         5               JAMES M. KILLION, having first been

         6      satisfactorily identified and duly sworn by the

         7      Notary Public, was examined and testified as

        10                        EXAMINATION

        11      BY MR. MCCARTHY:

        12           Q.  Would you please state your full name.

        13           A.  James Killion, K-i-l-l-i-o-n.

        14           Q.  Do you have a middle name?

        15           A.  M, Michael.

        16           Q.  Mr. Killion, I introduced myself

        17      to you a minute ago, but again, I'm Liam

        18      McCarthy.  I represent C.I.L. Inc., Jim

        19      Coskren --

        20           A.  Yeah.

        21           Q.  -- the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that's

        22      been brought against you.

        23               Have you ever had your deposition

        24      taken before?

         1           A.  I think so, quite a while ago, for a

         2      bad accident.

         3           Q.  More than five years ago?

         4           A.  Yeah.

         5           Q.  So you're -- just the one time?

         6           A.  I believe so.

         7           Q.  All right.  So you're a little bit

         8      familiar with this process?

         9           A.  A little bit.

        10           Q.  But let me go through the --

        11           A.  Okay.

        12           Q.  -- the procedure and the ground rules.

        13      The court reporter is here to make a record of

        14      everything that we're saying.

        15               MR. MCCARTHY:  I meant to --

        16      Ms. Lasna, the usual stipulations?

        17               MS. LASNA:  That's fine.

        18           Q.  The court reporter is here to write

        19      down everything we say, all my questions, all

        20      your answers.  She can only write down what one

        21      of us is saying at a time, so there's a few

        22      things that are important about that.  One is

        23      that every answer you give needs to be out

        24      loud.

         1           A.  Okay.

         2           Q.  If you nod your head, she can't take

         3      that down.

         4           A.  Got it.

         5           Q.  If you cover your mouth --

         6           A.  Yeah.

         7           Q.  -- she's not going to be able to hear

         8      you very well.

         9           A.  Okay.

        10           Q.  It's also important that you and I not

        11      speak at the same time.  In normal

        12      conversation, we'd cut each other off --

        13           A.  Right.

        14           Q.  -- and interrupt each other --

        15           A.  She can't get both of us at the same

        16      time.

        17           Q.  It would feel like it goes faster that

        18      way, but --

        19           A.  I get it.

        20           Q.  -- if you can let me finish my

        21      question, I will do my best to let you finish

        22      your answers.

        23               I'm here to find out what you know and

        24      what you remember.  I don't want you to guess

         2      remember the answer to a question, please tell

         3      me that.  It's possible that I will ask a

         4      question that doesn't make sense.  If you don't

         5      understand my question, let me know that, and I

         6      will rephrase it.

         7           A.  Liam, can I stop you for one second?

         8           Q.  Absolutely.

         9               THE WITNESS:  Do you know how to shut

        10      that off?  I think you hold this button here.

        11      I've never done it before.

        12               (Discussion off the record)

        13           Q.  And as I said before we started,

        14      Mr. Killion, if you need to take a break at any

        15      time, let me know that --

        16           A.  Yep.

        17           Q.  -- for whatever reason --

        18           A.  Okay.

        19           Q.  -- and I will accommodate you as soon

        20      as I can, which generally means as soon as you

        21      answer the question that's pending.

        22               What's your date of birth?

        23           A.  4/13/65.

         1           A.  Lowell, Massachusetts.

         2           Q.  Where do you currently live?

         3           A.  I'm at 9 Salem Street, Lawrence, Mass.

         4      01843.  I'm living with my girlfriend.

         5           Q.  How long have you lived there?

         6           A.  Well, we got the house three years

         7      ago.  I actually live on a boat, but I've been

         8      staying there.  It's because of my illness.

         9           Q.  When you say your "illness," what do

        10      you mean?

        11           A.  I had a tumor removed, and then

        12      recently, I had more surgery on the same deal.

        13           Q.  Are you currently on any medications?

        14           A.  Yes.

        15           Q.  Are you -- are any of those

        16      medications, do they affect your memory?

        17           A.  Yes.  Not my memory.  I'm on

        18      prednisone which gives me -- it has a

        19      concentration issue.

        20           Q.  It may affect your ability to

        21      concentrate, but it won't affect your memory;

        22      is that correct?

        23           A.  I'm not a doctor, but as far as I

        24      know.

         1           Q.  Okay.

         2           A.  What happens is I think of one thing,

         3      and then I'm shooting over to another thing,

         4      and I forget about what I was thinking over

         5      here.

         6           Q.  Well, I will do my best to keep you

         7      focused.

         8           A.  Okay.

         9           Q.  Are you taking any other medications

        10      that have any effect on your memory or your

        11      ability to --

        12           A.  Not to my knowledge.  I take 14 pills

        13      a day.

        14               MS. LASNA:  You're already starting to

        15      talk over him.  You want to make sure --

        16               THE WITNESS:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm

        17      sorry.

        18               MS. LASNA:  -- you wait for the

        19      question.

        20           Q.  Have you had any alcohol today?

        21           A.  No.

        22           Q.  Taken any illegal drugs today?

        12      it unless we have a job in that city or town.

        13      It's money.  So once we get a job, we go and

         1           A.  I can't answer you.  Mr. Coskren was

         2      involved at that point.  I talked to the

         3      workers on the site to get the repairs done.

         4           Q.  Yep.

         5           A.  Didn't go to no offices though, in

         8      have had a conversation -- well, let me ask a

         9      different question.

        10               On June 18, 2015, did you talk to

        11      anybody employed by the City of Lawrence?

        12           A.  15th or 18th?

        13           Q.  June 18, 2015, did you talk to anybody

        14      employed by the City of Lawrence?

        15           A.  I don't remember.

        16           Q.  Okay.

        17           A.  The incident happened on the 15th?

        18           Q.  Do you know when the incident

        19      happened?

        20           A.  I know exact -- not -- roughly.  I

        21      don't know if it was the 15th or the 18th, but

        22      you've said 15th three times, and then you just

        23      said the 18th, so I'm getting confused.

        24           Q.  I'm trying to say June 18, 2015?

         1           A.  Okay.  I still don't remember.

         2           Q.  I may have misspoken.

         3           A.  No, I got confused.  That's all.

         4           Q.  Let's do this an easier way.

         5           A.  Okay.

         6           Q.  You know Jim Coskren?

        12           Q.  How do you know him?

        13           A.  I worked with Danny which is his

        14      facilities manager.

        15           Q.  That's Dan Kadlic?

        16           A.  I believe so.

        17           Q.  How do you know Mr. Kadlic?

        18           A.  When I moved to town, we didn't have

        19      much work.  I put my feelers out.  Jim Coskren

        20      said, "I need some excavating done.  I'd like

        21      to introduce you to Dan."  I dealt with Dan

        22      ever since.

        23           Q.  And when was that that you moved to

        24      town?

         1           A.  Approximately four years ago.

         2           Q.  Sometime in 2015?

         3           A.  I think it might have been in there in

         4      '14, but I'm not sure.

         5           Q.  Who was it that introduced you to Jim

         6      Coskren?

         7           A.  My neighbor George.

         8           Q.  What's George's last name?

         9           A.  I don't really know.

        10           Q.  Does he work for C.I.L.?

        11           A.  He does.

        12           Q.  George -- when you were looking for

        13      work, George said you should talk to Jim

        14      Coskren at C.I.L.

        15           A.  I brought a machine home to my house

        16      to do work.  He seen the machine.  Come over

        17      and said, "Hey.  Do you do that for a living?"

        18               I said, "Yep."

        19               He said, "I want you to meet

        20      somebody."

        21               That's how I met him.

        22           Q.  So tell me about your first meeting

        23      with Jim Coskren?

        24           A.  Great guy.  Shook his hand.  Told me

         1      he had a problem.  Showed me the sinkholes in

         2      the yard, and said, "We got to figure out what

         3      this is."  I'd like to pay you to do so."

         4           Q.  The first time you met Jim Coskren,

         5      was that at 400 Canal Street in Lawrence?

         6           A.  I believe so.

         7           Q.  That's the C.I.L. building?

         8           A.  Yeah, I believe so.

         9           Q.  Right along the canal?

        10           A.  Yes.

        11           Q.  Can you describe the sinkholes that

        12      you saw when you went there with Mr. Coskren

        13      the first time?

        14           A.  About three-foot round.  Dropped a

        15      ten-foot fence post down one.  It went down

        16      about 40 feet.

        17           Q.  How many sinkholes were there?

        18           A.  Approximately five or six.

        19           Q.  Where were they located with respect

        20      to the building?

        21           A.  In front of the building.  Well, I

        22      don't know how we could call it the front of

        23      the building.  I'm going to say in front of the

        24      structure that come down.

         1           Q.  One side of the building faces the

         2      canal; correct?

         3           A.  Correct.

         4           Q.  If you're standing on the opposite

         5      side of the building so that you've got the

         6      building in front of you and then the canal --

         7      you with me so far?

         8           A.  No, I lost you.

         9           Q.  All right.  You know where the canal

        10      is?

        11           A.  Yes.

        12           Q.  You know where the building is?

        13           A.  Yes.

        14           Q.  Imagine that you're standing on the

        15      side of the building opposite the canal.  So

        16      it's --

        17           A.  Yeah.

        18           Q.  -- you, canal -- excuse me -- you,

        19      building, canal.

        20           A.  I'm on the right-of-way.

        21           Q.  Right.  The right-hand side is the end

        22      of the -- as you're standing from that vantage

        23      point, the right-hand side is the place where

        24      eventually part of the building --

         1           A.  Correct.

         2           Q.  -- was taken down; correct?

         3           A.  Correct.

         4           Q.  And so the sinkholes that you're

         5      describing were in that area?

         6           A.  They were all fenced off.

         7           Q.  Okay.

         8           A.  Construction fence was around them.

         9           Q.  And were they all in a paved area?

        10           A.  No.  The inner floor was pretty well

        11      messed up too.

        12           Q.  Inner floor of the?

        13           A.  Building.

        14           Q.  Building.

        15           A.  You couldn't really walk in there.

        16      The loading dock was a ramp that was also

        17      pretty bad.

        18           Q.  You could see that it was damaged by

        19      something?

        20           A.  It all collapsed.

        21           Q.  And then were there then three or four

        22      sinkholes in the parking lot?

        23           A.  There was a few in the parking lot.

        24      I'm going to say probably like three or four.

         1      And then, like I said, there was a few inside

         2      and on the loading dock.

         3           Q.  Okay.

         8           Q.  And what did he tell you he wanted

         9      done?

        10           A.  Well, they weren't sure what was going

        11      on, so I had to do a little research.  So I

        12      went to Enel, the power company, asked them if

        13      there was tunnels there.  They furnished us a

        14      little plan that showed the tunnels.

        15           Q.  What did you do then?

        16           A.  I went to the building department.

        17           Q.  What did you do at the building

        18      department?

        19           A.  I found out that they didn't use the

        20      tunnels anymore, and due to that fact, the wood

        21      don't stay wet anymore; it was drying out and

        22      rotting.  And their suspicious -- suspicion was

        23      that it was rotting out, and that's what the

        24      collapse was from.

         1           Q.  Did you do any other research other

         2      than talking to Enel and the building

         3      department?

         4           A.  We did as much research as we could

         5      get.  Nobody knows much about that system.

         6           Q.  Who else did you talk to other than

         7      the building department and power company?

         8           A.  I went through all the departments.

         9      Every department in that building was hand

        10      walked with the building inspector.  Then I

        11      went to the water department; got a site

        12      meeting.  And then I got a site meeting with

        13      the sewer department.  And I met them all

        14      on-site.  I also met with the gas company

        15      on-site.

        16           Q.  This is all before you'd agreed to do

        17      any work?

        18           A.  Correct.

        19           Q.  What was the purpose of doing all this

        20      research?

        21           A.  So I know what I was getting involved

        22      in.  Dotting my i's.

        23           Q.  Was that so that you could figure

        24      out what to do and how to do it and also how

         3           Q.  What did you learn from your on-site

         4      meeting with the water department?

         5           A.  Man named George Daley pulled up.

         6      Told me that he don't believe that there was

         7      any water mains in the area.  Just dig as --

         8      easy and go forward.  You should be fine.

         9           Q.  Did you have any other conversations

        10      with him?

        11           A.  Not to my knowledge.

        12           Q.  Did he have any plans with him?

        13           A.  None.  There was no plans.  He was --

        16           A.  He couldn't find any plans on it.

        17           Q.  When you spoke to Mr. Daley, did you

        18      smell any alcohol on his breath?

        19           A.  No.

        20           Q.  Did you observe him to be, in your

        21      opinion, under the influence of alcohol in any

        23           A.  No.

         1           A.  He told me he was going to his camp

         2      for the weekend.  He was having a few beers.

         3      There'd be no sense in calling him.

         4           Q.  He told you that he was doing that

         5      after he left you?

         6           A.  Correct.

         7           Q.  What did you learn from your on-site

         8      meeting with the sewer department?

         9           A.  There was no sewer in the area.

        10           Q.  Do you remember who you spoke to?

        12           Q.  Do you know his last name?

        14           Q.  Did the sewer department have any

        15      plans?

        16           A.  Don't remember.

        17           Q.  What did you learn from your on-site

        19           A.  There wasn't an on-site meeting with

        20      the building department.

        21           Q.  Okay.  What did you learn from

        22      speaking to the building department other

        23      than that the tunnels were unused, the

        24      wood wasn't wet anymore, and they suspected

         1      that the wood was rotting?

         2           A.  Yeah, they brought me to -- one

         3      building inspector brought me to every

         4      department and asked if there was anything in

         5      there, if there was anything that I needed to

         6      know, and if they were okay with me taking the

         7      tunnels out.  We got a verbal agreement from

         8      every department.

         9           Q.  When you say "taking the tunnels out,"

        10      what do you mean?

        11           A.  Removing them, filling it back in, and

        12      compacting it.

        13           Q.  So removing the wood, filling it in --

        14           A.  At the time, we didn't know what they

        15      were.

        16           Q.  Right.

        17           A.  We were anticipating they were wood

        18      like the other ones.  These ones were wood and

        19      granite.

        20           Q.  Your on-site meeting with the gas

        21      company, what did you learn?

        22           A.  We located the gas main on the

        23      building and marked it all out.  Come to

        24      conclusion it was nowhere near us.

         5           A.  We had a painted line we were working

         7           Q.  That meeting with the gas company,

         8      that's a meeting held under the Dig Safe rules?

         9           A.  Correct.  We had them back out -- we

        10      had them back out twice, I believe.  Just

        11      double-checking and dotting our i's.

        12           Q.  At what point did you agree to do some

        13      work for Mr. Killion?  You're Mr. Killion.

        14               At what point did you agree to do some

        16               There's too many Jims.

        20      homework?

        21           A.  Several weeks.

        22           Q.  Did the homework consist of talking to

         5           Q.  The on-site meetings came later?

         6           A.  They were within a day or two.

         7           Q.  Okay.  But when you're referring to

         8      the homework as being you finished your

         9      homework, then you agreed to do the work?

        10           A.  Well, there's a lot of other homework

        11      other than utilities.

        12           Q.  All right.  What's the other homework?

        13           A.  Does the canal go up and down

        14      the level of water?  Are we going to get

        15      halfway through and flood it?  Is there a DEP

        16      issue?

        17               I have a list I go by.  I don't have

        18      the list with me.

        19           Q.  Is that a list you created?

         6           Q.  So generally speaking, what's on that

         7      checklist?  I know you're not going to remember

         8      everything that's on the checklist, but tell me

         9      what's there.

        10           A.  Where's the local bus stop?  What time

        11      do the buses come?  What's my work hours?  Is

        12      the area secured, or does it need to be

        13      secured?  Do I need a police detail or I don't

        14      need a police detail?  Do I need a fire detail

        15      or I don't need a fire detail?

        16               Where the water main enters and comes

        17      out the building.  Where the sewer enters/comes

        18      out the building.  Where the gas comes in and

        19      out of the building.  If there's underground

        20      electric, where it comes in and out of the

        21      building.

        22               Is the building foundation concrete,

        23      block, or granite?  Is the brick that's on the

        24      building on a shelf, or is it not supported?

         1      What type of windows do we got?  Can they

         2      withstand a machine rattling the building?  Is

         4      parts or acids in the building that can -- a

         6               Do we have any antennas in the area?

         8      any wires for the stop signs or street lights?

         9      Is there any old steam pipes from the early

        10      1900s that have been abandoned?  Steam pipes

        11      look very much like water pipes.

         4      them my Dig Safe number, 34121.  They ask me

         5      city/town/state.  They ask me where I'm

         6      digging; whereabouts on the property I'm

         7      digging; what I'm doing; if I want to put any

         8      alternate phone numbers, faxes, or e-mails.

         9      Then they give me a start date time.

        10           Q.  They tell you when you can start?

        11           A.  Correct.

        12           Q.  Okay.

        13           A.  Then they gave me a confirmation

        14      number.

        15           Q.  At the time that you called Dig Safe,

        16      are you required to have already marked the

        17      work area?

        18           A.  Correct.

        19           Q.  What color do you mark the work area

        20      with?

        21           A.  White paint.  They're allowing pink in

        22      some situations now.

        23           Q.  Why is that?

        24           A.  I went to a little seminar on the

         1      phone with Dig Safe.  I don't know why.  I was

         2      a little taken back by it.

         3           Q.  In 2015 you used white paint?

         4           A.  Correct.

         5           Q.  So before you called Dig Safe with

         6      respect to the 2015 Coskren you had premarked?

         7           A.  Yeah.  There was several contractors

         8      that had premarked it.

         9           Q.  Who were the other contractors?

        10           A.  I -- I believe Pinnacle Construction

        11      was one.  I don't know the others.

        12           Q.  Do you know whether any of them had

        13      actually done any excavating?

        14           A.  I can't answer you.

        15           Q.  Okay.  Because you don't know?

        16           A.  I don't know.

        17           Q.  But did you make your own marks as to

        18      where you intended to dig?

        19           A.  I did.  They were right where the old

        20      marks with.

        21           Q.  The same work area?

        22           A.  Yeah.

        23           Q.  And when you called Dig Safe and go

        24      through what you've just told me, then what

         1      happens next in the Dig Safe process?

         2           A.  I get an e-mail telling me that I can

         3      go forward.

         4           Q.  And so in the meantime, what has

         5      happened at your work site?

         6           A.  Nothing.

         7           Q.  Nothing done by you?

         8           A.  Yeah, nothing done my me.  I don't

         9      know anything different.

        10           Q.  But after you called the 888 number --

        11           A.  It takes 72 hours.  I'm dead in the

        12      water until 72 hours are up.  On my Dig Safe, I

        13      don't know if it's everybody's, I ask for

        14      e-mail confirmation.

        15           Q.  In that 72 hours, whoever you talked

        16      to at the Dig Safe 888 number contacts

        17      utilities, and utilities come out and mark?

        18           A.  They tell you a list of who they're

        19      calling.

        20           Q.  Yep.  So in this circumstance, the

        21      Coskren project in 2015, who did they tell you

        22      they were going to call?

        23           A.  Every department, other than the

        24      building department.  But I think they did

         1      contact the building department too.

         2           Q.  Okay.  So who is it other than

         3      everybody?  Who is "everybody"?

         4           A.  I don't know all the fiberoptic

         5      companies that they have there, so I can't

         6      really honest -- answer you honestly, but your

         7      basic departments, they notify.

         8           Q.  That would be?

         9           A.  Gas, sewer, water, electric, building

        10      depart- -- I don't know if the building

        11      department or engineering department.  I can't

        12      answer you.

        13           Q.  Other than marking the work area and

        14      calling Dig Safe -- the Dig Safe number, do you

        15      have any other responsibilities before you

        16      start digging?

        17           A.  We took responsibilities.  We camera'd

        18      all the holes.  We camera'd the tunnels.  We

        19      took a look at the posts.

        20           Q.  Is that something -- when you say

        21      "camera'd," is that something you do yourself

        22      with your own equipment --

        23           A.  Correct.

        24           Q.  -- or is that --

         1           A.  I have a high-tech -- a real high-tech

         2      camera.  We put it in all the holes.  We looked

         3      at them.  I put it in the canal.  We knocked a

         4      brick out of the canal where the mouth was that

         5      they bricked up.  We put it in there.  We

         6      thoroughly camera'd the place.

         7               And what we're basically checking for

         8      is human life.

         9           Q.  What do you mean by that?

        10           A.  A lot of street bums and stuff living

        11      in them canals.

        12           Q.  You don't want to dig somebody up

        13      who's sleeping in a hole?

        14           A.  I've done it.  I backed into a job one

        15      day.  Got out.  I was walking back, and a

        16      manhole popped up, and it was a homeless guy

        17      living in a manhole 20 feet behind my truck.  I

        18      don't take no chances.  Newbury Street, Boston.

        19           Q.  In the -- in the 2015 Coskren project,

        20      you got an e-mail confirmation saying that you

        21      could go ahead with your work?

        22           A.  Don't quote me on that, please.  I'm

        23      not sure.

        24           Q.  Okay.  Generally speaking, you give

         1      them an e-mail and ask for that?

         2           A.  I ask them for an e-mail.  And what

         3      the e-mail will -- no gas, no electric, so on.

         4      I'm 99.9 percent sure I have that e-mail, but I

         5      don't know if I could get it to you.

         6           Q.  What do you mean by that?  Not sure

         7      you can find it?

         8           A.  You asked me earlier if I had the page

         9      with my checklist.  I lost my house September

        10      15.  I lost all my contents in the Columbia gas

        11      explosion --

        12           Q.  Ah.

        13           A.  -- where I reside with Michelle.  I

        14      can't find anything.

        15           Q.  Did you have a fire at the house?

        16           A.  It wasn't a fire.  It was water damage

        17      on top of freezing zero-degree days wiped it

        18      out.

        19           Q.  Okay.  When you got to the site, when

        20      it was time to start doing your work, were

        21      there any markings on the ground within your

        22      work area?

        23           A.  There was.  I had pictures.  I can't

        24      locate them, again.

         1           Q.  What markings were on the --

         8      realize I did it.

         9           Q.  It's all right.

        10               What were the markings that were on

        11      the ground inside the work area?

        12           A.  It would basically be any utility that

        13      was there would be painted.  Water would be

        14      blue.  Sewer would be green.  Electric would be

        15      red.  You'd have a little orange for cable TV

        16      in there.  There's a few others.  Basically,

        17      there would be lines or flags.  In hot top,

        18      they would paint it because the flags wouldn't

        19      go in the ground.

        20               There was nothing other than my Dig

        21      Safe markings, and I believe there was a red

        22      mark that said "no electric."  I would have to

        23      Google Earth it to see it.

        24           Q.  You've looked at Google Earth, and

         1      there's an image of it with your --

         2           A.  I don't know that, no.  That's just

         3      how I operate.  When I do things, I Google

         4      Earth them also.  And it will -- Google Earth

         5      will show the Tennessee gas line in the area,

         6      the main feed that comes from California, and I

         7      can locate it that way, and then I call them.

         8           Q.  That's the four-foot round line --

         9           A.  Yeah.

        10           Q.  -- the big one?

        11           A.  That's the one you're never going to

        12      hit.

        13           Q.  Right.  In this instance though, when

        14      you went back to start work, other than there

        15      being, you think, one red mark that said "no

        16      electric," there were no markings inside your

        17      work area?

        18           A.  I'm not sure.  It's been too long.  I

        19      don't remember.

        21      other?

         8      departments?

         9           A.  Dig Safe ain't always right.  Like I

        10      told you, I don't take chances.

        14           A.  Yeah, we don't have problems,

        15      generally.  We're pretty smooth operating.  I

        16      haven't had any problems.

        18               THE WITNESS:  I was just wondering if

         8      inside the work area?

        10      have had pictures and stuff.  I just lost them,

        11      like I said.

        12           Q.  When you actually started excavating,

        13      do you know what day it was?

        14           A.  I don't.

        19      the incident occurring?

        20           A.  Approximately three weeks, I believe.

        21           Q.  Three weeks actually digging in the

        22      parking lot?

        23           A.  Yeah.  And we were -- that was the

        24      last day -- the last hour that that got hit.

         1           Q.  You were practically complete at that

         2      point?

         3           A.  Yes.

         4           Q.  What -- what had you learned in those

         5      three weeks?

         6           A.  I didn't have to learn much.  I knew

         7      what I was getting into.

         8           Q.  Okay.

         9           A.  I did my homework.

        10           Q.  And the -- you didn't have a written

        11      contract with Mr. Coskren to do this work?

        12           A.  No.

        13           Q.  And so what -- what was it that he

        14      hired you to do?

        15           A.  At first it was an exploratory to find

        16      the tunnels and find out what we were up

        17      against, and then it was to go forward and

        18      remove them.

        19           Q.  So at the point that the incident

        20      happened, you had located the tunnels and

        21      determined what you were up against; correct?

        22           A.  Yes.

        23           Q.  And you had almost completed removing

        24      them?

         1           A.  Yes.  Removing that section of them.

         2      There's still more in the ground there.

         3           Q.  Where are there more that are in the

         4      ground?

         5           A.  On the left side of that water main.

         6           Q.  Meaning further away from the

         7      building?

         8           A.  They go across the street into the

         9      parking lot, and I don't know where they go

        10      from there.  There's another -- we pulled about

        11      110 feet, and they kept going, but we weren't

        12      willing to go any further.

        13           Q.  But, again, that was all -- the stuff

        14      you weren't willing to do was moving further

        15      away from the building?

        16           A.  Correct.

        17           Q.  Did you remove or fill in any of the

        18      tunnels under the loading dock?

        19           A.  Yep.

        20           Q.  How about under the building?

        21           A.  Right to the edge of the building.

        22           Q.  Do you know whether there were more

        23      tunnels under the building?

        24           A.  Can't answer you.

         1           Q.  Because you didn't dig under there?

         2           A.  Nope.

         3           Q.  I didn't ask that question very well.

         4               It's correct that you did not dig

         5      under the building?

         6           A.  Correct.

         7           Q.  Okay.  When you were doing this

         8      approximately three weeks of work, how many

         9      machines did you have working there?

        10           A.  One, maybe two.

        11           Q.  What machines?

        12           A.  An excavator, a Bobcat, if there was a

        13      Bobcat there.

        14           Q.  You're not sure whether there was or

        15      not?

        16           A.  No.

        17           Q.  Bobcat was solely to --

        18           A.  Move stuff around.

        19           Q.  Yep.  Who operated the excavator?

        20           A.  I did.

        21           Q.  Did anyone other than you operate the

        22      excavator at any point?

        23           A.  Yes.

        24           Q.  Who else operated the excavator?

         1           A.  My partner at the time.  It wasn't

         2      really a partner.  We did a lot of work

         3      together.

         4           Q.  Who was that?

         5           A.  Mike Case.  We call him "Juice."

         6           Q.  At some point did you have a company

         7      called Case Killion LLC?

         8           A.  No.  Nothing in writing.  Nothing

         9      registered.

        10           Q.  Was it a New Hampshire corporation

        11      called Case Killion, LLC?

        12           A.  If we did, it was just hearsay talk.

        13           Q.  At the time that the incident

        14      occurred, who was operating the excavator?

        15           A.  I want to clarify this question for

        16      you a little bit.

        17           Q.  Sure.

        18           A.  We didn't hit a pipe.  We hit a valve.

        19           Q.  Okay.

        20           A.  That valve comes 12 inches to the

        21      surface.  It's supposed to come directly to the

        22      surface so that they can put a wrench on it.

        23      It was paved over.  I caught the top of the

        24      valve 12 inches down from the hot top at the

         1      end of the day.

         2           Q.  You were operating the excavator?

         3           A.  Correct.  There was a cog about two

         4      and a half/three feet round.  It was from the

         5      1800s.  We actually got off the machine and

         6      admired it.  What we didn't know was that the

         7      City had paved over the valve -- or whoever

         8      paved that parking lot prior to me being

         9      there paved over the valve so it couldn't be

        10      seen.  So when I hit that, what I did was ten

        11      feet in the ground is broke the pipe.  The

        12      water didn't come blowing out for several hours

        13      later.

        14               To answer your question, I was in

        15      Tewksbury when I got the phone call from Dan,

        16      the facilities manager, there was water blowing

        17      out of the ground.

        18           Q.  Was there anyone else working with you

        19      at the time that you hit the valve?

        20           A.  Not with me.  My partner at the time

        21      might have had somebody with him.  I don't

        22      know.

        23           Q.  Where was he at the time?

        24           A.  I can't answer you.

         1           Q.  Was it at 400 Canal Street?

         2           A.  An hour prior to the call from Dan,

         3      they were there.  I don't know where they were

         4      when the -- I never seen him again on that site

         5      after that phone call from Dan.  I didn't see

         6      that -- Mike Case at all.

         7           Q.  Let's work backward.  You got a call

         8      from Dan Kadlic?

         9           A.  Yeah.

        10           Q.  What time did you get that call?

        11           A.  I don't recall.  I know I was done

        12      there for the day and left.

        13           Q.  He called you on your cell phone?

        14           A.  I believe so.

        15           Q.  From his cell phone?

        16           A.  I believe so.

        17           Q.  Had you gone directly from 400 Canal

        18      Street to Tewksbury?

        19           A.  I don't recall.

        20           Q.  Where were you in Tewksbury when Dan

        21      called you?

        22           A.  I don't recall.

        23           Q.  Were you driving?

        24           A.  I think so.

         1           Q.  What did Dan say to you when he

         2      called?

         3           A.  He said, "We have a problem.  We have

         4      water coming out of the ground."

         5           Q.  What did you do?

         6           A.  I reported right to there.  By that

         7      time, I was getting phone calls from the fire

         8      department and everybody.

         9           Q.  Who called you other than Dan Kadlic

        10      and the fire department?

        11           A.  I don't remember.

        12           Q.  How long did it take you to get from

        13      Tewksbury back to 400 Canal Street?

        14           A.  Less than an hour.

        15           Q.  When you got there, what did you

        16      observe?

        17           A.  That we had a serious water problem.

        18           Q.  What did you physically see that made

        19      you conclude there was a serious water problem?

        20           A.  Water coming out of the ground.  Water

        21      going across the site into the canal.

        22           Q.  Did it look like a geyser?

        23           A.  Like a river.

         1           A.  It was a little bit.  Nothing like

         2      you -- nothing like on TV.  Just bubbling out

         3      of the ground at a great rate.

         4           Q.  When you arrived, who was there?

         5           A.  Fire department, building department,

         6      water department, and several other

         7      departments.

         8           Q.  Was Dan Kadlic there?

         9           A.  I don't remember.

        12           Q.  Did you speak to Jim Coskren?

        13           A.  Yes.

        14           Q.  What did you say to him?

        15           A.  Me and him had a little bit of a

        16      meeting and discussed on how it should be

        17      handled.  Then me and Jim went to the fire

        18      department, water department, and everything

        19      on-site.  We did a little runaround to find out

        20      what we were up against and how they wanted it

        21      handled.

        22               I suggested we cut the valve out and

        23      do away with it.  It was unable to be used

        24      anyways from being hit and the fact that it was

         1      probably never used in the last 100 years.  At

         2      that point, we got permission to cut it out.

         3      Jim bought the stock.  We had it delivered.

         4               And then the fire department said,

         5      "You're not fixing that water main until that

         6      building comes down."

         7               We said we don't want to take the

         8      building down at that present time.  They made

         9      us.  They told us it had to come down.

        10               Jim called Daigle Construction.

        11      Daigle showed up and agreed with the fire

        12      department on us that it had to come down.

        13      That was the end of it.

        14           Q.  Was it an engineer from Daigle?

        15           A.  Yeah.

        16           Q.  Did you talk to him?

        17           A.  Jim did.

        18           Q.  You didn't talk to him?

        19           A.  I -- I might have been in the --

         1      hitting this valve?

         2           A.  No.  There was all kinds of stuff in

         3      the ground.  There were like little trinkets

         4      and stuff, bottles.  So when we hit that cog,

         5      we didn't know we hit a valve.  We figured it

         6      was an old cog from the mill or something.  It

         7      wasn't alarming.

         9      and admired it, you said?

        10           A.  Yeah.

        11           Q.  Did you take any pictures of it?

        12           A.  I don't remember.

        13           Q.  When you say, "We admired it," are you

        14      taking about you and Mike Case?

        15           A.  Correct.

        16           Q.  Anybody else?

        17           A.  Not to my knowledge.  Maybe -- I don't

        18      know.  There was people all around all the

        19      time.

        20           Q.  Not people working for you?

        21           A.  No.

        22           Q.  When you --

        23           A.  Curiosity people.  People that show up

        24      just to say, "Wow.  What's going on?"

         1           Q.  Big machines are fun to watch?

         2           A.  Inside the vents.

         3           Q.  Why did you get down off the machine

         4      and look at this cog?

         5           A.  It was just old.  That's all.  So what

         6      was it, at first.  Then we realized it was just

         7      a piece of metal hanging in the ground.  It

         8      wasn't visible from the ground.  It was

         9      covered.  It was paved over.

        10           Q.  Did you -- during the three weeks that

        11      you worked there, did you hit anything else or

        12      scoop up anything else that caused you to get

        13      down off the machine and admire it?

        14           A.  Bottles.  I like to collect them.

        15           Q.  Old bottles?

        16           A.  Yeah.  Stuff like that, sure.  I got a

        17      metal detector in the machine.  I'll go and

        18      check stuff.

        19           Q.  Why do you have a metal detector in

        20      the machine?

        21           A.  Just find gold bars some day, maybe.

        22           Q.  Found a gold bar yet?

        23           A.  Nope.

        24           Q.  When you observed the valve, or the

         1      cog, as you've called it, you're talking --

         2      when you say "cog," you're talking about the

         3      handle, basically.

         4           A.  No.  It's a gear-reducted valve.  The

         5      valve is enormous.  Six and a half feet high,

         6      maybe.  Probably weighs somewhere about 1,800

         7      pounds.  And it's gear-reducted.  Because it's

         8      so hard to turn, you have a big gear to a

         9      little gear to a smaller gear.  The gear at the

        10      surface was probably about three feet round,

        11      two and a half feet round.  Which I don't even

        12      believe is correct.

        13           Q.  So it was a two-and-a-half or

        14      three-foot valve?

        15           A.  I think so.

        16           Q.  Two-and-a-half or three-foot gear?

        17           A.  Yeah.

        18           Q.  So when you say "gear," you're talking

        19      about teeth around the outside?

        20           A.  Yeah.

        21           Q.  What did you do with it after you dug

        22      it up?

        23           A.  Just left it there.  We didn't think

        24      any more of it.

         1           Q.  Put it in a pile with whatever else

         2      you were digging up?

         3           A.  Never touched it.  Just left it right

         4      there.

         5           Q.  When you say you left it right there,

         6      had you scooped it up with the excavator and

         7      dumped it?

         8           A.  Nope.

         9           Q.  You looked at it in the bucket?

        10           A.  When I removed the hot top in that

        11      excavation area, just bumped it.  It was about

        12      a foot down.  Got out.  We looked at it.  I

        13      can't even recall if it was still -- it wasn't

        14      even connected to anything, I don't think.  I

        15      don't remember really too much about it.  It

        16      wasn't concerning.

        17           Q.  So after you removed that layer of hot

        18      top, bumped this cog or gear --

        19           A.  Yep.

        20           Q.  -- what did you do next?  Well, then

        21      you looked at it.  Then what did you do?

        22           A.  Proceeded on with my day.

        23           Q.  Removing more hot top?

        24           A.  I don't remember, to be honest with

         1      you.  Whatever was necessary to keep going.

         2           Q.  You didn't dig down any further in

         3      the --

         4           A.  No.

         5           Q.  -- area of that gear; correct?

         6           A.  No.  Wasn't even near it.

         7           Q.  Did you move away from it?

         8           A.  We didn't have -- that was the last

         9      minute of the day.  We were done.  There was no

        10      more work to be done at Coskren's until Jimmy

        11      okayed anything else he wanted done.  We were

        12      in the eleventh hour.

        13           Q.  So after you took off that layer of

        14      hot top and observed the --

        15           A.  I had a limit of -- that Jimmy

        16      marked out that I had to go to with paint,

        17      or there was paint there, but we were inside

        18      the fenced area.  He said, I would like you

        19      to go to here with removing the tunnels.

        20      That's where we were.  We were in the last bit

        21      of it when we hit that.  We were leaving after

        22      that day unless Mr. Coskren okayed any more

        23      work.

         1      that literally the last scoop that you did on

         2      the job?

         3           A.  I don't remember that.  I can't answer

         4      that.  I mean, I don't know if there was

         5      cleanup after.  It's just been too long.

         6           Q.  Well, not cleanup, but I'm talking

         7      about did you remove any more hot top or earth

         8      after that?

         9           A.  I can't answer you.  Honestly, I don't

        10      remember.

        11           Q.  You don't know what you did after you

        12      observed -- admired the gear --

        13           A.  I left.  I went to Tewksbury.

        14           Q.  All right.  And you didn't discuss

        15      that gear with anybody other than Mike Case?

        16           A.  Nope.

        17           Q.  Because you didn't think it was

        18      important?

        19           A.  No.  It was nothing that we were

        20      around -- quite honestly, it was nothing I'd

        21      ever seen before.

        22           Q.  Then how do you know what it was?

        23           A.  I didn't until I got the call.

         1      after you got the call --

         2           A.  Yeah.

         5           A.  He knew.

         6           Q.  -- water pipe?

         7           A.  He knew.

         8           Q.  Did you say it to him, though?

         9           A.  Probably.

        10           Q.  Did you tell him it was your fault?

        11           A.  I hit the pipe.

        12           Q.  Did you tell him it was your fault?

        13               MS. LASNA:  Objection.

        14           A.  I don't know what that means.

        15           Q.  You can still answer the question.

        16           A.  Yeah.  "Sorry, Jim.  I hit the pipe, I

        17      guess.  Let's rectify the problem."  That was

        18      it.

        19           Q.  What needed to be done to rectify the

        20      problem?

        21           A.  They had to cut the valve out, like I

        22      said before, and replace the pipe.

        23           Q.  How big was the pipe -- the section of

         1           A.  16 feet.

         2           Q.  16 feet long?

         3           A.  Yeah.  20 inches round, I think.  I

         4      don't quite remember if it was 20 or 24.

         5           Q.  And somebody had to bring that pipe

         6      from Reading or someplace?

         7           A.  Yeah.  Jimmy called in and bought a

         8      new piece of pipe.  But then I think I called

         9      in a few favors, and someone delivered a piece

        10      of pipe.  I think some stuff went back.  I just

        11      don't remember.

        12           Q.  Who actually replaced the pipe?

        13           A.  I called some of my father's old

        14      retired workers and brought them in and

        15      replaced the pipe as a favor.

        16           Q.  Before you could replace the pipe, you

        17      had to take down --

        18           A.  We weren't going in the hole until the

        19      building and was down, and they wanted a police

        20      and fire detail until the building was down.

        21           Q.  That was the fire department that

        22      ordered that or the building department?

        23           A.  Fire department.

         1      down that needed to be taken down?

         2           A.  My machines did.

         3           Q.  Who did it though?

         4           A.  I hired -- a friend of mine owns a big

         5      demo company.  I asked to borrow one of his

         6      workers that was trained in taking buildings

         7      down.  He's actually got quite a record.  He

         8      took down Foxboro Stadium, the Boston Gardens.

         9      I asked to borrow him for the day, and they

        10      sent him over.

        11           Q.  A guy with a white ponytail?

         1           A.  18th.

         2           Q.  When you are excavating like you were

         3      excavating at 400 Canal Street in June of

         4      2015 and, I guess, in May of 2015, do you have

         5      to have a spotter in addition to the guy in the

         6      cab?

         7           A.  Not by law.

         8           Q.  By good practice, do you have to?

         9           A.  Sometimes a spotter can get in trouble

        10      too.  When we're digging in something like

        11      that, it's not too smart to have a spotter.

        12      God forbid you move a timber, and the ground

        13      ten feet over, a hole opens up, a spotter would

        14      be at the bottom of the hole.  It wouldn't be

        15      good -- too good a clear practice to do that.

        16      I wouldn't want anybody near that bucket while

        17      we were doing that.

        18           Q.  Because you didn't know what was under

        19      the ground?

        20           A.  Well, we knew what was in the ground.

        21      We knew we were digging for tunnels.  It's

         4           Q.  You know the Relief's In in Lawrence?

         5           A.  Yeah.

         6           Q.  Have you done any work there?

         7           A.  I park my equipment there.

         8           Q.  Have you ever done any digging there?

         9           A.  Yeah.

        10           Q.  In the last couple of years?

        11           A.  Yeah.

        12           Q.  You know the area between the building

        13      and the picnic area?

        14           A.  Yeah.

        15           Q.  Did some digging there?

        16           A.  Yeah.

        17           Q.  What were you doing?

        18           A.  We installed cable line for TV.  I

        19      don't know what else.

        20           Q.  What kind equipment did you use on

        21      that job?

        22           A.  An excavator and a Bobcat.

        23           Q.  Did you have a spotter on that job?

        24           A.  I don't remember.  We weren't actually

         1      doing the job.  We were working for the fire

         2      department.  They handled everything.  I don't

         3      really know much about that.

         4           Q.  What do you mean you were working --

         5           A.  I just rented them the equipment and

         6      the operator.  They told us what to do.

         7           Q.  When you guys are there working, do

         8      they have shirts on that say "Killion" on them?

         9           A.  No.  My guys weren't working there.  I

        10      was there.  They hired a company out of Reading

        11      to work there.  We were just renting equipment.

        12      That's it.

        13           Q.  Did you do any digging there?

        14           A.  I probably did.  I know that one of

        15      the firemen did some digging on my machine

        16      there.  I give all the firemen my shirts over

        17      there.  I periodically go in there for a beer.

        18      We didn't charge them for the job.  It was

        19      volunteer.  I can't remember if it was a

        20      Saturday or not.  But we help out because we

        21      park there.

        22           Q.  You regularly park your equipment

        23      there?

        24           A.  Yeah.

         1           Q.  You didn't have two pieces of digging

         2      equipment over there, did you, working at the

         3      same time?

         4           A.  We parked there.  There could have

         5      been ten of them there.  I don't remember.

         6           Q.  Working on that job?

         7           A.  I don't remember.  I'd be lying if I

         8      said.

         9           Q.  All right.  The checklist that you

        10      have for all your jobs --

        11           A.  Yep.

        12           Q.  -- you followed every step on that

        13      checklist?

        14           A.  Yep.  And then some.

        15           Q.  Okay.  What's the "then some"?  What

        16      did you do beyond --

        17           A.  Walked in the building with Dan

        18      Kadlic; checked out the whole inside of the

        19      building; where the utilities went in and out;

        20      picked his brain because he's very familiar

        21      with the building.  He runs it.  Not much more

        22      I could have done.

        23           Q.  Anything other than the checklist and

        24      walking the building with Dan?

         1           A.  Everything I've told you plus that.

         2           Q.  When you met at the property with the

         3      water department, Mr. Daley --

         4           A.  Yeah.

         5           Q.  -- when was that?

         6           A.  Within the two weeks that I was doing

         7      my checklist and talking to the building

         8      department and everything.

         9           Q.  Before you stuck a shovel in the

        10      ground, so to speak?

        11           A.  Oh, yeah.  We don't touch ground until

        12      everything's answered.

        13           Q.  What was the purpose of that

        14      particular meeting?

        15           A.  I'm doing my homework, making sure

        16      that there's no mistakes.

        17           Q.  Mr. Daley told you that they didn't

        18      have any plans for that area?

        19           A.  Correct.

        20           Q.  And did he tell you that your guess

        21      was as good as his about where stuff was

        22      underground?

        23           A.  He didn't know anything about

        24      that area.  He didn't believe there was

         1      anything in that area.

         2               Unfortunately, I said, "Is there

         3      anything else we can do?"

         4               He said, "I'm going away.  Going to

         5      have a few beers.  I've been working my ass

         6      off.  I'm leaving, and don't even call me."

         7               That was the all the conversation we

         8      had.

         9           Q.  He told you there was nothing else

        10      that could be done?

        11           A.  For him.

        12           Q.  Did he tell you to be careful where

        13      you dug because he didn't know where --

        14           A.  I think he --

        15           Q.  -- stuff was?

        16           A.  -- said, "Just go easy.  That's all we

        17      can do."

        18           Q.  Are you aware that there's a fire

        19      hydrant --

        20           A.  Yep.

        21           Q.  -- next to the parking lot --

         1           Q.  Do you know where the lines --

         2           A.  Line comes out eight feet, hooks to a

         3      six-inch main that runs down the street.

         4      Domestic water.  And sprinkler goes into

         5      Jimmy's building.  There's three or four of

         6      them on the left side of the building heading

         7      down -- I don't know if it's north.  I think

         8      it's either north or west, there's two or three

         9      more hydrants.  And the water main's over, like

        10      I said, on the opposite side of the building

        11      going out.  And Jimmy had a leak there, so they

        12      encased it in concrete.  And it's very well

        13      visible.  That's where Dan Kadlic had took me

        14      and showed me.

        15           Q.  Those lines were outside of your work

        16      area?

        17           A.  Correct.

        18           Q.  Okay.  Were there any markings of any

        19      water service lines in the work area?

        20           A.  Like I said, I just don't remember

        21      what was there.  It's been too long.  If there

        22      was markings for water, we wouldn't be heading

        23      there.

        24           Q.  Did the -- Mr. Daley or anyone else

         1      from the water department tell you that they

         2      couldn't mark anything in the work area because

         3      they couldn't locate any plans?

         4           A.  Not -- the only one I talked in that

         5      work area about the water was George Daley.  If

         6      anybody was there, it was well after that pipe

         7      was hit.

         8               There's a foreman that showed up

         9      before I met Mr. Daley, told me -- he might

        10      have told me that, but that's when we set up

        11      the meeting with Mr. Daley because he had been

        12      around for the longest, and he was the head of

        13      the department.  Because I didn't want to talk

        14      to no workers.  But prior to meeting Mr. Daley,

        15      I did meet a foreman there or somebody that

        16      couldn't say anything.  And I told him, "Look

        17      it.  I just want your boss.  I don't want no

        18      mistakes."  That's when I got George Daley.

        19           Q.  The foreman didn't know anything about

        20      where anything was?

        21           A.  Yeah, he didn't have much to say.

        22           Q.  And so had a meeting after that?

        23           A.  With George Daley on-site.

        24           Q.  Are you familiar with a red hat?

         1           A.  No.

         2           Q.  Are you familiar with any way to look

         3      for buried lines other than Dig Safe markings?

         4           A.  Yeah.  I have all the equipment to

         5      check it.

         6           Q.  What equipment is that?

         7           A.  I have the metal detectors for water.

         8      I have sonar on cameras that repeats to the top

         9      so I can locate things.  That same sonar, the

        10      part that locates on the top, finds all

        11      electrical and cable and fiber -- I don't know

        12      if it finds fiberoptic, but it will find the

        13      electric and the cable.  We scanned that whole

        14      place, everything on that place with it.  It's

        15      called an electric eel.

        16           Q.  You scanned it with the electric eel?

        17           A.  Correct.  The electric eel part was

        18      the camera.  On the head of the camera is

        19      sonar.  If you're down 20 feet in the ground in

        20      a pipe, the sonar will release to the surface.

        21      We have one that you set on.  You know, for

        22      metal, we set on a certain number.  For

        23      electric, we set on a certain number.  And we

        24      scan the whole place.  We keep two of them

         1      behind the seat of the truck every day.

         2           Q.  And you used that at 400 Canal --

         3           A.  Absolutely.

         4           Q.  Did you locate unmarked lines?

         5           A.  Nope.  Picked up a couple of beer cans

         6      and Coke cans and that's it.

         7           Q.  Did you know that they were cans when

         8      you got them --

         9           A.  No.

        10           Q.  -- on the sonar?

        11           A.  Nobody could determine that.

        12           Q.  So what did you do when you --

        13           A.  We usually poke around a little bit

        14      with the other small -- lighter metal

        15      detectors, and that will tell you whether it's

        16      an exotic metal or a junk metal.

        17               Do you understand?  So copper would

        18      come up exotic.  It's an expensive, clean

        19      copper.  Coins come up as coins, an exotic.

        20      Aluminum comes up as exotic.

        21               With the metal detectors, we can find

        22      big chunks of metal in the ground.  Nothing.

        13           A.  No.  Cast iron, no.  It doesn't come

        14      up good.  You'd get a bad reading on it.  It's

        15      just not magnetic.  Magnets don't stick to cast

        16      iron.

        17           Q.  So if you used your equipment and went

        18      over an area where there was a cast-iron pipe,

        19      you would --

        20           A.  Should have found that cog, but it was

        21      cast iron.

        22           Q.  The cog was cast iron?

        23           A.  Yeah.  And back then, in the 1800s,

        24      they mixed carbon in with it.  So if you got a

         1      60 percent carbon and 40 percent cast iron,

         2      you're really not going to pick anything up.

         3      Do you understand what I mean?

         4           Q.  So you went over that area, there was

         5      cast iron there --

         6           A.  No, I don't know if there was cast

         7      iron there.

         8           Q.  Well, you said the pipe was cast iron;

         9      right?

        10           A.  Yeah.  But I don't know -- I didn't

        11      pick that pipe up.

        12           Q.  You wouldn't have expected to with

        13      your equipment?

        14           A.  No.

        15           Q.  Is there a way to pick up cast iron?

        16           A.  Not to my knowledge.  I mean, I'm sure

        17      there's -- there's a way to do everything in

        18      today's world, but not to my knowledge.  I've

        19      got pretty good state-of-the-art equipment.

        20           Q.  It doesn't -- sonar doesn't do

        21      anything for you there?

        22           A.  No.  Sonar would be to locate -- as

        23      the camera went in and we found the problem, if

        24      there was a problem, the sonar would locate it

         1      on the surface for me where I would have to

         2      dig.  Do you understand what I mean?

         3           Q.  You don't use sonar to find things

         4      under the ground?

         5           A.  Yeah, we do.  We put it in pipes that

         6      are broke.  If you call me and your sewer was

         7      broke, we'd put that pipe in and find the break

         8      on the camera.  It would see it.  And then I'd

         9      take the sonar, put it on, and I'd walk up on

        10      the surface and locate -- pinpoint where that

        11      break is on the surface so we know right where

        12      to dig.

        13           Q.  Have you ever used ground-penetrating

        14      radar?

        15           A.  Not personally, but I've been around

        16      it, absolutely.

        17           Q.  What's the purpose of using

        18      ground-penetrating radar?

        19           A.  It'll bounce back and show you

        20      anything in the ground -- voids, stuff like

        21      that.

        22           Q.  Does it show you where there are

        23      underground utilities?

        24           A.  It will show you everything.  If you

         3           Q.  You've never used it?

         4           A.  It's too much money.  $50,000.

         5           Q.  To buy a unit?

         6           A.  No.

         7           Q.  To use it once?

         8           A.  I think it's about 30 grand to use it,

         9      yeah.  It makes jobs obsolete.  That's why you

        10      don't see anybody with it, very few people.

        11               I just happen to know a man that has

        12      that setup.

        13           Q.  Who's that?

        14           A.  Earl Hepper, he does it.  I think he

        15      told me he gets 30 grand a day, 25 grand a day.

        16      It's crazy money.  And he claims it wasn't

        17      accurate.  He used it in the city of Lawrence.

         1           Q.  There's cast-iron pipes in Boston?

         2           A.  Everywhere.  Steam pipes.

         3           Q.  There's some in Lawrence?

         4           A.  There's millions of them.

         5           Q.  So if you can't detect them by the

         6      metal detectors that you use, how do you avoid

         7      hitting cast iron?

         8           A.  You go after the plans, and usually

         9      the city will furnish you an as-built.  It's

        10      their job to furnish you an as-built.  They

        11      couldn't.

        12           Q.  They couldn't because they didn't have

        13      any plans for that area?

        14           A.  That's what they told us at the time.

        15           Q.  Okay.  Did they --

        16           A.  But you'd also see the cast iron going

        17      in the building.  We checked out that whole

        18      foundation.  There's no pipes going in that

        19      building.

        20           Q.  No cast iron going into --

        21           A.  In that area.

        22           Q.  400 Canal Street?

        23           A.  In that area where -- in our marked

        24      area.  Yeah, there was nothing.

         1           Q.  Well, knowing what you know now, what

         2      you knew after the incident, where did that

         3      line go?

         4           A.  I don't know.  Shut the school down

         5      miles away.  That's all I can tell you.  They

         6      said it was an old valve.  They didn't know it

         7      was there.  They shut it off with another old

         8      valve that was in a building across the bridge.

         9      And then when we ended up digging it up to

        10      repair it, we found out that it wasn't put

        11      together right.  Instead of it being in a

        12      structure, they just laid plates against it and

        13      plate over it.  It was crazy.  Jimmy's got

        14      pictures.

        15           Q.  Jim Coskren?

        16           A.  I think so.

        17               They took street plates that you'd put

        18      over a hole in the street, leaned them against

        19      it four times.  That's how they -- what they

        20      did.

        21           Q.  They built a little tepee over it?

        22           A.  Yeah.  And they put a cover on it.

        23      And then they paved over it.

        24           Q.  You don't know when that happened?

         1           A.  I don't know if Jimmy paved the

         2      building or not.  I wasn't around at that

         3      point.  I don't know what the deal's there.

         4           Q.  You don't know who did it?

         5           A.  I don't.

         6           Q.  When you say that that valve is

         7      supposed to come to the surface, you're talking

         8      about coming to the surface where there's a

         9      small metal cover that you take off so that you

        10      can operate the valve?

        11           A.  Similar to this.  Probably a little

        12      bigger.

        13           Q.  Similar to the ones you see on

        14      sidewalks that --

        15           A.  Sure.

        16           Q.  -- say "water" or "gas"?

        17           A.  Yeah.  It would be a little bigger.

        18      It would have a wrench -- spot for a wrench on

        19      it or something.  It might be two feet down.

        22      there's a distinction I'm trying to make sure I

        23      understand, Mr. Killion.  And when you talk

         1      Dealy, whichever it is -- from the water

         2      department, and talking to the foreman before

         3      him, and going through the Dig Safe process,

         4      what I'm trying to understand is did you

         5      understand from the water department that there

         6      were no water lines in this area, or that they

         7      didn't have any maps of the area so that they

         8      didn't know?

         9           A.  From my own experience, I knew there

        10      was no water lines in my dig area because they

        11      would have went through the building.  The

        12      water main was out the other side of the

        13      building.  It's encased in concrete.  There's a

        14      part of it sticking out.  It's very visible.

        15               I walked with Dan Kadlic right to that

        16      area.  That's where it came in and out.  That's

        17      what Dan told me.  I walked the whole

        18      foundation with him.  Me and him were pretty

        19      sure that there wasn't a water main out there.

        20      Dan was confident for me to dig.

        21           Q.  Dan said he was confident for you to

        22      dig?

        23           A.  Dan was confident that there was no

        24      utilities in that area also.

         1           Q.  Okay.  Again, I'm not talking about

         2      Dan.  I'm trying to draw the distinction --

         3           A.  No, I understand that.

         4           Q.  I'm trying to draw a distinction

         5      related to the -- well, let me ask a different

         6      question.

         7           A.  Okay.

         8           Q.  You've dealt with cities and towns --

         9           A.  Yep.

        10           Q.  -- in Massachusetts and in New

        11      Hampshire; right?

        12           A.  Correct.

        13           Q.  And generally speaking, they have

        14      plans of where their --

        15           A.  Every town.

        16           Q.  -- water lines are?

        17           A.  You get as-builts, yeah.

        18           Q.  And things don't always correspond

        19      exactly to those plans, do they?

        20           A.  No.

        21           Q.  But when you go to a Town and ask for

        22      the maps, or ask for where their water lines

        23      are, they have a map of --

        24           A.  It's called an "as-built."

         1           Q.  They have the as-built plans of

         2      everything in town?

         3           A.  Well, for the most part.  When you

         4      start getting around 1920s and down, it gets

         5      tough.

         6           Q.  They don't always have the plans for

         7      1920 and before?

         8           A.  No.

         9           Q.  The as-builts?

        10               What I want to know is did the City

        11      not have any plan for the area along Canal

        12      Street, not have any as-builts for the area

        13      along Canal Street?

        14           A.  After we hit the water main, a young

        15      engineer showed up with plan.  It showed the

        16      water main very clearly.

        17           Q.  So was it prior to hitting the thing?

        18           A.  No.

        19           Q.  It was your understanding that they

        20      just didn't have any maps for that area?

        21           A.  Correct.  They didn't have any maps

         1      archives after about ten hours of research.

         2           Q.  You had the opportunity to -- well,

         3      you were involved in repairing the water line

         4      after the fact; right?

         5           A.  Yeah.

         6           Q.  So what was broken on the water line

         7      that was causing water to leak?

         8           A.  Right at the valve, there was a chunk

         9      missing out of it.  And my suspicion is what

        10      happened when I caught that cog on the top, it

        11      pulled the valve back a little bit, and one of

        12      the bolts leaned down on the pipe or pulled up

        13      on a pipe and broke the pipe.

        14           Q.  You saw the break in the pipe?

        15           A.  Yeah, there was a hole in the pipe.

        16           Q.  How big was it?

        17           A.  Oh, boy.  Four or five inches round,

        18      I'm thinking.

        19           Q.  And when you got to see that section

        20      of pipe, by then, the water had been turned

        21      off; right?

        22           A.  Oh, yeah.

        23           Q.  Was that a process that took a while?

        24           A.  Yeah.  It took them about,

         1      hypothetically, between six to ten hours to get

         2      the water off, and then -- yeah, about six to

         3      ten hours to get the water off.

         4           Q.  So was it the next day when you were

         5      back there repairing the pipe?

         6           A.  I don't believe so.  No, it wasn't the

         7      next day because the building had to come down.

         8      I think it took a couple days to make

         9      arrangements for Bogie to come up and take the

        10      building down, and then I think we fixed it

        11      after that.  But I just don't remember.  I

        12      really don't.  I didn't know I was going to be

        13      sitting here or I would have written it down.

        14           Q.  Was there a police and fire detail at

        15      the place?

        16           A.  I don't remember, but I'm sure there

        17      was.

        18           Q.  Okay.  Who paid for that?

        19           A.  Mr. Coskren.

        20           Q.  Okay.  Did you get paid for the work

        21      that you did at 400 Canal Street?

        22           A.  Absolutely.

        23           Q.  Mr. Coskren doesn't owe you any money

        24      for that work?

         1           A.  Oh, no.  Jimmy's the best.  Pays me

         2      every day.

         3           Q.  You've continued to do work for him

         4      since then?

         5           A.  Absolutely.

         6           Q.  And he's always paid you for that

         7      work?

         8           A.  I do work for C.I.L., not Jimmy

         9      directly, but Jimmy's the owner.

        10           Q.  Right.

        11           A.  And I'm sure he okays everything.

        12           Q.  Right.  Did you charge him for taking

        13      down that portion of the building that had to

        14      come down before the pipe could be fixed?

        15           A.  I think when I got my friend Bogie

        16      involved, there was a small fee with it.  I

        17      don't know what Mr. Coskren worked out.  If I

        18      was involved, I just don't remember.

        19           Q.  You don't know one way or the other

        20      whether you charged him for that?

        21           A.  Personally, I don't know what we

        22      worked out.  I just don't remember.

        23           Q.  Yep.  At the time you started digging

        24      in May or June of 2015, you believed that you

         1      knew where the -- you believe that you had

         2      enough information about where water lines were

         3      under the ground in the work area to go ahead

         4      and work?

         5           A.  When I started digging there, I

         6      believed the only thing in that ground was them

         7      trestles.  Other than that, I didn't think

         8      there was anything else in the ground there.

         9           Q.  The trestles being the tunnels?

        10           A.  Correct.

        11           Q.  And that's because you had had --

        12      you'd called Dig Safe.  You'd gone through that

        13      whole process with respect to gas and electric

        14      and all that?

        15           A.  I went through every process.  It took

        16      a couple of weeks.  It wasn't like we just

        17      rolled the dice.  We did all our homework

        18      there.

        19           Q.  But specifically with respect to water

        20      lines, based on what you understood from the

        21      water department from Mr. Daley -- or Dealy,

        22      whatever it is -- you thought there were no

        23      water line in that area?

        24           A.  Correct.  I knew about the hydrant.  I

         1      knew about the six-inch main running down the

         2      road, well outside our dig area.  Other than

         3      that, I was under the impression there was

         4      nothing but the trestles.

         5           Q.  Have you -- in your 17 or so -- 17 to

         6      19 years of work doing excavating, have you

         7      come across buried water lines before that you

         8      didn't know were going to be there?

         9           A.  No.  Everything's well marked today.

        10      We don't -- them problems don't exist.

        11           Q.  Have you ever encountered anything

        12      subsurface that you didn't expect to be there?

        13           A.  Sometimes irrigation lines.

        14      Landscapers don't have a law.  Let's say it

        15      that way.  Or they don't play by the rules.

        16      It's not too many lines that we -- that ain't

        17      marked that we don't know about.  There's no

        18      lines that we don't know about.

        19           Q.  You ever damaged any utility lines

        20      before?

        21           A.  Sure.

        22           Q.  What have you hit?

        23           A.  I never hit anything.  A rock will

        24      fall in a hole and hit it.  One time I had a

         1      street plate fall in the hole.  Car jumped on

         2      the brakes.  Hit it.  Stuff like that.  Never

         3      hit it with a bucket.

         4           Q.  The equipment's never contacted

         5      anything before?

         6           A.  Nothing of -- that would cause a --

         7      yeah, nothing that we'd need to worry about.

         8           Q.  Who's JME Corp.?

         9           A.  That's me.  That was a hearsay name.

        10      We registered it, but we never used it.  That

        11      was James Michael.

        21      Street during the time you were doing work

        22      there in 2015?

        23           A.  I don't know.  I can't answer you.

        24           Q.  Where does Mike Case live now?

         1           A.  Londonderry cemetery.

         2           Q.  When did he die?

         3           A.  Two days ago.  Three days ago.  They

         4      buried him two days ago, I think.

         5               Excuse me.  I was a little slow in

         6      re-answering it.  I got something caught in my

         7      throat.

         8           Q.  Tell me how the water leak happened,

         9      in your opinion.

        10           A.  We caught the cog on the surface.  It

        11      jammed the pipe.  Cast iron or ductile iron is

        12      very weak.  It's more like glass.  It's

        13      fragile.  It shatters.  I think we put a crack

        14      in it at the time.  And then as time

        15      progressed, the crack let go, and that's how

        16      you got your water leak.

        17           Q.  Did you do anything wrong to cause

        18      that?

        19           A.  100 percent the opposite.

        20               MR. MCCARTHY:  That's all I have.

        21               MS. LASNA:  I have no questions.

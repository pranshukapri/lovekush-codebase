        02      Q.   And your -- based on your understanding of --
        03  of how the company is governed, who are the multiple
        04  managers of the company?
        05      A.   I believe it's Vijay Goradia, Tom Wells, Gene
        06  Kenyon, and Jesse Zeringue who's now the CEO.
        07      Q.   Okay.  And who else -- who else is a manager of
        08  Lion Copolymer Holdings as far as you know?
        09      A.   I don't know who else is.
        10      Q.   All right.  You do not believe that you are a
        11  manager of Lion Copolymer Holdings?
        12      A.   Well, I believe that I'm a member of the board
        13  of Lion Copolymer, and I may be classified as a manager
        14  as well.
        15      Q.   Okay.  You just don't know sitting --
        16      A.   I just don't know.
        17      Q.   Sitting here today, you don't know?
        18      A.   That's right.
        19      Q.   All right.  So is it fair to say that sitting
        20  here today, you don't really know what the role of the
        21  board is at Lion Copolymer Holdings?
        22                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        23      A.   I do know what the role of the board is.
        24      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  Tell me what your
        25  understanding of the role of the board at Lion Copolymer
  00012:01  Holdings is.
        02      A.   The role of the board is to approve any major
        03  material decisions pertaining to Lion Copolymers.
        04      Q.   Any other role?
        05      A.   There will be many other roles that come up.
        06  Approvals of financial decisions, et cetera.
        07      Q.   All right.  And so who is on the board with you
        08  at Lion Copolymer Holdings currently?
        09      A.   It's -- as far as I know, it's Vijay Goradia,
        10  Swatantra Jain, Tom Wells, Gene Kenyon, Vishal Goradia,
        11  and myself.
        12      Q.   So I think you listed six people; is that
        13  correct?
        14      A.   And I -- I don't know if the documentation is
        15  done, but I believe since Jesse Zeringue was formally
        16  appointed as CEO, that he might be on the board as well.
        17      Q.   All right.  And when -- when did that happen?
        18      A.   I don't know the exact date.
        19      Q.   Are you for sure that that has happened?
        20      A.   That he has been appointed the CEO?
        21      Q.   And on to the board?
        22      A.   I'm not sure.
        23      Q.   Okay.  I will -- I will represent to you that
        24  he has testified that he is not the CEO and is not on
        25  the board.
  00013:01                Do you have any reason to believe that's
        02  not true?
        03                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        04      A.   I don't know when he testified and what has
        05  transpired since; but as I understand it, he has been
        06  appointed as the CEO.
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  But it's possible that
        08  that occurred after he testified that he wasn't the CEO
        09  and wasn't on the board?
        10      A.   That is possible.
        11      Q.   What in your mind is the division of
        12  responsibilities between the managers of the LLC and the
        13  board?
        14                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        15      A.   Sorry, would you repeat that?
        16      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Well, a little while ago I
        17  asked you who the managers of the LLC were, and you
        18  listed Vijay, Tom, Gene and Jesse.
        19                Do you remember that from a few moments
        20  ago?
        21      A.   Yes.  Well, if you are referring to the legal
        22  definition of a manager, there can be a manager of SBR
        23  business at Lion.  And so I'm not sure what you are
        24  alluding to when you say manager.
        25      Q.   Okay.  So we were -- we were talking at the
  00014:01  time in the deposition a few moments ago about the fact
        02  that it is a manager managed LLC.  Remember that?
        03      A.   Yes.
        04      Q.   And you agreed with me that it was a manager
        05  managed LLC, right?
        06      A.   And -- and in that definition, I believe the
        07  board members are managers.
        08      Q.   Okay.  So your understanding is that the board
        09  are the managers of Lion Copolymer Holdings?
        10      A.   Right.
        11      Q.   And then we've listed the current board
        12  members, right?
        13      A.   Right.
        14      Q.   All right.  Who were the board members of Lion
        15  Copolymer Holdings, LLC, back in 2014 at the time of the
        16  capital calls?
        17      A.   I -- I don't recall each of the members at that
        18  time, but I know I was on the board and Vijay was on the
        19  board.  And I believe Tom Wells was on the board at the
        20  time and Swatantra Jain.
        21      Q.   Okay.  But other than those four, you can't,
        22  sitting here today, tell us who the other members of the
        23  board were at the time of the capital calls in 2014?
        24      A.   Specifically, no.
        25      Q.   Who would you go talk to to find out the answer
  00015:01  to that question?
        02      A.   I would talk to Vijay.
        03      Q.   Anyone else?
        04      A.   Tom Wells.
        05      Q.   Do you have any other role with Copolymer --
        06  with Lion Copolymer Holdings other than as a board
        07  member?
        08      A.   I don't.
        09      Q.   And how long have you been on the board, sir?
        10      A.   I do not recall specifically, but probably
        11  since 2008 or '9.
        12      Q.   And have you served continuously on the board
        13  since that time?
        14      A.   I have.
        15      Q.   Do you remember how you got put on the board?
        16      A.   I believe that was an outcome of our
        17  participation in Lion Copolymers.
        18      Q.   And by participation in Lion Copolymers, what
        19  do you mean?
        20      A.   When we invested -- when Goradia Capital
        21  invested in Lion.
        22      Q.   That that was the transaction that put you on
        23  to the board?
        24      A.   Yes.
        25      Q.   And do you know why you got put on the board?
  00016:01      A.   Because I'm -- I'm a large shareholder of
        02  Goradia Capital.
        03      Q.   And was that the same -- was that your
        04  understanding of the same reason that Vijay went on the
        05  board?
        06      A.   Vijay was the one, I think, who negotiated the
        07  investment.
        08      Q.   And was that your understanding of how Tom
        09  Wells got on the board?
        10      A.   Tom Wells was nominated by us to be on the
        11  board.
        12      Q.   All right.  "Us" being you and Vijay?
        13      A.   Yes.
        14      Q.   And was -- was that how Swatantra Jain got on
        15  the board?
        16      A.   Yes.
        17      Q.   Meaning he also was appointed by you and Vijay,
        18  correct?
        19      A.   He was our nominee, yes.
        20      Q.   All right.  Is it fair to say, Mr. Goradia,
        21  that all of the board members serve on the board because
        22  you and Vijay Goradia want them to be on the board,
        23  correct?
        24                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        25      A.   They serve on the board because we have trust
  00017:01  in their capabilities and they bring value and they have
        02  accepted to serve on the board.
        03      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  But --
        04      A.   It's not an imposition.
        05      Q.   Understood.
        06                But -- but conversely, if you and your
        07  brother, Vijay, did not want a particular person on the
        08  board, you would remove them and could remove them from
        09  the board, correct?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   Not necessarily.  I think there would be a
        12  discussion, and we would have to take -- Swatantra Jain
        13  is a shareholder in Goradia Capital as well, and we
        14  cannot simply arbitrarily remove him from the board.
        15      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You -- your understanding is
        16  that you don't have the ability to pick who's on the
        17  board?
        18      A.   We may have the ability, but that is not the
        19  norm.  That is not how we operate.
        20      Q.   Do you recall that prior to January of 2013,
        21  that David and Pete De Leeuw were on the board?
        22      A.   Sorry, would you repeat that?
        23      Q.   Do you recall that prior to January of 2013,
        24  that David and Pete De Leeuw were on the board?
        25      A.   At some point, they were on the board.  I don't
  00018:01  know the precise date when they were.
        02      Q.   Do you remember them coming off the board?
        03      A.   Again, I don't recall the precise date, but
        04  yes.
        05      Q.   All right.  And do you remember the
        06  circumstances of them coming off the board?
        07      A.   As far as I recall, their term had expired.
        08      Q.   All right.  And they were not renominated by
        09  you or Mr. Goradia, correct?
        10      A.   As far as I recall, they did not ask to be
        11  renominated.
        12      Q.   Is your testimony that you would have
        13  renominated them had they asked to be renominated?
        14      A.   That's a hypothetical from almost seven, eight
        15  years ago.  You know, it would depend on the
        16  circumstances.
        17      Q.   Would you consider putting Pete or David
        18  De Leeuw on the board now?
        19      A.   It depends.
        20      Q.   On what?
        21      A.   On what value they would bring and what other
        22  things they are involved in.
        23      Q.   And what -- what difference does it make
        24  that -- of what other things they're involved in?
        25      A.   There would be -- if there is a conflict of
  00019:01  interest, then it would make sense.
        02      Q.   Okay.  Is it your testimony that none of the
        03  current board members have any conflicts of interest?
        04                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        05      A.   As far as I know, I -- I don't believe so.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  What types of conflicts of
        07  interests are you referring to that would preclude the
        08  De Leeuws from being on the board?
        09      A.   Pete and David have their own private equity
        10  firm that looks to acquire assets.  And it is possible
        11  that Lion could be pursuing something that they may be
        12  involved in for their own -- own company.
        13      Q.   Goradia Capital is a private equity fund,
        14  correct?
        15      A.   Yes.
        16      Q.   And it pursues investments for itself, correct?
        17      A.   Yes.
        18      Q.   And you're a member of Goradia Capital,
        19  correct?
        20      A.   Yes, I am.
        21      Q.   And Vijay is a member of Goradia Capital,
        22  correct?
        23      A.   Yes.
        24      Q.   Is Vishal a part of Goradia Capital?
        25      A.   No, he's not.
  00020:01      Q.   Is Swatantra Jain a part of Goradia Capital?
        02      A.   He is.
        03      Q.   Is Tom Wells part of Goradia Capital?
        04      A.   He is.
        05      Q.   Is Gene Kenyon part of Goradia Capital?
        06      A.   Yes, he is.
        07      Q.   Is Rich Furlin part of Goradia Capital?
        08      A.   Yes.
        09      Q.   What specifically is your role at Goradia
        10  Capital?
        11      A.   I'm on the board.
        12      Q.   And do you have any other roles or titles with
        13  Goradia Capital?
        14      A.   I don't have titles, no.
        15      Q.   Do you have any other role at Goradia Capital?
        16      A.   My role is to participate in the evaluations of
        17  investments that we decide to make.
        18      Q.   And when was Goradia Capital formed?
        19      A.   I don't recall the date.
        20      Q.   Was it before 2010?
        21      A.   I -- I cannot recall, no.
        22      Q.   What is your role with AFWest?
        23      A.   I'm a member of AFWest.
        24      Q.   Do you have any other role with AFWest?
        25      A.   No.
  00021:01      Q.   Does AFWest have a board?
        02      A.   No.
        03      Q.   It does not?
        04      A.   No.
        05      Q.   How is AFWest managed?
        06      A.   AFWest is just a financial vehicle.
        07      Q.   Do you know -- do you know what type of legal
        08  entity AFWest is?
        09      A.   I don't recall, no.
        10      Q.   You don't know if it's a corporation?
        11      A.   I'm quite sure it's not a corporation.
        12      Q.   Is it a partnership?
        13      A.   It could be.
        14      Q.   Is it an LLC?
        15      A.   It's possible.
        16      Q.   But your testimony is, you are not aware of how
        17  AFWest is governed?
        18      A.   AFWest, as I said, is just a special purpose
        19  vehicle to pursue certain investments.
        20      Q.   And so who decides when AFWest is going to do
        21  something?
        22      A.   It would be Goradia Capital, the Goradia family
        23  members, Vijay and myself.
        24      Q.   Okay.  So is it fair to say that you Hemant
        25  Goradia and your brother Vijay Goradia control AFWest?
  00022:01      A.   And the various trusts that are members, also.
        02      Q.   And so when AFWest is deciding whether to do
        03  something, your understanding of how it works is you
        04  vote, Vijay votes, and trustees or beneficiaries of the
        05  trust vote?
        06                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        07      A.   It is Vijay and I who will vote and present it
        08  to the trustees.
        09      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  You also described
        10  AFWest as a special purpose vehicle or a financial
        11  vehicle.
        12                Of what entity is AFWest a special purpose
        13  vehicle or financial vehicle?
        14                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        15      A.   It is not an entity of any other company.
        16      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  So to your
        17  understanding, there's no relationship between AFWest
        18  and Gorvest?
        19                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        20      A.   There is a relationship.
        21      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  What is the relationship
        22  between AFWest and Gorvest?
        23      A.   So Gorvest may have been formed prior to AFWest
        24  and then -- for other investments and then at some point
        25  for -- for simplicity, AFWest may have become a
  00023:01  subsidiary of Gorvest.
        02      Q.   And are you -- are you sure about all that, or
        03  is that a guess?
        04      A.   I'm quite sure about it.
        05      Q.   Okay.  So your understanding sitting here today
        06  is that AFWest is a subsidiary of Gorvest?
        07      A.   Again, I don't want to go into the legal
        08  definition of a subsidiary, but I believe that it is
        09  below Gorvest.
        10      Q.   Below Gorvest.  Does that mean it's controlled
        11  by Gorvest?
        12                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        13      A.   I couldn't tell you that, no.
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So let's talk about Gorvest.
        15  What is your role at Gorvest?
        16      A.   I'm a member of Gorvest.
        17      Q.   Okay.  Do you have any other roles at Gorvest?
        18      A.   I do not.
        19      Q.   And does Gorvest have a board?
        20      A.   I don't think so.
        21      Q.   You don't know whether or not you're on the
        22  board at Gorvest?
        23      A.   Gorvest does not have a board.
        24      Q.   Who controls Gorvest?
        25      A.   The investors.
  00024:01      Q.   And who are the majority investors in Gorvest?
        02      A.   Vijay and I.
        03      Q.   All right.  And is Swatantra Jain an investor
        04  in Gorvest?
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   Is Vishal Goradia an investor in Gorvest?
        07      A.   No.
        08      Q.   Is Vishal Goradia a beneficiary of a trust that
        09  is an investor in Gorvest?
        10      A.   Yes.
        11      Q.   Is Swatantra Jain an investor in AFWest?
        12      A.   Yes.
        13      Q.   Is Vishal Goradia an investor in AFWest?
        14      A.   No.
        15      Q.   Is Vishal Goradia an investor in a -- strike
        16  that.
        17                Is Vishal Goradia a beneficiary of an
        18  investor in AFWest?
        19      A.   Yes.
        20      Q.   And I think you said that you're not sure if
        21  Gorvest has a board.  So I assume you don't know whether
        22  or not Swatantra Jain or Vijay or Vishal are on the
        23  board of Gorvest?
        24                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        25      A.   I think I clarified your question earlier that
  00025:01  I'm quite sure there is no board for Gorvest.
        02      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And I think you -- I think you
        03  also tried to help me understand by saying that Gorvest
        04  is governed by the investors?
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   So is that consistent with, say, a member
        07  managed LLC?
        08                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        09      A.   I think if you're looking for legal
        10  definitions, I cannot tell you.  There will be other
        11  experts who can clarify that for you.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Who would know the answer to
        13  how Gorvest and AFWest are managed legally?
        14      A.   It would be our legal advisor.
        15      Q.   And who is that?
        16      A.   There's a gentleman named William Bell.
        17      Q.   William Bell?
        18      A.   Yes.
        19      Q.   And where is Mr. Bell?
        20      A.   Where is he?
        21      Q.   Yes, sir.
        22      A.   He's at -- if you mean where does he live or --
        23      Q.   Where is his office?
        24      A.   His office is in Austin, Texas.
        25      Q.   In Austin.
  00026:01                Is Mr. Bell a tax lawyer?
        02      A.   Yes, he is.
        03      Q.   Does he have his own firm?
        04      A.   Yes, he does.
        05      Q.   Is there anyone else that you would go talk to
        06  to understand the governance of AFWest and Gorvest?
        07      A.   It will be Vijay.
        08      Q.   Anyone else?
        09      A.   No.
        10      Q.   Other than Lion Copolymer Holdings and Goradia
        11  Capital, do you sit on any other boards?
        12      A.   I do.
        13      Q.   What are the names of the other companies on
        14  which you sit on the board?
        15      A.   There are a number of Vinmar entities.  I could
        16  not enumerate all of them here.
        17      Q.   Okay.  Other than the numerous Vinmar entities
        18  on which you sit on the board, any other companies that
        19  you sit on the board?
        20      A.   I sit on the board of Vinmar International and
        21  Vinmar Overseas.  I'm trying to remember.
        22      Q.   And again, I'm sorry.  Let me make sure -- let
        23  me make sure we're on the same page.
        24                Other than the -- other than the numerous
        25  Vinmar entities that you serve on the board --
  00027:01      A.   Right.
        02      Q.   -- any other companies that you serve on the
        03  board?
        04      A.   Presently, I don't recall any other.
        05      Q.   So is it fair to say that you don't serve on
        06  the board currently of any company that is not
        07  controlled by yourself or your brother?
        08                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        09      A.   Sorry.  Would you restate.
        10      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Is it fair to say that you
        11  currently do not serve on the board of any for profit
        12  company that is not controlled by you or Vijay Goradia?
        13                MR. RUOCCO:  Same objection.
        14      A.   Actually, there is one that we recently
        15  invested in that is called HPPE.
        16      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  HP?
        17      A.   PE.
        18      Q.   PE?
        19      A.   Yes.
        20      Q.   And when you say "we recently invested in," who
        21  invested?
        22      A.   It's one of our entities.  I don't recall
        23  through which entity we have invested.
        24      Q.   Was it Goradia Capital?
        25      A.   No.
  00028:01      Q.   Was Goradia Capital who analyzed the investment
        02  prior to making it?
        03      A.   That's possible.
        04      Q.   And then some entity was created to actually be
        05  the investment vehicle?
        06      A.   Correct.
        07      Q.   But Goradia Capital did the due diligence?
        08      A.   Somebody has done the due diligence, yes.
        09      Q.   Okay.  You wouldn't have had somebody at Lion
        10  do the due diligence, right?
        11                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        12      A.   No.
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Right.  That's a no?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   All right.  Is there any other Goradia family
        16  investment vehicle other than Goradia Capital?
        17                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        18      A.   As I said, we create different entities when we
        19  invest in different --
        20      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  It was a bad question.  Let me
        21  ask it this way.
        22                Is there any other entity other than
        23  Goradia Capital that would conduct the due diligence for
        24  the Goradia family to analyze a potential investment?
        25                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
  00029:01      A.   So it is possible that Vinmar M&A team may have
        02  done some due diligence, but that particular target was
        03  not suitable for Vinmar and then it's passed on to
        04  Goradia Capital.
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  What type of business is HPPE?
        06      A.   HPPE is specialty chemicals business.
        07      Q.   Domestic or international?
        08      A.   Domestic.
        09      Q.   Was this investment made in the last two or
        10  three years?
        11      A.   Yes.
        12      Q.   Does the Goradia family have a controlling or
        13  minority interest in HPPE?
        14      A.   Minority.
        15      Q.   Who is the controlling interest holder in HPPE?
        16      A.   I don't know exactly who controls it, but there
        17  are a number of shareholders.
        18      Q.   Okay.  So let's go back to Lion Copolymer
        19  Holdings and talk about your -- your role some more.
        20  We've established that you're on the board and you've
        21  been on the board since 2008-ish; is that right?
        22      A.   As I said, I don't remember the precise date,
        23  but I've been on the board for quite some time.
        24      Q.   Would you consider yourself the numbers guy at
        25  Lion Copolymer Holdings?
  00030:01                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        02      A.   What exactly do you mean number -- by numbers
        03  guy?
        04      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  The person most knowledgeable
        05  about the company's financials.
        06      A.   No, I'm not.
        07      Q.   Would you consider yourself a valuation expert?
        08      A.   No.
        09      Q.   Have you ever personally performed any
        10  valuations of Lion Copolymer Holdings?
        11      A.   Have I actually prepared the spreadsheets and
        12  put the numbers together, no.  But as a board member, I
        13  have participated in looking at the valuations and
        14  approving it.
        15      Q.   Okay.  What -- what valuations of Lion
        16  Copolymer Holdings do you recall looking at and
        17  approving?
        18      A.   I don't recall specific valuations, but I
        19  believe over the course of Lion Copolymers, there have
        20  been several valuations done.
        21      Q.   And who were those valuations done by?
        22      A.   They may have been done by Lion Copolymers' CFO
        23  with inputs and guidance from Vijay as chairman.
        24      Q.   But sitting here today, you don't recall any
        25  valuation that you looked at or approved as a board
  00031:01  member?
        02                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        03      A.   As I said, I have looked at several valuations
        04  for Lion over the course of my tenure on the board.
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  But sitting here today, you
        06  can't identify for the vice chancellor what those
        07  valuations are?
        08                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        09      A.   Specifically can I recall a document to tell
        10  you, no, I cannot.
        11      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  No, sir.  Can you even recall
        12  the date, the year that any of these valuations that you
        13  looked at or approved occurred?
        14      A.   I may --
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   I may not recall the dates, but I recall
        17  events.  So I believe every time there was a capital
        18  call or when Lion was considering potentially selling
        19  the company, there were valuations done.
        20      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  So your testimony for
        21  the vice chancellor is that you specifically recall
        22  looking at and approving valuations in connection with
        23  capital calls?
        24                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        25      A.   My testimony is that I recall having looked at
  00032:01  valuations for Lion and then as a board member having
        02  approved them.
        03      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  That's not my question.  My
        04  question is:  Your testimony for the vice chancellor is
        05  that you recall looking at and approving as a board
        06  member valuations in connection with capital calls at
        07  Lion Copolymer Holdings?
        08                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        09      A.   I'm going to ask you to repeat that again
        10  because I seem to not have understood your question.
        11      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Your testimony for the vice
        12  chancellor is that you recall looking at and approving
        13  valuations in connection with capital calls at Lion
        14  Copolymer Holdings?
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   As I said, I recall that valuations were done
        17  at different times of Lion Copolymers in regards to
        18  events such as capital calls which I recall having seen
        19  and approving as a board member.
        20      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  But do you have a specific
        21  recollection of approving valuations in connection with
        22  capital calls?
        23                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        24      A.   As I said, when you asked for specific
        25  recollection, if you asked me for one particular
  00033:01  valuation, I cannot mention that here.  But I have seen
        02  valuations, and I have as a board member approved them.
        03      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Are you an accountant?
        04      A.   I'm not.
        05      Q.   And I think you said you didn't ever perform
        06  any valuations, correct?
        07      A.   I said I was not involved in preparing the
        08  spreadsheets and putting together the numbers.
        09      Q.   And by putting together the numbers, for
        10  instance, you didn't determine what EBITDA to use,
        11  correct?
        12      A.   I'm sorry.  Would you repeat that?
        13      Q.   You said you were not involved in putting
        14  together the numbers.  My question was:  And by putting
        15  together the numbers, for instance, you didn't determine
        16  what EBITDA to use?
        17                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        18      A.   I did not determine what EBITDA numbers to use;
        19  but again, when it came to the board for approval, I
        20  would have looked at the EBITDA numbers and either been
        21  satisfied that they were consistent with Lion's
        22  performance or I have objected to them.
        23      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  All right.  But before it came
        24  to you, you were not involved in selecting that
        25  particular EBITDA number, right?
  00034:01      A.   I would not have been involved.
        02      Q.   And before it came to you as a board member,
        03  you would not have been involved in selecting a
        04  multiple, correct?
        05      A.   Correct.
        06      Q.   And before it came to you, you would not have
        07  been responsible for identifying the proper financials
        08  to underpin the valuation, correct?
        09                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        10      A.   I would not have been involved in putting it
        11  together, right.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You would not have been
        13  involved in determining the financial projections that
        14  were available inside of the company, whether to use
        15  those or not, right?
        16                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        17      A.   Well, again, as I said, that whether it's the
        18  EBITDA number or the projections, they would have been
        19  presented to us as board members; and we would have
        20  either found them consistent with what we considered to
        21  be appropriate for Lion Copolymers.
        22      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And how did you do that?
        23      A.   Sorry.  How did I do what?
        24      Q.   How did you determine that it was consistent?
        25      A.   Because of we are being provided with financial
  00035:01  data of Lion Copolymers and we are in the industry, so
        02  we have a good idea of what the trends are.
        03      Q.   Are you sure you got financial information in
        04  2014?
        05      A.   I consistently got financial information.  If
        06  you asked me specifically 2014, I cannot recall.
        07      Q.   And how was this financial information
        08  transmitted to you, Mr. Goradia?
        09      A.   Through documents and through conversations.
        10      Q.   How did you receive the financial information
        11  that you're referring to?
        12      A.   Which financial information?
        13      Q.   The financial information that you're telling
        14  me you got.
        15      A.   So I would get quarterly update on Lion's
        16  performance.
        17      Q.   And how did you receive that?
        18      A.   It may have been through documents that were
        19  delivered to me.
        20      Q.   And how were those documents delivered to you?
        21      A.   I do not recall.
        22      Q.   By email?
        23      A.   Sometimes it could be email.  At other times it
        24  may be physical documents.
        25      Q.   Someone could have brought it physically to
  00036:01  your office?
        02      A.   Yes.
        03      Q.   Who would have done that?
        04      A.   It could have been Rich Furlin.
        05      Q.   Who else?
        06      A.   It could have been Vijay.
        07      Q.   Who else?
        08      A.   Gene Kenyon, Tom Wells.
        09      Q.   Do you get paid by Lion Copolymer for serving
        10  on the board?
        11      A.   I do not.
        12      Q.   You don't know?
        13      A.   I do not.
        14      Q.   What about Goradia Capital, do you get paid by
        15  Goradia Capital?
        16      A.   No.
        17      Q.   Do you get paid by AFWest?
        18      A.   No.
        19      Q.   Do you get paid by Gorvest?
        20      A.   When you say paid, you mean salary?
        21      Q.   Correct.
        22      A.   No, I do not.
        23      Q.   Do you receive a salary from any company?
        24      A.   I receive a salary from Vinmar.
        25                (Exhibit 1 marked.)
  00037:01      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I'm going to mark as Exhibit 1
        02  to your deposition an email chain that you're on.  Ask
        03  you to take a minute and look at it.  Let me know when
        04  you're ready.
        05      A.   Okay.
        06      Q.   Okay.  Mr. Goradia, this is an email chain back
        07  from November of 2008 regarding a discussion about tax
        08  allocation and tax advances, correct?
        09      A.   The subject says, "Draft board resolution on
        10  tax allocation."
        11      Q.   Right.  And you've reviewed this and this is a
        12  discussion of which you're a part about the proper way
        13  to allocate taxes and make tax advances at Lion,
        14  correct?
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   I think this is an opinion of Steve Lyttleton
        17  who worked for Lion Chemical Capital.
        18      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  An opinion of Steve Lyttleton
        19  about what?
        20      A.   Whatever he is referring to here about a tax
        21  allocation.
        22      Q.   Okay.  And could you recall -- you're on this
        23  email, correct?
        24      A.   Yes.
        25      Q.   Your email address is Simpar, S-i-m-p-a-r,
  00038:01  21@Yahoo.com.
        02                Do you see that?
        03      A.   Yes.
        04      Q.   And is that your email address?
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   Do you still have that email address?
        07      A.   I do.
        08      Q.   What other email addresses do you have?
        09      A.   HGoradia@Vinmar.com.
        10      Q.   What else?
        11      A.   HGoradia@GoradiaCapital.com.
        12      Q.   What else?
        13      A.   GoradiaHemant@Gmail.com.
        14      Q.   Any others?
        15      A.   I don't think so.
        16      Q.   How do you distinguish between what email
        17  account you use?
        18      A.   I -- for the most part, I use
        19  HGoradia@Vinmar.com or HGoradia@GoradiaCapital.com.
        20      Q.   All right.  And, again, my question is:  How do
        21  you distinguish between which ones you use?
        22      A.   Most Vinmar-related matters are at Vinmar.com
        23  and Goradia Capital matters at GoradiaCapital.com.
        24      Q.   Do you ever use Vinmar.com for non-Vinmar
        25  business?
  00039:01      A.   It's possible.
        02      Q.   Why?
        03      A.   It just happens if I'm sending messages from my
        04  phone or something like that.
        05      Q.   Okay.  And do you use the Goradia Capital email
        06  address for Vinmar business?
        07      A.   It could happen.
        08      Q.   And why do you do that?
        09      A.   Not as a matter of practice.  It's the same
        10  reason.
        11      Q.   The same reason being just convenience?
        12      A.   I may be traveling, and by chance I just send
        13  something out from Vinmar or the other way around.
        14      Q.   So you described it -- you describe the first
        15  email as an opinion of Steve Lyttleton about tax
        16  advances and tax allocations, right?
        17      A.   What do you mean by first email?  Because
        18  there's a chain of emails here.  I don't know which one.
        19      Q.   Right.  The first email in the chain is the
        20  last one, right, the bottom one?
        21      A.   Right.
        22      Q.   This is the email that starts the email chain.
        23  You understand that, right?
        24      A.   Yes.
        25      Q.   And I think you described this as an opinion of
  00040:01  Steve Lyttleton about tax advances and tax allocations,
        02  correct?
        03      A.   I was referring to the email subject that he
        04  send, and that was the last email.
        05      Q.   Okay.  But you've reviewed this email, and you
        06  understand that it is Mr. Lyttleton expressing an
        07  opinion and some concerns about how the company is doing
        08  tax allocations, correct?
        09                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        10      A.   So, Mr. Price, you are handing me a document
        11  from 2008.  I don't know in what context it is; and you
        12  are, you know, asking me to read it in the short time
        13  and then give you answers.  And I'm trying to do the
        14  best I can.
        15      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And having sat here -- having
        16  received it in 2008 and sat here and reviewed it this
        17  morning, you can't characterize for us what Mr.
        18  Lyttleton is saying?
        19                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        20      A.   What I can characterize is that he's asking for
        21  -- the subject matter refers to draft board resolution
        22  on tax allocation, and he's suggesting retaining the
        23  services of E&Y.
        24      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  To provide an independent
        25  opinion to Lion about how to do tax allocations,
  00041:01  correct?
        02      A.   Yes.
        03      Q.   All right.  And then your brother responds to
        04  him on the first page, correct?
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   And your brother says, "Agree on the need for
        07  independent opinion."
        08                Do you see that?
        09      A.   Yes.
        10      Q.   And then he says, "We have asked -- already
        11  asked for an independent opinion from Margolis Phipps
        12  Wright, a very reputable tax firm in Houston and Locke
        13  Lord, the well-known law firm for an opinion."
        14                Did I read that correctly?
        15      A.   Yes.
        16      Q.   Do you know who the "we" is that your brother
        17  is referring to?
        18      A.   No, I don't.
        19      Q.   Is that you and him?
        20      A.   I can't recall.
        21      Q.   Is that Goradia Capital?
        22      A.   As I said, I don't know who he's referring to
        23  whenever he says we here.
        24      Q.   Okay.  And -- but he does say that "We have
        25  already asked for an independent opinion."
  00042:01                Do you see that?
        02      A.   Yes.
        03      Q.   Do you know who Margolis Phipps Wright is?
        04      A.   Margolis Phipps & Wright is an accounting firm
        05  here.
        06      Q.   Okay.  And how do you know them?
        07      A.   They have done work for us.
        08      Q.   When you say "they have done work for us," what
        09  do you mean?
        10      A.   They have been filing our taxes for Vinmar.
        11      Q.   For how many years?
        12      A.   I don't recall precisely.
        13      Q.   20?
        14      A.   It's possible.
        15      Q.   All right.  Does Margolis Phipps & Wright, the
        16  tax firm in Houston, do your personal taxes?
        17      A.   Yes.
        18      Q.   Do they do Vijay's personal taxes?
        19      A.   I don't know.
        20      Q.   Do they do Goradia Capital's taxes?
        21      A.   I believe they do.
        22      Q.   Do they do Gorvest's taxes?
        23      A.   I believe so.
        24      Q.   Do they do AFWest's taxes?
        25      A.   I think so.
  00043:01      Q.   Do you think that was an independent opinion to
        02  have Margolis Phipps & Wright perform this analysis?
        03      A.   Sure.  Why not?
        04      Q.   And let's talk about Locke Lord.
        05                Do you know who they are?
        06      A.   They're a law firm.
        07      Q.   And does Vinmar use Locke Lord?
        08      A.   In some matters.
        09      Q.   So Locke Lord has been the lawyers for Vinmar
        10  through the years on various transactions, correct?
        11      A.   I wouldn't say through the years, but we have
        12  used them on some transactions.
        13      Q.   All right.  And at this time in 2008, were they
        14  serving as Vinmar's lawyers?
        15      A.   I don't recall.
        16      Q.   Has Locke Lord ever been the lawyers for
        17  Goradia Capital?
        18      A.   I don't recall.
        19      Q.   Has Locke Lord ever been the lawyers for
        20  Haverhill Chemicals?
        21      A.   I don't recall.
        22      Q.   Has Locke Lord ever been the lawyers for you
        23  personally?
        24      A.   Again, I can't recall.
        25      Q.   Has Locke Lord ever been the lawyers for any
  00044:01  trusts of which you are a trustee or beneficiary?
        02      A.   Yes.
        03      Q.   Has Locke Lord ever been the lawyers for
        04  Gorvest?
        05      A.   I don't recall.
        06      Q.   Has Locke Lord ever been the lawyers for
        07  AFWest?
        08      A.   I think I answered that already, no, I don't
        09  recall.
        10      Q.   Do you know whether -- do you know whether in
        11  connection with the preparation of the LLC agreement who
        12  Locke Lord represented?
        13      A.   I believe they represented Goradia Capital.
        14      Q.   And that was about this same time frame,
        15  correct?
        16                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        17      A.   Again, the timing-wise, you know, I cannot tell
        18  you definitively.
        19      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you know whether Locke Lord
        20  was retained to represent the company Lion Copolymer
        21  Holdings?
        22      A.   I don't recall.
        23      Q.   Who would know the answer to that?
        24      A.   At the time, probably Vijay.
        25      Q.   Okay.  Is it possible based upon this email
  00045:01  that -- that Locke Lord was retained in November of 2008
        02  to represent Lion Copolymer Holdings?
        03                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        04      A.   Possible, yes.
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Are you aware of Locke Lord
        06  ever representing Lion Copolymer Holdings?
        07      A.   Sorry.  Would you repeat it?
        08      Q.   Are you aware of Locke Lord ever representing
        09  the company Lion Copolymer Holdings?
        10      A.   I do not recall.
        11      Q.   All right.  So you do not -- as a board member
        12  -- and you've been a board member since 2008, right?
        13      A.   Yes.  Again, I'm not going to confirm the date
        14  2008.  So as I've stated earlier, you know, if future
        15  questions you say as of this date, then I've said
        16  earlier that I do not recall exactly the date that I was
        17  on the board.
        18      Q.   Well, why would you be getting this draft board
        19  resolution in November of 2008 unless you were on the
        20  board?
        21      A.   So I was probably on the board, but you are
        22  saying specifically and if you're going to say specific
        23  dates, then I do not recall that I was on the board.
        24      Q.   All right.  But you don't have any explanation
        25  for why you got this email other than that you were on
  00046:01  the board, right?
        02      A.   I would have been on the board to receive this
        03  email.
        04      Q.   Okay.  So you were on the board in November of
        05  2008?
        06      A.   That would be the logical conclusion, yes.
        07      Q.   Okay.  And so my question is:  From this moment
        08  forward, are you ever aware of Lion Copolymer Holdings
        09  hiring Locke Lord to be its lawyers?
        10      A.   As I said, I do not recall Lion Copolymers
        11  hiring Locke Lord as attorneys.
        12      Q.   Okay.  Would that have been something that you
        13  would have been involved in as a board member?
        14      A.   In retaining Locke Lord?
        15      Q.   Correct.
        16      A.   Possibly.  Not -- not required.
        17      Q.   Who has the authority to hire lawyers for the
        18  company?
        19      A.   It will be Vijay Goradia or the CEO.
        20      Q.   All right.  So your testimony is the CEO has
        21  the authority to hire outside counsel for the company
        22  without board approval?
        23                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        24      A.   It depends on what matter.  If it -- you know,
        25  if it is for routine matters, I believe, yes, the CEO
  00047:01  has that authority.
        02                MR. RUOCCO:  Counsel, we've been going for
        03  about an hour, so whenever you're coming to a natural
        04  stopping place, that would probably be good.
        05                MR. PRICE:  Okay.  Almost ready for a
        06  break.  Just give me a second.
        07                (Exhibit 2 marked.)
        08      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I'm going to hand you what I've
        09  marked as H. Goradia 2 to your deposition.  Give you a
        10  moment to take a look at that.  Let me know when you're
        11  ready, Mr. Goradia.
        12      A.   Okay.
        13      Q.   All right.  So let's start with first things
        14  first.  You received this email from Pete De Leeuw dated
        15  October 23rd, 2007, correct?
        16      A.   Correct.
        17      Q.   And this email went to HGoradia@Vinmar.com,
        18  correct?
        19      A.   Correct.
        20      Q.   And again, the subject line is board meeting.
        21                Do you see that?
        22      A.   Yes.
        23      Q.   And so does this refresh your recollection that
        24  you were, in fact, on the board as of October 23rd,
        25  2007?
  00048:01      A.   I must have been.
        02      Q.   Okay.  And do you remember that at this time,
        03  back in 2007, that kind of -- that there was a
        04  management services agreement between the company and
        05  Lion Chemical Capital?  Do you remember that?
        06      A.   Yes.
        07      Q.   And that the De Leeuws were -- were in charge
        08  of a lot of the activities at the business, correct?
        09      A.   Correct.
        10      Q.   Later some of those functions were taken over
        11  perhaps by Goradia Capital, right?
        12      A.   I don't remember what functions they had and
        13  what were taken over by Goradia Capital.
        14      Q.   Okay.  But you do remember at this time that
        15  Lion Chemical was -- had a management services agreement
        16  and was functioning in compliance with that?
        17      A.   They had the agreement.  In compliance, I
        18  cannot recall if they were in compliance or not.
        19      Q.   All right.  And that Mr. Pete and Mr. David De
        20  Leeuw were on the board at that time, correct?
        21      A.   Yes.
        22      Q.   And was one of the things that Pete was in
        23  charge of during this time period was setting up board
        24  meetings?
        25      A.   I don't know if he was in charge of setting up
  00049:01  the board meetings, but I suppose that was one of his
        02  roles.
        03      Q.   Okay.  He appears to be setting up this board
        04  meeting, correct?
        05      A.   Correct.
        06      Q.   And do you recall back in 2007 and '8 and '9
        07  that there were board meetings?
        08      A.   I recall attending maybe three board meetings.
        09      Q.   When?
        10      A.   Probably between 2007 and 2008 maybe.
        11      Q.   Okay.  And this email is seeking to schedule a
        12  board meeting, correct?
        13      A.   Correct.
        14      Q.   And it says that "The main subject for the
        15  meeting will be discussion of the operating and capital
        16  plan for 2008."
        17                Do you see that?
        18      A.   Yes.
        19      Q.   And do you recall back in 2007, 2008, 2009,
        20  that the board met and approved an operating and capital
        21  plan?
        22                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        23      A.   I don't recall precisely what we approved, but
        24  I recall having attended the board meetings.
        25      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  And you don't recall
  00050:01  approving budgets each year during this time period?
        02      A.   I cannot recall specifically.  I don't
        03  remember.
        04                MR. PRICE:  Okay.  Let's take a short
        05  break.
        06                MR. RUOCCO:  Sure.
        07                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 10:33 a.m.
        08  We're off the record.
        09                (Recess taken from 10:33 a.m. to
        10  10:42 a.m.)
        11                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 10:42 a.m.
        12  We're back on the record.
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Mr. Goradia, are you familiar
        14  with interest rate hedges?
        15      A.   I'm not an expert.
        16      Q.   Do you know generally what they are?
        17      A.   Generally, yes.
        18      Q.   Okay.  And what is your general understanding
        19  of what an interest rate hedge is?
        20      A.   It's just a hedging strategy to protect
        21  yourself against the fluctuations in interest rates.
        22      Q.   All right.  And can you -- can you take out
        23  interest rate hedges on other companies?
        24      A.   I don't understand the question.
        25      Q.   Okay.  Are you aware of whether Vinmar has ever
  00051:01  done any sort of interest rate hedge on Lion's debt?
        02      A.   I'm not aware of it.
        03      Q.   Do you know whether Vinmar ever considered
        04  doing interest rate hedges on Lion Copolymers' debt?
        05      A.   Not that I'm aware of.
        06                (Exhibit 3 marked.)
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Give you a moment to look at
        08  this email which I've marked as Exhibit 3 to your
        09  deposition which is an October (as spoken) 17th, 2016
        10  email from Tom Wells to you and Vijay Goradia, subject
        11  line interest rate hedge.
        12      A.   Okay.
        13      Q.   Okay.  You've had a chance to look at
        14  Exhibit 3, and can you confirm for us that this is an
        15  email dated August 17th, 2016, from Tom Wells to you and
        16  Vijay Goradia, subject line interest rate hedge?
        17      A.   Yes.
        18      Q.   And this is Mr. Wells who is communicating with
        19  you and Vijay Goradia in your Vinmar capacities,
        20  correct?
        21      A.   Yes.
        22      Q.   And he's suggesting to you that Vinmar should
        23  give serious consideration to an interest rate swap
        24  transaction on Lion's debt, correct?
        25      A.   I don't believe it says here anything about
  00052:01  Lion's debt.
        02      Q.   And you don't think -- so what do you think
        03  it's talking about then?
        04      A.   I think as it states clearly, "Because Vinmar
        05  does not have actual debt, it will be saving on the
        06  discount of LCs on which it pays LIBOR plus a spread.
        07  Vinmar will continue to pay the same but would recoup if
        08  LIBOR were to exceed 1.12 percent."
        09      Q.   So explain to me how you understand this was
        10  going to work.
        11      A.   I don't know how it was going to work.  I think
        12  what he's referring to is that Vinmar should consider
        13  hedging its interest exposure.
        14      Q.   But how does Vinmar have interest exposure if
        15  it doesn't have any debt?
        16      A.   Because Vinmar does a lot of trade financing.
        17      Q.   And why wasn't this a good strategy for Lion to
        18  consider?
        19      A.   I think that's something you would have to ask
        20  Mr. Wells.
        21      Q.   Did you upon reading this think that it was
        22  something that Lion should consider?
        23      A.   I don't recall.
        24      Q.   Do you know whether Vinmar pursued this
        25  strategy?
  00053:01      A.   We did not.
        02      Q.   So LCs, LCs down in that paragraph towards the
        03  bottom, your understanding is that's referring to what?
        04      A.   That's referring to letters of credit.
        05      Q.   Letters of credit.
        06                Did Mr. Wells ever present the idea of
        07  doing interest rate hedges for Lion to the Lion board?
        08      A.   I don't recall him doing that.
        09      Q.   Did you ever present Mr. Wells' interest rate
        10  hedge idea to anyone else at Lion?
        11                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        12      A.   No, I don't.
        13                (Exhibit 4 marked.)
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Mr. Goradia, I've handed you
        15  what I've marked as Exhibit 4 to your deposition which I
        16  believe is a series of emails primarily between you and
        17  your brother.  And I'm going to ask you to take a look
        18  at those, and then I have some questions for you.
        19      A.   Okay.
        20      Q.   So do you recognize this as a series of emails
        21  from July of 2015 primarily between you and your
        22  brother?
        23      A.   Yes.
        24      Q.   I guess the chain starts with an email on July
        25  11th from Tom Wells to you and Vijay, correct?
  00054:01      A.   Correct.
        02      Q.   And then it appears the conversation continues
        03  just between you and your brother, correct?
        04      A.   Correct.
        05                (Reporter clarification.)
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So let me -- let me ask you:
        07  What -- what is this talking about?
        08      A.   It's talking about an investment in the company
        09  that we had made.
        10      Q.   An investment in a company that -- that you had
        11  made, "you" being you and your brother?
        12      A.   Well, we were the primary owners to another
        13  entity.
        14      Q.   Okay.  And what entity had made the investment?
        15      A.   I don't recall which entity made the
        16  investment.
        17      Q.   All right.  What was the investment?
        18      A.   It was in a petrochemical plant.
        19      Q.   All right.  A petrochemical plant called JAC?
        20      A.   That's short for Jurong Aromatics.
        21      Q.   Can you spell that for us?
        22      A.   Yeah, sure.  J-u-r-o-n-g.  Second word is
        23  Aromatics, A-r-o-m-a-t-i-c-s.
        24      Q.   All right.  And what kind of business was
        25  Jurong Aromatics in?
  00055:01      A.   Production of petrochemicals.
        02      Q.   And you and your brother through some entity
        03  had made an investment in Jurong Aromatics?
        04      A.   Yes.
        05      Q.   Let's call it JAC, okay?
        06      A.   Sure.
        07      Q.   All right.  So you and your brother had made an
        08  investment in JAC.  Do you recall when that investment
        09  was?
        10      A.   It may have been around 2013.
        11      Q.   And was it a controlling investment or a
        12  minority investment?
        13      A.   A minority interest.
        14      Q.   And was one of the things you are discussing in
        15  these emails in July of 2015 with your brother
        16  protecting your minority interests?
        17      A.   We were trying to, yes.
        18      Q.   Okay.  And if we look at your brother's email
        19  dated July 14th, 2015, at 7:47 in the morning, he says
        20  down towards the bottom, "Second thing is, SG has said
        21  under their proposal even if all other equity holders
        22  get 25 percent, they intend to issue new equity.  They
        23  were not clear on how much the existing equity owners
        24  will get diluted.  Theoretically, they could issue new
        25  equity at a very, very high dilution rate and pretty
  00056:01  much wipe us out."
        02                Did I read that correctly?
        03      A.   Yes.
        04      Q.   Then he goes and he says, "As I have said
        05  before, percentage equity, minority rights and clarity
        06  on further dilution are key things that have to get
        07  negotiated."
        08                Did I read that correctly?
        09      A.   Yes.
        10      Q.   So in your minority investment with your
        11  brother in JAC, one of the things you were concerned
        12  about in the summer of 2015 was your minority rights,
        13  correct?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   And the possibility of getting diluted, right?
        16      A.   Yes.
        17      Q.   And wanting to make sure that you were
        18  protected from getting overly diluted, correct?
        19      A.   Yes.
        20      Q.   And then your brother responds to you -- I
        21  guess you send him an email later that day, and then he
        22  responds to you again at the top of the page.
        23                Do you see that?
        24      A.   Yes.
        25      Q.   And your brother says to you, "Again, besides
  00057:01  the initial dilution, we need to understand how we will
        02  get diluted with new capital infusion and need to
        03  negotiate the best minority protection rights."
        04                Did I read that correctly?
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   What were the best minority protection rights
        07  that you-all were discussing at that time?
        08      A.   I don't recall precisely what we were
        09  discussing, but this was a situation where we had --
        10  as -- as a minority shareholder, we had very little
        11  rights.  And as I mentioned that we could negotiate the
        12  best deal we could from the SG Group or potentially lose
        13  all our equity.
        14      Q.   And did you want to make sure that if you got
        15  diluted, that it was done fairly?
        16      A.   We were trying to get the best deal possible.
        17  And as I mentioned, that the -- the financial difficulty
        18  that JAC was facing, as I say clearly here, that we try
        19  and negotiate the best deal we can get or we might
        20  possibly lose all our equity.
        21      Q.   I understand.
        22                My question was:  Was one of the things
        23  you wanted was to make sure that if you got diluted,
        24  that it was done fairly?
        25      A.   Fairly is a -- is a relative term.  We were
  00058:01  trying to get the best possible deal that we could under
        02  the circumstances.
        03      Q.   You didn't think that the majority could dilute
        04  you unfairly, do you?
        05                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        06      A.   The majority could dilute us to nothing.
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You believed that the minority
        08  -- you believed that the majority in JAC could have
        09  diluted you to nothing?
        10      A.   Yes.
        11      Q.   So what sort of protections were you and Mr.
        12  Vijay Goradia discussing trying to get?
        13      A.   This was a restructuring transaction, and we
        14  were just trying to, as I said, the best possible
        15  outcome that we could get.  And if it meant that the --
        16  you know, the best we could get was 10 cents on the
        17  dollar, then that was the best we could get.
        18      Q.   Well, but my question is:  What minority rights
        19  are you talking about trying to get?
        20      A.   Minority rights as in, you know -- we -- we
        21  were trying everything to protect our equity.  And that,
        22  you know, that would mean we asked for a lot of things.
        23  We asked for super majority voting, but none of this was
        24  passed.
        25      Q.   Did -- well, so let's talk about some of the
  00059:01  things you asked for.
        02                So you asked for super majority voting?
        03      A.   Yes.
        04      Q.   Did you ask for board seats for you or for
        05  Vijay?
        06      A.   We already had a board seat in JAC.
        07      Q.   Okay.  And did you think that being on the
        08  board was something that gave you some protection?
        09      A.   I think it was just having a seat at the table
        10  and having some access.
        11      Q.   And because you knew, for example, that you
        12  could go to meetings and at least espouse your point of
        13  view, correct?
        14      A.   Yes.  But as far as minority rights, that did
        15  not offer us any additional protection.
        16      Q.   You didn't think being able to go to a board
        17  meeting and espouse your view offered you any
        18  protection?
        19      A.   No.
        20      Q.   Okay.  And why not?
        21      A.   Because the majority could dictate the terms to
        22  the minority.
        23      Q.   And what other -- what other minority rights
        24  did you ask for?
        25      A.   As I said, we were not in a position to demand
  00060:01  anything.  We tried to get the best possible deal we
        02  could, and we -- we got nothing actually.
        03      Q.   My question was:  What did you ask for?
        04      A.   We asked for a requirement of super majority
        05  vote.  We may have asked -- I -- I don't recall now
        06  precisely what all we asked for.
        07      Q.   Okay.  Did you ask that -- did you ask that
        08  there had to be board meetings?
        09      A.   No.
        10      Q.   So you weren't concerned about the majority
        11  doing things without meetings?
        12      A.   Not really because as I said, the majority
        13  could make the decision then dilute us to nothing and
        14  so, yeah.
        15      Q.   So you didn't care if the board did everything
        16  by consent?  It didn't have any board meetings?
        17      A.   Well --
        18                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        19      A.   -- caring is -- is different.  We did care.
        20  It's that we recognized that we had very little to no
        21  leverage.
        22      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Fair point.  But -- fair point.
        23                But to your point, you did care.  So a
        24  minority investor would rather there be actual board
        25  meetings as opposed to having everything done by written
  00061:01  consents, right?
        02                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        03      A.   Not -- not from my view because a formal board
        04  meeting can be a dog and pony show and be worthless.
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So you think as a -- you think
        06  that a -- as a minority investor requiring there to be
        07  board meetings as opposed to written consents doesn't
        08  give you any protection?
        09      A.   Not really.
        10      Q.   When you said you asked for super majority
        11  voting, what specifically?  Like 75 percent?
        12      A.   I believe so, yes.
        13      Q.   You thought that was a way to protect the
        14  minority, right?
        15      A.   As I said, we were trying to get the best
        16  possible deal.  And so we -- we would ask for whatever
        17  we could get.  And that didn't necessarily protect
        18  minority rights, but might -- might constrain the
        19  majority from --
        20      Q.   What other -- what other protections did you
        21  think that you had in that transaction as a minority?
        22      A.   I don't think we had a lot of protections.
        23      Q.   Do you think -- do you think requiring that any
        24  dilution be at fair market value is a protection?
        25      A.   Do I think that's protection?
  00062:01      Q.   Yes.
        02      A.   It could be.
        03      Q.   Okay.  Versus letting the majority dictate what
        04  the price is?
        05                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        06      A.   In my experience, you can have independent
        07  valuations.  These do not really reflect the true value
        08  of an asset.  And so that by itself does not protect the
        09  minorities or -- or for that matter anybody.
        10      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So --
        11      A.   So it is possible that, you know, the majority
        12  can be fairer than an independent valuation.
        13      Q.   Would -- did you feel that way in JAC because
        14  the majority in JAC owed you fiduciary duties?
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   Sorry.  I didn't follow the question.
        17      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Did you feel that way --
        18      A.   Which way?
        19      Q.   -- meaning that it's okay for the majority to
        20  come up with the value for the dilution, did you feel
        21  that way because the -- the majority in JAC owed you and
        22  Vijay fiduciary duties?
        23                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        24      A.   Yeah, I -- I don't recall that the majority in
        25  the JAC agreement owed us a fiduciary duty.  And as I
  00063:01  said, an independent valuation in this JAC matter would
        02  not have made any difference.
        03      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Did you feel that way in the
        04  JAC instance because the majority had to act in good
        05  faith?
        06                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        07      A.   Again, I don't know that the JAC articles of
        08  association required them to act in good faith.
        09      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You just don't know one way or
        10  the other?
        11      A.   No.
        12      Q.   Do you know what customary minority rights are?
        13      A.   I don't know the legal definition.
        14      Q.   And you also can't tell us despite having seen
        15  it in this email, you can't tell us what best minority
        16  protection rights are either, right?
        17      A.   Right.
        18      Q.   Did you have anything to do with the drafting
        19  of the LLC agreement back in 2007 and '8?
        20      A.   Is your question whether I had inputs in the
        21  drafting of the agreement?  Then, no.
        22      Q.   My -- I think my question was even broader than
        23  that.  It was:  Did you have anything to do with the
        24  drafting of the LLC agreement back in 2007 and 2008?
        25      A.   With the drafting of the agreement, no.
  00064:01      Q.   Did you have any input whatsoever into what
        02  went into this document?
        03      A.   I believe that I had reviewed the document and
        04  then agreed to it.  To the final document, not the
        05  draft.
        06      Q.   All right.  It's -- I will represent to you
        07  that I actually don't believe you signed it.  Is that
        08  different than what you remember?
        09      A.   I -- I believe that I must have signed it.
        10      Q.   All right.  Well, let's -- let's see if we
        11  can't maybe refresh your memory about that.
        12      A.   Okay.
        13                (Exhibit 5 marked.)
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I'm handing you Exhibit 5,
        15  which is the amended and restated limited liability
        16  company agreement of Lion Copolymer Holdings, LLC.
        17                I'll ask you to look at the back and see
        18  if you can find your signature anywhere.
        19                Mr. Goradia, did you sign on behalf of
        20  yourself or any entity, Exhibit 5?
        21      A.   I don't recall.
        22      Q.   What do you mean you don't recall?
        23      A.   That I signed this agreement.
        24      Q.   Okay.  My question is a little different.
        25                I've handed you Exhibit 5.  Did you sign
  00065:01  Exhibit 5 or not?  Is your -- does your signature appear
        02  anywhere in Exhibit 5?
        03      A.   It does not.
        04      Q.   Okay.  And you don't have a recollection of
        05  ever signing some version of Exhibit 5, right?
        06      A.   I don't have a recollection.
        07      Q.   Okay.  So let's go back to your prior
        08  testimony.  Your testimony started off with, well, I
        09  think I might have reviewed it because I signed it.  Now
        10  that we have established that you didn't sign it, are
        11  you sure you read it?
        12                MR. RUOCCO:  Objection to form.
        13      A.   As I said, I -- if you're asking me am I sure,
        14  no.  But I -- I recall that I had read some drafts of
        15  this agreement.  And I would have, you know, made some
        16  comments to it if I didn't like something.
        17      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  All right.  And you -- you
        18  specifically remember reviewing it prior to it getting
        19  signed?
        20      A.   Yes.
        21      Q.   And you remember talking to people about it?
        22      A.   I believe so, yes.
        23      Q.   Who did you speak to?
        24      A.   I don't recall.
        25      Q.   Did you speak to Vijay?
  00066:01      A.   Most likely.
        02      Q.   Did you speak to the lawyers?
        03      A.   Probably not.
        04      Q.   Who were your lawyers or who were AFWest's
        05  lawyers in this transaction?
        06      A.   I don't recall.
        07      Q.   Who were Gorvest's lawyers in this transaction?
        08      A.   I do not recall.
        09      Q.   Do you know why Swatantra Jain signed on behalf
        10  of AFWest and not you?
        11      A.   All of us travel a lot, and so we are all
        12  authorized to sign.
        13      Q.   So is it -- is it fair to say that you did not
        14  negotiate with the De Leeuws this document?
        15      A.   I did not negotiate.
        16      Q.   You didn't communicate with the De Leeuws or
        17  any of their investors at all about this document,
        18  right?
        19      A.   Right.
        20      Q.   Didn't talk to them, right?
        21      A.   Yes.
        22      Q.   You did not talk to them?
        23      A.   I did not talk to them.
        24      Q.   You did not email with them, right?
        25      A.   As far as I know, yes.
  00067:01      Q.   Let me ask you to take a look at page 39.
        02  Actually, I'm sorry, let's go to 38 first --
        03      A.   Okay.
        04      Q.   -- Mr. Goradia.
        05                And do you see there in the middle of the
        06  page article 7 management?
        07                Do you see that?
        08      A.   Yes.
        09      Q.   And then 7.01 has a title Management of the
        10  Company's Affairs, correct?
        11      A.   Yes.
        12      Q.   And then turn to (g), 7.01(g).
        13                Are you there?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   Okay.  And can you read the first sentence of
        16  7.01(g) for me?
        17      A.   "Any action required or permitted to be taken
        18  at any meeting of the board may be taken without a
        19  meeting if a majority of the directors (including one of
        20  the LC Capital directors) consent to such action in
        21  writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or
        22  writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are
        23  filled" -- "are filed with the minutes of the
        24  proceedings of the board."
        25      Q.   Okay.  And do you know who the LC Capital
  00068:01  directors are?
        02      A.   I believe that would be Pete De Leeuw and David
        03  De Leeuw.
        04      Q.   And did -- do you understand 7.01(g) to require
        05  Pete or David De Leeuw to approve the company to act by
        06  written consent as opposed to at a meeting?
        07                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        08      A.   Sorry.  Would you --
        09      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you understand this
        10  provision to say that the board cannot act by consent
        11  and must have a meeting unless Pete or David say it's
        12  okay?
        13                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        14      A.   I think this is a complex document and you are
        15  asking me for a legal opinion and -- or an
        16  interpretation of this particular sentence and I -- I
        17  can't give you that.
        18      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  But you do know that the
        19  LC Capital directors that are being referred to are Pete
        20  and David, correct?
        21      A.   I believe so.
        22      Q.   And you do understand generally that this
        23  section is talking about how and under what
        24  circumstances the board can proceed by written consent,
        25  right?
  00069:01                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        02      A.   Again, as I said, this particular sentence of
        03  this paragraph of this page, you know, it -- it is not
        04  in context, right, so of the whole document which is --
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So you -- you can't even --
        06      A.   -- which is many pages.
        07      Q.   You can't even answer the question that you
        08  understand (g) to be talking about under what
        09  circumstances the board can act by written consent?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   As I said, this document has to be in its
        12  entirety, right, and together.  So I don't know what
        13  else is in there that connects to this clause.
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So you're aware that during
        15  2014, which is an important time period in this case,
        16  right?
        17                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        18      A.   Sorry, what?
        19      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You're aware that 2014 and what
        20  happened at Lion and what the board did during 2014 is
        21  very important to this case, right?
        22                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        23      A.   It is important as in what sense?
        24      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  That that's what this case is
        25  about, what occurred at the company in 2014, correct?
  00070:01      A.   If you say so.
        02      Q.   You don't have that -- you don't know what this
        03  case is about?
        04                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        05      A.   I have an idea what this case is about.  But if
        06  you are focusing on a particular year or a particular
        07  date and -- and saying that that's the most important
        08  thing, then I -- I'm not agreeing to it.
        09      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I didn't say it was the most --
        10  I didn't say it was the most important thing.  I said,
        11  do you understand that what actions the board took in
        12  2014 are very important to this case?
        13                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Yes or no?
        15      A.   If you're asking for some kind of legal
        16  interpretation, then I cannot.
        17                MR. PRICE:  Can you repeat the question
        18  for Mr. Goradia?
        19                (Requested portion was read.)
        20                MR. RUOCCO:  The same objection.
        21      A.   I -- I will respond again that you are asking
        22  me for some kind of legal interpretation.
        23      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  No, sir.  I'm asking whether
        24  you understand that the board's actions in 2014 are
        25  important?
  00071:01                MR. RUOCCO:  Object.
        02      A.   I believe all board's actions are important.
        03      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  Including the ones that
        04  occurred in 2014?
        05      A.   Including the ones in 2014, yes.
        06      Q.   Great.  And you understand that there were no
        07  board meetings in 2014, correct?
        08      A.   I don't recall if there --
        09      Q.   Okay.
        10      A.   -- were or not.
        11      Q.   If -- if Vijay Goradia has sworn both in
        12  writing and in his testimony that there were no board
        13  meetings during 2014, do you dispute that?
        14      A.   Well, again, you have to define what a board
        15  meeting is.  As this document itself says that the
        16  board -- there can be a formal dog and pony show or
        17  there can be a meeting by call -- phone call or emails,
        18  et cetera, where a majority of the board discusses
        19  matters, right?
        20      Q.   All right.  You're aware that there were not
        21  any formal board meetings in 2014 of Lion Copolymer
        22  Holdings, correct?
        23      A.   I cannot recall.
        24      Q.   You're aware that the board in 2014 only acted
        25  by written consent, correct?
  00072:01      A.   I do not recall if there were any formal
        02  meetings in 2014.
        03      Q.   And you know for a fact that Pete and David
        04  De Leeuw never approved in 2014 the board proceeding by
        05  written consent, right?
        06      A.   I don't know.
        07      Q.   When you received a bunch of written consents
        08  -- and we'll look at them later -- did you not concern
        09  yourself about whether or not what the board was doing
        10  by written consent was actually something it could do?
        11                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        12      A.   We -- we have people, and I'm sure they were
        13  adhering to the terms of the LLC.
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Who's -- who are those people
        15  that are making sure that you are adhering to the L --
        16  the LLC agreement?
        17      A.   It would be people internally, and they may
        18  seek outside legal advice as well.
        19      Q.   And would you expect those people to
        20  communicate legal advice to you if -- if they got it?
        21      A.   Not necessarily.
        22      Q.   So as a board member of Lion Copolymer
        23  Holdings, you wouldn't want to know what the lawyers
        24  thought about a particular action you were being asked
        25  to take?
  00073:01                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        02      A.   We have full confidence in the people who are
        03  managing it.  And so if they were comfortable with the
        04  legal advice that they had obtained, then I would be
        05  okay with it.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Would you be surprised to learn
        07  as a board member who approved certain actions in 2014
        08  that the lawyers at Porter & Hedges had advised the
        09  company not to do it?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   I cannot respond to a hypothetical.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Were you aware --
        13                MR. PRICE:  I've never had that happen,
        14  actually.
        15      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Were you aware that Porter &
        16  Hedges had advised Rich Furlin and your brother that
        17  certain actions that were presented to the board in 2014
        18  could expose the board and the company to liability?
        19                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        20      A.   Wouldn't it be better if you showed me a
        21  document so that I can then look at it and respond?
        22      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I'm happy to show you some
        23  documents.  My question is:  Do you recall that?
        24      A.   I do not.
        25      Q.   Do you think that's something that should have
  00074:01  been communicated to you?
        02      A.   Again, you are referring to something that I
        03  have not seen; or I don't know what you are referring
        04  to, so I cannot respond.
        05      Q.   How many times in your career as a Lion board
        06  member have you been told that the lawyers advised
        07  against a certain action?
        08      A.   I don't recall it ever done.
        09      Q.   Okay.  So that's something that's pretty
        10  important, right?
        11                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        12      A.   What is?
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Having the lawyers tell you not
        14  to do something as a board.
        15      A.   Again, you're asking me a hypothetical
        16  question.  If you want me to opine on something, then
        17  show me what you are talking about.
        18      Q.   My point is -- my point is, that's something
        19  that you would remember happening, correct?
        20      A.   I remember a lot of things, and I may not
        21  remember a lot of things.
        22                THE WITNESS:  May I take a quick 2-minute
        23  break?  I just need to use the restroom.
        24                MR. PRICE:  Okay.
        25                THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
  00075:01                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:23 a.m.
        02  We're off the record.
        03                (Recess taken from 11:23 a.m. to
        04  11:29 a.m.)
        05                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:29 a.m.
        06  We're back on the record.
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Show you what I've marked as
        08  Exhibit 6 to your deposition.
        09                (Exhibit 6 marked.)
        10      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And let's just start at the
        11  top.
        12                This is an email from Steve Lyttleton to a
        13  bunch of people on May 23rd, 2007, right?
        14      A.   Right.
        15      Q.   And one of the people that receives this email
        16  is you.
        17      A.   Yes.
        18      Q.   And it is attaching a marked-up version of a
        19  letter of intent and a clean version of a letter of
        20  intent, correct?
        21      A.   I haven't looked at it.  Okay.
        22      Q.   So is that -- have you now confirmed that that
        23  is what this is, Mr. Lyttleton circulating a -- a letter
        24  of intent, both a marked-up version and a clean version,
        25  correct?
  00076:01      A.   Correct.
        02      Q.   And you received this back on May 23rd, 2017,
        03  right?
        04                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        05      A.   2007 you mean?
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I'm sorry.  20 -- 2007.
        07      A.   2007, yeah.
        08      Q.   And if you'll -- let's look at the clean
        09  version just cause it's a little easier.  And if you'll
        10  turn to additional terms, No. 3 on page 4.
        11                Do you see 3(b) on additional terms?
        12      A.   D as in David?
        13      Q.   Oh, I'm sorry.  B as in boy.
        14      A.   B, I'm sorry.  Yes.
        15      Q.   And the paragraph that begins "there shall be
        16  seven board members."
        17                Do you see that?
        18      A.   Yes.
        19      Q.   Let's look at the second sentence that begins
        20  "AFWest."
        21                Do you see that?
        22      A.   Yes.
        23      Q.   It says, "AFWest designated directors, the
        24  AFWest directors, shall control the board; and LC
        25  Capital and the other investors in Holdings will receive
  00077:01  customary minority rights, including approval of certain
        02  enumerated transactions, tagalong rights and preemptive
        03  rights."
        04                Do you see that?
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   Do you have an understanding of what customary
        07  minority rights are?
        08      A.   As far as I know, there's not a standard
        09  definition of customary minority rights.
        10      Q.   Did you understand at the time you received
        11  this what customary minority rights meant?
        12      A.   As I said, my understanding there is not one
        13  definition of customary minority rights.
        14                So I don't know what else was negotiated
        15  as minority rights.
        16      Q.   Okay.
        17      A.   This is more of a generic term.
        18      Q.   And it's a generic term that you have some
        19  understanding of because you and your brother use
        20  similar language when you're talking about your minority
        21  investments, right?
        22                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        23      A.   I don't know that we use similar language.
        24      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You don't think best minority
        25  protection rights and customary minority rights are
  00078:01  remotely the same?
        02      A.   I -- I don't know.  As I said, the definition
        03  of customary minority rights may differ, so...
        04      Q.   But you have -- you have an understanding of
        05  what minority rights you want when you're a minority
        06  investor, right?
        07      A.   And again, that may depend on the investment
        08  and how much leverage we have.
        09      Q.   Right.  But you know what minority rights you
        10  want when you're a minority investor, correct?
        11      A.   As I said, we ask for everything and -- but
        12  that's not what we get.
        13      Q.   And in this document, the De Leeuw investors
        14  were asking for customary minority rights, correct?
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   I don't know that the De Leeuw investors were
        17  asking for customary rights.  I think this is a letter
        18  of intent.
        19      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Well, it would apply -- that's
        20  fair.  It would apply to all minority investors,
        21  including employees and everybody that's not AFWest,
        22  right?
        23                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        24      A.   Again, sorry, I'm confused.  Would you repeat
        25  that?
  00079:01      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Well, I'm just simply saying
        02  this is a letter of intent that says that the minority
        03  investors, whoever they are, are going to get customary
        04  minority rights, right?
        05                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  That's what it says?
        07      A.   That's what it says, yes.
        08      Q.   Okay.  And just like you when you're proposing
        09  minority rights that you want, presumably they had an
        10  understanding of what they meant by that, right?
        11      A.   So if you're going to compare, we were not
        12  assuming anything.  We were proposing specific rights.
        13                (Exhibit 7 marked.)
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Let me show you what I have
        15  marked as Exhibit 7.  And this is a letter of intent
        16  dated that same day, May 23rd, 2007, correct?
        17      A.   Yes.
        18      Q.   And if you'll look at page 4, additional terms
        19  3(b), that language we just looked at regarding
        20  customary minority rights is still in there, right?
        21      A.   Yes.
        22      Q.   And then turn to the last page, and your
        23  brother Vijay has signed in agreement as chairman of
        24  AFWest Chemicals, correct?
        25      A.   Yes.
  00080:01      Q.   And, in fact, is this your brother's signature
        02  initials on each and every page of Exhibit 7?
        03      A.   Yes.
        04      Q.   Okay.  You can set that aside.
        05                And you're aware that after that letter of
        06  intent, the LLC agreement, which we looked at, Exhibit 5
        07  I think it was, was then executed, right?
        08      A.   I would think so, yes.
        09      Q.   The document that you don't recall signing, and
        10  we can't find your signature on, right?  The LLC
        11  agreement.
        12      A.   The LLC agreement, yes.
        13      Q.   All right.  You don't recall signing it, and we
        14  didn't see your signature on it, correct?
        15      A.   You did not see -- we did not see my
        16  signature --
        17      Q.   Right.
        18      A.   -- on it, correct.
        19      Q.   And then after that agreement was signed, you
        20  remained on the board of directors of Lion Copolymer
        21  Holdings, right?
        22      A.   Which agreement?
        23      Q.   Exhibit 5.
        24      A.   The LLC agreement?
        25      Q.   Yes.
  00081:01      A.   Yes.
        02      Q.   That got signed in 2008.  And after that, you
        03  were on it -- you were on the board of directors before
        04  that agreement was signed, right?
        05      A.   Right.
        06      Q.   And then you were on the board of directors of
        07  Lion Copolymer Holdings after it got signed, right?
        08      A.   Right.
        09      Q.   And Pete and David De Leeuw were on the board
        10  of directors of Lion Copolymer Holdings after Exhibit 5
        11  got signed, right?
        12      A.   As I said, I don't recall the dates when they
        13  were and they were not.
        14      Q.   But after that agreement was signed, you do
        15  recall that they were on the board for a period of time
        16  after that?
        17      A.   Yes.
        18                (Exhibit 8 marked.)
        19      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Let me show you what I've
        20  marked as Exhibit 8 to your deposition.  Give you a
        21  moment to look at that.
        22      A.   Okay.
        23      Q.   Exhibit 8 is an email dated May 25th, 2012,
        24  from Pete De Leeuw to the members of the board of
        25  directors of Lion Copolymer Holdings, correct?
  00082:01      A.   Yes.
        02      Q.   It also includes Rich Furlin and Steve
        03  Lyttleton even though they were not on the board, right?
        04      A.   Right.
        05      Q.   And the subject line is copolymer board action
        06  on distributions.
        07                Did I read that correctly?
        08      A.   Yes.
        09      Q.   And one of the things that Mr. De Leeuw is
        10  raising to the board is a concern about distributions
        11  and how distributions have been handled at Lion
        12  Copolymer, correct?
        13      A.   Yes.
        14      Q.   And in the middle of the paragraph -- well, and
        15  one of the things he's doing is suggesting that the
        16  board needs to hire outside attorneys or consultants to
        17  come in and kind of see if things have been done
        18  properly, correct?
        19      A.   That's what he seems to be suggesting.
        20      Q.   Yeah.  He's suggesting he thinks that needs to
        21  be done, correct?
        22      A.   That's what he says.
        23      Q.   Right.  And -- and one of the things he says in
        24  the middle of the paragraph or in the middle of the
        25  page, he says, does he not, "We as directors, however,
  00083:01  have a fiduciary responsibility to all Copolymer
        02  investors to do company distributions correctly.  And
        03  that is the total driving force for this letter to the
        04  board and the attached report."
        05                Did I read that correctly?
        06      A.   Yes.
        07      Q.   Did you agree with Mr. De Leeuw that the board
        08  had fiduciary responsibilities to all Copolymer
        09  investors to get this right?
        10      A.   I -- I do not recall this email.
        11      Q.   Did you -- is your testimony that you didn't
        12  get it?
        13      A.   Obviously, it's addressed to me, but I didn't
        14  -- do not recall it at this point.
        15      Q.   You never wrote Mr. De Leeuw back and said,
        16  "What are you talking about?  We don't owe fiduciary
        17  duties as directors," did you?
        18      A.   I don't recall that I did.
        19      Q.   Did you walk down the hall to Vijay and say,
        20  "Vijay, what is he talking about, we don't owe anyone
        21  fiduciary duties"?
        22      A.   I don't recall doing that.
        23      Q.   Do you recall whether, in fact, the board did
        24  hire an outside consultant to look into this issue?
        25      A.   I don't recall.
  00084:01      Q.   Do you disagree with Mr. De Leeuw that the
        02  board members owed fiduciary duties?
        03      A.   It would depend on what was in the LLC
        04  agreement.
        05      Q.   When you were acting as a board member from
        06  2007 until now, did you act in a way that you thought
        07  you owed fiduciary duties?
        08                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        09      A.   I think you're asking for a legal definition,
        10  and I can't respond to that.
        11      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Mr. Goradia, is it -- when you
        12  served as a board member since 2007, did you think you
        13  had an obligation to be honest?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   Did you think you had an obligation to be
        16  transparent?
        17      A.   Again, what transparency may mean to me may be
        18  different to you.
        19      Q.   What do you think it means?
        20      A.   It means that what is required as per the LLC
        21  agreement that you will transparently share.
        22      Q.   Okay.  So did you think you had an obligation
        23  to treat all investors, all members of the company
        24  equally?
        25      A.   I -- I don't know legally if that's a
  00085:01  requirement.  I -- what I believe is that we had to
        02  treat all members fairly.
        03      Q.   Did you think as a board member of Lion
        04  Copolymer Holdings that you could take actions that
        05  would favor one member over another?
        06      A.   I think the actions we would have to take would
        07  have to be in compliance with the LLC agreement.
        08      Q.   And -- and so your testimony is that if that
        09  favored one member over another, that you could do it?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   If the LLC agreement did allow for it
        12  specifically, then yes.
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you remember instances where
        14  you felt like as a board, you were favoring one member
        15  over another?
        16      A.   No.
        17      Q.   So that never came up as far as you know?
        18      A.   As far as I know.
        19      Q.   Did you think you needed as a board member to
        20  provide information to all the members so that they
        21  could make the decisions you were asking them to make?
        22      A.   I'm confident that the appropriate people
        23  provided the information as required by the LLC
        24  agreement.
        25      Q.   Because you felt as a board member that that
  00086:01  was one of your obligations to make sure the members had
        02  the information they needed to make decisions, right?
        03                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        04      A.   As a board member, one of my obligations was to
        05  make sure that the LLC agreement was adhered to.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  One of your obligations was to
        07  make sure the LLC agreement was adhered to?
        08      A.   Yes.
        09      Q.   That's kind of like the big -- that's kind of
        10  like your big picture point, right?  Like as a board
        11  member, I had to follow the LLC agreement, right?
        12      A.   I'm sorry.  Could you rephrase?
        13      Q.   Is that your big -- is that like your big
        14  picture point like --
        15      A.   I don't understand big picture point.  What do
        16  you mean by big picture point?
        17      Q.   Well, I'm asking you about transparency, and
        18  you tell me you don't really know what that means.
        19                I'm asking you if you could treat members
        20  differently and you say, well, if the LLC agreement says
        21  I can, then I guess I can.
        22                So my point is, your -- your answer to all
        23  these questions is:  You thought as a board member all
        24  you needed to do was just comply with the LLC agreement,
        25  right?
  00087:01                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        02      A.   I don't believe I said all I had to do.  I
        03  believe that as a board member, we had to be in
        04  compliance with the LLC agreement.
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  All right.  And how did you
        06  ensure as a board member that the board was, in fact, in
        07  compliance?
        08      A.   We had several people who would make sure and
        09  review whatever actions were being done.  And we had
        10  confidence that they would follow the appropriate
        11  requirements.
        12      Q.   And who were those people?
        13      A.   It would be Gene Kenyon.  It would be Tom Wells
        14  and Rich Furlin.
        15      Q.   Anyone else?
        16      A.   It would be the CEO of Lion.
        17      Q.   Jesse Zeringue?
        18      A.   Jesse and previously it was Greg Nelson.
        19      Q.   Okay.  And again, it's not exactly clear that
        20  Jesse was the CEO, right?
        21                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        22      A.   Was?
        23      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Is, was, has ever been?
        24      A.   What is your question?
        25      Q.   The CEO.  You don't know --
  00088:01      A.   Has he ever been?  I believe he's -- he's
        02  currently the CEO.
        03      Q.   Okay.  And you believe that might have happened
        04  like in the last couple of weeks?
        05                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        06      A.   I didn't say that.
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So your testimony about -- your
        08  testimony about being in compliance with the LLC
        09  agreement is reliance on Furlin, Wells and Kenyon,
        10  right?
        11      A.   For the most part.
        12      Q.   And just so I understand how this works, so you
        13  assumed as a board member that if something was
        14  presented to you via written consent, for example, that
        15  you could decide it based on what was in front of you,
        16  and that Furlin and Wells and Kenyon had vetted that it
        17  was okay?
        18                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        19      A.   That's a very complex sentence.  Would you
        20  repeat it, please?
        21      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You assumed as a board member
        22  that if something was presented for you to act on, that
        23  it had been vetted by Kenyon, Wells and Furlin and was
        24  in compliance with the agreement?
        25                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
  00089:01      A.   If I looked at it and I was comfortable with
        02  it, then, yes.  If I was not, then I would ask questions
        03  and ask them specifically.
        04      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And so give me -- give me
        05  examples of when you asked questions to make sure that
        06  what was being asked of you was in compliance of the LLC
        07  agreement.
        08      A.   I -- I can't recall a specific example right
        09  now.
        10      Q.   Isn't it true that you've never done that?
        11                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        12      A.   That's false.
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Tell me the time when you did
        14  it and asked them, I'm not sure this is in compliance,
        15  can you explain it to me?
        16      A.   Numerous times.
        17      Q.   Give me an example.
        18      A.   As I had said already, I've answered your
        19  question.  I cannot recall a specific example.
        20      Q.   You can't recall a specific example, but you
        21  know for sure that it happened on multiple occasions?
        22      A.   Yes.
        23      Q.   Is it -- is that because it happened so many
        24  times, you just can't keep track of how many times
        25  Kenyon and Furlin and Wells presented incorrect written
  00090:01  consents to you?
        02                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        03      A.   It's because I'm a busy person and I have a lot
        04  to do and I cannot recall specific examples.
        05                (Exhibit 9 marked.)
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Let me hand you what I'm
        07  marking as Exhibit 9 to your deposition.  Exhibit 9 is
        08  another example of Mr. Pete De Leeuw and the guys at
        09  Lion Chemical setting a formal board meeting of Lion
        10  Copolymer, correct?
        11      A.   Yes.
        12      Q.   You can set that aside.
        13                (Exhibit 10 marked.)
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Exhibit 10 appears to be a
        15  series of communications around another board meeting in
        16  2012 about a sale process, correct?
        17      A.   I don't see where it refers to a board meeting.
        18      Q.   The -- the members on the email are -- are the
        19  board members, correct?
        20      A.   Yes.
        21      Q.   And Greg Nelson was the CEO at the time and was
        22  on the board, right?
        23      A.   Yes.
        24      Q.   Do you remember Greg Nelson ever formally being
        25  removed from the board?
  00091:01      A.   I believe he resigned as the CEO.
        02      Q.   My question is:  Do you recall seeing a
        03  corporate document or a written consent or an action
        04  removing him from the board?
        05      A.   I do not recall.
        06      Q.   And do you recall the sale process that
        07  occurred in 2012?
        08      A.   I recall sale processes.  I do not recall a
        09  specific process in 2012.
        10      Q.   You don't recall something called Project
        11  Savanna?
        12      A.   No.
        13      Q.   Were you not involved in Project Savanna?
        14      A.   I don't know what you are referring to.  As I
        15  said, I don't recall a Project Savanna.
        16      Q.   All right.  So since you don't recall a Project
        17  Savanna, it's probably not something you were involved
        18  in, right?
        19      A.   If it's related to Lion Copolymer, then I was
        20  -- I'm sure I was aware of it at the time.
        21      Q.   You just don't remember it now?
        22      A.   Correct.
        23      Q.   Okay.  So this email from Greg Nelson to Vijay
        24  and Gene and copying you is talking about the
        25  possibility of getting between 7 and 800 million for
  00092:01  Lion, correct?
        02      A.   Sorry.  Would you repeat?
        03      Q.   This email, Exhibit 10, from Greg Nelson to
        04  Gene Kenyon, Vijay, you and other board members is
        05  talking about a sale process for Lion in the 700 to
        06  $800 million range, correct?
        07      A.   The way I read it, he's referring to proposing
        08  a potential price for Lion.
        09      Q.   Correct.  And -- but what the board was
        10  discussing was selling -- was the possibility of selling
        11  Lion between 700 and 800 million, correct?
        12      A.   I don't know that the board was discussing
        13  this.  I think he's referring to a call with Vijay and
        14  Gene, and he has included all the board members in the
        15  email.
        16      Q.   So when you received this email back in 2012,
        17  you did not believe as a board member that the company
        18  was looking into selling between 700 and 800 million?
        19      A.   I -- I do not recall the specific price.
        20      Q.   Well, the CE -- apparently, at the very least
        21  you can confirm that you received an email on
        22  August 2nd, 2012, where Greg and Vijay and Gene are
        23  recounting their discussions of possibly selling Lion
        24  between 7 and 800 million, correct?
        25      A.   You are saying possible sale, and what the
  00093:01  message is saying is he has a thought, a thought.
        02  That's Gene -- Greg Nelson's thought.
        03      Q.   Well, there's already --
        04      A.   So I don't know that that's a possible sale.
        05      Q.   Well, there's already bids, right?
        06      A.   I don't know there is.  You are asking me to
        07  form a judgment based on this one email.
        08      Q.   Well, can you read the email, sir?  I mean, the
        09  email says --
        10      A.   "Vijay, Gene, after our teleconference today, I
        11  have a thought.  If we separated the two businesses and
        12  have LCY and Transfar increase their bid for Geismar to
        13  $750 million and we get the Hong Kong guys to increase
        14  their bid for SBR from 35 million to 50 million, then we
        15  are at 800 million for both businesses.
        16                "Going from 700 million to 750 million is
        17  not as big a stretch as going from 700 million to 800
        18  million.  That said, I would we have MS use this
        19  approach."
        20      Q.   Okay.  Does this -- does this refresh your
        21  recollection that there were actual bids on the table to
        22  buy Lion?
        23      A.   I don't recall that there were firm bids.  I
        24  believe there were letters of intents at the time.
        25      Q.   Okay.  And that Greg Nelson is talking about
  00094:01  trying to get these bidders to increase so that Lion
        02  could possibly be sold between 700 and 800 million,
        03  correct?
        04      A.   I think he's proposing something for the board
        05  to consider.
        06      Q.   And what is that?
        07      A.   If the -- this potential buyers could be
        08  convinced to increase their bids.
        09      Q.   That you could possibly sell the company
        10  between 700 and 800 million?
        11      A.   That is his thought to propose to these
        12  potential buyers.
        13                (Exhibit 11 marked.)
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I've handed you what I've
        15  marked as Exhibit 11 to your deposition.  This is
        16  another communication from Pete De Leeuw to the board
        17  dated May 22nd, 2008, regarding having a board meeting,
        18  correct?
        19      A.   May I look at it, please?
        20      Q.   Yes.
        21      A.   Thank you.  Okay.
        22      Q.   This is another example, is it not, of Pete De
        23  Leeuw setting a board meeting for Lion and sending out
        24  information related to that board meeting, correct?
        25      A.   This is an email from Pete asking for a board
  00095:01  meeting to be held by telephone.
        02      Q.   And providing information in advance for the
        03  board to consider during that meeting, correct?
        04      A.   Yes.
        05      Q.   You can set that aside.
        06                (Exhibit 12 marked.)
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I've handed you what I've
        08  marked as Exhibit 12 to your deposition.  Give you a
        09  moment to look at that.
        10      A.   Okay.
        11      Q.   This is an email from 2007 in September where
        12  Pete De Leeuw is sending around to the board some
        13  additional information that apparently someone asked for
        14  at the board meeting, correct?
        15      A.   Yes.
        16      Q.   And you can't have follow-up discussions and
        17  follow-up emails to board meetings that don't occur,
        18  right?
        19      A.   I'm sorry?
        20      Q.   Somebody -- there was apparently a board
        21  meeting, right?
        22      A.   Apparently.
        23      Q.   And at that board meeting or board
        24  presentation, someone had some questions, right?
        25      A.   For all I know, it may have been a question
  00096:01  from Pete himself.
        02      Q.   Okay.
        03      A.   Yeah.
        04      Q.   And then Pete sent around information that
        05  someone at the board meeting requested, correct?
        06      A.   Well, I don't know what was requested and what
        07  he's presenting.  So is it directly a response to a
        08  request?  I don't know.  I have no way of knowing that
        09  from this document.
        10      Q.   It says, "Attached is one of the items
        11  requested at the board presentation."
        12      A.   Right.  Then let us say that at that board
        13  presentation, I had asked for all capital spending, and
        14  then he sends me this in response.  That would not be a
        15  direct response to my question.
        16                So you are asking me to testify that this
        17  was clearly his response to what was asked, and I don't
        18  know at that time what was asked and whether what he's
        19  presenting is actually a proper response to what was
        20  asked.
        21      Q.   Well, I'm not -- I'm not asking whether it's a
        22  proper response.  He's trying to respond to whatever
        23  someone requested, correct?
        24      A.   Well, you can overload someone with information
        25  which is not relevant.
  00097:01      Q.   Okay.  Under -- once Mr. Goradia and you kicked
        02  the De Leeuws off the board, there were no formal board
        03  meetings, right?
        04                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        05      A.   As I said earlier, I think several times that I
        06  don't recall.
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You don't recall that there
        08  have been any --
        09      A.   I would like to add, please, also that when you
        10  are also stating that when the De Leeuw brothers were
        11  kicked off the board.  I don't know that they were
        12  kicked off the board.
        13                I believe their term expired.
        14      Q.   And they were not renominated?
        15      A.   I don't know that they weren't.
        16      Q.   And they were not reappointed by you as a
        17  controlling member of AFWest who had the ability to put
        18  them back on the board, correct?
        19      A.   What I know is that they were no -- no longer
        20  on the board once their term expired.
        21      Q.   And they could have remained on the board had
        22  you and your brother Vijay wanted them to remain on the
        23  board, correct?
        24      A.   I don't know at the time if they wanted to be
        25  on the board.
  00098:01      Q.   That's not my question.  My question was:  They
        02  could have stayed on the board had you wanted them to
        03  stay on the board, correct?
        04      A.   But whether we would have wanted them or not,
        05  if they did not want to, it wouldn't matter.
        06      Q.   And you -- but you don't know whether they
        07  wanted to or not?
        08      A.   Exactly.  And that's what I've been saying,
        09  that I -- I don't know what transpired at that time.
        10                (Exhibit 13 marked.)
        11      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Let me know when you're ready
        12  to talk about Exhibit 13.
        13      A.   Okay.
        14                Okay.
        15      Q.   Exhibit 13 is from the summer of 2009, correct,
        16  an email?
        17      A.   Yes.
        18      Q.   And again, this is reflective of the fact that
        19  there was a board meeting in the summer of 2009, right?
        20      A.   Again, I don't recall that there was a board
        21  meeting, but it says here, "The presentation for the
        22  board meeting."
        23      Q.   Okay.  So it looks as though there was a board
        24  meeting scheduled for Tuesday, June 16th, correct?
        25      A.   Correct.
  00099:01      Q.   You don't recall going to that, right?
        02      A.   I don't.
        03      Q.   You don't know whether it happened or not,
        04  right?
        05      A.   I can't recall.
        06      Q.   But in advance of that board meeting that was
        07  scheduled, Mr. Nelson is sending out what he calls a
        08  board book, correct?
        09      A.   Yes.
        10      Q.   And he's sending this out in advance of the
        11  meeting, correct?
        12      A.   Correct.
        13      Q.   Presumably so that the board members can
        14  familiarize themselves with the materials and what is
        15  going to be discussed, correct?
        16      A.   Yes.
        17      Q.   There were no board books sent around regarding
        18  the August capital call, were there?
        19      A.   August when?
        20      Q.   The August 2014 capital call, do you remember
        21  that?
        22      A.   Yeah.  I don't recall if there was a board book
        23  or not.
        24      Q.   There was, in fact, not a board book sent
        25  around, right?
  00100:01      A.   Are you claiming it as a fact, or are you
        02  asking me?  If you're asking me, I already told you I do
        03  not recall that there was a board book.
        04      Q.   My statement to you is:  There is not one, and
        05  you know there wasn't one, right?
        06                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        07      A.   As I said, I don't recall if there was or not.
        08      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  There was not a board book
        09  related to the November capital call, and you know that,
        10  right?
        11                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        12      A.   I do not recall that there was one.
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  There was not a board book
        14  related to the Ashland transaction, correct?
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   Sorry?  Can you repeat that?
        17      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  The board presumably approved
        18  the Ashland transaction in 2014, right?
        19      A.   Right.
        20      Q.   There was not a board book presenting the
        21  Ashland transaction to the board, right?
        22                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        23      A.   Okay.  If you're -- I don't know what your
        24  definition of a board book is, but I do recall receiving
        25  a lot of materials on the Ashland transaction.
  00101:01      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Before or after it happened?
        02      A.   Before and after.
        03                (Exhibit 14 marked.)
        04      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  Do you see Exhibit 14?
        05      A.   I'm going through it, please.
        06      Q.   Okay.  Sure.
        07      A.   Okay.
        08      Q.   Exhibit 14 is an email from Rhonda Graham to
        09  the board members and a few other people, correct?
        10      A.   Yes.
        11      Q.   It's dated November 11th, 2008, correct?
        12      A.   Correct.
        13      Q.   And the subject line says Lion Copolymer board
        14  of directors meeting minutes 10/30/2008, correct?
        15      A.   Yes.
        16      Q.   And attached to the email are the board meeting
        17  minutes from the board meeting held on October 30, 2008,
        18  correct?
        19      A.   Correct.
        20      Q.   And they purport to be prepared by Rich Furlin,
        21  correct?
        22      A.   They purport to be, yes.
        23      Q.   And if we look at these board meeting minutes,
        24  it appears as though you were not in attendance at this
        25  meeting; is that correct?
  00102:01      A.   That's what it says, yes.
        02      Q.   At the very back of the board minutes, it says,
        03  "The resolutions, including Mr. Jain and Hemant Goradia
        04  via telephone, were passed unanimously."
        05                Did I read that correctly?
        06      A.   Yes.
        07      Q.   Was it your practice to attend these board
        08  meetings via telephone or just this particular one?
        09      A.   There was not any specific practice.
        10      Q.   Okay.  Do you think these minutes are helpful
        11  in terms of recording what happened at the board
        12  meeting?
        13      A.   They can be.
        14      Q.   Do you think it's good governance practice to
        15  have board meeting minutes?
        16      A.   It depends on the structure and who the board
        17  members are.
        18      Q.   There were no board meeting minutes for --
        19  related to the August capital call, correct?
        20      A.   I do not recall.
        21      Q.   There's no board -- there's no minutes
        22  recording any sort of discussion amongst the board about
        23  the August capital call, right?
        24      A.   I'm not aware of board meetings from that time.
        25      Q.   Okay.  At all, so there wouldn't be board
  00103:01  meeting minutes since there weren't board meetings,
        02  right?
        03                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        04      A.   That's not what I said.  I said I'm not aware
        05  of board meeting minutes.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  You're not aware of
        07  board meeting minutes for -- related to the August
        08  capital call, right?
        09      A.   I'm not aware of any board meeting minutes or I
        10  cannot recall any board meeting minutes at this time.
        11      Q.   Related to the August capital call or you just
        12  can't recall any board meeting minutes ever occurring
        13  after, say, 2012?
        14      A.   I do not recall even this board -- board
        15  meeting minutes.
        16      Q.   Well, this one obviously happened because we're
        17  looking at it, right?
        18      A.   Obviously because you have a document and that
        19  may have been other board meeting minutes that probably
        20  are -- were there, but are misfiled or lost.
        21      Q.   Well, you received a copy of these meeting
        22  minutes even though you weren't in attendance at the
        23  meeting, right?
        24      A.   By email, yes.
        25      Q.   And so there -- there were not any meeting
  00104:01  minutes related to the November 2014 capital call,
        02  right?
        03                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        04      A.   As I said and I repeat that, I do not recall
        05  what board meetings were from what time.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And there were not any board
        07  meeting minutes related to any board discussion of the
        08  Ashland transaction, right?
        09                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        10      A.   I do not recall them at this time.
        11      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I think what I might do for
        12  these, let's try to group this together to speed this up
        13  a little bit.
        14                (Exhibit 15 marked.)
        15      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Mr. Goradia, I'm going to hand
        16  you Exhibit 15, which is a selection of certain
        17  financials reports -- financial reports from various
        18  months in 2013.
        19                Do you recognize Exhibit 15?
        20      A.   If I may please look at it.
        21                Okay.
        22      Q.   So Exhibit 15 is a selection of February, March
        23  and November financials and monthly narratives that were
        24  given to you via email by Stacey Schiro, correct?
        25      A.   Yes.
  00105:01      Q.   And I'll represent to you that I've got every
        02  other month for 2013, exact same thing going to you.
        03                Do you remember receiving these monthly
        04  financial and narratives during 2013?
        05      A.   I remember receiving the monthly financial
        06  statements, yes.
        07      Q.   During 2013?
        08      A.   Right now I cannot recall.
        09      Q.   Okay.  You don't recall receiving these?
        10      A.   As I said, I recall receiving monthly financial
        11  statements, and obviously my email address is there, so
        12  I must have received these.
        13      Q.   Okay.  And did you review these at or about the
        14  time you got them?
        15      A.   Not -- not necessarily in that time in detail.
        16      Q.   So you might have -- you might have reviewed
        17  one month and then not looked at it for a couple of
        18  months, or you might have skimmed them, it just depends?
        19                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        20      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  It depends on kind of like
        21  whether or not you had time; is that right?
        22      A.   No.  I'm sure that I looked at them and the
        23  highlights; and if I had questions, I would ask for the
        24  information.
        25      Q.   Who would you ask for additional information?
  00106:01      A.   It would be -- if it was Greg Nelson at the
        02  time or Gene Kenyon or Tom Wells.
        03      Q.   Well, in 2013 was Greg Nelson still around?
        04      A.   I don't recall that.
        05      Q.   So at some point in early 2014, you stopped
        06  receiving these emails, right?
        07      A.   I do not recall when I stopped receiving them.
        08      Q.   But at some point in time, you did stop
        09  receiving monthly email financials and narratives,
        10  correct?
        11      A.   At some point in time, yes.
        12      Q.   And did that make it harder for you to keep
        13  track of what was going on at the business?
        14      A.   No.
        15      Q.   How did you keep track of what was going on at
        16  the business as a board member if you weren't getting
        17  these monthly financials and narratives?
        18      A.   For one thing, Vijay would keep us informed on
        19  the -- the highlights; and as I said, I would have
        20  frequent talks with Tom Wells and Gene Kenyon.
        21                MR. PRICE:  Okay.  Let's take a lunch
        22  break.
        23                MR. RUOCCO:  Sure.
        24                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 12:22 p.m.
        25  We're off the record.
  00107:01                (Lunch recess taken from 12:22 p.m. to
        02  1:03 p.m.)
        03                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 1:03 p.m.,
        04  and we're back on the record beginning media No. 4.
        05                (Exhibit 16 marked.)
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Mr. Goradia, I'm going to hand
        07  you what I've marked as Exhibit 16 to your deposition.
        08                Can you identify this as an email from
        09  Rich Furlin to you and your brother dated December 11th,
        10  2013?
        11      A.   Yes.
        12      Q.   And the subject line is Lion cash call,
        13  correct?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   And it looks like Mr. Furlin is sending you and
        16  Vijay, as representatives of AFWest, a cash call notice
        17  related to a terminated employee.
        18                Does that look right?
        19      A.   Yes.
        20      Q.   And do you know whether or not AFWest
        21  contributed to this?
        22      A.   I don't recall.
        23      Q.   If you'll look at the first sentence of the
        24  second paragraph, it says, "Under the existing Lion loan
        25  agreements, the company can only make payments to
  00108:01  members for tax distributions."
        02                Did I read that correctly?
        03      A.   Yes.
        04      Q.   Is that the type of advice that we were talking
        05  about earlier that you relied upon Mr. Furlin for?
        06      A.   Well, again, you are asking me for an
        07  interpretation of this one line in this email; and I
        08  don't know what to make of it because --
        09      Q.   So you don't know whether that's true or not?
        10      A.   What is --
        11                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        12      A.   What is true or not?
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Was it true as of
        14  December 11th, 2013, that under the existing Lion loan
        15  agreements, the company could only make payments to
        16  members for tax distributions?
        17      A.   I do not know.
        18      Q.   And so earlier in the morning when we were
        19  talking about how do you know if the board is acting in
        20  compliance with the LLC agreement and other agreements,
        21  I thought you said that you relied upon Mr. Furlin and
        22  Wells and Kenyon for that advice.
        23                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        24      A.   Okay.  If that's what I testified, then yes.
        25      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  And so were -- would you
  00109:01  -- is this the kind of statement that you would rely
        02  upon from Mr. Furlin about whether or not the company
        03  could or couldn't do something consistent with its loan
        04  agreements?
        05      A.   It depends.  If I had any concerns, I might
        06  have asked for further clarification from him or others.
        07      Q.   Do you remember the summer of 2014 an issue
        08  coming up where Bank of America wanted the term loan of
        09  the company reduced by 35 million?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   I do not recall the specifics, but I know that
        12  Lion was facing some issues and was perhaps close to
        13  violating its covenants with the lenders.
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And how did you learn about
        15  that?
        16      A.   I don't remember.  It may have been from Tom
        17  Wells or Gene Kenyon or all of them.
        18      Q.   There was not a formal board meeting of Lion
        19  about the bank covenant issue, was there?
        20      A.   I don't recall.
        21      Q.   There was not a board meeting at which various
        22  options for the company to solve the potential bank
        23  covenant issue were presented, were there?
        24      A.   I do not recall.
        25      Q.   Did you ever ask anyone what the options were
  00110:01  to solve the potential bank covenant issue?
        02      A.   As I said, I recall there were a number of
        03  discussions that were had that that happened.
        04      Q.   Were those initiated by you or Mr. Wells?
        05      A.   That, I don't recall.
        06      Q.   Were you involved in any possible solutions or
        07  pursuing negotiations for solutions to the bank covenant
        08  issue?
        09                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        10      A.   Involved as in was I directly negotiating with
        11  the banks?  No.  But was I involved or did I voice my
        12  opinions, then yes.
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  What were your opinions?
        14      A.   Oh, I don't recall right now.
        15      Q.   You don't recall what opinions you had about
        16  what should be done?
        17      A.   Correct.
        18      Q.   What did you think about the idea of
        19  withholding tax distributions?
        20      A.   The idea of what?
        21      Q.   What did you think about the idea of
        22  withholding tax distributions to solve the $35 million
        23  problem?
        24      A.   I don't know what you're referring to.
        25      Q.   That option was never presented to you?
  00111:01                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        02      A.   Not that I recall.
        03      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  What did you think about
        04  the idea of solving the $35 million problem with Bank of
        05  America by getting sub debt?
        06      A.   Again, I do not recall the specifics; but I
        07  believe sub debt was probably one of the options
        08  considered.
        09      Q.   And were you involved at all in the
        10  negotiations to try to get sub debt?
        11      A.   No.
        12      Q.   We talked a lot this morning about the various
        13  companies and investments that you and your brother
        14  have.
        15                Have there been instances over the years
        16  where one company in which you have invested loans money
        17  to another company in which you have invested?
        18      A.   I cannot remember a specific example.
        19      Q.   Okay.  You're not aware of -- of what I'll call
        20  intercompany loans between various Goradia-controlled
        21  entities?
        22      A.   Not that I can recall.
        23      Q.   You don't recall that, for example, Gorvest has
        24  loaned money in the past to Haverhill Chemicals?
        25                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
  00112:01      A.   Again, I don't recall.
        02      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You don't recall anything about
        03  the Gorvest loan to Haverhill Chemicals?
        04                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        05      A.   I think I already answered that I don't recall,
        06  no.
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I'm being clear.  You literally
        08  don't recall anything about that?
        09                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        10      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Including whether or not it
        11  even occurred?
        12      A.   Yes, I don't recall.
        13                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  All right.  So you weren't
        15  involved in the decision for Gorvest to loan money to
        16  Haverhill?
        17                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        18      A.   I may have been involved.
        19      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You weren't involved in coming
        20  up with what the terms were?
        21                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        22      A.   Again, I don't recall, but I may have been
        23  involved.
        24      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You don't remember why Gorvest
        25  might have loaned money to Haverhill?
  00113:01                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        02      A.   Again, as I said, I do not recall that Gorvest
        03  loaned money to Haverhill.  But I -- I can recall that
        04  Haverhill had faced financial difficulties.
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So tell me what you remember
        06  about how the bank covenant problem with Bank of America
        07  was resolved.
        08      A.   As I recall, there was a -- a fresh equity
        09  infusion.
        10      Q.   And when did that happen?
        11      A.   That, I don't remember.
        12      Q.   And who did it?
        13      A.   Who did it as in physically --
        14      Q.   Who made --
        15      A.   -- took the money to Bank of --
        16      Q.   Who made the equity infusion?
        17      A.   That was AFWest and Gorvest, I believe.
        18      Q.   Was it both of them?
        19      A.   Possibly.
        20      Q.   You don't remember?
        21      A.   No.
        22      Q.   Who was responsible for deciding that AFWest
        23  and Gorvest would give 35 million to Lion?
        24      A.   As I recall, the situation was very fluid, and
        25  a -- a prompt decision had to be made.  And I believe
  00114:01  that Vijay and I, along with Tom Wells and Gene, had
        02  discussed about it.  And the -- the idea was to make a
        03  capital call, but that there was not enough time.  And
        04  so we basically provided the rescue money.
        05      Q.   And what role did Tom and Gene have at AFWest?
        06      A.   They don't have any role.
        07      Q.   What role do Tom and Gene have at Gorvest?
        08      A.   They don't have any.
        09      Q.   Did AFWest have $35 million to put into Lion?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   I don't recall.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Where did the 35 million that
        13  AFWest put into Lion come from?
        14      A.   I don't recall now, but it must have come
        15  from -- from the members of AFWest.
        16      Q.   Who were the members of AFWest?
        17      A.   I think we discussed that earlier this morning.
        18  So it was Vijay Goradia, myself and some of our family
        19  trusts.
        20      Q.   And so how did --
        21      A.   And -- and Mr. Jain.
        22      Q.   Those are actually the members of Gorvest,
        23  correct?
        24      A.   And AFWest.
        25      Q.   Isn't it -- isn't it true that the money was
  00115:01  actually raised by Gorvest?
        02      A.   That is possible.
        03      Q.   And that Gorvest gave the money to AFWest?
        04      A.   Maybe.
        05      Q.   How would Gorvest give $35 million to AFWest?
        06  How would that work?
        07                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        08      A.   How does that -- I don't understand how -- how
        09  does that work.
        10      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Well, they're two different
        11  legal entities, correct?
        12      A.   Yes.
        13      Q.   Right?  Like I can sue AFWest or I could sue
        14  Gorvest and they're different, right?
        15      A.   Yes.
        16      Q.   So how does Gorvest get 35 million over to
        17  AFWest?
        18      A.   Because of the same shareholders or majority of
        19  the share -- shareholders.
        20      Q.   But on what -- what were the terms of Gorvest
        21  giving 35 million to AFWest?
        22      A.   I do not recall.
        23      Q.   Was it a loan?
        24      A.   I don't recall.
        25      Q.   Was it a gift?
  00116:01      A.   Don't recall.
        02      Q.   Did you ever talk to Porter & Hedges about how
        03  to vote on the consents for the capital calls?
        04      A.   I did not.
        05      Q.   Did anyone ever tell you what Porter & Hedges'
        06  advice was as to the various written consents related to
        07  the capital calls?
        08      A.   I don't recall.
        09      Q.   Did you ever talk to Porter & Hedges about any
        10  of the valuations you saw?
        11      A.   No.
        12      Q.   Did you ever talk to any lawyers about any vote
        13  you made in 2014 as a board member?
        14      A.   I don't recall.
        15      Q.   Did you ever talk to any lawyer about any
        16  valuation that you say you saw?
        17      A.   I do not recall.
        18      Q.   How did Gorvest get any additional units or
        19  shares of Lion if the money came from AFWest?
        20      A.   I don't know the details.
        21      Q.   Do you know that Gorvest did, in fact, get
        22  additional common sharing ratio as a result of the
        23  capital calls?
        24      A.   I don't know.
        25      Q.   You don't even know whether that happened?
  00117:01      A.   No.
        02      Q.   Why would Gorvest get additional common sharing
        03  ratio if it didn't put in any money?
        04                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        05      A.   I don't know.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Did you know when you voted for
        07  the capital calls that Gorvest was going to get
        08  additional units without putting in any money?
        09                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        10      A.   I do not recall as to what transpired at that
        11  time.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Did you ever talk to Bank of
        13  America directly about the covenant issue?
        14      A.   No.
        15      Q.   Now, Bank of America was also the lender for
        16  Haverhill Chemicals, correct?
        17      A.   I believe so.
        18      Q.   And Haverhill Chemicals was another Goradia
        19  family investment in the chemical business; is that
        20  right?
        21      A.   Yes.
        22      Q.   And Goradia Cap -- I'm sorry, Haverhill was
        23  having financial difficulties in 2014 as well, right?
        24      A.   I believe so.
        25      Q.   Was the problems that Bank of America was
  00118:01  having with the Haverhill credit impacting how they were
        02  treating Lion in 2014?
        03      A.   I have no reason to believe that.
        04      Q.   You don't think Bank of America wanted to lower
        05  its exposure to Goradia writ large in 2014?
        06      A.   I don't know what you mean by Goradia writ
        07  large.  If you would explain.
        08      Q.   Okay.  The various Goradia controlled
        09  businesses that they had loans to.
        10      A.   I don't believe they had any concerns.
        11      Q.   Is -- is Bank of America still the Goradia
        12  family's bank?
        13                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        14      A.   I -- I don't understand.
        15      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do -- do any Goradia
        16  family-controlled businesses have loans with Bank of
        17  America today?
        18      A.   Yes.
        19      Q.   Do you as a board member understand how Lion
        20  can raise equity?
        21      A.   Do I as a board member -- I don't -- what does
        22  that mean?
        23      Q.   Do you have an understanding as to how Lion can
        24  raise equity under the LLC agreement?
        25      A.   I don't know the specific clauses in the LLC
  00119:01  agreement for equity raise.
        02      Q.   Do you know that the only way for the company
        03  to raise equity is through a capital call?
        04                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        05      A.   I don't know.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Has anyone ever told you that
        07  the only way for the company to raise equity is through
        08  a capital call?
        09      A.   I don't recall.
        10      Q.   You do know that when AFWest sent the
        11  $35 million to Lion, that no capital call had been made,
        12  correct?
        13      A.   Yes.
        14      Q.   So how was that payment for equity if there had
        15  been no capital call?
        16      A.   That is the only reason we would transfer the
        17  money.  Otherwise, why would we?
        18      Q.   I'm sorry.  Say that again.
        19      A.   That is the only reason we would transfer the
        20  money, advance the money to Lion.
        21      Q.   You're saying AFWest would only advance the
        22  money if it got equity?
        23      A.   Yes.
        24      Q.   And who's -- who had those discussions?
        25      A.   I don't recall specifically, but we had
  00120:01  discussions about it.
        02      Q.   And so this is -- this is you and Vijay on
        03  behalf of AFWest talking to you and Vijay on behalf of
        04  Lion?
        05                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        06      A.   I don't understand you and Vijay on behalf of
        07  AFWest and you and Vijay on behalf of Lion.
        08      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Who -- who negotiated the terms
        09  of the 35 million being given as equity in June of 2014?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Objection to form.
        11      A.   Well, as I said, Lion was facing a serious
        12  financial issue with banks.  Lion would have been in
        13  violation of its covenants with the banks, and the banks
        14  could have foreclosed on Lion.  And the situation was
        15  very fluid, and so we discussed internally that we
        16  needed to inject new equity into Lion.  And -- and
        17  that's what we did.
        18                And there wasn't enough time to have a
        19  proper capital call.  And so the idea was, okay, we go
        20  ahead and inject the equity, save the company for the
        21  benefit of all shareholders, and then issue the capital
        22  call.
        23      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  But, Mr. Goradia, I understand
        24  that your testimony is that when the money went in from
        25  AFWest to Lion, your position is that that was for
  00121:01  equity, correct?  That's your position?
        02      A.   Yes.  It -- it was an advance that we had made
        03  to Lion to rescue Lion.  And in return, we would get new
        04  equity, yes.
        05      Q.   Well, so was it an advance or was it for
        06  equity?
        07                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        08      A.   It was an advance for equity.
        09      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So when were you going -- when
        10  were you supposed to get the equity?
        11      A.   As soon as we would issue the capital call.
        12      Q.   So you didn't -- so when you -- just so I'm
        13  clear.  So when you -- when AFWest sent the money on
        14  June 27th, 2014, there was no expectation to get equity
        15  that day?
        16                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        17      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Correct?
        18      A.   That day?  Probably not.
        19      Q.   Okay.  You didn't -- if I bought 100 shares of
        20  IBM today, I expect to get my 100 shares of IBM today,
        21  right?
        22      A.   IBM is a public company, Lion is not.  There's
        23  a big difference.
        24      Q.   I understand.
        25                I'm simply saying you knew that when you
  00122:01  were sending the 35 -- when AFWest sent the 35 million
        02  on June 27th, that you were not on June 27th getting any
        03  equity, correct?
        04      A.   Correct.
        05      Q.   And, in fact, there was a plan to potentially
        06  never get any equity, correct?
        07      A.   What plan are you referring to?
        08      Q.   To have the 35 million taken out by sub debt.
        09      A.   Where is this plan?
        10      Q.   Did you not talk to Tom Wells about that?
        11      A.   About not getting equity for the 35 million?
        12  No.
        13      Q.   Correct.  You're not aware that -- that on
        14  June 27th, that the plan was that the money was not
        15  going to stay in the company but was going to get repaid
        16  when the company got sub debt?  You've never heard that?
        17                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        18      A.   I don't recall that.
        19      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  That's not something Tom Wells
        20  told you?
        21                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        22      A.   As I said, I don't recall it.
        23      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  That's not something that Vijay
        24  told you?
        25                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
  00123:01      A.   I don't recall it.
        02      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So what were the terms on which
        03  AFWest was to get equity?
        04      A.   I don't know what the terms were.  As I said,
        05  the situation was extremely fluid; and this was to
        06  rescue the company on behalf of all the shareholders.
        07      Q.   So the idea was that -- that the board, you and
        08  Vijay and Wells and Kenyon and Swatantra, would make up
        09  the terms later?
        10      A.   Make up has a negative connotation.  So if
        11  that's what you're implying, then no.
        12      Q.   What would you -- what would you like to say?
        13  That the terms would be determined later?  How would you
        14  characterize it?
        15      A.   Characterize what?
        16      Q.   Characterize how the terms of the equity
        17  advance that you say occurred on June 27th were going to
        18  be determined.
        19      A.   I do not recall what was contemplated at that
        20  -- that point.  All I recall is the fact that Lion was
        21  in serious financial difficulty and would be in
        22  violation of its covenants with the bank and that there
        23  was a necessity to infuse significant new capital --
        24      Q.   And so A --
        25      A.   -- to save Lion.
  00124:01      Q.   And so AFWest loaned $35 million to Lion?
        02      A.   AFWest never loaned Lion Copolymer.  AFWest
        03  provided an advance and expected to get new equity.
        04      Q.   Do you know what the LLC agreement says about
        05  advances?
        06      A.   If you allow me to read it, I can read it for
        07  you.
        08      Q.   Why don't you turn -- turn to Exhibit 5, the
        09  agreement, and turn to page 28.  Do you see Article 5,
        10  capital contributions?
        11      A.   Yes.
        12      Q.   And then it says, "5.01, capital contributions;
        13  member loans," correct?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   Let's go to 5.01(d) on page 30.  And 5.01(d) on
        16  page 30 says, "Any member that agrees to do so may,
        17  subject to section 7.01(w)(vi) and the prior written
        18  consent of AFWest, advance (as a loan and not as a
        19  capital contribution) monies to or on behalf of the
        20  company on such terms as such member and the board
        21  mutually agree."
        22                Did I read that correctly?
        23      A.   Yes.
        24      Q.   Does that refresh your recollection that the
        25  board -- that the LLC agreement states that advances
  00125:01  made by members to the company are as loans and not as
        02  capital contributions?
        03                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        04      A.   You're asking me to interpret again a sentence
        05  from a clause of a very complex document; and I'm sorry,
        06  I'm unable to do that.
        07      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  There were no terms agreed to
        08  by AFWest and the company on June 27th when the money
        09  was advanced, correct?
        10      A.   I don't know.
        11      Q.   Wouldn't you know as a member of AFWest?
        12      A.   As I said, I do not recall.  At that time, the
        13  situation was dire, and action had to be taken.  And I
        14  do not recall all of the discussions and what was
        15  agreed.
        16      Q.   The truth of the matter is there were no terms,
        17  there was no agreement between the company and AFWest as
        18  to the terms of that advance, correct?
        19      A.   You are saying the truth of the matter is.  You
        20  were not there, and you are saying the truth of the
        21  matter is.  How do you know the truth of the matter?
        22      Q.   Well, I've never seen any terms.
        23      A.   That doesn't make it true.
        24      Q.   So what were the terms?
        25      A.   I don't know.
  00126:01      Q.   Who would --
        02      A.   I've already told you that.
        03      Q.   Who would know if not you?
        04      A.   If not me, there are a number of people.
        05      Q.   Who would know?
        06      A.   It may be Vijay; it may be Tom Wells; it may be
        07  Gene; it may be all of them.
        08      Q.   How would Tom Wells know anything about a deal
        09  that AFWest did since he doesn't have anything to do
        10  with AFWest?
        11                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        12      A.   Both Tom and Gene Kenyon were involved in
        13  resolving a problem for Lion, and so they would know.
        14      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  This is about the terms on
        15  which AFWest sent $35 million to Lion.  I would think
        16  the people that would know that would be the members of
        17  AFWest, correct?
        18                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        19      A.   Along with others.
        20      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And the only members of AFWest
        21  that we've talked about are you and Vijay, correct?
        22      A.   That is your recollection.  I think I talked to
        23  you about members being Swatantra Jain and the -- the
        24  trust of our children as well.
        25      Q.   Okay.  So who do I need to talk to at the trust
  00127:01  to find out if they might know the terms?
        02      A.   I will have to find out who the trustees are.
        03      Q.   Are the -- should I talk to the trustees to
        04  find out whether they know the terms on which AFWest
        05  sent 35 million to Lion?
        06      A.   I'm sure you'll talk to whomever you want, Mr.
        07  Price.
        08      Q.   Was there an agreement between the company and
        09  AFWest on June 27th that AFWest would receive a
        10  10 percent return annualized monthly on those monies?
        11      A.   I do not recall.
        12      Q.   Was there an agreement between the company and
        13  AFWest on June 27th when AFWest sent the money in that
        14  AFWest would get a return on its capital before other
        15  distributions were made to shareholders --
        16                MR. RUOCCO:  Object.
        17      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  -- and unit holders?
        18                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        19      A.   I don't know.
        20      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Was there an agreement on
        21  June 27th, 2014, when the 35 million was wired from
        22  AFWest to the company the amount that AFWest's common
        23  sharing ratio would increase as a result of this
        24  advance?
        25                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
  00128:01      A.   I don't recall.
        02      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Those terms all came later,
        03  correct?
        04      A.   If I didn't recall if the terms were there,
        05  then I don't recall when they came.
        06      Q.   Do you think it's good faith to change the
        07  terms of the equity after you put in the equity?
        08                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        09      A.   I think it's very good faith to save a company
        10  that would have gone bankrupt and all shareholders would
        11  have lost all their equity.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you think it's good faith to
        13  change the terms after the fact and make them better for
        14  AFWest?
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   I think it's very good faith to act responsibly
        17  in trying to protect the equity of all equity holders.
        18      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Have you ever had investments
        19  where you got to set the terms of your investment months
        20  after you made the investment?
        21      A.   I don't know.
        22      Q.   It makes it a lot easier to make money, doesn't
        23  it?
        24                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        25      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  What was the value of the
  00129:01  company on June 27th, 2014?
        02      A.   I don't know in that situation how we would
        03  determine the value of the company.
        04      Q.   As a member of AFWest with duties and
        05  obligations to the other members of AFWest, shouldn't
        06  you have known the value of Lion since you were,
        07  according to you, investing 35 million into it at the
        08  time?
        09                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        10      A.   I was not involved in the day-to-day operations
        11  of Lion.  I had some idea about Lion facing financial
        12  difficulty.  And a value of Lion would have been
        13  determined -- appropriate person to determine would be
        14  Vijay Goradia.
        15      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  What kind of equity was AFWest
        16  supposed to get -- well, let me strike that.
        17                What was AFWest's understanding of the
        18  type of equity it was going to get when it sent the
        19  35 million on June 27th?
        20                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        21      A.   I don't recall precisely.  What I do recall is
        22  asking the question as to why we were putting up so much
        23  money and asking about the contributions from the other
        24  equity holders.
        25      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  What was your understanding of
  00130:01  how much per unit AFWest was paying on June 27th?
        02      A.   Sorry?
        03      Q.   What was your understanding of how much AFWest
        04  was going to pay per unit for the equity on June 27th?
        05      A.   I don't recall.
        06      Q.   Were -- was your understanding that AFWest on
        07  June 27th when it wired the money was getting Class
        08  1 units?
        09      A.   I don't know.
        10      Q.   Was your understanding on June 27th when AFWest
        11  wired the money that it was getting Class 2 units?
        12                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        13      A.   As I have said before and I repeat, that this
        14  is from 2014, and I do not recall the specifics.
        15      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Was it your understanding that
        16  AFWest was going to get Class 3 units?
        17      A.   I don't know.
        18      Q.   What about Class 4?
        19      A.   I don't know.
        20      Q.   Or Class 5?
        21      A.   I don't know.
        22      Q.   Was it your understanding that there was going
        23  to be a preferred return associated with the equity?
        24      A.   I believe that was part of the discussion that
        25  I had with Vijay in that we were injecting so much money
  00131:01  and putting our money at risk and that there should be
        02  some preference.
        03      Q.   And so you and Vijay talked prior to the money
        04  going in on June 27th about getting a preferred return
        05  for putting in the money?
        06                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        07      A.   I --
        08      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Is that your testimony?
        09      A.   I -- I don't know what we precisely discussed,
        10  was it 1 hour before, two days before or an hour later.
        11      Q.   Could it have been two weeks later?
        12      A.   I don't think so.
        13      Q.   Okay.  So somewhere around -- your recollection
        14  is that somewhere around the time of June 27th, 2014,
        15  when AFWest was wiring the money, that you and Vijay
        16  talked about how Lion needed to give AFWest a preferred
        17  return?
        18                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        19      A.   Again, you're asking for specifics; and I
        20  cannot remember the specifics.  But as I said, I had
        21  expressed concern that we were putting a lot of our
        22  money at risk, and that there should be some advantage
        23  that we get for that.
        24      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  An advantage meaning a
        25  preferred return, correct?
  00132:01      A.   As I said, I do not recall the specifics.
        02      Q.   Was anyone else involved in the discussions of
        03  ensuring that AFWest received this advantage other than
        04  you and your brother?
        05      A.   I -- it's possible that Swatantra Jain was in
        06  that discussion.
        07      Q.   Anyone else you think might have been involved
        08  in that discussion about the advantage needing to go to
        09  AFWest as a result of the transfer of the 35 million?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   I don't recall.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Have you ever had a valuation
        13  done of AFWest?
        14      A.   I don't recall.
        15      Q.   Have you ever had a valuation done of Gorvest?
        16      A.   I don't recall, but it's possible for estate
        17  planning reasons.
        18      Q.   Okay.
        19                (Exhibit 17 marked.)
        20      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Let's look at Exhibit 17.  Give
        21  you a moment to look at that.
        22      A.   Okay.
        23      Q.   Have you seen this document before?
        24      A.   I may have.
        25      Q.   Okay.  I will -- I will represent to you that
  00133:01  your -- your brother indicated that this was done for
        02  estate planning purposes valuing Gorvest's interests in
        03  Lion, okay?
        04      A.   Okay.
        05      Q.   Seeing as how you also own part of Gorvest, I
        06  wondered whether this was also used by you for estate
        07  planning purposes.  In other words, did you two both go
        08  hire Stout to perform this so you could both use it for
        09  estate planning purposes?
        10      A.   I'm -- I'm sure it was used by my advisors for
        11  estate planning purposes.
        12      Q.   I'm sorry, say that again.
        13      A.   I'm sure it was used by my advisors for estate
        14  planning purposes.
        15      Q.   Okay.  And you're sure of that?
        16      A.   Yes.
        17      Q.   All right.  Can you turn to the last page,
        18  please?
        19                Well, before you do that, were you happy
        20  with this report?
        21      A.   I don't know if I was happy or unhappy or
        22  neutral.
        23      Q.   Okay.  I mean, it appears to be fairly
        24  comprehensive.  Do you agree?
        25      A.   Well, it's a long report.
  00134:01      Q.   Okay.  And you like Stout, Risius & Ross,
        02  right?  You think they're good?
        03      A.   I have no opinion.
        04      Q.   Okay.  You -- you didn't hire them because you
        05  thought they were bad, right?
        06      A.   I think we probably hired them on advice of our
        07  advisors.
        08      Q.   Okay.  Who you trust?
        09      A.   Right.
        10      Q.   And you have no reason to believe that Stout
        11  did a bad job in this report, correct?
        12      A.   I have no reason to believe they did a bad job
        13  for the purpose that it was required.
        14      Q.   Right.  And, in fact, you used it for the
        15  purpose that you sought it, which was estate planning
        16  purposes, right?
        17      A.   Right.
        18      Q.   Okay.  Let's turn to the last page.  So the
        19  conclusion of the report, Mr. Goradia, is that the fair
        20  market value as of April 29, 2013, of Gorvest's
        21  controlling membership interest in Lion was 204,372,000,
        22  correct?
        23      A.   That's their opinion.
        24      Q.   And if you look at the previous page, do you
        25  see the middle of the -- the middle of the page
  00135:01  indicated controlling equity value income approach on
        02  page 53?
        03      A.   Yes.
        04      Q.   Do you see there in the middle of the
        05  paragraph, Stout, Risius & Ross states that as of
        06  April 29th, 2013, the enterprise value of the company
        07  was 654.7 million.
        08                Do you see that?
        09      A.   Yes.
        10      Q.   And did you receive and review this report
        11  around the time that it came out?
        12      A.   I don't recall.
        13      Q.   Would it have been your practice to review
        14  something like this, having paid for it to be done?
        15      A.   I have so many documents coming across, so I
        16  may have; and I may have missed it, also.
        17      Q.   Have you ever had any other valuations of
        18  AFWest or Gorvest done for any purpose?
        19      A.   We may have, again, for estate planning
        20  reasons.
        21      Q.   But for -- let's go back to this Stout one that
        22  you had done for estate planning purposes.  Why did you
        23  hire Stout to do it?
        24      A.   I think I already stated that it was probably
        25  on the advice of our advisors.
  00136:01      Q.   And by advice of your advisors, what do you
        02  mean?
        03      A.   Estate planning advisors.
        04      Q.   And your -- you -- and your estate planning
        05  advisors advised you to hire an independent third party?
        06      A.   Again, I -- sorry.
        07                MR. RUOCCO:  To the extent you're going to
        08  get into stuff with trust or estate's lawyers, just
        09  don't disclose the substance of any conversations about
        10  legal issues with trust and estate's lawyers.
        11      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Did your -- did your -- did
        12  your advisors tell you that we should get a third --
        13  independent third party to do a valuation?
        14      A.   I don't recall what they advised at that time.
        15      Q.   Why didn't you use Rich Furlin?
        16      A.   I -- I repeat, we must have retained them on
        17  advice of our advisors.
        18      Q.   Do you think it would have been a good idea for
        19  estate planning purposes to use Rich Furlin to value
        20  Gorvest's interests?
        21      A.   It depends on the purpose.
        22      Q.   Do you think it would have been a good idea for
        23  estate planning purposes to use Vijay to come up with a
        24  fair market value?
        25      A.   Again, it depends on the purpose and objective.
  00137:01      Q.   Do you think the IRS would accept Vijay doing a
        02  fair market value for your estate planning purposes?
        03      A.   I think we established that I'm neither an
        04  accountant nor a tax expert.  So I wouldn't know what
        05  the IRS would or would not accept.
        06      Q.   Would you feel comfortable presenting something
        07  to the IRS based upon -- for your estate planning
        08  purposes based upon a Vijay valuation?
        09      A.   I do not present anything to the IRS.  It is my
        10  advisors who do representation, and they determine what
        11  is appropriate.
        12      Q.   Would you think it's appropriate to present to
        13  the IRS a valuation that you had done of your own
        14  assets?
        15      A.   It would depend on what my tax advisors tell
        16  me.
        17      Q.   What about a bank, do you think a bank would
        18  accept you telling them what your own assets were worth?
        19      A.   Yes, they do accept it.
        20      Q.   And do you think the IRS would accept you
        21  telling --
        22      A.   I think I'll repeat my answer on that as same.
        23      Q.   Do you remember that one of the options
        24  considered to resolve the bank covenant issue was to
        25  require the members of Lion to return prior
  00138:01  distributions or face a penalty?
        02      A.   I do not recall the specifics, but I recall
        03  that there was some discussion along those lines.
        04      Q.   Is it your understanding that that did or did
        05  not ever happen?
        06      A.   It is my understanding that it did not happen.
        07      Q.   All right.  And that -- and that it was never
        08  implemented?
        09      A.   What was --
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   -- never implemented?
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  That the return of
        13  distributions or be penalized plan was never
        14  implemented?
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   As -- I -- I think that the idea was probably
        17  rejected as far as I know.
        18      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  All right.  And so do you know
        19  why it didn't happen?
        20      A.   As far as I recall, it was the De Leeuw group
        21  that had some reservation about it or opposed it.
        22      Q.   And so to be clear, we talked -- we spent a
        23  long time talking about the 35 million and how and why
        24  it went in on June 27th, right?  We've been over that a
        25  fair amount this afternoon, right?
  00139:01      A.   Yes.
        02                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        03      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I just want to be clear.  You
        04  do not believe that the 35 million was wired by AFWest
        05  to the company pursuant to the return of distributions
        06  option?
        07      A.   As I stated, I think quite clearly, that the 35
        08  million was an advance.  It was an advance for equity.
        09      Q.   No.  I understand.  But I'm trying to decide --
        10  I'm trying to make sure I understand what you agree it
        11  was not.
        12                It was not 35 million wired by AFWest to
        13  Lion pursuant to the return of distributions or
        14  everybody gets penalized strategy?
        15                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        16      A.   And I repeat for your understanding, that Lion
        17  was in very serious financial situation.  It was going
        18  to be in violation of its covenants and the bank might
        19  have foreclosed on their loans and put Lion in
        20  bankruptcy and so the injection was a rescue.
        21      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And it was not pursuant to --
        22  to the --
        23      A.   I don't know what it was not.  I know what it
        24  was, and that's what I've stated now numerous times,
        25  so...
  00140:01      Q.   Well, but you haven't answered my question.  My
        02  question was that the penal -- that the return of
        03  distributions or be penalized strategy to your
        04  understanding was not implemented, correct?
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   And I'm simply saying, so let's just be clear,
        07  since it wasn't implemented, that 35 million on
        08  June 27th was not pursuant to the return of
        09  distributions or get penalized strategy?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Correct?
        12      A.   I'm telling you a positive answer and you want
        13  me to answer on a negative question and I'm telling you
        14  what it was.  What it was not, it's up to you to
        15  determine.
        16      Q.   So it might have been part of the return of
        17  distributions or get penalized?
        18      A.   It was an advance.  It was a capital injection.
        19      Q.   Tell me about when you first learned of the
        20  Ashland transaction.
        21      A.   I don't know the precise date.
        22                MR. RUOCCO:  Counsel, we've been going for
        23  about an hour, if this is a good time for a break.
        24                MR. PRICE:  Yeah.  Give me just one second
        25  and we'll --
  00141:01                (Exhibit 18 marked.)
        02      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I've handed you Exhibit 18.
        03      A.   Okay.
        04      Q.   This is an email from your brother to you and
        05  to Swatantra Jain on November 24th, 2014, correct?
        06      A.   Yes.
        07      Q.   The subject line says Lion hyphen or
        08  Lion/Ashland acquisition, correct?
        09      A.   Yes.
        10      Q.   And your brother tells you and Swatantra that
        11  "we've entered into a contract to buy this business."
        12                Do you see that?
        13      A.   Yes.
        14      Q.   Is this when you learned of the Ashland
        15  acquisition?
        16      A.   No.
        17      Q.   So your testimony is that your brother is
        18  simply telling you a bunch of stuff that you already
        19  knew?
        20                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        21      A.   I knew that we were participating in the
        22  acquisition of Ashland prior to this email.
        23      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  But did you know that a
        24  contract had been signed prior to this email?
        25      A.   No.
  00142:01      Q.   Did you know what the purchase price was prior
        02  to this email?
        03      A.   I had a fair idea, yes.
        04      Q.   Did you know that the purchase price was 195
        05  prior to this email?
        06      A.   I think that was an indicated offer.
        07      Q.   Did you know that 20 million of escrow had
        08  already been put in place prior to this email?
        09      A.   I don't recall.
        10      Q.   You see down at the bottom where your brother
        11  says, "We have already put in 20.  We will need to wire
        12  in 28 by Wednesday."
        13                Do you see that?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   So again, my question is:  Prior to this email,
        16  did you know that you had already put in 20 million?
        17      A.   And again, my answer is I do not recall.
        18      Q.   Do you know when the 20 went in?
        19      A.   I don't recall.
        20      Q.   Do you know who the "we" is?
        21      A.   It would be one of the -- I think it would have
        22  to be Lion.
        23      Q.   That Lion had put 20 million in escrow?
        24      A.   It would seem so.
        25      Q.   Where did Lion get the 20 million to put in
  00143:01  escrow?
        02      A.   I don't know.
        03      Q.   Isn't it true that actually AFWest put the 20
        04  million in escrow?
        05      A.   I don't know.
        06      Q.   You're not aware that AFWest again advanced the
        07  20 million for Lion?
        08      A.   As we sit here, I do not recall.
        09                MR. PRICE:  Okay.  Let's take a short
        10  break.
        11                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 2:01 p.m.
        12  We're off the record.
        13                (Recess taken from 2:01 p.m. to 2:09 p.m.)
        14                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 2:09 p.m.
        15  We're back on the record.
        16      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay, Mr. Goradia.  We've
        17  marked Exhibit 19 for you to your deposition.
        18                (Exhibit 19 marked.)
        19      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Give you a moment to take a
        20  look at that.  Are you ready?
        21      A.   No.
        22                Okay.
        23      Q.   Is this one of the documents you saw yesterday?
        24      A.   No.
        25      Q.   Do you recognize this document?
  00144:01      A.   It has my signature, so...
        02      Q.   Okay.  And it's got your signature, and then it
        03  says, "Hemant Goradia, member of board of directors
        04  AFWest Chemicals, Inc."
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   Excuse me.
        07      A.   Yes.
        08      Q.   At the top it says, "AFWest Chemicals, Ltd."
        09                Do you see that?
        10      A.   Yes.
        11      Q.   Is -- is AFWest Chemicals, is it an
        12  incorporated entity or is it limited?
        13      A.   I do not recall.
        14      Q.   And I think -- I can't remember what -- what
        15  the testimony was about your role, some of your roles at
        16  AFWest, but does this -- does this refresh your
        17  recollection that you are, in fact, a member of the
        18  board of directors of AFWest?
        19      A.   Well, again, I do not recall that AFWest has a
        20  board of directors, but I'm a member of AFWest.
        21      Q.   Okay.  Okay.  Why would you sign something as a
        22  member of the board of directors if you're not on the
        23  board?
        24      A.   Again, as I said, the situation was very fluid
        25  at the time, and there was no time to review every word
  00145:01  and every document.
        02      Q.   Okay.  And you -- you knew at the time you
        03  signed this that this was a document that was going to
        04  be given to third parties, correct?
        05      A.   I don't recall.
        06      Q.   You don't recall that this document was
        07  prepared so it could be given, say, to Bank of America?
        08      A.   I do not recall right now.
        09      Q.   You don't recall that this document was
        10  prepared so that it could be sent to Ernst & Young, the
        11  auditors?
        12      A.   I don't.
        13      Q.   Had you known that, would you have perhaps
        14  caught that member of the board of directors might not
        15  be right?
        16      A.   As I said, the situation was such that
        17  everything was happening and had to happen in a very
        18  short period of time.
        19      Q.   Okay.  And in the last paragraph of this letter
        20  which you signed and sent to Rich Furlin on April 30th,
        21  2014, you write, "As the majority shareholder, AFWest
        22  Chemicals, Ltd. agrees that if the refinancing is not
        23  completed, it will return its share of the required 35
        24  million in accordance with the terms of the agreement."
        25                And then it goes on.  It says, "It will
  00146:01  make additional equity contributions in accordance with
        02  the agreement to ensure that the company meets the
        03  requirement of the 35 million return of prior
        04  distributions."
        05                Did I read that correctly?
        06      A.   Yes.
        07      Q.   All right.  So before the break, we were
        08  talking about the return of distributions -- return of
        09  prior distributions plus a penalty option.
        10                This was obviously prepared in accordance
        11  with that, correct?
        12                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        13      A.   No.  I don't know that it was prepared in
        14  connection with that.
        15      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Well, that's -- that is what
        16  it's talking about, right?
        17      A.   That's what you are saying.  I don't know
        18  because it is referring to various documents here, and
        19  you are only showing me this document.
        20      Q.   But you wrote this.  This is your letter?
        21      A.   Along with what?  It says along with various
        22  agreements.
        23      Q.   Where are you reading?
        24      A.   "The second amended credit agreement between
        25  Lion Copolymers and Bank of America."
  00147:01      Q.   Okay.  This is your --
        02      A.   "Fourth amendment -- fourth amendment to the
        03  amended and restated limited liability company
        04  agreement" --
        05      Q.   Sir, this --
        06      A.   -- "ratified under the terms of the agreement
        07  on April 17th which was paid to the shareholders in
        08  March of 2013."
        09                So there are lots of things associated
        10  with this.
        11      Q.   With this --
        12      A.   In 2019 you are just showing me one page and
        13  asking me to then opine on, you know, what the
        14  agreement's about --
        15      Q.   I'm asking you --
        16      A.   -- without addressing everything else.
        17      Q.   I'm asking you to explain to the vice
        18  chancellor your letter that you wrote and signed.
        19      A.   And I --
        20                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        21      A.   Just by this letter, I cannot explain.
        22      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  All right.  So you can't
        23  explain what you meant by the requirement of the 35
        24  million return of prior distributions at the end of the
        25  letter?  You can't explain to the vice chancellor what
  00148:01  that meant, what you meant?
        02      A.   It would have to be associated with other
        03  documents.
        04      Q.   And so you would need to look at all those
        05  other documents to remember what you meant?
        06      A.   That and perhaps even talk to the people who
        07  were involved.
        08      Q.   Yeah.  Because you really didn't write this
        09  letter, right?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   It's not in my handwriting, no.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And well, you didn't type --
        13  sit it out and type at a computer, did you?
        14      A.   I don't believe so.
        15      Q.   Somebody prepared this letter for you to sign,
        16  correct?
        17      A.   I would think so.
        18      Q.   And someone told you to sign it, correct?
        19                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        20      A.   Nobody tells me to sign it.  They request me to
        21  sign it.
        22      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Someone requested for you to
        23  sign it, correct?
        24      A.   Probably.
        25      Q.   And you did?
  00149:01      A.   I did, and I wouldn't have just signed it
        02  blindly.  I would have asked questions, and I would have
        03  asked to see other documents.
        04      Q.   What other documents did you ask to see?
        05      A.   I don't recall.
        06      Q.   Who did you ask to see --
        07      A.   I don't recall.
        08      Q.   Who did you ask to provide you additional
        09  information?
        10      A.   I don't recall.
        11                (Exhibit 20 marked.)
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Can you turn -- I've handed you
        13  Exhibit 20.  It's a printout of an Excel spreadsheet.
        14  I'm going to ask you to turn about four or five pages
        15  in.  We're going to be looking for the page that at the
        16  top says "percentage of Ashland put into Lion," and then
        17  it's got August '14 and November '14.
        18      A.   Sorry.  Which page is it?
        19      Q.   We're looking for the page that's got an
        20  August '14 column and a November '14 column.
        21      A.   Okay.
        22      Q.   Okay.  And, Mr. Goradia, do you recognize this
        23  page of Exhibit 20 that we're looking at as the August
        24  and November capital call valuations?
        25      A.   By this page, I cannot tell.
  00150:01      Q.   Have you ever seen this page before?
        02      A.   I may have.
        03      Q.   Earlier today I believe you testified that you
        04  looked at and approved the August and November capital
        05  call valuations; is that correct?
        06      A.   As a board member, I would have.
        07      Q.   Okay.  And what we are looking at is, in fact,
        08  the August and November capital call valuations.
        09                And do you recognize them as such?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   I don't understand your question.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you recognize this page of
        13  Exhibit 20 as the August and November capital call
        14  valuations that you reviewed and approved?
        15      A.   Again, I'm confused with your question.  You
        16  know, to me recognized, do I recognize you.  I recognize
        17  -- I have never met you.  So do I recognize you from the
        18  past, no, I don't.  Tomorrow will I recognize you,
        19  probably, yes, because I met you.  So what do you mean
        20  by do I recognize this?
        21      Q.   Well, so we'll break it down.
        22      A.   Yeah, please.
        23      Q.   Have you ever seen Exhibit 20, the whole thing,
        24  before?
        25      A.   I don't recall.
  00151:01      Q.   Okay.  Have you ever seen this particular page
        02  before?
        03      A.   I don't recall.
        04      Q.   Your side of the case, your lawyers, Vijay in
        05  sworn testimony have said this is the November and
        06  August '14 capital call valuations.
        07      A.   I was not at Vijay's deposition, and I have not
        08  read his deposition.  So I don't know what he said and
        09  what he meant.
        10      Q.   And so my question to you is:  Do you recognize
        11  these as the August and November capital call valuations
        12  seeing as you claim to have reviewed and approved them
        13  back in 2014?
        14      A.   So I don't know if she can pull out my answer
        15  but I think what I said was, I do not recall the
        16  specifics but I do recall that I would have approved
        17  it.
        18      Q.   Okay.  So you've never seen this before?
        19      A.   I did not say that.  I say I do not recall.
        20      Q.   Okay.  When you -- so let's -- let's do it this
        21  way.  When you approved the August 2014 capital call
        22  back in 2014, did you know that the current EBITDA used
        23  by the company was $54,942,592?
        24      A.   Sitting here today, I do not recall what that
        25  number was in August or November of 2014.
  00152:01      Q.   Okay.  And so do you know what current EBITDA
        02  even means?
        03      A.   Generically?
        04      Q.   Do you know what -- when the company says
        05  current EBITDA 54,942,592, the number they used in the
        06  capital call valuation, what does current EBITDA mean?
        07  Where did they get that number?
        08      A.   I don't know.
        09      Q.   Is that last 12 months of EBITDA?
        10      A.   It could be last 12 months.  It could be the
        11  real EBITDA of the current year actual versus projected
        12  for the rest of the months.  I don't know.
        13      Q.   Could it be a normalized EBITDA?
        14      A.   I don't know.
        15      Q.   I mean, you're aware of the Williams
        16  interruption that was going on in 2014, correct?
        17      A.   Yes.
        18      Q.   And so do you know if this is a normalized
        19  EBITDA to adjust for Williams?
        20      A.   It was ongoing.  So I don't know how you
        21  normalize it.
        22      Q.   Okay.  You're saying you can only normalize it
        23  after the fact?
        24      A.   It would be very difficult not knowing when
        25  Williams was supposed to be back on stream.
  00153:01      Q.   Well, but to the extent -- to the extent that
        02  the Williams interruption had impacted months that had
        03  already occurred, you could normalize those prior
        04  months, right?
        05      A.   No.  I didn't normalize.  You would normalize
        06  when you know for a specific time frame that this is
        07  what occurred and it is contained within this time
        08  frame.
        09                With Williams, there was -- at that time
        10  nobody knew when they would be up and running again --
        11      Q.   Okay.
        12      A.   -- and so how long that situation would
        13  continue.
        14      Q.   Okay.  So current EBITDA could be last 12
        15  months?
        16      A.   In this context, I don't know.
        17      Q.   I'm just -- I'm just trying to understand what
        18  it could be.
        19      A.   Well, you're asking me to speculate.
        20      Q.   Well, do you think it would be unreasonable to
        21  use last 12 months?
        22      A.   I don't want to speculate.
        23      Q.   Would it be unreasonable to use projections?
        24      A.   I -- I cannot speculate.  Sorry.
        25      Q.   So you don't know where this number came from?
  00154:01      A.   Not specifically, no, sir.
        02      Q.   Did you -- did you know where this number came
        03  from back in 2014 when you approved it?
        04      A.   As I said, I cannot recall, no.
        05      Q.   Did you ask any questions about where the
        06  number came from at the time you approved it?
        07      A.   I cannot recall right now.
        08      Q.   There's a six EBITDA multiple.  What does that
        09  mean?
        10      A.   That's what it says, six, six months probably.
        11      Q.   Okay.  Where did that come from?
        12      A.   I believe that -- I don't know, but I believe
        13  it must have come from using a reasonable analysis of
        14  that multiple to utilize for these purposes.
        15      Q.   All right.  And were you involved in that
        16  analysis at all?
        17      A.   I was not.
        18      Q.   Okay.  Do you know who was?
        19      A.   I don't know specifically, but I believe it
        20  would have to be with Vijay doing it, you know, based on
        21  his experience over all of the industry and the Lion's
        22  performance over the years.
        23      Q.   And did you have any discussions with Vijay
        24  about his decision to use a six multiple?
        25      A.   We had a lot of discussions as it related to
  00155:01  Williams and its impact on Lion, and I did not -- do not
        02  recall specifically of using six multiple, but I do
        03  remember at that time that I felt that given that Lion
        04  was solely dependent on Williams for its feedstock
        05  supply, that Lion was a distressed asset.
        06      Q.   Mr. Goradia, my question is:  Did you have
        07  discussions with Vijay about his decision to use a six
        08  multiple?
        09      A.   And I said, I do not recall.
        10      Q.   Do you know what the source was for Vijay
        11  picking a six multiple?
        12      A.   No.
        13      Q.   Did he provide you any calculations on how he
        14  got to a six multiple?
        15      A.   I don't recall.
        16      Q.   Did you ask anyone to benchmark Vijay's six
        17  multiple?
        18                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        19      A.   As I said, I do not recall the six multiple.
        20  So how could I have asked someone to benchmark a six
        21  multiple.
        22      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So now you're saying you don't
        23  remember it even being a six multiple at the time?
        24      A.   You asked me that what was the basis of the six
        25  multiple, and I said I don't recall.
  00156:01      Q.   And then I said did you ask anyone to benchmark
        02  the six multiple.
        03      A.   No, I did not.
        04      Q.   Was Vijay's six multiple based upon public
        05  companies?
        06      A.   Publicly traded companies?
        07      Q.   Yes.
        08      A.   I don't know what it was based on.
        09      Q.   Did you ask him what it was based on?
        10      A.   I don't recall.
        11      Q.   Did you ask him if it was based on public
        12  companies?
        13      A.   I do not recall.
        14      Q.   Did you ask him if it was based on transactions
        15  or acquisitions that had actually occurred?
        16      A.   I'm sure with all his experience that he would
        17  have taken into account various transactions and also
        18  Lion's situation at the time which was -- which was in
        19  distress, serious distress.
        20      Q.   But you don't know whether he did or not?
        21      A.   I don't know.
        22      Q.   Multiples like this change over time, correct?
        23      A.   Yes.
        24      Q.   So then it comes -- so then the next line is
        25  "329,655,551."
  00157:01                Do you see that?
        02      A.   Sorry.  Which one?
        03      Q.   The next line on this chart, "329,655,551."
        04                Do you see that?
        05      A.   Yes, yes.
        06      Q.   What is your understanding of what that is?
        07      A.   I believe that would be the current EBITDA
        08  times six.
        09      Q.   Okay.  Is that the enterprise value?
        10      A.   It doesn't show here.
        11      Q.   Okay.  What is your understanding of what the
        12  enterprise value is as of August of '14?
        13      A.   I don't know.
        14      Q.   Did you think you needed to know that in order
        15  to approve the capital call?
        16      A.   At the time I'm sure.
        17      Q.   At the time you're sure you did know what the
        18  enterprise value was?
        19      A.   I'm sure I would have been told.
        20      Q.   And what -- what were you told?
        21      A.   I don't know.  I don't remember.
        22      Q.   Were you told that it was $330 million?
        23      A.   I don't remember.
        24      Q.   If you had been told that it was $330 million
        25  back in 2014, would that have shocked you?
  00158:01      A.   Again, you are going -- you're asking me to go
        02  back in time, and I don't know at the time.
        03      Q.   You had been told by your advisor Stout for
        04  estate planning purposes that 16 months before, the
        05  company was worth $650 million.
        06                Is your testimony that had you been told
        07  it was only worth 330, that you wouldn't have been
        08  shocked?
        09                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        10      A.   I don't know what I would have thought.  You're
        11  asking me to speculate.
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  What is -- do you see on here
        13  "35 million pre-equity"?
        14                Do you see that?
        15      A.   Yes.
        16      Q.   What is pre-equity?
        17      A.   That is prior to injection on the equity.
        18      Q.   But what is pre-equity?  Do you know what it
        19  is?
        20      A.   I don't -- I don't know what you're asking.
        21      Q.   Have you ever heard of an account or an
        22  accounting entry or a financial statement entry called
        23  pre-equity?
        24      A.   Yes.
        25      Q.   When have you heard of that?
  00159:01      A.   When we are looking at investments.
        02      Q.   Okay.  Who's "we"?
        03      A.   Me.
        04      Q.   Okay.  When you look at investments, you look
        05  at something called pre-equity?
        06      A.   Sometimes.
        07      Q.   And what is it?
        08      A.   A company that is trying to induce us to
        09  provide equity, then they show pre-equity valuation and
        10  post-equity valuation.
        11      Q.   No.  I understand a pre-equity valuation and a
        12  post-equity valuation.  I'm talking about something that
        13  appears on the debt side of the balance sheet called
        14  pre-equity.
        15                Do you know what that is?
        16      A.   As I said, I do not recall this document.  So I
        17  don't know what it is, but I would assume this was an
        18  advance that AFWest had made.
        19      Q.   The advance that is showing up as a debt on the
        20  balance sheet, correct?
        21                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        22      A.   I don't think it's showing up as debt.
        23      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  It's not?
        24      A.   I don't believe so.
        25      Q.   You don't think that 240 plus 7 plus 35, 282 of
  00160:01  debt?
        02                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        03      A.   That is not debt.  There was an advance made;
        04  and so when you are calculating, you have to account for
        05  it.  It doesn't just disappear.
        06      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So, but why is it appearing on
        07  the debt side of the ledger?
        08      A.   I am not an accountant, as I've already stated;
        09  and I don't know who prepared this document, so...
        10      Q.   Then do you see where it says, "Less legal and
        11  bankers' fees 12 million"?
        12      A.   Yes.
        13      Q.   Do you see that?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   Where did that come from?
        16      A.   I don't know.
        17      Q.   Did you review and approve that deduction for
        18  the August capital call?
        19      A.   As I said, as a board member, I would have
        20  looked at it and approved it.
        21      Q.   Are transaction costs typically subtracted from
        22  fair market value calculations?
        23      A.   It depends.
        24      Q.   Stout didn't deduct transaction costs from your
        25  valuation for estate planning purposes, did they?
  00161:01      A.   Stout was not anticipating any transaction.
        02      Q.   Was a transaction being anticipated here?
        03      A.   I don't know.
        04      Q.   Well, you approved the valuation.  Was a
        05  transaction being anticipated or not?
        06      A.   Well, there was -- you showed me some document
        07  that there was refinancing to be done with Bank of
        08  America.  So that would have been a transaction.
        09      Q.   And so this legal and bankers' fees of 12
        10  million relates to a refinancing transaction with Bank
        11  of America?
        12      A.   I've already told you, I don't know what this
        13  refers to.
        14      Q.   So let's talk about the questions for the
        15  November capital call, "Current EBITDA 53 million."
        16                Do you see that?
        17      A.   Yes.
        18      Q.   Same set of questions.  Do you know where that
        19  number came from?
        20      A.   No.
        21      Q.   Could it be last -- could it be last 12 months?
        22      A.   I don't know.
        23      Q.   Could it be some amount of actuals plus
        24  projections?
        25      A.   I do not know.
  00162:01      Q.   Did you know at the time that you approved the
        02  capital call in November of 2014?
        03      A.   I don't remember.
        04      Q.   Okay.  And the six EBITDA multiple, same set of
        05  questions, would your answers all be the same as to --
        06  as to the November capital call in that multiple and why
        07  you chose -- or why it was chosen and why you approved
        08  it?
        09      A.   Yes.
        10      Q.   All the answers would be the same?
        11      A.   The same.
        12                You find that humorous?
        13      Q.   No, I'm just trying -- no, I'm actually hoping
        14  we can expedite this a little bit.
        15      A.   Okay.
        16      Q.   It's actually -- none of this is really funny.
        17  But I'd like to go a little faster if we can, but I also
        18  don't want to miss something if you have a specific
        19  recollection of why you approved the November capital
        20  call.
        21      A.   Thank you.
        22      Q.   So the $318 million number, again, you don't
        23  know what that is other than it's 53 times six?
        24      A.   Correct.
        25      Q.   But you don't know what that's representing?
  00163:01      A.   The document doesn't state what it is.
        02      Q.   Right.  And you don't remember that, that that
        03  was the enterprise value presented to you as a board
        04  member in 2014?
        05      A.   I do not.
        06      Q.   Let's go down to "legal and bankers' fees."
        07  Again, the same series of questions for November of '14.
        08                Do you know why that was taken out?
        09      A.   Taken out?  It's here for November.
        10      Q.   Right.  But that's -- but that's being
        11  deducted --
        12      A.   Right.
        13      Q.   -- as part of the November capital call
        14  valuation.
        15                You understand that, right?
        16      A.   I -- I don't know specifically.  You know, it
        17  could be for all legal and bankers' fees anticipated for
        18  various things that were going on with Lion.
        19      Q.   You understand, do you not, that in both the
        20  August and November capital calls that these $12 million
        21  figures were taken out to reduce the value to increase
        22  the amount that the plaintiffs were diluted?
        23                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        24      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You understand that, right?
        25      A.   That's -- I don't understand the question.
  00164:01      Q.   You don't understand that that's how it works?
        02                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        03      A.   That's a very complex question; and if you
        04  could break it down, perhaps I can respond to you.
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  Do you understand that
        06  the -- that the $12 million deduction for both the
        07  August and November capital calls resulted in a lower
        08  fair market value of the company?
        09      A.   I think --
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   I think the $12 million as the document shows
        12  was attributed to legal and bankers' fees.
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  And that it reduced the amount
        14  of distributable value, correct?
        15      A.   It would have to, yes.
        16      Q.   And that that reduced -- and that that
        17  increased the amount that the nonparticipating unit
        18  holders were diluted?
        19      A.   No.  It would result in, I believe, dilution of
        20  all the original shareholders.
        21      Q.   And how do you think that works?
        22      A.   Based on the original equity of everybody.
        23      Q.   Well, the amount of units that, say, AFWest got
        24  was based upon the amount put in compared to the
        25  existing equity value, right?
  00165:01      A.   Say that again.
        02      Q.   You understand that, that the -- that the
        03  amount that AFWest and all the other participating
        04  members got was based on comparing the amount put in
        05  with the existing equity value?
        06      A.   So are you talking about new equity or old
        07  equity?
        08      Q.   I'm talking about how much the new equity got
        09  in the company.
        10      A.   So what -- how much -- whoever got the new
        11  equity are the people who contributed in the capital
        12  call.
        13      Q.   Correct.
        14      A.   Right.  And?
        15      Q.   But to determine how much they get, you have to
        16  know how much the company was worth at the time they
        17  were putting it in, right?
        18      A.   Right.
        19      Q.   And if you knock off $12 million of legal and
        20  bankers' fees, you decrease the value of the company
        21  that they're buying into and increase the amount that
        22  they're getting, right?
        23                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        24      A.   I'm trying to make sense of your question.
        25      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  You don't understand that
  00166:01  that's how it works?
        02      A.   I want to be careful because I know that you
        03  are an expert at tricking somebody like me.  So let me
        04  have a moment to think it through.
        05                Okay.
        06      Q.   You tell me when you're ready.
        07      A.   I'm ready.
        08      Q.   Okay.  So do you understand that that's how it
        09  works?
        10      A.   What I understand is there were equity holders
        11  and then there was a capital call and then whoever
        12  contributed got equity based on their contributions and
        13  based on the formula that was developed.
        14      Q.   And do you understand how the minority who
        15  didn't contribute got diluted, what the calculation for
        16  that was?
        17      A.   As I said, it would be based on the formula
        18  that was developed.
        19      Q.   Developed by who?
        20      A.   By Lion's management.
        21      Q.   The board of directors?
        22      A.   And -- and the management of Lion.
        23      Q.   Who's the management of Lion?
        24      A.   I think we went through that.  Could you repeat
        25  who we --
  00167:01      Q.   Well, no, no.  I'm sorry.  You think the -- you
        02  think the dilution -- the amount of dilution or the fair
        03  market value that somehow Neil Jurkovic or Jesse
        04  Zeringue and those people were involved?
        05      A.   No.
        06      Q.   So who is the management of Lion then?
        07      A.   As we discussed, it was Gene Kenyon was
        08  involved, Tom Wells and those guys.
        09      Q.   Okay.  They came up with the formula to
        10  determine how -- how much --
        11      A.   I don't know who came up with the formula.
        12      Q.   What is net present value of August '14 return?
        13  Do you know what that is?
        14      A.   No.
        15      Q.   But you reviewed and approved that getting
        16  deducted from the enterprise value as well, correct?
        17                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        18      A.   I would have --
        19                MR. PRICE:  I'm sorry.  What's the
        20  objection?
        21                MR. RUOCCO:  There's no foundation for the
        22  question.  I don't see how you laid a foundation for
        23  that.
        24                MR. PRICE:  What do you mean there's no
        25  foundation?  This is your valuation.  It's clearly
  00168:01  deducted.
        02                MR. RUOCCO:  But you've asked -- you
        03  stated positively that he reviewed and approved it.
        04                MR. PRICE:  Because he's testified to that
        05  20 times today.
        06                MR. RUOCCO:  I don't think that's the
        07  testimony.  I think that misstates the testimony.  I
        08  think it's been a repeated problem throughout the
        09  deposition.
        10      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  Okay.  So you don't know
        11  what net present value of August '14 return is?
        12      A.   No.
        13      Q.   Even though you reviewed and approved the
        14  November capital call valuation?
        15      A.   And I repeat, we are in August of 2019.  You
        16  are producing one piece of document in front of me from
        17  2014, and I don't recall the specifics.
        18      Q.   Are there a lot of documents that you remember
        19  reviewing in connection with approving the capital calls
        20  in 2014?
        21      A.   Sorry?
        22      Q.   You're complaining I'm only showing you one
        23  document.  Your lawyers have only identified one
        24  document.  I'm simply asking:  Are there a bunch of
        25  other documents I should be asking you about?
  00169:01      A.   I'm sure you will.
        02      Q.   Were there a bunch of other documents that we
        03  should have been looking at that you reviewed in
        04  approving the capital calls in 2014?
        05      A.   I can't tell you what you should or shouldn't
        06  have been doing.
        07      Q.   Did you review a bunch of documents in
        08  connection with approving the August and November
        09  capital call valuations?
        10      A.   As I stated, I do not recall what all I
        11  reviewed in 2014.
        12      Q.   You were not receiving financials, monthly
        13  financials and narratives in 2014 like you were in 2013,
        14  right?
        15      A.   As I've stated, I do not recall when I stopped
        16  receiving the monthly financials.
        17      Q.   Assuming with me that we have no evidence that
        18  you've received monthly financials and narratives in
        19  2014, how could you possibly know what the current
        20  EBITDA of the company was?
        21      A.   Why would I assume whatever you are determining
        22  to be a fact?
        23      Q.   So how did you get the monthly financials in
        24  2014?
        25      A.   I don't remember that whether I got them or
  00170:01  not.
        02      Q.   Right.  And I'm saying, let's -- since you
        03  don't know whether you got them or not, let's assume you
        04  didn't.  If you didn't get them, how could you possibly
        05  approve the capital call valuations?
        06      A.   Well, why would I --
        07                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        08      A.   Why would I assume that?
        09      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  So you did get them?
        10      A.   I don't know.
        11                THE WITNESS:  I need to use the restroom.
        12                MR. PRICE:  Okay.
        13                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 2:44 p.m.
        14  We're off the record.
        15                (Recess taken from 2:44 p.m. to 2:51 p.m.)
        16                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 2:51 p.m.
        17  We're back on the record.
        18      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Okay.  Mr. Goradia, let me show
        19  you Exhibit 21.
        20                (Exhibit 21 marked.)
        21      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you recognize Exhibit 21?
        22      A.   Yes.
        23      Q.   Okay.  This is an email.  It starts out as an
        24  email between Mr. Kenyon and your brother on May 31st,
        25  2016; and then the next day, he is kind of passing it
  00171:01  along to you with a comment, correct?
        02      A.   Correct.
        03      Q.   And the title is update on bidders, correct?
        04      A.   Yes.
        05      Q.   And there was an attempt to sell Lion in 2016,
        06  correct?
        07      A.   Correct.
        08      Q.   This is maybe a year and a half, 16 months
        09  after the November capital call, right?
        10      A.   Right.
        11      Q.   And Mr. -- your brother is advising you that
        12  you-all have just gotten a new bid from something called
        13  Charlesbank Capital, right?
        14      A.   I think all he has done is saying disappointed
        15  that Lion did not bid.  Now it's only the financial
        16  buyers who are the banks.
        17      Q.   Well, let's back up.  Mr. Kenyon has advised
        18  Vijay that there is a new bid for Lion from Charlesbank
        19  Capital, correct?
        20      A.   Correct.
        21      Q.   And that bid is between 615 and 670 million,
        22  correct?
        23      A.   Correct.
        24      Q.   And you learned of that because Vijay forwarded
        25  it to you the next day, right?
  00172:01      A.   Right.
        02      Q.   So just so we can book end it, you had a -- you
        03  had a valuation done April -- end of April 2013 by Stout
        04  that said the company was worth 650 million.  In May of
        05  '16, you're getting bids for about the same, 6 -- low 6s
        06  to high 6s.  Yet, you approved valuations to dilute the
        07  minority members in '14 of half that.
        08                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        09      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Correct?
        10                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        11      A.   What is correct?  I don't know what do you mean
        12  by correct?
        13      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  It is true --
        14      A.   Are you asking me to confirm your deduction?
        15      Q.   Well, what's wrong about my deduction?
        16      A.   Everything is wrong.
        17      Q.   It's wrong that you had a bid for 615 to 670?
        18      A.   These bids mean very little when actual
        19  transactions need to -- when they happen, then those
        20  bids go out the window.
        21      Q.   And it's wrong that Stout valued the company at
        22  650 million as of April of 2013?
        23      A.   No buyer that does the valuation based on what
        24  Stout or somebody else has valued the company at.  As a
        25  buyer, we -- we do our own due diligence and determine
  00173:01  what the asset is worth.
        02      Q.   Well, somebody at Charlesbank Capital thought
        03  the company was worth 615 to 670.
        04      A.   Then why did they not put it up?
        05      Q.   Well, I don't know.  Maybe you guys didn't want
        06  to settle.  Maybe you -- maybe you thought it was worth
        07  700 million.
        08      A.   And that's your assumption again.  That's your
        09  assumption.
        10      Q.   So is your testimony that you would have sold
        11  for 615 million?
        12      A.   I'm not saying that.  What I'm telling you is
        13  that when people bid it -- put in the initial bids, they
        14  put in a notional number.  That is not a true value.
        15  And if anybody should know, it should be your client.
        16  They're running a private equity firm.  They -- they
        17  don't pay the price that they put in the initial bids
        18  at.  They have lots of experience in that.
        19                (Exhibit 22 marked.)
        20      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I'm showing you the fifth
        21  amendment that reflects the terms of the August capital
        22  call, okay?
        23      A.   Okay.
        24      Q.   And those that participated in the August
        25  capital call got something called an August 2014
  00174:01  investor return, right?
        02      A.   I don't know what you're referring to.
        03      Q.   You don't know -- you don't know that that's
        04  what happened in -- in the August capital call?
        05      A.   You handed me a document, and then you are
        06  asking something else.  So am I looking --
        07      Q.   Okay.
        08      A.   -- at the document, or is it something out of
        09  the blue.
        10      Q.   Okay.  Well, let's -- I mean, let's -- if you
        11  don't like the document, let's do it this way.
        12                Do you remember that the -- the terms of
        13  the August capital call approved by the board included
        14  an August 2014 investor return of 10 percent a year?
        15      A.   I do not recall.
        16      Q.   You don't recall approving that as a board
        17  member?
        18      A.   I do not recall right now.
        19      Q.   Okay.  Why did you -- why did you need to --
        20  why did you vote to approve a preferred return of
        21  10 percent?
        22      A.   As I've said before in my testimony, I don't
        23  know what all was being discussed and considered at that
        24  particular time.
        25      Q.   But you were on the board.  You were on the
  00175:01  board, right?
        02      A.   I was on the board.
        03      Q.   And you don't remember approving a 10 percent
        04  return for the August capital call contributors?
        05      A.   I do not.
        06      Q.   Why would -- why was there a need to provide
        07  the August investors with a 10 percent return?
        08      A.   I think I've answered already.
        09      Q.   Which is what?
        10      A.   Which is I do not recall what all was being
        11  considered at that given point in time.
        12      Q.   Meaning you don't know why it was needed to
        13  induce people?
        14      A.   I do not recall at that time what
        15  considerations were determined to be appropriate.
        16      Q.   I mean, according to you, the money had already
        17  been put in for equity, right, in June, right?
        18      A.   Money had been advanced, yes.
        19      Q.   And so there was no need to offer a preferred
        20  return to induce people to -- to participate because
        21  AFWest had already put all the money in?
        22                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        23      A.   You made a statement, Mr. Price.
        24      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Is that not true?
        25                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
  00176:01      A.   What is not true?
        02      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Is it not true that there was
        03  no need to induce participation in the capital call
        04  because AFWest had already put in the whole 35 million?
        05                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        06      A.   Sorry, is it not -- I don't understand your
        07  question.
        08      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  The capital call is in August,
        09  right?
        10      A.   Yes.
        11      Q.   The terms we're talking about, the preferred
        12  return was come up with in August, right?
        13      A.   Seems to be from this document.
        14      Q.   Okay.  But the money was already in the company
        15  in June, correct?
        16      A.   And?
        17      Q.   So why are we creating better terms in August?
        18  The -- the capital call has already been done.
        19                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        20      A.   I -- I'm very confused.  Capital call is
        21  already done.  On the one hand, you are saying capital
        22  call is done; and on the other hand, you are saying
        23  capital call came subsequent to the money we advanced.
        24  So I have no idea what you are saying.
        25      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you know why the -- do you
  00177:01  know why the terms of the August capital call were
        02  changed after August?
        03                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        04      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Well, let me -- let me ask a
        05  first question:  Do you know that the August capital
        06  call terms were changed after August?
        07                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        08      A.   I don't recall.
        09      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you think that they were
        10  changed after August?
        11      A.   If I don't recall, then I -- I can't think.
        12      Q.   So it's possible that they were changed after
        13  August?
        14                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        15      A.   I -- I'm -- I'm not going to speculate.
        16      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Where should we look to see if
        17  they got changed?
        18      A.   I don't know.
        19      Q.   In the LLC agreement?
        20      A.   You're claiming they were changed.
        21      Q.   So --
        22      A.   So you probably already know.  So why are you
        23  asking me where you should look?
        24      Q.   Well, do you know that they were changed?
        25      A.   I already replied.
  00178:01      Q.   Did you vote for them to be changed?
        02      A.   I already replied, I do not recall.
        03      Q.   You voted for them to be changed.  You don't
        04  remember doing that?
        05                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        06      A.   I think I've answered.
        07                (Exhibit 23 marked.)
        08      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Let's look at Exhibit 23.
        09                Have you seen this document before?
        10      A.   I don't recall.
        11                (Exhibit 24 marked.)
        12      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  I've handed you Exhibit 24.
        13                Have you seen this document before?
        14      A.   Let me look at it, please.
        15      Q.   Do you remember this document?
        16      A.   I don't recall.
        17      Q.   This is an email from Tom Wells to you and your
        18  brother, September 17th, 2015, correct?
        19      A.   Yes.
        20      Q.   The subject line is meeting with Wells Fargo,
        21  correct?
        22      A.   Correct.
        23      Q.   And Wells Fargo was another bank that loaned
        24  money to Lion and other Goradia family businesses?
        25      A.   Yes.
  00179:01      Q.   Including a company called Haverhill?
        02      A.   Yes.
        03      Q.   And it indicates -- Mr. Wells indicates to you
        04  two that, "The message from the bank was clear.  They
        05  want to exit the relationships with Goradia Capital as
        06  quickly as possible."
        07                Did I read that correctly?
        08      A.   Yes.
        09      Q.   Was -- do you remember earlier when I asked you
        10  whether or not the Gora -- Goradia family's other
        11  businesses were impacting the relationship with Bank of
        12  America?
        13                Do you remember that?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   And you said that that was not true, right?
        16      A.   Yes.
        17      Q.   Does Exhibit 24 demonstrate that the Goradia
        18  family's other businesses were impacting Lion's
        19  financial situation at least with regard to Wells Fargo?
        20      A.   No.
        21      Q.   You don't believe that that's what this says?
        22      A.   Wells Fargo has continued to support Goradia
        23  family businesses.
        24      Q.   So what -- what is -- this appears -- I mean,
        25  this appears to be like a long explanation of -- of Lion
  00180:01  and also Haverhill and what happened at Haverhill,
        02  right?
        03      A.   Right.
        04                MR. RUOCCO:  Object to form.
        05      Q.   (By Mr. Price)  Do you know whether this was
        06  transmitted to Wells Fargo at all?
        07      A.   What was?
        08      Q.   This whole write-up.
        09      A.   I have no idea, but I -- but I would think not.
        10      Q.   Okay.  Did you -- did you read this at the time
        11  you got it?
        12      A.   I do not recall.
        13      Q.   Have you looked at it today?
        14      A.   Yes, I have.
        15      Q.   Okay.  Is there anything in here that's not
        16  correct about -- about what Mr. Wells is describing at
        17  both Lion and Haverhill?
        18      A.   As you said, this is a very long email.  And if
        19  you're asking me to confirm if everything is correct,
        20  then I'll have to read it line by line.
        21      Q.   Okay.  Well, can you -- can you do that?  Can
        22  you read it real quick for me and then tell me whether
        23  or not --
        24      A.   Sure.
        25      Q.   -- there's anything in here that's incorrect
  00181:01  about what Mr. Wells says?
        02      A.   Okay.
        03      Q.   Is there anything in Exhibit 24 in terms of Mr.
        04  Wells' recitation of what has gone on at Lion and
        05  Haverhill that you disagree with?
        06      A.   Again, I do not recall specific things that
        07  were happening at that time.  So this is his assessment,
        08  and so I cannot opine that everything that he's stating
        09  here is correct.
        10      Q.   Okay.  But there's nothing -- you haven't read
        11  anything that you can tell me, "Mr. Price, I know this
        12  part of it is not true"?
        13      A.   Oh, yes.  So you mention about the relationship
        14  with Wells Fargo Bank.  And as I stated, the Wells Fargo
        15  relationship actually has continued to remain strong.
        16                And, in fact, if I -- I don't remember the
        17  exact date, but the very next year, Wells Fargo had
        18  increased their credit facility to Goradia companies.
        19      Q.   Okay.  So --
        20      A.   That's No. 1.  And No. 2, your implication that
        21  this in some way adversely impacted Lion also is not
        22  correct.  But that -- that's your assumption from --
        23  from this memo.
        24      Q.   I'm not asking you to agree or disagree with my
        25  assumptions.  I'm asking you to tell me what Mr. Wells
  00182:01  has said that is incorrect.
        02      A.   So you asked me to give you an example, and I
        03  gave you one.
        04      Q.   All right.  The example being --
        05      A.   Wells Fargo.
        06      Q.   -- he says they want to exit the relationships
        07  with Goradia Capital as quickly as possible, you say
        08  that is not true and it turned out to not be true?
        09      A.   No.  They -- they wanted to exit some of the,
        10  you know, relationships that Wells Fargo Bank was
        11  involved in.
        12      Q.   Which ones did they want to exit?
        13      A.   I -- I don't know.  I think he's just saying as
        14  quickly as possible.  I don't know he's referring to
        15  which financing they wanted to exit.
        16                MR. PRICE:  Let's take a quick break.  I
        17  might be able to wrap this up here in a couple of
        18  minutes.
        19                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 3:14 p.m.
        20  We're off the record.
        21                (Recess taken from 3:14 p.m. to 3:21 p.m.)
        22                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 3:21 p.m.
        23  We're back on the record.
        24                MR. PRICE:  I'll pass the witness.
        25                MR. RUOCCO:  We'll reserve our questions
  00183:01  for trial.
        02                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at
        03  3:21 p.m.
        04                MR. PRICE:  Thank you, sir.
        05                THE REPORTER:  And you need a final
        06  tomorrow?
        07                MR. RUOCCO:  Yeah.  Whatever our standing
        08  order is.
        09                THE REPORTER:  And we'll send you the
        10  rough tonight, Mr. Price.
        11                MR. PRICE:  Okay.  Thank you.
        12                (Deposition concluded at 3:21 p.m.)

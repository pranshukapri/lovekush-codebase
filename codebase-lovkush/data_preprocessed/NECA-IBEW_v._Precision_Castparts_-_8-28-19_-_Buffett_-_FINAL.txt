          13                   E X A M I N A T I O N

          14    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          15         Q.   Good morning, Mr. Buffett.  I introduced

          16    myself before, but my name is Randy Baron.  I'm

          17    going to ask you some questions here today.

          18              I don't anticipate that we will spend much

          19    time ago.  I think I have some understanding of, you

          20    know, at least how you typically do business.

          21              I think I wanted to start off with asking

          22    you if you have an understanding as to what the

          23    lawsuit is to which you are here to testify?

          24         A.   In a general way, yes.

          25         Q.   What do you understand it to be?


                                                         8


           1         A.   Well, as I understand it, there are two

           2    lawsuits.  Maybe I'm incorrect.

           3         Q.   Yes.  I only have one of them.

           4         A.   Oh, okay.

           5              Well, your suit, I presume relates to the

           6    question of whether the directors of Precision

           7    Castparts acted properly during the sale process to

           8    Berkshire Hathaway.

           9         Q.   So you understand that the focus of our

          10    lawsuit is conduct by the officers and directors of

          11    Precision Castparts and the company prior to its

          12    acquisition, correct?

          13         A.   Yes.

          14         Q.   All right.

          15              And do you understand what the basic

          16    factual contention is, what it is that we said was

          17    done wrong by the officers and directors of

          18    Precision Castparts or the corporation?

          19         A.   I haven't read the complaint, no.

          20         Q.   Do you have any understanding of that?

          21         A.   Well, I have a general understanding, but

          22    I have not -- I have not read the complaint, no.

          23         Q.   What is your general understanding?

          24         A.   Well, my general understanding is that the

          25    plaintiffs feel that the directors did not behave


                                                         9


           1    according as they should according to the state law

           2    in which it is incorporated, which I believe is

           3    Oregon.

           4         Q.   All right.

           5              Do you have any understanding as to

           6    whether or not our claims have to do with

           7    information that was set forth in the proxy

           8    statement?

           9         A.   Yes, I have heard that.

          10         Q.   And do you have -- do you have any belief

          11    as to what you think a company that you are buying,

          12    to seek shareholder approval of that purchase should

          13    say or do in the proxy statement?

          14         A.   Well, I think generally we have bought a

          15    fair number of companies, and the directors usually

          16    get one or more advisors.  And they listen to those

          17    advisors, but they also form their own opinions as

          18    to whether the shareholders are receiving fair

          19    compensation.

          20         Q.   You understand that the rules, at least

          21    the federal rules that companies have to go by, is

          22    that the information in the proxy statement is

          23    supposed to be a full and fair disclosure of

          24    information that is accurate -- accurate and

          25    necessary for shareholders to make a decision to


                                                        10


           1    vote yes or no, correct?

           2         A.   Correct.

           3         Q.   And is it your expectation when you are

           4    buying a company that the information that the

           5    directors and officers are telling their

           6    shareholders is the truth?

           7         A.   Correct.

           8         Q.   All right.

           9              And you also expect, and I have read a

          10    number of things that you have said publicly, you

          11    have a strong belief, if I understand it, that you

          12    expect to get truthful answers and sort of truthful

          13    information from the companies that you are going to

          14    buy, correct?

          15         A.   That's correct.

          16         Q.   All right.

          17              And I think that when, you know, you

          18    talk -- you had an interview in connection with this

          19    acquisition, and I think that you said something

          20    about the fact that, you know, what you do is, you

          21    know, you look the people in the eye and you try to

          22    get a real sense as to whether they are honest and

          23    telling you the truth.

          24              Is that accurate sort of representation

          25    sort of the way that you do it?

           1         A.   I look at 10-Ks, 10-Qs, competitors'

           2    information, recent -- any recent transcripts of

           3    information they have conveyed to the public.

           4              But it is certainly important that whoever

           5    is going to run the company that I feel confident in

           6    the fact that they are truthful and able.

           7         Q.   Did you understand that the lawsuit that

           8    we are bringing is fundamentally of the position

           9    that the directors and officers of Precision didn't

          10    really tell their shareholders the same thing that

          11    they were telling you about the company?

          12              MR. GARVEY:  Object, lacks foundation.

          13              THE WITNESS:  I --

          14              MR. GARVEY:  You may answer.

          15              THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          16              I have no idea except for what I read in

          17         the proxy at the time.  I haven't read the

          18         proxy since that time, so it is not like it is

          19         fresh in my mind.  But I have no information --

          20         I don't think I have ever met any of the

          21         directors of Precision Castparts except for

          22         Mark Donegan.

          23    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          24         Q.   And my question was really sort of, did

          25    you understand that sort of the nature of our


                                                        12


           1    lawsuit is that we think that what was represented

           2    to you as to what the nature of the business and the

           3    business plan was is not what was represented to

           4    shareholders?  Sort of a snapshot, where we think

           5    the company is at the time of the acquisition?

           6              MR. GARVEY:  Same objection.

           7              You may answer.

           8              THE WITNESS:  Well, the only thing that

           9         was represented to me was what would be in

          10         public documents.  I think it would be the same

          11         thing that would have been presented to the

          12         public.

          13    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          14         Q.   Well, so let's talk a little bit about

          15    that, and sort of what you -- what your belief was

          16    about Precision Castparts.

          17              First, as I understand you, and I think

          18    what you have said in the past, and I can show you

          19    sort of the transcript or the -- or the article

          20    about what you said, but fundamentally what I

          21    understand is that you made your decision to go

          22    ahead and acquire Precision Castparts after about 10

          23    or 15 minutes of meeting with Mr. Donegan, is that

          24    an accurate statement?

          25         A.   No.  I decided based on the fact that Todd


                                                        13


           1    Combs had had a favorable view of the company.  But

           2    I did not decide after 10 or 15 minutes to buy the

           3    company.  I decided to find out whether they were

           4    interested or would be willing to accept a

           5    proposition that I could make if they were -- if

           6    they were willing to -- to listen to one.

           7         Q.   So you had a conversation with Todd Combs

           8    for -- a relatively extensive conversation with

           9    Mr. Combs before you met with Mr. Donegan?

          10         A.   I don't know about extensive.  No, I met

          11    Mr. Donegan.  Actually, he had a date with Todd --

          12    people frequently come to see -- CEOs frequently

          13    come to see Todd.  Sometimes I drop in on those

          14    sessions and sometimes I don't.

          15              But my memory is that I dropped in at the

          16    end of the conversation, which would be the

          17    customary way I would do it.  Very seldom do I

          18    listen to the whole conversation.

          19         Q.   Well, tell me the background that you did

          20    before you, you know, had the look in his eyes and

          21    tried to assess whether he would be interested in

          22    being acquired by Berkshire Hathaway.

          23              What was your due diligence or what

          24    efforts did you personally take?

          25         A.   Beforehand, there wasn't any due


                                                        14


           1    diligence.

           2         Q.   Okay.

           3              What did Mr. Donegan tell you about the

           4    company?  What did you understand?

           5         A.   I just -- the only impression I came away

           6    with is that he was passionate about the company.  I

           7    could read everything else.

           8         Q.   Did you read other things before you --

           9         A.   Not beforehand, but later I read.

          10         Q.   We are going to have slow down because she

          11    has to take us both down and we are having a

          12    conversation.

          13         A.   I'm sorry.

          14         Q.   Which is fine, but we have to sort of

          15    measure our conversation.  Let me ask the questions,

          16    take a breath, answer the question.

          17         A.   Good enough.

          18              I shouldn't say "good enough" quite so

          19    soon, but good enough.

          20         Q.   Exactly.

          21              Okay.  So help me a little bit on the

          22    timing.

          23         A.   Sure.

          24         Q.   So the timing was you knew that Mr. Combs

          25    thought it was a good possibility of an acquisition


                                                        15


           1    to acquire Precision Castparts, correct?

           2         A.   No.  That is not correct.

           3              I knew that he thought it was a good stock

           4    to own in his portfolio.

           5         Q.   Okay.  And then how did -- then I

           6    understand, Mr. Donegan came in to speak to

           7    Mr. Combs.

           8              At that point in time, you stopped in and

           9    said hello, is that correct?

          10         A.   I stopped in and listened probably -- this

          11    is not a clear memory of time at all -- but I

          12    stopped in for the latter part of the conversation.

          13    I thought he was there 15 minutes, it might have

          14    been there 30 minutes.

          15         Q.   And at the time that you stopped in at

          16    that time was it contemplated that you would

          17    possibly buy Precision Castparts?  Or did you just

          18    stop in for just a general conversation?

          19         A.   I stopped in because it was a portfolio

          20    company of Todd's, and so -- and sometimes I did

          21    that and sometimes I didn't.

          22              This was a company I really wasn't that

          23    familiar with ahead of time, but I knew that Todd

          24    liked it.

          25         Q.   How long after -- and how long after that


                                                        16


           1    meeting did you consider buying Precision Castparts?

           2         A.   I said to Todd, afterwards, I don't

           3    remember the specific details of whether I said it

           4    that day or the next day, but I said, and I have

           5    said this with many other companies, and I have done

           6    it many times without the Todd prelude where I have

           7    met through other people.

           8              I said, Let's ask, let's ask the CEO, in

           9    this case, Mark Donegan, let's ask him whether if

          10    Berkshire would make a bid, whether that would be an

          11    act they would be fine with, or they would rather

          12    not have us do it.

          13         Q.   So -- and at least according to my

          14    calendar, the meeting with Mr. Donegan and Combs was

          15    on July 1st.  And it was really on July 2nd that

          16    Mr. Combs then called Mr. Donegan and said that they

          17    were interested in an acquisition.

          18              So it would have been that same day or the

          19    next morning where you had that conversation, is

          20    that accurate?

          21         A.   That would be correct.

          22         Q.   At the time what did you know about

          23    Precision Castparts?

          24         A.   I knew that Todd thought it was an

          25    attractive company.  He probably has 15 companies or


                                                        17


           1    so in his portfolio, and that means that among many

           2    hundreds of companies he thinks that those 15 are

           3    companies that he regards as -- as meeting his test

           4    in terms of valuation as a stock.

           5              And considering a whole bunch of

           6    qualitative and quantitative factors, that he thinks

           7    that they are the 15 that he likes better than the

           8    other thousands.

           9         Q.   What did he know about the company's

          10    business model?

          11         A.   Very little.

          12         Q.   What did you know, though?

          13         A.   I don't know that I could say that I knew

          14    anything about the model of the company.  I knew

          15    what they did in a general.

          16         Q.   What did they do?

          17         A.   Primarily supply aircraft parts.

          18         Q.   Okay.

          19              And did you have some sense as to the

          20    growth profile of the company, whether it was at a

          21    steady state?  Whether it was growing?  Whether or

          22    not it was organically growing?  Whether it was

          23    growing through acquisitions?  Anything else, did

          24    you have any sense of that?

          25         A.   I can't speak to that specifically in that


                                                        18


           1    I can take myself back in time three years and say

           2    exactly what I knew when.

           3              But I had -- I certainly -- I knew Todd

           4    liked it.  I knew that he felt that the record had

           5    been good.  I think the stock did -- had been

           6    disappointing recently, and that is about what I

           7    knew, yes.

           8         Q.   You had no idea of whether or not it was a

           9    growth company at the time or at a steady state or

          10    anything to that effect?

          11              MR. GARVEY:  Object to form.

          12              THE WITNESS:  Well, I knew that over time

          13         it had grown, obviously.

          14    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          15         Q.   Do you know whether it was still in a

          16    growth phase?

          17         A.   Pardon me?

          18         Q.   Was it still in a growth phase?  Was it a

          19    company that was still planning to continue growing?

          20         A.   I wouldn't -- I wouldn't have known that

          21    back then.

          22         Q.   At some point prior to making the offer

          23    -- now there was a offer made pretty soon thereafter

          24    on July 9th.

          25              Between that first conversation where


                                                        19


           1    Mr. Combs talked to Mr. Donegan and Mr. Donegan

           2    said, yes, we would be interested in entertaining an

           3    offer, did you gain any more information about

           4    Precision Castparts actual business model?

           5         A.   A lot more information, as much as I could

           6    get.

           7         Q.   Okay.

           8              So prior to making the over at 235, that

           9    was the offer and you never moved off that, correct?

          10         A.   That's -- that's correct.

          11         Q.   Who comes up with that number?

          12         A.   I come up with it.

          13         Q.   And how do you come up with that number?

          14         A.   I look at the business.  I look at its

          15    history.  I think about its competition.  I think

          16    about the nature of the business.  I think like any

          17    perspective owner would think about a business, what

          18    are the prospects of this company and is there

          19    somebody there to manage it.

          20         Q.   So you look at -- and if I understand --

          21              MR. GARVEY:  Excuse me.  I think he was --

          22         go ahead and continue.

          23    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          24         Q.   Go ahead.  I'm sorry.

          25         A.   Also relevant, but I don't need to look at


                                                        20


           1    it, but interest rates, the economy, and other

           2    things that are an influence.  But in terms of the

           3    specific company, I read everything I can get.  And

           4    I probably asked Todd questions after I read things,

           5    knowing that he can helpful in clarifying certain

           6    things.

           7         Q.   Yes.  Obviously other issues like the

           8    capital markets, if you are going to want to finance

           9    it; those other issues come into play in your

          10    decision-making process?

          11         A.   To varying degrees.  It depends on the

          12    size of the acquisition, our own cash position and

          13    that sort of thing.

          14         Q.   Exactly.

          15              So now, as you started to do your research

          16    before you got to that 235, at that point in time,

          17    did you get a stronger understanding of what the

          18    company did?

          19         A.   Yes.

          20         Q.   And so after that strong understanding,

          21    what did you understand about, again, what that

          22    company's business model was?

          23         A.   Well, I understood what was in the 10-Q.

          24    I understood what they talked about at investor

          25    presentations.


                                                        21


           1              I learned that -- I asked a lot more

           2    questions of Todd, and it is what I frequently do.

           3              I made a decision a couple of months ago

           4    on a 10 billion-dollar investment in Occidental

           5    Petroleum, and I heard that there was a possibility

           6    of it on a Friday.  And I met the people on Sunday.

           7    And an hour later, we committed $10 billion.  And in

           8    between, I thought about Occidental a lot.

           9         Q.   Some people can do that.

          10         A.   Well, it isn't always successful.  Believe

          11    me.

          12         Q.   So, again, just so I understand your frame

          13    of mind, your frame of mind is what they are saying

          14    in their 10-Ks and Qs, and what they describe in

          15    their business model from your perspective is how

          16    you viewed the company?  They say that we are, you

          17    know, selling airplane parts as our primary business

          18    model.

          19              You accept that to be true.  If they tell

          20    you that oil and gas is their primary business

          21    model, for example, you would accept that?

          22         A.   I wouldn't use the term "model."  I would

          23    say activity, all right?

          24         Q.   All right.  Well, that is a fair point.

          25              When I say the phrase "business model,"


                                                        22


           1    what do you think of when I actually use that

           2    phrase?

           3         A.   Well, we don't have a business model at

           4    Berkshire Hathaway, no.  We have a lot of business

           5    activities.  And day-by-day, Berkshire gets

           6    reformed.  Sometimes we go a long time in between

           7    those days.  But we don't -- we don't have a model.

           8    We have never -- we have never used the term

           9    "business model" at Berkshire.

          10              We say -- we have certain principles which

          11    we put in the back of the annual report about our

          12    attitude towards shareholders and time horizons and

          13    that sort of thing.  But we do not have the

          14    customary, what some people might call a business

          15    model.  It is just not a term.

          16         Q.   And what do you think that means, the

          17    customary term "business model"?

          18         A.   Well, I think the way that management

          19    consultants would use it, it would involve a

          20    long-term strategy perhaps, and it would involve a

          21    lot of jargon that we don't use.

          22         Q.   Well, when you are acquiring a company, is

          23    that not something that you are concerned about.  I

          24    understand that Berkshire Hathaway itself, because

          25    it is a conglomerate of a bunch of different


                                                        23


           1    companies.

           2         A.   Yes.

           3         Q.   All that have sort of different goals and

           4    aspirations.

           5              But when you are acquiring a company, do

           6    you have some interest in, again, the traditional

           7    frame of a business model or what its strategies

           8    are, what its future strategies are intended to be?

           9         A.   I'm concerned with the business

          10    activities, and what I think competitive positions

          11    will be five or 10 years or 20 years out, and

          12    whether I have the right person to maximize whatever

          13    opportunities there may be.

          14         Q.   And so Precision Castparts and throughout

          15    their 10-Qs and Ks, they talk about their activities

          16    in sort of fundamentally three ways; right?  They

          17    talk about their aerospace activities, their oil and

          18    gas industries, and then sort of their growth --

          19    their growth through acquisition activities,

          20    correct?

          21         A.   Well, they -- they certainly for the

          22    record have the latter third.  But with every

          23    company, that there is a possibility of acquisition,

          24    some of them more active in the past, and you can

          25    assume that they may have more interest in that.


                                                        24


           1              But I would not want to buy any company

           2    that thought that their main purpose was to make

           3    acquisitions.

           4              Precision had a history of doing

           5    acquisitions, but I looked at their activities as

           6    being in those -- primarily in the aircraft field.

           7    But obviously turbines, and they have other

           8    activities.

           9         Q.   Well, they represented to you and your

          10    Board of Directors, again, that acquisition was a

          11    significant part of the activity that they actually

          12    were involved in, correct?

          13         A.   They didn't represent that to me.  I

          14    looked at the history of the company, and seeing

          15    that they had done a number of acquisitions.  But

          16    nobody represented anything to me about future

          17    acquisitions.

          18         Q.   But they did explain that their business

          19    model moving forward involved a very detailed plan

          20    as to looking for acquisitions, how they make the

          21    acquisitions, how the acquisitions fit in, correct?

          22         A.   I don't remember that.

          23              MR. GARVEY:  Pardon me, Mr. Buffett.

          24              Randy, could you clarify what time frame

          25         you are asking about here?

           1    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

           2         Q.   I'm talking about at any time prior to the

           3    transaction closing.

           4         A.   I don't -- I don't recall -- I'm not

           5    saying it is not in there, but I don't recall in the

           6    10-K or in investor presentations.  They had a

           7    record of acquisitions, but I don't --

           8         Q.   I'm sorry.  Hold on.  I need to --

           9         A.   I will say this, I was not making a

          10    proposal based on the idea either that they would or

          11    would not make acquisitions.  You hope any company

          12    that you buy finds good things to do.  And some do

          13    and some don't.

          14         Q.   Well, you understood that they actually

          15    had staff and employees whose job it was to search,

          16    continually search for acquisitions, look for a

          17    pipeline of acquisitions, try to determine whether

          18    or not where and when they could fold in a new

          19    acquisition, correct?

          20         A.   I don't remember that.  I'm not saying

          21    that somebody didn't say it at some time, but I have

          22    no recollection of that.

          23              MR. RANDY BARON:  Can you mark this as

          24         Exhibit 141?

          25

           1              (The referred-to document was marked by

           2         the court reporter for Identification as

           3         Deposition Exhibit 141.)

           4    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

           5         Q.   I'm showing you what I have marked as

           6    Exhibit 141.  And this is a presentation that

           7    Precision Castparts made to the Berkshire Hathaway

           8    Board of Directors on October 16th, which I think

           9    is -- or October 2016, which is just prior to the

          10    shareholders vote --

          11              MR. ROBERT BARON:  No, it isn't.  It is a

          12         year after the shareholders and George people?

          13              MR. RANDY BARON:  I'm sorry.

          14              Wait.  I misspoke.  I'm sorry.  Relax,

          15         Bob.

          16              MR. ROBERT BARON:  I'm really relaxed.

          17         You didn't misspeak.

          18              MR. RANDY BARON:  I did misspeak.

          19              MR. ROBERT BARON:  Okay.  The document is

          20         dated on its face almost --

          21              MR. RANDY BARON:  I know.  Relax.

          22              MR. ROBERT BARON:  Almost nine months

          23         after closing, Randy.

          24              MR. RANDY BARON:  Relax.

          25              MR. ROBERT BARON:  And George asked you


                                                        27


           1         whether your questions were directed to the

           2         period --

           3              MR. RANDY BARON:  I know.

           4              MR. ROBERT BARON:  -- the time period, and

           5         you said prior to the closing.

           6              MR. RANDY BARON:  I know.  Relax.

           7    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

           8         Q.   So I'm showing you a presentation from

           9    Precision Castparts to the Berkshire Board of

          10    Directors dated October 2016.

          11              Have you ever seen this document before?

          12         A.   Sure.

          13         Q.   All right.

          14              In this document, if you take a look at

          15    it, it talks in sort of a detailed analysis -- when

          16    is the last time you saw this document, by the way?

          17         A.   When we passed it out -- it is customary

          18    if we buy a major company, we have a once a year

          19    meeting of the board offsite.  It is the only

          20    meeting, really, that we have.  And we do it in the

          21    fall; we are doing it again this fall.  And if we

          22    have a new big acquisition, I usually invite the CEO

          23    to come to the board and describe his business.

          24         Q.   Okay.  And what is -- describing the

          25    business, are they talking about, you know, what the


                                                        28


           1    business was historically, what the business is

           2    since it was acquired?  Or what is sort of the

           3    framework of that discussion?

           4         A.   I let them do it their own style.  I just

           5    tell them, look, we have got -- in the case now, 14

           6    interested directors, and they don't know that much

           7    about your business and tell them about it.

           8         Q.   All right.

           9              So have you -- so do you have a

          10    recollection of having seen this document before?

          11         A.   Well, I accept the fact it is document

          12    that we sent out in the fall of 2016 to the

          13    directors meeting.

          14         Q.   All right.

          15              And do you actually comment on this

          16    document at all?  Or do you just take --

          17         A.   No.

          18         Q.   -- the document that the CEO prepares and

          19    give it to the board?

          20         A.   Well, the CEO, we -- I can't be

          21    100 percent sure in that particular year, but

          22    sometimes the -- the presenting CEO will send out

          23    some background figures to the directors.  Sometimes

          24    they will just present it by slide.  Well, they will

          25    send out some kind of document and they will present


                                                        29


           1    slides and talk through it.  And then they will

           2    answer questions.  The presentation is up to them.

           3         Q.   And did Mr. Donegan actually give this

           4    presentation -- give a presentation to the board

           5    with this document?

           6         A.   He certainly gave a presentation.

           7         Q.   So, if you turn to this document and sort

           8    of it goes through, and let's sort of walk through

           9    it.  There is -- it talks about a history snapshot

          10    that you see on the first page, on page 2.

          11              And then it talks about, you know, the

          12    initial -- it gives the historical numbers and it

          13    give history revenue and EBITDA numbers.

          14              Do you see that on page 4?

          15              And you said, yes, you see that.

          16              That is clearly talking about even before

          17    Berkshire Hathaway?

          18         A.   Yes, I know.  It is the history.

          19         Q.   Then it identifies sort of its calendar

          20    year 2016, forecasted sales by segment.  You see it

          21    on the organization chart on page 5.

          22              MR. GARVEY:  Object to form.

          23    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          24         Q.   And then you see on page 6, there is a

          25    sales by market sort of graph, it talks about its


                                                        30


           1    sort of overall sales and where the sales come from.

           2              Do you see that?

           3         A.   Yes.

           4         Q.   All right.  It talks about locations.

           5              And then on page 8, it talks about

           6    acquisition strategy.  So it is the one page before

           7    that.  The page before that, on page 8.  It just

           8    says, Acquisition Strategy, at which point literally

           9    there is a multi-page discussion of an acquisition

          10    strategy by Precision Castparts, including with a

          11    history on page 13, and then a return on investment

          12    capital on page 14.

          13              Do you see that?

          14         A.   Yes.  Uh-huh.

          15         Q.   Did you understand that this acquisition

          16    strategy was a new strategy or an old strategy by

          17    the company?

          18         A.   Well, I didn't know -- what I would call a

          19    strategy.  I knew they had a history of acquisitions

          20    and that generally they had been successful.

          21         Q.   And that they were planning on continuing

          22    them?

          23         A.   Well, that would depend on the

          24    opportunities.

          25         Q.   But again --


                                                        31


           1         A.   We have actually -- our subsequent

           2    acquisitions that have not worked out that well, as

           3    you probably know.

           4         Q.   I do understand that.

           5              But you understood as of a year later that

           6    there was -- they had historically made

           7    acquisitions, and at least in Mr. Donegan's view,

           8    there was a strategy to continue making those

           9    acquisitions under certain formulations, correct?

          10         A.   There was a strategy to continue to look

          11    for acquisitions.

          12         Q.   All right.

          13              And again, my point was, that wasn't a new

          14    strategy, that was a strategy that you understood

          15    was the strategy that the company had at the time

          16    that you acquired it, correct?

          17         A.   I knew that -- like many of our companies,

          18    including Berkshire itself, we are looking for

          19    acquisitions every day.  But "strategy" implies

          20    something beyond what we do, I will put it that way.

          21         Q.   And all I'm looking for, Mr. Buffett, is

          22    very simply, I'm trying to get a sense as to

          23    whether, with regard to what the company was doing

          24    prior to the acquisition -- prior to the acquisition

          25    by Berkshire Hathaway, and what it wanted to do even


                                                        32


           1    a year later, whether there was any change or

           2    whether or not this was sort of a consistent

           3    business, you know, whether you call it strategy, an

           4    outlook, a forecast, all of those things didn't

           5    change in that year, is that correct?

           6         A.   No.  But the ability to successfully make

           7    acquisitions varies enormously depending on the

           8    environment in which you are in.

           9              But -- but the same situation for us, we

          10    have probably maybe 50 or 60 acquisitions, but in

          11    the last few years, we haven't made any to speak of.

          12         Q.   The market will dictate what you can do?

          13         A.   So the strategy can't be to make

          14    acquisitions.  It can be to -- to have an open mind

          15    about acquisitions, but we do not want any

          16    strategies that are committed to making

          17    acquisitions.

          18         Q.   Oh, absolutely.

          19              You don't want to make bad acquisitions,

          20    you want to make good acquisitions.

          21         A.   Yes.

          22         Q.   And then you said they don't always work

          23    out, but you want to set up your own --

          24         A.   You want to think -- you don't want to

          25    stretch.

           1         Q.   But at the time -- at the time of the

           2    acquisition for Precision Castparts, you don't

           3    know -- you didn't know one way or the other whether

           4    or not the environment for acquisitions was going to

           5    be good or bad in the year, two years, or three

           6    years following, correct?

           7         A.   That's correct.

           8         Q.   Because if you knew that, that would make

           9    life a lot easier, if you knew in advance whether

          10    the market was good or bad.

          11         A.   I will just take one week.

          12         Q.   But it was, in fact, your belief, at least

          13    at the time, that not only had Precision Castparts

          14    made many acquisitions prior to the acquisition, but

          15    that you believed that they were going to make many

          16    more, at least at the time of the acquisition?

          17         A.   I don't believe they were initially going

          18    to make many more.  I believe that they would --

          19    would like to make more acquisitions, and the

          20    question is whether the environment allowed it.

          21         Q.   Let me show you another document.

          22         A.   We encourage our companies to make good

          23    acquisitions, but sometimes we can and sometimes we

          24    can't.

          25              MR. RANDY BARON:  Can you mark this


                                                        34


           1         Exhibit 142, please.

           2              (The referred-to document was marked by

           3         the court reporter for Identification as

           4         Deposition Exhibit 142.)

           5    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

           6         Q.   I'm showing you what we got off of the

           7    Berkshire Hathaway website, which is, I think, an

           8    except of your shareholder letter.

           9              Do you recognize this?

          10         A.   Yes, uh-huh.

          11         Q.   Okay.  And you can see that in focusing on

          12    the third bullet point on page 4 of the letter,

          13    there is a discussion of the acquisition of

          14    Precision Castparts.

          15              Do you see that?

          16         A.   I see that.

          17         Q.   And then at the bottom, it says, "In

          18    building his business, Mark has made many

          19    acquisitions and will make more."

          20              Do you see that?

          21         A.   Yes.

          22         Q.   And that was an accurate statement from

          23    your perspective, is that Mr. Donegan of Precision

          24    Castparts had made many acquisitions and you

          25    anticipated that he would make many more?


                                                        35


           1         A.   I didn't think many more.

           2         Q.   And he will make more?

           3         A.   Yes.

           4         Q.   You believed he would make more?

           5         A.   There may have been -- I don't know when

           6    he made acquisitions subject to our purchase, but

           7    there may have even been one in the works then.

           8         Q.   But you believed that at least at that

           9    time you did not know the environment, you believed

          10    he would make more acquisitions, particularly hoping

          11    that the environment would be conducive to that?

          12         A.   Yes, I would say that Berkshire has made

          13    many acquisitions and will make more.  But that

          14    is...

          15         Q.   Let me -- well, in addition to just sort

          16    of understanding its business -- well, actually, let

          17    me pull back.

          18              When you told the shareholders, the

          19    Berkshire shareholders that Mr. Donegan had made

          20    many acquisitions and will make more, what was your

          21    basis for that knowledge?

          22              Was that just reading the SEC filings or

          23    was that also an assurance by Mr. Donegan that he

          24    would do that?

          25         A.   I knew by nature that if he found good


                                                        36


           1    acquisitions, he would like to be able to do them.

           2              And Berkshire, not needing dividends and

           3    having a lot of capital would be available, if

           4    acquisitions made sense.  But -- but I never -- I

           5    never instructed any management to -- to make

           6    acquisitions.

           7              I like it generally when they do, but I

           8    think I have actually commented in one of the annual

           9    letters that, telling a manager to make acquisitions

          10    is little like telling your teenage son to have a

          11    normal sex life.  I mean, you really don't need that

          12    extra push.

          13         Q.   I haven't had that conversation with my

          14    teenage son.

          15         A.   Different sons have different appetites;

          16    it is dangerous advice to give, generally.

          17         Q.   Was there a discussion where at least,

          18    again, I guess, you know, back to your analogy right

          19    now, a healthy sex life, prior to the -- prior to

          20    the close of the acquisition, do you recall at least

          21    through -- at least through other people encouraging

          22    Mr. Donegan to continue his acquisition strategy, a

          23    healthy acquisition strategy?

          24         A.   Again, I have not -- I wouldn't have

          25    encouraged him in terms of any strategy.  I would


                                                        37


           1    always encourage all of our managers to look for

           2    acquisitions -- even in their line own or dimensions

           3    of others, from other companies, which has had

           4    contact.  That has happened at Berkshire, they have

           5    referred other companies to us, because they have

           6    said they had a good experience being acquired by

           7    Berkshire.  So they tell friends.

           8              MR. RANDY BARON:  Can you mark this as

           9         Exhibit 143, please?

          10              (The referred-to document was marked by

          11         the court reporter for Identification as

          12         Deposition Exhibit 143.)

          13    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          14         Q.   I'm showing you an email chain and sort of

          15    the way the email chain works, if you look at them,

          16    they start from the back, at the bottom?

          17         A.   Yes, sure.

          18         Q.   And in the middle, and I acknowledge that

          19    this didn't come directly from you, but there is

          20    a -- if you see that there is an email from Shawn

          21    Hagel at Precision Castparts that says, "I think we

          22    should plan on the full 1 billion given Warren's

          23    direction to Mark to 'go by faster,' exclamation,

          24    end quote.

          25              Do you see that sentence?


                                                        38


           1         A.   Yes.

           2         Q.   Do you have any recollection of telling

           3    Mr. Donegan or Mr. Combs to Mr. Donegan, yes, buy

           4    more as long as they are good?

           5         A.   Well, I have -- I'm almost sure I never

           6    said what is shown in quotes here.

           7         Q.   Okay.  Why are you sure about that?

           8         A.   I don't think I have ever said that to any

           9    of our managers.

          10         Q.   Did you say anything that could have been

          11    interpreted that way?

          12         A.   Well, it is hard to tell, you know, what

          13    the teenage boy hears, but I don't think -- I have

          14    never said anything like that.

          15         Q.   Did you make it clear to Mr. Combs or Mr.

          16    Donegan directly which is, don't hold back on doing

          17    acquisitions while we are pending our transactions,

          18    continue to do what you have been doing the whole

          19    time?

          20         A.   Well, I don't -- I don't think I would

          21    have given any instructions one way or the other on

          22    that.  I wasn't in a position -- I don't remember

          23    doing that with any manager, or potential manager.

          24         Q.   Now, immediately after the acquisition

          25    closed, or actually immediately before the


                                                        39


           1    acquisition closed, as I understand it, the

           2    acquisition closed on January 29th, 2016.

           3              Does that comport with your recollection?

           4         A.   I don't have any -- yeah.

           5         Q.   You recall getting, you know, from Mr.

           6    Donegan, his assurance that they were -- that

           7    Precision Castparts was committed to further

           8    expansion through acquisition under Berkshire.

           9              Do you recall receiving that?

          10         A.   I don't -- I don't recall that, no.  I --

          11    I certainly was aware he was looking at acquisitions

          12    always.  But a number of our managers are.  I'm

          13    working on acquisitions always.

          14              MR. RANDY BARON:  Can you mark this as

          15         Exhibit 144, please.

          16              (The referred-to document was marked by

          18         Deposition Exhibit 144.)

          19    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          20         Q.   I'm showing what has been marked 144, and

          21    you see on the very top there is an email from Mark

          22    Donegan to your assistant, Debbie Bosanek.

          23              And, as I understand it, you don't get

          24    emails directly.  They get sent to your assistant

          25    and she prints them out and gives them to you.  Is


                                                        40


           1    that how it works?

           2         A.   That's correct.  That's correct.

           3         Q.   And so you would assume that if Mr.

           4    Donegan sent something for Ms. Bosanek for you, that

           5    that would have been printed out and given to you?

           6         A.   Yes, that would have been given to me.

           7         Q.   In this, you see that Mr. Donegan says, "I

           8    can assure all capital, you, we are all committed to

           9    driving this organization to continue increased

          10    performance and further expansion through

          11    acquisitions, and really look forward to being a key

          12    contributor to the Berkshire family."

          13              Do you see that?

          14         A.   I see that.

          15         Q.   Do you have some recollection, again,

          16    prior to this transaction closing, Mr. Donegan,

          17    again, committing towards further expansion through

          18    acquisition?

          19         A.   He was committed to looking for

          20    acquisitions.  He'd been doing it throughout his

          21    management of the company.  I'm committed to looking

          22    for acquisitions at Berkshire.

          23         Q.   Speaking of -- that is interesting.

          24              When you talk to your shareholders, your

          25    Berkshire shareholders, do you tell them that you


                                                        41


           1    are just continue to look for acquisitions, that

           2    that is sort of what you are hoping to achieve if,

           3    in fact, there are good acquisitions in the market

           4    that will allow them to happen?

           5         A.   Yes.  Our intention at Berkshire would be,

           6    we are retaining 25 billions dollars or so of

           7    earnings per year, and fortunately we have two

           8    prongs.  I explain that to our shareholders, we are

           9    fortunate that we have two options that most

          10    companies, really large companies don't think of

          11    having.

          12              One is we can do it through the

          13    acquisition of part of a company, by buying stock in

          14    the company, and secondly, we can buy entire

          15    companies.

          16              And our preference is to buy entire

          17    companies, but it is a lot easier to buy marketable

          18    securities.

          19         Q.   But, again, you don't know whether you are

          20    going to buy any or not.  It all depends on what the

          21    opportunities are and what the market is, correct?

          22         A.   That is exactly true.  But I wouldn't come

          23    to the office if I wasn't hoping every day the phone

          24    would ring.

          25         Q.   But if you don't know whether you are


                                                        42


           1    going to buy them or not, why do you bother to tell

           2    your shareholders that that is what you looking to

           3    do?

           4         A.   Well, they should know it.  Why we are

           5    retaining $25 billion of their money, so I should

           6    tell them what we hope to do with that 25 billion.

           7         Q.   And because they have invested it and

           8    those are investments decisions that they are

           9    making, so they should have full information as to

          10    what the nature of the investment decisions are

          11    being made with their money, correct?

          12         A.   Well, my partner, Charlie Munger and I,

          13    look at them as their partners, basically, and we

          14    want to give them, in as simple terms as possible,

          15    what they can and can't expect from us, and what we

          16    are going to try and do with their money, which is

          17    exactly what we are doing with our own money.  In my

          18    case, I have 99 percent of my capital in Berkshire.

          19         Q.   So, again, the idea is, if they are going

          20    to invest their money in the company, they have --

          21    they should have an understanding as to what the

          22    company expects to do with their investments?

          23         A.   We have for 30 years a section of the

          24    annual report when we set the economic principles of

          25    Berkshire Hathaway.  These people are our partners,


                                                        43


           1    and we want to know their -- they are entitled to

           2    know what our own expectations of our sales are,

           3    what our limitations are, how we are going to treat

           4    their money, and so we try to lay that out.

           5         Q.   Even if you don't know whether or not you

           6    are ever going to make another acquisition again?

           7         A.   Well, I don't know how long -- I'm going

           8    to 89 in a couple days, so I may have made my last

           9    acquisition.  But every day I'm thinking about it.

          10         Q.   And so, again, because -- since you don't

          11    know whether you will make one or not, doesn't mean

          12    you shouldn't tell your shareholders that you will

          13    continue to try, correct?

          14         A.   It is what I hope to do.  But it isn't

          15    something I can in any way guarantee in them that I

          16    can do.

          17         Q.   But why do you tell them if it is only

          18    something you hope to do?

          19         A.   Again, because they are leaving

          20    $25 billion with me; they ought to know what I'm

          21    thinking about doing with it.

          22         Q.   I want to sort of move on to another

          23    issue.  That issue is Mr. Donegan.

          24              Did you have some understanding as to,

          25    absent an acquisition by Berkshire, what Mr.


                                                        44


           1    Donegan's plans were at Precision Castparts?

           2         A.   I thought he was in love with his

           3    business.  And I looked -- that is what I'm hoping

           4    to find in a manager.  And he seemed to me a fellow

           5    that was much more interested in his business doing

           6    well than how he did.  And that he would bring -- I

           7    certainly had the impression that he worked

           8    extremely hard at it, and I thought he knew his

           9    business extremely well.

          10              And, you know, the one question I asked

          11    him, was, you know, do you plan to retire at 65?

          12         Q.   And what did he tell you?

          13         A.   He said he -- I don't remember precisely

          14    what he said.  But the remembrance I have in my mind

          15    is that he basically said the same thing I would

          16    say, which is I will work as long as I can.

          17         Q.   And you are succeeding with that plan.

          18         A.   And he's succeeding with the plan, too.

          19         Q.   Well, did you get any sense as to whether

          20    or not the idea of what you want to do with the

          21    business of Precision Castparts, you know, including

          22    its acquisition as an acquisition, options, whatever

          23    we want to call it, that doing so as a member of the

          24    Berkshire family was more in sync with his desire --

          25    his way of running a company as opposed to a public


                                                        45


           1    company?

           2         A.   Well, I think -- I sell this in effect to

           3    sellers that the financial resources of Berkshire

           4    are essentially unlimited.  So that, in effect, it

           5    can -- we don't need dividends from subsidiaries

           6    that, all of the time that the CEO, they don't have

           7    to worry about dealing with banks, they don't have

           8    about dealing with lawyers, usually.  They don't --

           9         Q.   Who wouldn't want to deal with lawyers?  I

          10    don't understand.

          11         A.   They can use 100 percent of their time --

          12    if they love their business, they can spend

          13    100 percent of their time in that love affair.

          14         Q.   That is a great sales pitch.

          15         A.   Well, I think it is true, too.

          16         Q.   I don't disagree with that.

          17         A.   Yes.

          18         Q.   With regard to Mr. Donegan, do you have

          19    any sense of whether or not he acknowledged that

          20    benefit?  You are talking -- you don't have to deal

          21    with the same level of the analyst calls the

          22    analyst -- the same expectations of, you know,

          23    meeting your earnings numbers to the same extent,

          24    all of those things make it probably a better job to

          25    be a CEO under the Berkshire umbrella then alone in


                                                        46


           1    the public markets, would you agree with that?

           2         A.   I think -- I think that it is a luxury I

           3    enjoy.  And I think that having unlimited resources

           4    for anything good that comes along, having -- if you

           5    are in love with your business, you are free to run

           6    your business.  And some executives are in that

           7    position and a great many aren't.

           8              And you can't change the people.  So I

           9    can't put that spark in them.  But if that is spark

          10    is there, I can make sure that we are the right

          11    place to have it.

          12         Q.   Some managers love running business and

          13    some managers love the wheeling and dealing of being

          14    in the public equity market?

          15         A.   Some are looking forward to their

          16    retirement.

          17         Q.   And was there any sense from Mr. Donegan

          18    in particular that, you know, Precision Castparts

          19    was going to be both more successful and, you know,

          20    a more pleasant plan to run under Berkshire

          21    Hathaway?

          22         A.   I think -- I think every -- I think we

          23    bring ingredients that any company that are -- are

          24    almost unique.

          25         Q.   Did you get any sense from Mr. Donegan


                                                        47


           1    that he recognized that?

           2         A.   Well, I think he -- he liked the fact --

           3    he wouldn't be talking to me, if he didn't think

           4    that Precision Castparts would -- would have a good

           5    future under Berkshire.  I mean, he loved the place.

           6    He wouldn't turn it over on some raider of some

           7    sort.

           8         Q.   Did you ever get any since that he, either

           9    directly or from Mr. Combs that, in fact, he loved

          10    the place but that he was frustrated with it as a

          11    public company as opposed to in a situation where he

          12    could focus on running the company?

          13         A.   I think he ran -- I think he ran the

          14    company as a company that he loved.  I mean, we all

          15    get frustrated a little bit.  I get frustrated at

          16    times I can't find anything to buy.  But if you

          17    really like your business, if it is not just a

          18    business to you, but it is a passion, you like the

          19    idea that -- that if a 2008 or '09 period comes

          20    along, you have got bank loan that are coming due,

          21    you have got a parent that has got a lot of money.

          22         Q.   One last document I would like to show

          23    you.

          24              MR. RANDY BARON:  Mark this 145 for me,

          25         please.

           2         the court reporter for Identification as

           3         Deposition Exhibit 145.)

           4    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

           5         Q.   I'm showing you an email chain, and this

           6    is an email chain, again, between your assistant,

           7    Debbie Bosanek -- do you say Bosanek --

           8         A.   Bosanek, it is from me.  You get fewer

           9    emails, if you have somebody else receive them.

          10         Q.   I need to try that.

          11         A.   It works.

          12         Q.   And then -- and then it was Das Anupreeta

          13    from the Wall Street Journal who you are speaking

          14    with, correct?  On your email chain?

          15              MR. GARVEY:  Are you working off the same

          16         one we are?  This is one with --

          17              MR. RANDY BARON:  Maybe I got the wrong

          18         one.

          19              THE WITNESS:  With Dimon.

          20              MR. RANDY BARON:  Oh, I'm sorry.

          21              THE WITNESS:  Would you like this one

          22         back?

          23              MR. RANDY BARON:  It is the wrong email on

          24         that date.  I'm sorry.

          25              Can you just mark this next in order?

           1              THE REPORTER:  146.

           2              MR. RANDY BARON:  146.

           3              (The referred-to document was marked by

           4         the court reporter for Identification as

           5         Deposition Exhibit 146.)

           6    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

           7         Q.   On 146, this is an email chain between,

           8    again, you and Ms. Anupreeta Das from the Wall

           9    Street Journal, correct?

          10         A.   Correct.

          11         Q.   And the question that was asked of you

          12    was, did you make it a condition of the deal that

          13    Mark Donegan stay on?

          14              And then you said, "Not formal nor

          15    contractual, but I would not have made the deal

          16    unless I was 100 percent sure he would run the

          17    company for a very long time."

          18              Do you see that?

          19         A.   That's correct.

          20         Q.   Explain to me what you meant by -- how

          21    were you able to be 100 percent sure he was going to

          22    stay and run the company for a long time?

          23         A.   It was a judgment I made after talking

          24    with him.  You know, and -- it isn't -- I did say

          25    something to the effect, are you going to retire at


                                                        50


           1    65.  But it goes beyond that.  You can -- you can

           2    actually tell with a reasonable degree of assurance,

           3    I'm sure I have gotten fooled sometimes, but you can

           4    tell by how people talk about their business, and

           5    they -- their personality, their conviction, their

           6    passion for it comes through.

           7              I think it probably comes through with me

           8    about Berkshire, because it is what I think about,

           9    you know.

          10         Q.   How does -- and is it just because of your

          11    history and the way you have acquired companies, or

          12    do you do something to make clear to the managers

          13    that you are going to be part of the family, I'm

          14    buying this company, but I'm buying this company

          15    with you at the helm?

          16         A.   With me, personally.  Or them --

          17         Q.   To the manager of the company.  Like, for

          18    example, Mr. Donegan, you clearly want him to stay

          19    and not retire and be there for an extended period

          20    of time.  Again, but by anybody who is going to be

          21    acquired, they want to know whether they have got a

          22    job, if you acquire them and, you know, fire them

          23    and put in a whole new management team.

          24              How do they get that assurance from you?

          25         A.   Well, they can look at the record.  I


                                                        51


           1    mean, I can't recall a time when I've ever bought a

           2    company to fire the guy the next day.

           3              We are dependent on the management.  We

           4    don't have --

           5         Q.   That is not yours --

           6         A.   Well, we don't have a corps of people

           7    here. I mean, we have 395,000 employees, we have got

           8    25 at headquarters.  We don't have anybody to run

           9    companies.  I can't run them.  Todd can't run them.

          10    Debbie would probably be better than -- but we don't

          11    have anybody to run the companies.

          12              And we need managers who, for reasons

          13    other than money, they have got to be paid fairly,

          14    but for reasons other than money, that is just

          15    plain -- that is what they want to do in life.

          16              Because probably three quarters of our

          17    managers are financially independent.  They don't

          18    need to do it to live well.  They have got to do it

          19    because they love doing it.  I can't put that in

          20    them.  I can mess it up, but I can't put it in them.

          21         Q.   In one of your interviews about this, you

          22    said, something, you know, we treat, you know, we

          23    treat them well, we treat our managers well that

          24    come in.

          25              What do you mean by that?  Is that more


                                                        52


           1    than just money?

           2         A.   Oh, I think it is more than money.  I

           3    think --

           4         Q.   What is it that you do that you think is

           5    treating your managers well?

           6         A.   I think -- I think when they come to the

           7    annual meeting, they are heros to 40,000 people.  I

           8    think that -- I mean, they show their wares there at

           9    our meeting.  I think there is some prestige,

          10    perhaps joined -- joined with Berkshire now.  That

          11    wasn't true 40 years ago.

          12              But I think now that -- that I think -- on

          13    balance, if you run a company owned by Berkshire

          14    that it is regarded as something different, perhaps.

          15    Maybe I'm kidding myself.

          16              I think that -- I think they understand

          17    generally that they are not going to be subject to

          18    some 25-year-old MBA telling them, you know, what to

          19    have for breakfast in the morning, if you are with

          20    Berkshire.  And that culture will extend beyond me,

          21    because at my age, they don't know whether I'm going

          22    to be around tomorrow.

          23         Q.   So do you ever have to tell the managers,

          24    look, you know, I'm buying this company with the

          25    expectation that you are going to be around a long


                                                        53


           1    time, or do you just assume that they know that

           2    because it is Berkshire?

           3         A.   Well, I think -- they know I wouldn't be

           4    buying -- I couldn't name -- name another person at

           5    Precision Castparts.  I'm not there.  It is one

           6    thing, I -- I count on them living a long time.

           7    That doesn't mean they will.

           8              But I had one woman who worked for me

           9    until she was 103.  I use her as an example.

          10    Because when she retired at 103, she died the next

          11    time.  I just hold that as a threat over the other

          12    members.

          13         Q.   Let's move back to Exhibit 145 for just a

          14    minute, and that is the email with Mr. Dimon.

          15              In there it appeared that you were

          16    indicating that you would, you know, accept some

          17    financing or you may look for some additional

          18    financing for the acquisition.

          19              Was that a business decision for

          20    diversification?  Was that a business decision for

          21    sort of keeping good relations?  Or was that some

          22    need that you guys think you had financially for the

          23    acquisition?

          24         A.   Well, we always have the money to do it.

          25         Q.   That was my point.


                                                        54


           1         A.   We don't commit unless they have got the

           2    money.  That doesn't mean I wouldn't borrow some

           3    money.  But we never --

           4         Q.   So in this instance, do you recall whether

           5    you ultimate ultimately took some money?

           6         A.   As I look at this, I don't remember at

           7    all.

           8         Q.   So you don't know why you said to

           9    Mr. Dimon, sure, we might take some of your money?

          10    You have no recollection of why?

          11         A.   I guess he's prepared if I called.  But I

          12    have no memory whether we borrowed money on this --

          13    on the deal.

          14              MR. RANDY BARON:  We don't we -- we have

          15         been about an hour.  I think I'm probably done,

          16         unless my colleagues tell me I have a lot more

          17         questions for you and then we will come back.

          18         Can we take five minutes and decide what else

          19         we need?

          20              THE WITNESS:  Sure.

          21              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Please stand by as we

          22         go off the record.  The time is approximately

           2         which the following proceedings were held:)

          10    BY MR. ROBERT BARON:

          11         Q.   I'm going to refer to him as plaintiff's

          12    counsel, since we have the last -- the same last

          13    name.

          14              MR. RANDY BARON:  I don't need it.

          15              MR. ROBERT BARON:  I'm sorry.  Am I not

          16         projecting adequately?

          17              THE WITNESS:  I'm glad somebody else needs

          18         help.

          19              MR. ROBERT BARON:  Thank you.

          20              I think we are good.

          21    BY MR. ROBERT BARON:

          22         Q.   So, Mr. Buffett, plaintiff's counsel asked

          23    you some questions about your understanding with

          24    respect to the future acquisitions by Precision at

          25    the time you were contemplating the purchase of


                                                        56


           1    Precision.

           2              And my question is, at the time you

           3    decided to make the offer and at the time that you

           4    signed up the acquisition of Precision, did you have

           5    any specific forecast or expectations about the pace

           6    of future acquisition activity by Precision?

           7         A.   No.

           8         Q.   When you have made other acquisitions of

           9    other public companies, or private companies, when

          10    you make that acquisition, do you prepare a forecast

          11    of the expected future acquisition activity by those

          12    companies?

          13         A.   No.

          14         Q.   Do you have, in your acquisition

          15    experience, I think you said you bought 60

          16    companies.

          17         A.   Roughly, yes.

          18         Q.   Have you ever had a specific forecast or

          19    set of expectations about the future acquisition

          20    activity by the target company that you are going to

          21    purchase about what level of acquisitions they were

          22    going to enter into in the next three to five years?

          23         A.   Never.

          24         Q.   Does Berkshire, for its own use, prepare

          25    forecasts as to the level of acquisition activity


                                                        57


           1    that Berkshire expects to engage in over any future

           2    period, one year, three years, five years?

           3         A.   We never have that.

           4         Q.   And why don't you do that?

           5         A.   I don't know.  I know -- I know that I'm

           6    interested in doing them.  I know that there is no

           7    way to predict what will come along when -- I don't

           8    know what the competition will be.  Right now

           9    private equity, for example, is extraordinary

          10    competition.

          11              It wouldn't make any sense.  I want to be

          12    prepared.  I'm always prepared to make acquisitions.

          13    I like have a loaded gun in terms of having the

          14    cash, some fair amount of cash available and access

          15    to credit, if needed.  But we have never had a plan

          16    like that.

          17         Q.   If a company that you are considering

          18    purchasing were to present you with a forecast as to

          19    their future rate of acquisitions, is that something

          20    that you would rely upon in deciding whether to go

          21    ahead and try to purchase that company, or actually

          22    sign up an acquisition of that company?

          23         A.   It might -- it might worry me a little bit

          24    if they actually had numbers.  I mean, you can't

          25    forecast acquisitions.  You can -- you can have a


                                                        58


           1    very keen interest in a subject, and we have it at

           2    Berkshire.  And some of our subsidiaries do and some

           3    don't.

           4              There is no sense having an acquisition

           5    plan of See's Candy, but if it seems sensible to be

           6    willing to look at acquisitions at a Marmon, for

           7    example, but we have no forecast on that sort of

           8    thing.

           9         Q.   Is it unusual for the operating companies

          10    under the Berkshire umbrella to study potential

          11    acquisition candidates on a regular basis?

          12         A.   Well, a number do and a number don't.  I

          13    mean, in the insurance business it -- it would be

          14    very, very, very unlikely that -- Geico is not going

          15    to consider an acquisition.  But it can consider

          16    expansion.

          17              But, on the other hand, let's take Shaw, a

          18    carpet company, if you take Marmon, which has

          19    acquired a number of companies over the years.

          20              Uber has always had an interest, but their

          21    record has been very poor since we bought it, in

          22    terms of acquisitions.  But they had acquired

          23    companies over the years.  And still, if something

          24    good came along, we would be interested in doing it.

          25              But there are certain industries we are in


                                                        59


           1    where it is -- it may make some sense, but BNSF, it

           2    is very unlikely they ever make an acquisition.

           3         Q.   You made some reference during your

           4    testimony in response to the questions from

           5    plaintiff's counsel to the acquisitions that

           6    Precision had made since the closing of Berkshire's

           7    acquisition.

           8              In your view, has Precision been

           9    successful in its attempts to acquire other

          10    companies since Berkshire acquired Precision, three

          11    and a half years ago now?

          12              MR. RANDY BARON:  Objection, form.

          13              MR. GARVEY:  You may answer.

          14              THE WITNESS:  Oh.  Not to this point, no.

          15              It actually -- we made one that turned out

          16         very badly, and -- but that happens.  I have

          17         made some myself, not necessarily in that time

          18         period.  But I have made -- I have made enough

          19         myself that -- it can happen.  It will happen

          20         from time to time.  But we have had -- we have

          21         not had a good streak since the time we bought

          22         Precision.

          23    BY MR. ROBERT BARON:

          24         Q.   You've bought 60 companies over the years,

          25    and is it fair to say some of those acquisitions


                                                        60


           1    have been very successful and others have been

           2    unsuccessful?

           3         A.   That is very fair to say.

           4         Q.   Is it possible for you to know at the time

           5    you enter into an agreement to acquire a company

           6    whether that acquisition is ultimately going to be

           7    accreted to Berkshire's financial performance?

           8         A.   No.  I have always been -- I have that

           9    expectation and sometimes it is realized and

          10    sometimes it is more than realized.  And other

          11    times, I'm dead wrong.

          12         Q.   And there have been instances where

          13    acquisitions by Berkshire have disappointed you,

          14    correct?

          15         A.   A number.

          16         Q.   With respect to the performance, the

          17    financial performance of Precision, since Berkshire

          18    acquired it, has Precision's financial performance

          19    during the years from 2016 to the present met your

          20    expectations at the time you acquired the company or

          21    at the time you agreed to acquire the company in

          22    2015?

          23         A.   No.

          24         Q.   And has the underperformance been due to

          25    circumstances that were within the control of the


                                                        61


           1    management of Precision?

           2         A.   No.  I think Mark Donegan has done a fine

           3    job and we are lucky to have him.  But it still

           4    hadn't worked out to date.  It hasn't worked out as

           5    we had hoped.  Actually, that has been commented on

           6    by certain outside analysts, including at our annual

           7    meeting.

           8              MR. ROBERT BARON:  I have no further

           9         questions at this time.

          10              MR. RANDY BARON:  May I have the

          11         microphone back?

          12              F U R T H E R   E X A M I N A T I O N

          13    BY MR. RANDY BARON:

          14         Q.   I have a couple of follow-ups to those.

          15              Mr. Baron, the other Mr. Baron commented

          16    about forecasts on acquisitions.

          17              I believe that you sort of made comments

          18    before about long range forecasts of companies you

          19    acquired before, correct?

          20              What is your belief in trusting or relying

          21    on forecasts of any sort?

          22         A.   Well, in effect, when I buy a company I'm

          23    making one myself.  It may not be precise, or -- but

          24    I'm saying overall, it is a good idea to lay out X

          25    for this company, because I expect that we will get


                                                        62


           1    a decent return on X over time.

           2         Q.   What about the internal company

           3    management's long range, five-year, 10-year

           4    forecasts, what is your view on those?

           5         A.   I never ask for them.

           6         Q.   All right.  Why?  Why not?

           7         A.   I don't think people know perfectly the

           8    future, and I think that -- in the end, it is my

           9    decision.  I mean, I can't -- I can't go to the

          10    Board of Directors and say, well, you know, so and

          11    so told me they were going to earn 2 X, you know,

          12    five years from now.  It is my decision.

          13         Q.   It is not just they don't want acquisition

          14    they are going to make, they don't know what the

          15    market is going to be, they don't know whether the

          16    oil and gas industry is going to be bad, whether or

          17    not Boeing is going to have issues with its liners,

          18    all of those things you don't know, so you don't

          19    rely on them --

          20         A.   The world can't -- well, I make estimates

          21    in my own mind, obviously, of what I see in the

          22    future, both with stocks and with businesses.  But I

          23    don't rely on other people's forecasts for stocks.

          24         Q.   For anything?

          25         A.   Yes.

           1         Q.   And when -- so does -- does Berkshire do

           2    long-range forecasts?

           3         A.   No.

           4         Q.   Why not?

           5         A.   Because we -- all we know is we are going

           6    to do our best.

           7         Q.   All right.

           8              And so it is not that Berkshire doesn't --

           9    doesn't forecast out, project for acquisitions, it

          10    just doesn't forecast out its overall business model

          11    beyond, you know, what it hopes it can achieve in a

          12    very short time?

          13         A.   Well, not even in the short time.  But I

          14    would say this, I do make sure that I know where the

          15    month, quarter where cash is going to be.

          16         Q.   Exactly.

          17              But, again, the other Mr. Baron made

          18    comments about you don't forecast out acquisitions,

          19    but you don't really forecast out anything at

          20    Berkshire, correct?

          21         A.   I don't do it in the specific sense of

          22    forecast.  Obviously, when I buy a business, I'm

          23    projecting a future in my mind that I think is

          24    satisfactory in terms of the capital we are laying

          25    out.

           1         Q.   And what you do do, is you actually set

           2    aside a certain amount of money that is intended

           3    specifically for acquisitions, if they can be

           4    achieved in the next year or two years following,

           5    correct?

           6         A.   Well, I don't set it aside.  I'm just --

           7    I'm always in a position where I could look at

           8    things that are large, and I would even look at

           9    things where we might have to borrow money, although

          10    I would want ample liquidity after we borrowed the

          11    money.

          12              But I would never put Berkshire in any

          13    position where if the stock market closed for a

          14    month, or commercial paper couldn't be sold or

          15    anything like that that, that Berkshire would have a

          16    problem.  I'm very conservative financially.  But I

          17    also like to do big deals.

          18         Q.   So, again, a moment ago when we were

          19    speaking first, you were talking about you tell

          20    shareholders that you have a certain amount of

          21    capital, a certain amount of capital that you are

          22    not allocating yet, that you are holding back for

          23    potential acquisitions, correct?

          24         A.   Well, we keep all of the money.  So

          25    they -- we better do something with it.  But I do


                                                        65


           1    tell them, currently, that we will keep always at

           2    least $20 billion in cash or US Treasury bills.

           3         Q.   And why are you telling them that you are

           4    keeping 20 billion?

           5         A.   Because I don't know whether the stock

           6    market is going to be open tomorrow.

           7         Q.   Okay.  So you are keeping the

           8    20 billion -- is it just to hold, if the stock goes

           9    down, or is it for the purpose of making

          10    acquisitions?

          11         A.   No.  We want to have $20 billion, so if

          12    the world stops for some reason, if a missile

          13    actually hit Hawaii instead of -- we want to be in

          14    better shape than any bank is.  We do not want to

          15    count on bank lines.  We don't want to count on the

          16    openness of markets.

          17              MR. RANDY BARON:  I have no further

          18         questions.

          19              MR. ROBERT BARON:  Nothing further here.

          20         Thank you.

          22         ends the deposition.  The time is approximately

         11    MR. CROKE:

         12        Q.    Good morning, Mr. Mathur.

         13        A.    Good morning.

         14        Q.    Thank you for being here.

         15              My name is Jacob Croke, and I'm

         16    going to be asking you some questions

         17    today.

         18              Could you please state your full

         19    name for the record?

         20        A.    Anish Mathur.

         21        Q.    Do you understand that you're

         22    testifying under oath today just like you

         23    would in a court of law?

         24        A.    Yes, I do.

         25        Q.    Is there any reason you can't

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    testify truthfully and accurately today?

          3        A.    There's no specific reason, but

          4    there are certain things that you may not

          5    state clearly, but I'll specify that to you

          6    when that is the case.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              I'd like to cover just a few

          9    basics.  The court reporter here is going

         10    to be writing down everything that everyone

         11    says.  So just to make sure the record is

         12    clear, please wait for me to finish asking

         13    my questions before answer and I'll try to

         14    do the same for you.

         15              Okay?

         16        A.    I'll try that.

         17        Q.    And if you don't understand any

         18    of my questions, please just say so.

         19    Otherwise, I'll presume that you understand

         20    the question.

         21              Is that fair?

         22        A.    Yes.

         23        Q.    You can let me know at any time

         24    if you need a break.  My only request is

         25    that if I've asked you a question, that you

          8        Q.    Have you ever testified in any

          9    legal proceeding before?

         10        A.    What does testify mean, had a

         11    witness or --

         12        Q.    Sure.  Have you ever appeared

         13    before a court?

         14        A.    No.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16        A.    No.

         18    plaintiff or a defendant in a legal

         19    proceeding?

         20        A.    I don't recall actually, but if

         21    you're talking about like something going

         22    to a county court for a parking ticket, I

         23    mean, I don't remember that, but...

         24        Q.    No, no.  Any sort of lawsuit or

         25    claim filed against you individually other

          2    than, you know, parking ticket kind of

          3    thing.

          4        A.    So have I been plaintiff -- what

          5    does plaintiff mean again, is that the

          6    one --

          7              MR. ITKIN:  The claimant.

          8        A.    The claimant, okay.  So

          9    personally, no.

         10        Q.    Okay.  Did you do anything to

         11    prepare for your deposition today?

         12        A.    Yes, I did.

         13        Q.    What did you do?

         14        A.    I met with Uri and Andrew, for

         15    instance.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              And about how many times did you

         18    meet with them?

         19        A.    A few times.

         20        Q.    When was the first time that you

         21    met to prepare for your deposition?

          5        A.    Well, not all of it was about

          6    deposition, but I can't put a time on it.

          7    Maybe a couple of hours.  Maybe a little

          8    bit longer.

          9        Q.    And did you meet again the next

         10    day?

         11        A.    Yes, I did.

         12        Q.    And about how long did you meet

         13    that day?

         14        A.    How long for deposition?

         15        Q.    To prepare for today's

         16    deposition?

         17        A.    I do not know how much, what

         18    portion of that was for deposition and what

         19    was all of that.  But we met for a few

         20    hours on Wednesday as well and maybe a

         21    couple of hours on Thursday.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              Did you have any telephone calls

         24    as well in advance of your deposition to

         25    prepare for this?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Yeah, actually, I -- when -- a

          3    while ago I did once, yeah.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5              And when was that?

          6        A.    I don't remember, about maybe

          7    last month.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              Who was on that telephone call?

         10        A.    Uri, I think I remember, but I

         11    don't know the others.  Oh, Christian was

         12    there.

         13        Q.    And is that Christian Adler?

         14        A.    Yes, Christian Adler.

         15        Q.    And he's from Astra, correct?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Was there anyone else from Astra

         19    on that call?

         20        A.    I don't remember.

         21        Q.    During any of your calls or

         22    meetings to prepare for your deposition,

         23    was there anyone present other than your

         24    counsel from Mr. Itkin's firm or Astra's

         25    in-house counsel?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    I don't think so.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              Was Shikha Gupta on any of those

          5    calls or in any of those meetings?

          6        A.    Meetings, no.  Calls, I don't

          7    remember, she may have been actually.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              And Shikha Gupta is employed at

         10    Astra, is that correct?

         11        A.    Yes, that's right.

         12        Q.    And she's not an attorney,

         13    correct?

         14        A.    No.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16        A.    Not to my knowledge anyway.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Are you aware that Mr. Adler

         19    testified in connection with this matter

         20    last month?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              Have you spoken to Mr. Adler

         24    regarding his deposition?

         25        A.    Generally, yeah.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And when was that?

          3        A.    I think when he came back to

          4    London.

          5        Q.    And what did you discuss with

          6    Mr. Adler?

          7        A.    It was mostly about how he felt,

          8    uncomfortable, tense.  That's mostly about

          9    it.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              What did Mr. Adler tell you about

         12    his deposition?

         13        A.    That it was -- he said that you

         14    got to have to go through this, you can't

         15    really describe the feeling.  I think it

         16    was his first time as well and he says you

         17    have to be careful what you say.

         18        Q.    What else did Mr. Adler tell you

         19    about his deposition?

         20        A.    I mean, there were a few things

         21    we may have discussed, but anything

         22    specific -- no, we didn't go into details

         23    about anything that he discussed.  It was a

         24    very raw conversation, like how was it, did

         25    it go okay, kind of thing.  Not really he

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    ask me that and I said that, nothing of

          3    that sort.

          4        Q.    So you don't recall having any

          5    conversations --

          6        A.    No, there wasn't any like -- I

          7    mean, we just had a conversation, more

          8    about how he felt and what did he -- sorry,

          9    did he -- what was I saying -- the

         10    conversation was more about how he felt and

         11    did he do okay, did he not do okay, rather

         12    than about the content of the deposition

         13    per se.

         14        Q.    So you didn't discuss the

         15    substance of Mr. Adler's testimony with

         16    him?

         17        A.    He discuss one thing that he

         18    thought maybe we should clarify later on.

         19    That is one thing specific that we

         20    discussed.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22        A.    But other than the content of it,

         23    which actually I think Uri was on the call

         24    and we discussed whether or not we should

         25    clarify further to yourself.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              And what was the thing that you

          4    discussed clarifying?

          5        A.    I think about economic interest.

          6        Q.    Could you just explain what you

          7    mean by that?

          8        A.    I think you may have asked

          9    Dr. Adler a question about economic

         10    interest relating to Abacus Securities.

         11        Q.    Uh-huh.

         12        A.    And he may not have answered in

         13    the most pedantic manner.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              And could you just elaborate a

         16    little further what you mean by that?

         17        A.    What do you want me to elaborate?

         18    I don't quite understand.

         19        Q.    Sure.

         20              What information do you feel that

         21    you wanted to clarify specifically about

         22    Mr. Adler's answers?

         23        A.    Oh, sorry.  I didn't want to

         24    clarify anything.

         25        Q.    Okay.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              What was Mr. Adler's concern with

          3    respect to that clarification?

          4        A.    He said that he may not have

          5    answered it -- he may have understood you

          6    to be asking something else and he may have

          7    misunderstood what you asked.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              Have you reviewed the transcript

         10    of Mr. Adler's deposition?

         11        A.    No.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13              Did you review any documents to

         14    prepare for this deposition?

         15        A.    Like a legal doc?

         16        Q.    No, any documents to prepare.

         17        A.    Would you call e-mail a document?

         18        Q.    Yes.

         19        A.    I may have seen a couple of

         20    e-mails, yeah.

         21        Q.    Were there any documents that you

         22    reviewed that refreshed your recollection

         23    as to any issues related to this

         24    proceeding?

         25        A.    What does that mean actually,


                                                        19

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    refresh?

          3        Q.    Sure.

          4              So what that means is, is there

          5    anything that you did not recall before

          6    reviewing a document and then after

          7    reviewing a document you had a new

          8    recollection of what had happened?

          9        A.    Actually, I don't think so, no.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              In preparing for this deposition,

         12    did you review any documents that haven't

         13    been produced by Astra in this matter?

         14        A.    No.

         15        Q.    And have you spoken -- sorry.

         16        A.    Let me clarify that question.  I

         17    do not know exactly what has been produced

         18    because I did not go through all the

         19    discovery documentation.

         20        Q.    Uh-huh.

         21        A.    So I can't answer that with that

         22    accuracy that you probably expect me to.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24        A.    But not to my knowledge, is how I

         25    should put it probably.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Sure.

          3              And --

          4              MR. CROKE:  To counsel, I just

          5        request if there are any documents

          6        that Mr. Mathur reviewed that haven't

          7        been produced, we request that those

          8        be produced.

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Noted.

         10    BY MR. CROKE:

         11        Q.    Have you spoken with anyone at

         12    Astra other than Mr. Adler or Astra's

         13    in-house counsel about your deposition?

         14        A.    The question is -- could you

         15    clarify the question?  That I'm having a

         16    deposition?

         17        Q.    Sure.

         18              Have you had any conversations

         19    with anyone at Astra, other than Mr. Adler

         20    or Astra's in-house counsel, about the fact

         21    that you're having this deposition today?

         22        A.    I don't understand whether you're

         23    asking me if other people know about it.

         24    If you're asking me that question, the

         25    answer is yes, there are other people that


                                                        21

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    know I'm having a deposition.

          3        Q.    Setting aside just the fact that

          4    someone might be aware you're traveling or

          5    attending a deposition --

          6        A.    Yes.

          7        Q.    -- have you had any conversations

          8    with anyone at Astra other than Mr. Adler

          9    or Astra's in-house counsel about the

         10    substance of what you expect to say at

         11    today's deposition?

         12        A.    No, actually.  I don't think we

         13    prepared for that specific question you're

         14    asking for the deposition, what I'm going

         15    to say and so on -- no, that is not the

         16    kind of conversation I had with -- not even

         17    with Christian.

         18        Q.    Okay, great.  Thank you.

         19              And again, other than just, you

         20    know, the basic scheduling fact that you're

         21    having a deposition, have you spoken with

         22    anyone outside of Astra, other than counsel

         23    from Mr. Itkin's firm, about the substance

         24    of your deposition today?

         25        A.    I'm struggling with the word


                                                        22

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    "substance," to be honest.  For instance, I

          3    may have -- not may -- I did tell my wife

          4    that I'm having a deposition and she asked

          5    me what the deposition is and I explained

          6    to her.

          7        Q.    That's fair enough.

          8        A.    I'm just trying to be pedantic

          9    because my lawyer says say everything

         10    accurately today because he doesn't like it

         11    if you're not --

         12              MR. ITKIN:  Don't tell him

         13        everything I tell you.

         14              THE WITNESS:  Okay.

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Please.

         16        A.    No, no, I'm just trying to be

         17    accurate about it.

         18        Q.    I appreciate that.

         19        A.    So she did ask me what it is and

         20    I explained to her what a deposition is.

         21    If that is a substance, then yes, I talked

         22    about it.  But she's not in the industry,

         23    so she doesn't know what the real substance

         24    is, if I may say it that way.

         25        Q.    Understood.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              And other than your wife and

          3    other than conversations just about the

          4    fact that you would be traveling here for a

          5    deposition, have you had any conversations

          6    with anyone outside of Astra other than

          7    counsel about your deposition?

          8        A.    Not that I recall actually.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10        A.    And I would say that with a fair

         11    amount of certainty, I don't think that

         12    happened.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              I have a few questions about your

         15    education and professional history.

         16        A.    Uh-huh.

         17        Q.    Did you graduate from university?

         18        A.    Yes, I did.

         19        Q.    And when was that?

         20        A.    I graduated twice.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22        A.    So one is an undergrad and there

         23    is a postgraduate.

         24        Q.    And when were each of those?

         25        A.    I graduated in '97 for my

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    undergrad and 2004 for post grad.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              And do you have any professional

          5    licenses or certifications?

          6        A.    Like, there's something called CC

          7    in the UK, which is certification for

          8    securities.  I don't know whether you call

          9    it license, but if you call that a license,

         10    then yes.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12        A.    Certification.

         13        Q.    And is that something that comes

         14    from like the FCA, for example?

         15        A.    No, no, no.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17        A.    It's separate from that.  You

         18    take an exam.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20        A.    And you get a certification.

         21        Q.    Do you have any license or

         22    certification from, you know, like a

         23    governmental entity like the FCA or

         24    anything like that?

         25        A.    So I'm an approved person, for


                                                        25

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    instance, under the FCA.  I haven't checked

          3    whether it's called a license or not.  And

          4    I have -- I would rather put it this way,

          5    that it's an authorization to do certain

          6    tasks which are regulated activities.

          7              If you want to put that as a

          8    license, then yes.

          9        Q.    Sure.  Understood.

         10              After you received your graduate

         11    degree, did you become employed?

         12        A.    Yes.

         13        Q.    And where was that?

         14        A.    It was -- I don't remember the

         15    technical legal name of the entity, but it

         16    was in India.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18        A.    For a short period of time.  That

         19    was the first employment.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              And then did you leave that

         22    employment and take another job at some

         23    point?

         24        A.    Yes.

         25        Q.    And where was that second job?


                                                        26

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Second job was in Bangalore, and

          3    that was the most substantial duration.  I

          4    think technically the company was called

          5    Alliance Data.

          6        Q.    And did you --

          7        A.    I may not know the exact legal

          8    name, by the way.

          9        Q.    Did you at some point take a job

         10    with Deutsche Bank?

         11        A.    Yes.

         12        Q.    And when was that?

         13        A.    I started working at Deutsche in

         14    2006.

         15        Q.    And how long were you employed at

         16    Deutsche Bank?

         17        A.    I think quarter three 2012.  That

         18    was the last I was at DB.

         19        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         20    Bank, where were you employed?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    Where, as in what city?

         23        Q.    Sure, yeah.  Was it in London the

         24    entire time or were you in multiple offices

         25    during your time at Deutsche Bank?


                                                        27

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    So could you -- so when I say

          3    stationed in London, like a primary place

          4    of work?

          5        Q.    Yeah, yeah.  Where was your

          6    primary place of employment when you joined

          7    Deutsche Bank?

          8        A.    It was London.

          9        Q.    And was that your primary place

         10    of employment throughout your duration at

         11    Deutsche Bank?

         12        A.    My legal contract was with

         13    Deutsche Bank London branch.  It does not

         14    mean that I did not go to other offices and

         15    some of it could have been for meetings,

         16    some of it could have been work related and

         17    so on.

         18        Q.    Understood.

         19              But did you, for example, did you

         20    officially transfer to a different office

         21    within Deutsche Bank for some period of

         22    time?

         23        A.    Different city, you mean?

         24        Q.    Yes.

         25        A.    No.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    What was your role at Deutsche

          3    Bank when you first joined?

          4        A.    When you say "role," you mean

          5    what did I do?

          6        Q.    Yeah.

          7        A.    It's a wide variety of things

          8    that I did at Deutsche Bank.

          9        Q.    Such as what?

         10        A.    I mean, it varied from when I

         11    joined until the end.

         12        Q.    Uh-huh.

         13        A.    So it could be managing risk, for

         14    example, towards the end, managing a

         15    portfolio of assets.  To begin with, it

         16    could be simply, you know, making

         17    presentations, for instance.  All varied

         18    over a period of time.

         19        Q.    Were you a trader during your

         20    time at Deutsche Bank?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    And were you a trader from when

         23    you first joined Deutsche Bank?

         24        A.    Yes.

         25        Q.    And were you a trader until you


                                                        29

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    left Deutsche Bank?

          3        A.    A trader is very broad term.

          4        Q.    Uh-huh.

          5        A.    And the answer, a simple answer

          6    would be yes, and I'm not trying to be

          7    difficult, but it could mean a variety of

          8    things, as you probably understand.

          9        Q.    And so your role over time at

         10    Deutsche Bank evolved, is that correct?

         11        A.    Yes.

         12        Q.    In your role as a trader at

         13    Deutsche Bank, what types of things did you

         14    trade?

         15        A.    I assume you mean securities?

         16        Q.    Uh-huh, yes.

         17        A.    A wide variety of securities to

         18    include RMBS, CMBS, as an example.

         19        Q.    Sure.

         20              And by RMBS, you mean residential

         21    mortgage-backed securities?

         22        A.    Yes, that's what I mean.

         23        Q.    And CMBS is commercial

         24    mortgage-backed securities?

         25        A.    Yes.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Did you also -- during your time

          3    at Deutsche Bank, did you also trade

          4    collateralized debt obligations?

          5        A.    Yes, I did.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              And just so we're on the same

          8    page, I'll refer to that as CDOs, is that

          9    fair?

         10        A.    That is acceptable.

         11        Q.    And during your time at Deutsche

         12    Bank, did you also trade synthetic CDOs?

         13        A.    Do you basically understand what

         14    sort of trading a CDO means, if you don't

         15    mind me asking?

         16        Q.    Yeah.

         17        A.    You do?  So you don't quite trade

         18    a CDO.

         19        Q.    Uh-huh.

         20        A.    You can trade a CDO security, for

         21    instance.  That usually implies tranches of

         22    those.  What are you asking?

         23        Q.    I'm asking specifically did you

         24    trade securities issued in connection with

         25    synthetic CDOs.


                                                        31

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    It's a very broad question.  So

          3    CMBS is a security in connection with a CDO

          4    as well, and I've already answered that,

          5    but from memory you don't sort of trade a

          6    CDO, okay.  That's what I understand from

          7    it.

          8        Q.    Do you have an understanding of

          9    what it means to trade synthetic CDO

         10    securities?

         11        A.    I have an understanding what the

         12    layperson or another trader will say, but

         13    in your context that is not how I would put

         14    it as a trader.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              How would you put it as a trader?

         17        A.    What?

         18        Q.    If you were trying to describe a

         19    role that would involve, for example,

         20    trading securities issued by a synthetic

         21    CDO, how would you describe it?

         22        A.    Describe what, sorry?

         23        Q.    If you were trying to describe

         24    your role as someone who traded securities

         25    issued by a synthetic CDO, how would you


                                                        32

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    describe it?

          3        A.    See, from my understanding

          4    synthetic CDO doesn't issue security.  An

          5    SPV issues a security.  And an SPV issuer

          6    may issue a security, and if those

          7    securities are tradable instruments, then

          8    yes, you would trade them.

          9        Q.    And did you trade those types of

         10    securities during your time at Deutsche

         11    Bank?

         12        A.    You mean the securities issued by

         13    an SPV?

         14        Q.    The securities issued by an SPV

         15    that has a synthetic CDO, did you trade

         16    those types of securities during your time

         17    at Deutsche Bank?

         18        A.    I'm trying to make it easier.  If

         19    you're asking me if I traded synthetic ABS

         20    CDO tranche securities, the answer is yes.

         21        Q.    Okay, thank you.

         22              Do you have an understanding of

         23    what a synthetic CDO is?

         24        A.    I have a broad understanding of

         25    it.


                                                        33

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    What is a synthetic CDO?

          3        A.    Again, it's a very large asset

          4    class, very similar to law and similar to

          5    corporate law.  I can go on and on for like

          6    an hour, but if you'll be a little bit more

          7    specific, then I would answer that question

          8    in a more specific fashion.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10              How does a synthetic CDO differ

         11    from a non-synthetic CDO?

         12        A.    There is nothing called a

         13    non-synthetic CDO.

         14        Q.    Synthetic CDO --

         15        A.    That I understand.

         16        Q.    A synthetic CDO is a subset of

         17    CDOs, is that correct?

         18        A.    I wouldn't put it that way.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20              How would you put it?

         21        A.    A synthetic CDO is synthetic CDO.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              You traded collateralized debt

         24    obligations during your time at Deutsche

         25    Bank, correct?


                                                        34

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Well, I clarified earlier you

          3    don't trade -- in my opinion, you don't

          4    trade collateralized debt obligation, you

          5    trade securities, which are tranches of

          6    collateralized debt obligations.

          7        Q.    Yes.

          8              And certain CDOs are also

          9    synthetic CDOs, is that correct?

         10        A.    That is correct.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              So what is the difference between

         13    securities issued by an SPV that is a

         14    synthetic CDO and securities issued by an

         15    SPV that is not a synthetic CDO?

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         17        A.    I just -- you're asking the same

         18    question twice again, and I have exactly

         19    the same non-understanding of it.  Are you

         20    asking me to compare SPV can issue a

         21    commercial mortgage-backed securitization

         22    and it will also be a non-synthetic

         23    obligation backed by debt?

         24        Q.    Uh-huh.

         25        A.    Not necessarily -- I do not think

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    you're asking that question.  I'm asking

          3    you to clarify.  You can't just simply say

          4    what is X and what is not X.  The "not X"

          5    could be a million of other things.

          6              So if you're not being specific,

          7    I won't be able to answer.  Are you asking

          8    me to compare a synthetic CDO with

          9    something that is not a synthetic CDO?

         10        Q.    I'm asking you what the

         11    difference is between a CDO that is not a

         12    synthetic CDO and a synthetic CDO.  What is

         13    the difference between those, to your

         14    understanding?

         15        A.    Okay.

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         17        A.    You're asking the same question

         18    again and again and I'm unable to answer in

         19    the form you're asking.  So if you would

         20    like me to make certain assumptions such as

         21    a debt obligation that has a loan on it,

         22    behind it, I can do that -- but please, I'm

         23    helping you to ask me the right question

         24    here.  You're not asking the question that

         25    I can answer in 30 seconds.

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              During your time at Deutsche

          4    Bank, did you ever structure CDOs?

          5        A.    I was a part of the structuring

          6    team.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              During your time at Deutsche

          9    Bank, did you ever structure synthetic

         10    CDOs?

         11        A.    Same.  I was a part of a

         12    structuring team that structured synthetic

         13    CDOs.

         14        Q.    In connection with synthetic

         15    CDOs, are you familiar with the concept of

         16    collateral securities?

         17        A.    I am, broadly speaking.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19              What is your understanding of

         20    what collateral securities are in

         21    connection with a synthetic CDO?

         22        A.    It depends on the kind of

         23    synthetic CDO.

         24        Q.    How does it depend on the kind of

         25    synthetic CDO?


                                                        37

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    There are different varieties of

          3    synthetic CDOs that are out there.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5        A.    For example, a synthetic CDO

          6    could all have, for instance, collateral

          7    securities that are also what we know as

          8    reference obligation and some that have

          9    only unfunded securities, and it will be

         10    different in both cases.

         11        Q.    What are the purposes of

         12    collateral --

         13        A.    And this is not -- I'm sorry,

         14    didn't mean to talk over you.

         15        Q.    No, go ahead.

         16        A.    But to clarify, these are not the

         17    only types of synthetic securities.  There

         18    could be way, many more out of that.

         19        Q.    Uh-huh.

         20              What are the purposes of

         21    collateral securities in a synthetic CDO?

         22              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         23        A.    It really, synthetic CDOs are

         24    wasteful instruments and it could be what

         25    the counterparties want it to be.  It's


                                                        38

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    usually a bilaterally structured

          3    instrument.

          4        Q.    But specifically, what is the

          5    purpose of the collateral securities in

          6    connection with the synthetic CDO?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Same objection.

          8        A.    My answer is not going to be very

          9    different from what I said before.  If you

         10    give me a specific instance, I'll try and

         11    answer that.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13              Do CDOs that are not synthetic

         14    CDOs have collateral securities?

         15        A.    Yes, they may very well be.

         16        Q.    Separate and apart from the

         17    reference portfolio?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    There is no reference portfolio

         20    in a non-synthetic CDO.  It could just be

         21    collateral securities.

         22        Q.    In a synthetic CDO, there is a

         23    credit default swap between the SPV and a

         24    credit default swap counterparty, is that

         25    correct?


                                                        39

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    Yeah, in some cases, it is

          4    correct.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              And a credit default swap that

          7    references a portfolio of securities is

          8    typically referred to as a reference

          9    portfolio, correct?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11        A.    In some synthetic securities that

         12    are backed by CDO obligation, it could be

         13    correct.

         14        Q.    And in those circumstances when

         15    investors purchase notes from the CDO, the

         16    cash that investors use is not used to

         17    invest directly in cash securities, but

         18    rather to invest in collateral securities,

         19    is that correct?

         20        A.    Not always.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              When is it not?

         23              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         24        A.    When the underlying reference

         25    obligation is funded.


                                                        40

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And I'm talking specifically here

          3    about synthetic CDOs where the reference

          4    obligations are not funded and the exposure

          5    that the SPV has is through a credit

          6    default swap.

          7              In those circumstances, the cash

          8    that comes from investors that purchase

          9    securities can be invested in collateral

         10    securities, is that correct?

         11        A.    Yes, in some case, yes.

         12        Q.    And in those circumstances, what

         13    is the purpose of the collateral

         14    securities?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    Well, it depends on what kind of

         17    security we're talking about here.  There

         18    are multiple answers to that question.

         19        Q.    Okay.  Could you give me one?

         20        A.    Yes.  The cash in a specific

         21    circumstance, which could be a credit link

         22    note, which is what I was hoping you would

         23    talk about, you seem to be alluding to

         24    that.  In that case, if the noteholder is a

         25    non-bank entity, then unrated position, and


                                                        41

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    if they post cash as a collateral to the

          3    SPV specifically, then that SPV could put

          4    that money or cash in securities or

          5    deposits.

          6        Q.    And if the SPV puts that money in

          7    securities, what is the purpose of those

          8    securities?

          9        A.    In some cases --

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11        A.    In some cases, the purpose could

         12    be to generate LIBOR.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              Are there any other purposes?

         15        A.    There could be.

         16        Q.    Can you think of any?

         17        A.    Think of any in the sense that --

         18    other than the fact that they are

         19    collateral securities?

         20        Q.    I'm asking you could you think of

         21    any purposes of the collateral securities

         22    other than the one you just mentioned,

         23    which is to generate LIBOR?

         24        A.    Other than them being a

         25    collateral?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Well, what is the purpose of them

          3    being the collateral?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    You want me to redefine the word

          6    "collateral"?

          7        Q.    No.  I'm asking you what is the

          8    purpose of them being of collateral

          9    securities?  You just identified that as

         10    one of the purposes of them.

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    To be the collateral of the

         13    security.

         14        Q.    And what is the reason for there

         15    being collateral in the synthetic CDO?

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         17        A.    As I said, that is the essence of

         18    collateralized debt obligation.

         19        Q.    And what is the collateral used

         20    for?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    I just explained to you one of

         23    the reasons is to generate LIBOR.

         24        Q.    Are there any other reasons?

         25        A.    Well, it depends.  It's


                                                        43

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    synthetic securities.  The primary reason

          3    that comes to my mind is to generate LIBOR.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5        A.    Could two synthetic parties

          6    decide that the collateral securities could

          7    also generate something else?  Yes.  But

          8    that is not the primary purpose of it.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10        A.    Other than being collateral.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              Do collateral securities in a

         13    synthetic CDO typically have to satisfy

         14    eligibility criteria?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    If a synthetic CDO is structured

         17    to have eligible collateral securities,

         18    then the answer will be yes.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20              Do you have an understanding of

         21    what those criteria typically are?

         22              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         23        A.    There is not typical criteria.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25        A.    That I understand.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Do you have an understanding of

          3    how those criteria are typically set?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    If I don't see there is a typical

          6    criteria, how can they be typically set?

          7    Or can you explain that to me.

          8        Q.    Sure.

          9              My question to you is do you have

         10    an understanding of how it is that the

         11    eligibility criteria in a synthetic CDO are

         12    negotiated?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    So you're asking me how do people

         15    negotiate part of the contract?

         16        Q.    You just said that in a

         17    collateral security there are typically --

         18    sorry, in a synthetic CDO in which there

         19    are collateral securities that there can be

         20    eligibility criteria for those collateral

         21    securities, correct?

         22        A.    I didn't say that.  You did.

         23        Q.    I'm asking you, again, for

         24    synthetic CDOs with collateral securities,

         25    are there typically a set of eligibility


                                                        45

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    criteria that the collateral securities

          3    must satisfy?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    I already answered that question.

          6    I'll try and do it differently.

          7              In some synthetic securities,

          8    there could be an eligibility criteria.

          9    But it doesn't have to have one.

         10        Q.    And in the synthetic CDOs where

         11    there is a set of eligibility criteria, do

         12    you have an understanding of how those

         13    criteria are typically determined?

         14              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         15        A.    I answered that question as well

         16    before, that there is no typical

         17    determination or a typical eligibility

         18    criteria in the first place.  So, unless

         19    you're being -- unless you be specific

         20    about are you asking me how is it being

         21    negotiated -- I don't understand the

         22    question.

         23        Q.    My question is not about whether

         24    there is -- at this point my question is

         25    not whether there is specifically a typical


                                                        46

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    set of criteria.

          3              The question is specifically

          4    this:  In a synthetic CDO in which there is

          5    criteria for the collateral securities, do

          6    you have an understanding of how the

          7    parties that are structuring that synthetic

          8    CDO typically agree on that set of

          9    criteria?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11        A.    Okay.  From what I understand

         12    from your question is yes.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              And what is your understanding?

         15        A.    They talk to each other.

         16        Q.    And who are the parties in that

         17    circumstance?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    Could you be more specific, which

         20    parties you're talking about?

         21        Q.    Sure.

         22              You said that you structured CDO,

         23    synthetic CDO during your time at Deutsche

         24    Bank, is that correct?

         25        A.    I answered that already, yes.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              Did any of the synthetic CDOs

          4    that you structured during your time at

          5    Deutsche Bank have collateral securities in

          6    them?

          7        A.    Yes.

          8        Q.    Did any of those synthetic CDOs

          9    that you structured during your time at

         10    Deutsche Bank that had collateral

         11    securities in them have any eligibility

         12    criteria for those collateral securities?

         13        A.    Some of them may have had, but I

         14    don't recall at the moment.

         15        Q.    And do you recall how it was that

         16    during your time at Deutsche Bank when you

         17    structured synthetic CDOs that you agreed

         18    on those eligibility criteria?

         19              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         20        A.    I just said that I don't recall

         21    having a set of eligibility criteria in the

         22    ones that I was a part of structuring.

         23        Q.    So to be clear, is it that you

         24    don't recall whether any of the synthetic

         25    CDOs that you were involved in structuring


                                                        48

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    had eligibility criteria?

          3        A.    Correct.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5              So you don't recall, one way or

          6    the other, it's not that you recall, but

          7    don't recall how they were set?

          8              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          9        A.    No.  I didn't say that, actually.

         10    I said something completely different.

         11              I said I don't recall the ones

         12    that I structured actually having an

         13    eligibility criteria.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              For synthetic CDOs where there is

         16    a set of eligibility criteria for the

         17    collateral securities, do you have an

         18    understanding of where those eligibility

         19    criteria would typically be listed?

         20              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         21        A.    You're talking about which legal

         22    doc, is that the question?

         23        Q.    Yes.

         24        A.    It could be multiple locations.

         25    It depends on the structure of the


                                                        49

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    synthetic security.  If it has a trust

          3    deed, it could be part of that.  Sometimes

          4    it could be a part of CDS.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6        A.    So it could be different places,

          7    yeah.

          8        Q.    But you, yourself, during your

          9    career, have reviewed offering documents

         10    for synthetic CDOs that describe the

         11    eligibility criteria for collateral

         12    securities, is that correct?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    Yes, I have.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              And in those instances, where was

         17    the eligibility criteria listed?

         18        A.    I think I answered that it varies

         19    depending on the docs that I'm reviewing.

         20    It could be in the CDOs doc, it could be

         21    trust indenture, it could be elsewhere,

         22    too.

         23        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         24    Bank, did you enter into credit default

         25    swaps referencing any structured products?


                                                        50

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Simply put, yes.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              Did that include CDS referencing

          5    CDOs?

          6        A.    There's a good chance I may have.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              During your time at Deutsche

          9    Bank, did you purchase securities in

         10    initial offerings?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    I don't recall I did, actually.

         13        Q.    So during your time at Deutsche

         14    Bank, the securities that you traded, you

         15    traded in the secondary market exclusively,

         16    is that correct?

         17        A.    You're talking about my personal

         18    expertise here or my personal experience

         19    here, right?

         20        Q.    I'm talking about you in your

         21    role at Deutsche Bank.

         22        A.    So me in my role at Deutsche

         23    Bank, whether I personally bought and sold

         24    primary synthetic securities?

         25        Q.    We'll start with you personally,


                                                        51

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    your role.

          3              During your time as a trader at

          4    Deutsche Bank, did you decide in your role

          5    at Deutsche Bank to invest in securities in

          6    initial offerings?

          7        A.    Did I make a decision myself to

          8    invest in synthetic securities?

          9        Q.    Securities, initial offerings,

         10    not specifically limited to synthetic

         11    securities.

         12        A.    I don't recall making a decision

         13    such as that.

         14        Q.    Did people who reported to you at

         15    Deutsche Bank, during your time at Deutsche

         16    Bank, invest in securities and initial

         17    offerings?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    You're asking me to speculate

         20    whether other people who work for me, did

         21    they buy synthetic securities or securities

         22    in general, IPO?

         23        Q.    I'm not asking you to speculate.

         24    I'm asking you whether, during your time at

         25    Deutsche Bank, you know if the people who


                                                        52

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    reported to you invested in securities in

          3    initial offerings?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    They may have.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              During your time at Deutsche

          8    Bank, did you invest in securities through

          9    the secondary market?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11        A.    Yes.

         12        Q.    And during your time at Deutsche

         13    Bank, did people who reported to you invest

         14    in securities in the secondary market?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    Some kind of securities, yes.

         17        Q.    So is it fair to say that during

         18    your time at Deutsche Bank, you and the

         19    people who reported to you invested in

         20    securities through the secondary market,

         21    not through initial offerings?

         22        A.    I didn't say that.  You asked me

         23    a very different question earlier.  You're

         24    changing the question now.

         25              People who reported to me could


                                                        53

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    have invested both in primary and secondary

          3    market.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5        A.    You didn't specify the time

          6    limit, so I do not know whether you're

          7    saying while I was their boss did they

          8    issue and purchase primary securities or

          9    trade or not.  So if you will be specific,

         10    I'll answer specifically.

         11        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         12    Bank, did you focus on trading securities

         13    with particular credit ratings?

         14              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         15        A.    I'm struggling with the word

         16    "focus" here.  Did I focus on it?  No.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              So, for example, you weren't a

         19    trader on a desk that only invested in

         20    AAA-rated securities, right?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    Correct.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              During your time at Deutsche

         25    Bank, did you invest in any unrated


                                                        54

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    securities?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          4        A.    Did I personally?

          5        Q.    Were you, in your role at

          6    Deutsche Bank, did you make the decision to

          7    invest in any unrated securities?

          8              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          9        A.    So the question is whether I made

         10    a decision to invest in unrated securities.

         11    I may have made a decision to invest in

         12    unrated securities.  I don't recall.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              During your time at Deutsche

         15    Bank, what was your typical investment

         16    process for deciding whether to purchase a

         17    security?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    Well, it would depend on, it

         20    would depend on time, year, month, date and

         21    what you're looking to do with that time,

         22    depending on our desk strategy at that

         23    time.

         24        Q.    So the process that you would use

         25    would change depending on your desk


                                                        55

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    strategy?

          3        A.    Would change, yes, correct.

          4        Q.    How did it change?

          5              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          6        A.    Could you be more specific?

          7        Q.    Sure.

          8              For example, during your time at

          9    Deutsche Bank when you were deciding

         10    whether or not to invest in a security,

         11    would you typically review offering

         12    documents for that security?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    Yes, you would, but that is not

         15    how you start the decision.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              How would you start the decision?

         18        A.    As I said, it starts with a

         19    broader strategy first.

         20        Q.    Were there times -- during your

         21    time at Deutsche Bank, were there times

         22    that you decided to invest in securities

         23    that you did not review the offering

         24    materials?

         25              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.


                                                        56

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Yeah, there could have been.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              During your time at Deutsche

          5    Bank, in deciding whether to invest in

          6    securities, did you typically review

          7    trustee reports issued in connection with

          8    those securities?

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Same objection.

         10        A.    Did I personally review trustee

         11    reports?

         12        Q.    Sure, you can start there.

         13        A.    I may have reviewed some trustee

         14    reports.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              Was it your typical practice in

         17    deciding whether to invest in a security to

         18    review the trustee reports for that

         19    security?

         20              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         21        A.    I said to you before it depends

         22    on -- I have a problem understanding the

         23    word "typically" with you.  So help me out

         24    here so that I can answer truthfully to

         25    you.

          2              There is no typical process.  It

          3    depends on what the strategy of the desk is

          4    at the time.

          5        Q.    So the strategy of the desk at

          6    the time affects whether or not you would

          7    review trustee reports before deciding to

          8    invest in a security?

          9        A.    There may not be a trustee

         10    report, for instance.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              What are the circumstances where

         13    there wouldn't be trustee reports

         14    available?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    The security hasn't been issued,

         17    for instance.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19              And -- but you don't recall any

         20    circumstances in which, during your time at

         21    Deutsche Bank, you invested in securities

         22    in the initial offering, right?

         23        A.    But that is not the only

         24    circumstances where there may not be a

         25    trustee report available.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              And when trustee reports were

          4    available, was it your typical practice

          5    during your time at Deutsche Bank to review

          6    trustee reports before deciding whether to

          7    invest in a security?

          8              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          9        A.    I can answer that question again

         10    in the same way.  There is no typical way

         11    of investing in a security.  Would I review

         12    some trustee reports when it is relevant?

         13    Yes.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              When would the trustee reports

         16    not be relevant to your decision to invest

         17    in a security?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19              Just so the record is clear, are

         20        we talking about any time, ever, in

         21        any security in the entire world?  Do

         22        you want to -- I just want the record

         23        to reflect that it not be skewed later

         24        on.

         25        A.    I'm just trying to answer your


                                                        59

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    question in all honesty.  Not all

          3    securities have trustee reports.

          4        Q.    Understood.

          5        A.    Or the ones that do have it may

          6    not be available.

          7        Q.    Understood.

          8        A.    Or equity securities, for

          9    example, just don't call them trustee

         10    reports, for instance.

         11        Q.    Uh-huh.

         12              For structured products such as

         13    RMBS, CMBS and CDOs, in circumstances where

         14    trustee reports were available, during your

         15    time at Deutsche Bank, would you typically

         16    review those trustee reports before

         17    deciding whether to invest?

         18        A.    I already said would I review in

         19    some cases, yes.  Would I review in some

         20    other cases?  No.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              What were the circumstances in

         23    which there would be trustee reports

         24    available for a structured product and that

         25    you would not review them before deciding

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    whether to invest?

          3        A.    Let's say, for example --

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    Let's say, for example, a

          6    security was issued last month.  The

          7    trustee report is available and I may not

          8    decide not to review it because it may not

          9    be relevant at that point of time.

         10        Q.    And why would it not be relevant?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    The credit migration is really

         13    what's reflected in a trustee report, a

         14    month after the issuance.  Nothing really

         15    changes.

         16        Q.    Uh-huh.

         17        A.    And you may not want to review it

         18    because there are other more important

         19    things to review in that document, such as

         20    a structure, such as a cash waterfall, such

         21    as the real difference between the draft

         22    redline that you've seen versus the actual

         23    doc.

         24        Q.    Uh-huh.

         25        A.    That's what become more relevant.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    So there could be various circumstances

          3    where I may have decided it.  I understand

          4    that you're not on a trading desk, but

          5    you're not asking me questions that I can

          6    help you answer appropriately and

          7    truthfully, and you asked me to testify

          8    under oath.

          9              I'm trying to do the best I can

         10    to answer your question, but please ask a

         11    specific question so I'll give you a

         12    specific answer.  You're asking the same

         13    question three times and I'm getting

         14    confused as to what you're asking me.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              In circumstances in which a

         17    security had been issued a year or two

         18    prior, so there are a year or two of

         19    trustee reports that are available, during

         20    your time at Deutsche Bank, were there any

         21    circumstances in which you would make a

         22    decision to invest in that security without

         23    reviewing those trustee reports?

         24        A.    Yes, I can -- how would my answer

         25    change -- you're asking the same question.


                                                        62

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Yes, I could have done it.

          3        Q.    And in a situation in which there

          4    is a year or two of trustee reports

          5    available, what would the reason be that

          6    you would not need to review those trustee

          7    reports in deciding whether or not to

          8    invest in that security?

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         10        A.    It could be a multitude of

         11    reasons.

         12        Q.    Can you give me one?

         13        A.    Sure.  I don't quite know where

         14    we're getting here, to be honest, but, for

         15    example, a securities already been written

         16    down that I'm looking to purchase and I

         17    already know that the security is written

         18    down, the value is close to zero.

         19        Q.    Uh-huh.

         20        A.    It doesn't matter what the

         21    trustee report says.  I'm going to buy it

         22    anyway for a price I'm looking to buy it.

         23    The reason the purchase could be different

         24    from investing in it, for instance.

         25        Q.    Uh-huh.


                                                        63

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    So yes, I would do that in those

          3    circumstances.

          4        Q.    Were there other sources of

          5    information that you would review in

          6    deciding whether or not to purchase a

          7    security during your time at Deutsche Bank

          8    beyond trustee reports and offering

          9    documents?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11        A.    Of course.

         12        Q.    And what were those other sources

         13    of information?

         14        A.    Bloomberg, for instance.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              Any others that you can think of?

         17        A.    Yeah, it's -- it could be index,

         18    for example.

         19        Q.    Would you typically review rating

         20    agency reports, if they were available, in

         21    deciding whether or not to purchase a

         22    security during your time at Deutsche Bank?

         23        A.    In some cases, yes.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25              During your time at Deutsche

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Bank, was your investment process different

          3    for synthetic CDOs as compared to other

          4    types of securities?

          5        A.    It, again, depends.  And I'm

          6    trying to answer the word if it comes to

          7    investment process.  The investment process

          8    depends on a multitude of factors, as I

          9    said previously.  It depends on the time

         10    when I'm buying and selling these

         11    securities.

         12        Q.    Uh-huh.

         13        A.    And if it was such a great set of

         14    investment processes back at DB, I cannot

         15    compare one versus the one that we do at

         16    Astra.

         17        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         18    Bank, what were the factors that you

         19    considered when you were deciding whether

         20    or not to invest in a synthetic CDO?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    Amongst other things, what my

         23    view is in the market on the underlying

         24    assets or whether or not, for instance, am

         25    I short a security, am I -- wanted to buy

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    to cover a short, for instance, I might see

          3    there is a value proposition in the market,

          4    for instance.  There are a multitude of

          5    factors, as I said.

          6        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

          7    Bank, did you typically consider the

          8    collateral securities in a synthetic CDO

          9    when deciding whether to invest in a

         10    synthetic CDO?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    What do you mean by what

         13    typically?  Explain to me, maybe we'll help

         14    each other a little bit more.

         15        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         16    Bank, you invested in synthetic CDOs,

         17    correct?

         18        A.    Yes.

         19        Q.    When you invested in synthetic

         20    CDOs during your time at Deutsche Bank, did

         21    you typically review the collateral

         22    securities in those synthetic CDOs in

         23    connection with deciding to invest?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

         25        answered.

          2    BY MR. CROKE:

          3        Q.    You can answer.

          4        A.    I take you back to what I said

          5    earlier.  Not all synthetic securities may

          6    have collateral securities.

          7        Q.    Uh-huh.

          8        A.    I asked you before what does

          9    "typically" mean to you.  And if you help

         10    me understand what does typically mean, if

         11    there isn't a typical synthetic CDO with

         12    collateral securities, how can I have a

         13    typical answer to a question that doesn't

         14    have a typical instance?

         15        Q.    What does typical mean to you?

         16        A.    Something that has a

         17    frequent-enough occurrence.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19        A.    What does it mean to you?

         20        Q.    At your time at Deutsche Bank,

         21    when you were deciding whether or not to

         22    invest in synthetic CDOs that had

         23    collateral securities, was it your practice

         24    to review the collateral securities before

         25    deciding whether to invest?

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    I may have, yes.

          4        Q.    But was it your practice to do

          5    so?

          6              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          7        A.    When it was relevant, yes.

          8        Q.    When would it be relevant?

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         10        A.    It would depend on the

         11    circumstance.  Look, securities trading is

         12    a fairly complicated area.  Credit debt,

         13    which is CDO, synthetic CDOs, are probably

         14    one of the most complex end of the

         15    spectrum.

         16              Synthetic itself doesn't have a

         17    typical thing.  It's usually bilaterally

         18    negotiated asset.  You don't have a

         19    typically frequently agreed instance once

         20    it's a collateral security, as by reference

         21    obligation in the first place.  There is no

         22    typical procedure of doing it.

         23              And I can repeat it as many

         24    number of times if you like, but I'm just

         25    not getting your question.  If you can

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    simply answer what you mean by typical, I

          3    would try and answer that better.

          4        Q.    In the circumstances in which it

          5    was relevant to you to review the

          6    collateral securities in a synthetic CDO

          7    before deciding whether to invest in a

          8    synthetic CDO during your time at Deutsche

          9    Bank, what was it that made the collateral

         10    securities relevant to you?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    The mere existence of it could

         13    make it relevant, for instance, in some

         14    cases.  But it really depends on the asset.

         15        Q.    In the circumstances in which you

         16    invest in synthetic CDOs during your time

         17    at Deutsche Bank and the synthetic CDOs had

         18    collateral securities that you did not

         19    review the collateral securities, why would

         20    it not have been relevant in those

         21    circumstances?

         22              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         23        A.    Again, multiple reasons.  For

         24    example, if I have put those collateral

         25    security in it.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              Are there other reasons why it

          4    wouldn't have been relevant?

          5        A.    If the collateral is cash, for

          6    instance, it might be relevant.

          7        Q.    Any other reasons that you could

          8    think of?

          9        A.    There could be more, but -- there

         10    could probably be a sequence of other

         11    reasons, yeah.

         12        Q.    If the synthetic CDO was

         13    over-collateralized, would that be a reason

         14    why it would not be relevant?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    What do you mean by

         17    over-collateralized?

         18        Q.    Do you have an understanding of

         19    what it means for a synthetic CDO to be

         20    over-collateralized?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    Do you understand that

         23    over-collateralized is a specific technical

         24    term?

         25        Q.    I'm asking do you have an


                                                        70

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    understanding of what it means for a

          3    synthetic CDO to be over-collateralized.

          4        A.    I do.  But I don't think we are

          5    on the same page, Jake.

          6        Q.    Can you explain your

          7    understanding?

          8        A.    Over-collateralization happens

          9    for every tranche in a security in every

         10    single asset.  And no, that has no

         11    relevance to whether or not you review

         12    collateral security.  That's why I'm saying

         13    I think if I answer that question, you will

         14    receive it the wrong way.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              Do you have an understanding of

         17    what it means for a synthetic CDO to have

         18    collateral in it in excess of the

         19    outstanding balance of the notes that were

         20    issued by the synthetic CDO?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    The notional balance?

         23        Q.    Is that a question?

         24        A.    Yes.

         25        Q.    The notional balance of the


                                                        71

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    synthetic CDO?

          3        A.    No, are you asking -- could there

          4    be a notional balance higher?

          5        Q.    I'm asking are you aware of any

          6    circumstance in which, for example, there

          7    is a synthetic CDO with $100 million

          8    notional of notes that are outstanding and

          9    $110 million of collateral?

         10        A.    My question is, is your question

         11    about $110 million of notional?

         12        Q.    Of the collateral.

         13        A.    Of notional?

         14        Q.    You're saying notional.  Are you

         15    referring to the notional of the securities

         16    issued by the synthetic CDO or the notional

         17    of the collateral securities in the

         18    synthetic security --

         19        A.    I'm asking you a question.

         20    You're saying $110 million, what, what is

         21    $110 million?

         22        Q.    Are you aware of any

         23    circumstances in which you can have a

         24    synthetic CDO that is issued $100 million

         25    notional of outstanding securities and


                                                        72

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    where the synthetic CDO holds collateral

          3    with a notional value of, for example, $110

          4    million?

          5        A.    It can happen.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              And in circumstances like that,

          8    how would you describe that synthetic CDO?

          9    Would you describe it as

         10    over-collateralized?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    No.

         13        Q.    Would you describe it as having

         14    excess collateral?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    No.

         17        Q.    Okay.  I just want to make sure

         18    we're taking on the same page.

         19        A.    You keep using a technical term,

         20    over-collateralization.

         21        Q.    Uh-huh.

         22        A.    And I'm asking you a question,

         23    you don't answer my question.  So I've not

         24    been able to answer it accurately as how

         25    I'm going to put this thing on this matter.


                                                        73

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Is there a term you would use to

          3    describe that circumstance that I just gave

          4    you?

          5        A.    There is no technical term on the

          6    circumstance that you gave me.

          7        Q.    How would you describe that

          8    circumstance?

          9        A.    I asked you a question, when you

         10    say $110 million of collateral security,

         11    and you didn't answer my question -- hence

         12    I'm not able to answer your question.  Are

         13    you telling me $110 million of notional,

         14    Jake, of collateral securities?

         15        Q.    My question to you was:  Are you

         16    aware of any circumstances in which you can

         17    have a synthetic CDO that is issuing $100

         18    million notional of outstanding securities

         19    and where the synthetic CDO holds

         20    collateral with a notional value of, for

         21    example, $110 million?

         22        A.    Uh-huh.

         23        Q.    And you responded it can happen.

         24              So my question to you now is, how

         25    would you describe the circumstance that I


                                                        74

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    just described to you?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          4        A.    There is no description of the

          5    circumstance as a technical word.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              In a circumstance such as the one

          8    I just described, if you were making a

          9    decision whether or not to invest in the

         10    securities from that CDO, would it be your

         11    practice to review the collateral

         12    securities in that synthetic CDO?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    It could be, if it is relevant at

         15    this time.

         16        Q.    And what might make it relevant?

         17        A.    What the collateral security is

         18    inside it.

         19        Q.    Why would that be relevant?

         20        A.    The market value of it, for

         21    instance.  There are multiple reasons of

         22    how it could be relevant, or irrelevant for

         23    that matter.

         24        Q.    What are some of the reasons that

         25    might make it relevant?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    As I said, the riskiness of

          4    collateral securities, for instance.

          5        Q.    Why would the riskiness of the

          6    collateral securities be relevant?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          8        A.    In a circumstance that I'm

          9    thinking about, if noteholders bear the

         10    risk of those collateral securities, then

         11    in those circumstances I would look to

         12    review them.

         13        Q.    During your time at Deutsche Bank

         14    when you were deciding whether to invest in

         15    synthetic CDOs that had collateral

         16    securities, was it your practice to review

         17    the eligibility criteria for the collateral

         18    securities?

         19              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         20        A.    Again, I'm struggling with the

         21    word "practice."  Could you rephrase it

         22    without using the word practice?

         23        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         24    Bank, when you were deciding whether to

         25    invest in synthetic CDOs that had


                                                        76

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    collateral securities, did you ever review

          3    the collateral -- the eligibility criteria

          4    for those collateral securities?

          5              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          6        A.    If I ever.  I may have.

          7        Q.    Why would you review the

          8    eligibility criteria in those

          9    circumstances?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11        A.    As I previously mentioned, I

         12    don't recall.  Are you talking about

         13    secondary market as well?

         14        Q.    My question is very general.

         15              I asked you:  During your time at

         16    Deutsche Bank, when you were deciding

         17    whether to invest in synthetic CDOs that

         18    had collateral securities, whether you ever

         19    reviewed the eligibility criteria for those

         20    collateral securities?

         21        A.    And I said I may have.

         22        Q.    Do you recall any specific

         23    instance in which you did so?

         24        A.    I don't recall a specific

         25    instance, though.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              During your time at Deutsche

          4    Bank, after purchasing a security were you

          5    involved in monitoring the performance of

          6    those securities?

          7        A.    I may have been involved in

          8    monitoring.

          9        Q.    And what would your role

         10    typically be in connection with monitoring

         11    securities?

         12        A.    I don't recall having a typical

         13    monitoring role.

         14        Q.    Do you recall any specific

         15    instances in which you were involved in

         16    monitoring securities during your time at

         17    Deutsche Bank?

         18        A.    As I said, I may have monitored

         19    some securities, but not typically.

         20    Typically my role wasn't to monitor

         21    securities.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              Understanding that you may have

         24    done it --

         25        A.    Yeah.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    -- sitting here today, do you

          3    recall any specific instances during your

          4    time at Deutsche Bank where you were

          5    involved in monitoring securities that you

          6    had invested in?

          7        A.    A specific instance, no.  It

          8    doesn't come to my mind right now.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10              Did your role at Deutsche Bank

         11    involve managing the risk of a portfolio of

         12    securities?

         13        A.    Yes, at some point it did.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              And was that a responsibility

         16    that you gained over time at your time at

         17    Deutsche Bank?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    Yes.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              At the time you left Deutsche

         22    Bank, how large was the portfolio

         23    securities for which you were managing the

         24    risk?

         25        A.    Very large, is all I can say.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    In the order of billions of

          3    dollars?

          4        A.    I'm sorry, I won't be comfortable

          5    answering that question, to be honest.

          6    It's a specific matter confidential to my

          7    previous employer.

          8        Q.    Could you explain what you mean

          9    by that?

         10        A.    You're talking about my time at

         11    Deutsche Bank?

         12        Q.    Uh-huh.

         13        A.    I can only answer generally

         14    questions about it, but I would be

         15    uncomfortable answering questions relating

         16    to specificity regarding my role at DB.

         17        Q.    And why would you be

         18    uncomfortable answering that?

         19        A.    Part of it has to do with the

         20    fact that I recall having a confidentiality

         21    agreement.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              And that's a confidentiality

         24    agreement between you and Deutsche Bank?

         25        A.    Yes.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              And you believe that that

          4    confidentiality agreement prohibits you

          5    from answering my questions today?

          6              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  That's

          7        not at all what the witness said.

          8        A.    Yeah, that's not what I said,

          9    actually.  I just simply said that makes me

         10    uncomfortable.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              Comfort notwithstanding, are you

         13    going to be able to answer my questions

         14    that I ask you about your time at Deutsche

         15    Bank?

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  The

         17        witness just sat here and answered

         18        over an hour of your questions about

         19        his time at Deutsche Bank.  He's here

         20        as a fact witness.  What his time at

         21        Deutsche Bank has to do with anything

         22        in this proceeding is still unclear to

         23        me, but he has answered all of your

         24        questions.

         25              So your question to him right now

          2        is really unfair and mischaracterizes

          3        the record.

          4              If you want to rephrase your

          5        question, I'll be comfortable letting

          6        him answer it.  Otherwise, we're going

          7        to shut this down -- shut down this

          8        line of questioning about his

          9        confidentiality agreement.

         10    BY MR. CROKE:

         11        Q.    Can you tell me anything about

         12    the size of the portfolio that you managed

         13    at the time you left Deutsche Bank?

         14        A.    Yes, it was very large.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              And can you give me any

         17    qualification on that as to whether we're

         18    talking billions, trillions or millions?

         19        A.    Billions.

         20        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.

         21              MR. ITKIN:  We've been going over

         22        an hour.  Can we take a break for like

         23        five minutes?

          8        Beginning of media number 2.

          9        Q.    Mr. Mathur, focusing on the time

         10    just before you left Deutsche Bank, what

         11    was your role at that time?

         12        A.    Again, it was quite varied.

         13    Like, amongst other things, portfolio

         14    management.

         15        Q.    Did you have a title at Deutsche

         16    Bank at this time?

         17        A.    Yes, I did.

         18        Q.    And what was that title?

         19        A.    As a director.

         20        Q.    Did you have a title within a

         21    particular business line, for example, head

         22    of a certain desk?

         23        A.    Yes.

         24        Q.    And what was that title?

         25        A.    It's called head of Winchester

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Capital.

          3        Q.    And what is Winchester Capital?

          4        A.    Well, it's not a full name, by

          5    the name, so it's Winchester Capital

          6    Principal Finance.  It's the -- it's just

          7    sort of a name to recognize a principal

          8    finance desk more to the outside world than

          9    just saying, oh, I'm trading with Deutsche

         10    Bank, to specify a certain desk, principal

         11    finance desk often have names.

         12        Q.    And was that considered a

         13    proprietary trading desk?

         14        A.    That is not a name we ever used,

         15    but some people might characterize it like

         16    that.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              How many people reported to you

         19    at the time you left Deutsche Bank?

         20        A.    A few, I think.  At the time I

         21    left Deutsche Bank, I'm going to have to

         22    think harder to come up with a more

         23    accurate answer.  Okay?

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25        A.    It's a little bit -- the reason


                                                        84

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    I'm sort of taking so much time is because

          3    there were front office people, then there

          4    were other people who sort of have a dotted

          5    line into it and so on, but there were two

          6    primary traders that were directly

          7    reporting in to me, three maybe directly

          8    reporting in to me, technically per se, but

          9    it was like an informal setup like most

         10    principal desk, there isn't really a fixed

         11    reporting line per se.

         12              So a few traders, a handful, less

         13    than like five traders probably and some of

         14    the middle office guys and risk guys, and

         15    we also had, since it's a principal finance

         16    desk, started morphing into a legacy at

         17    that time.

         18              So because you specifically asked

         19    and I do want to answer it appropriately,

         20    at the time of leaving it was turning into

         21    what's called non-cooperating unit.  So

         22    there was more of a fluid situation.

         23        Q.    And who were the traders who were

         24    specifically directly reporting to you at

         25    that time?


                                                        85

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Would you like me to name them?

          3        Q.    Yes, if you could.

          4        A.    Again, I'm uncomfortable

          5    answering that question because this is not

          6    a public information.  This is just my

          7    comfort level -- is it hugely relevant to

          8    you?

          9        Q.    Was one of them Christian Adler?

         10        A.    I think technically he would have

         11    reported in to me, because that wasn't

         12    really, as I said before, it was at the

         13    time I was leaving, it was more fluid than

         14    that.

         15        Q.    Was Shikha Gupta one of the

         16    traders who reported to you?

         17        A.    Again, similar answer.

         18        Q.    But are Mr. Adler and Ms. Gupta,

         19    are those among the five or so traders that

         20    you mentioned who were reporting to you, or

         21    are you thinking of a different group of --

         22        A.    No, no, no.  It's just that -- I

         23    don't recall, it's been a few years now, so

         24    I might be missing some specificity here.

         25              But from memory at that time


                                                        86

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    there was a morphing into non-cooperating

          3    unit at DB and there was a chatter at that

          4    time -- and I don't know whether it

          5    materialize, it didn't materialize while I

          6    was there -- so if you would ask me to

          7    guess, I'll be more comfortable, but if you

          8    ask me to be more specific, I probably

          9    wouldn't remember very clearly if that be

         10    the case.  Would you want me to guess?

         11        Q.    I think I can hopefully narrow

         12    this.  My question just specifically is, a

         13    few moments ago you mentioned that there

         14    were five or so traders who reported to

         15    you.

         16        A.    Less than five.

         17        Q.    Less than five.

         18              My question is just whether

         19    Mr. Adler and Ms. Gupta were among that

         20    group or whether you were referring to a

         21    different group of people?

         22        A.    No, no, no.  I was just simply

         23    saying that it may have been possible that

         24    at the time of my leaving they may not be

         25    reporting to me anymore, is what I was


                                                        87

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    saying, because there were changes

          3    happening at that desk at that time.

          4        Q.    My question is just a few minutes

          5    ago you mentioned that there were less than

          6    five traders that were reporting directly

          7    to you.

          8        A.    Correct.

          9        Q.    When you say less than five, are

         10    Mr. Adler and Ms. Gupta among that group

         11    that you're referring to?

         12        A.    I clarified my answer further,

         13    which is what I'm saying, that I think they

         14    were that the time, but I'm guessing

         15    because there was a lot of restructuring

         16    going on at DB at that time.  It may have

         17    been possible that at the time of my

         18    departure nobody was reporting in to me.

         19    I'm just clarifying that answer to you so

         20    that I'm technically accurate.

         21        Q.    And at the time just before you

         22    left Deutsche Bank, as we discussed

         23    earlier, you had a portfolio of risk that

         24    you were managing, correct?

         25        A.    Correct.


                                                        88

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              Were you the person responsible

          4    for trading securities within that

          5    portfolio?

          6        A.    Amongst other people, yes.

          7        Q.    And the other people who were

          8    involved in that, is that, again, referring

          9    to the five or so, or however many it was,

         10    traders that were reporting up to you?

         11        A.    At what time exactly?

         12        Q.    The time just before you left

         13    Deutsche Bank.

         14        A.    Yeah, so the answer is the same.

         15    There could have been actually a much

         16    larger group of people thinking about it,

         17    that could be -- that the risk that I was

         18    managing could have included more people

         19    than just those five.  And the fact that

         20    they were probably not reporting to me does

         21    not necessarily mean that they were not

         22    also part of that risk.

         23              But I'm thinking on my feet right

         24    now, so that's the reason my answer may not

         25    be technically accurate.  So if you would

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    go back to DB and ask them what their 7 or

          3    11 people reporting to me at that time of

          4    my departure, that may not be right.  So

          5    I'm just simply giving you a best guess

          6    answer at the moment.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              During your time at Deutsche

          9    Bank, did you have any involvement in

         10    setting valuations for the securities that

         11    you had purchased?

         12              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         13        A.    I don't understand the term

         14    "setting valuation."

         15        Q.    Sure.

         16              During your time at Deutsche

         17    Bank, were there policies that were

         18    followed with respect to determining the

         19    valuations of securities that were held on

         20    Deutsche Bank's books?

         21        A.    I'm pretty certain Deutsche Bank

         22    had a policy.

         23        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         24    Bank, were you involved in the process of

          2    that were held within the portfolio of risk

          3    that you managed?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    To the best of my recollection,

          6    no.

          7        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

          8    Bank, were traders who reported to you

          9    involved in the process of determining the

         10    valuations for securities that were held

         11    within the portfolio of risk that you

         12    managed?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    I can't answer the question with

         15    certainty if there is anyone reporting to

         16    me would have been involved in valuation,

         17    but if you're asking me to guess, then no,

         18    there wouldn't be.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20              During your time at Deutsche

         21    Bank, what factors were considered in

         22    setting valuations for the securities in

         23    the portfolio that you managed?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         25        A.    Without the caveat that it is


                                                        91

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    security dependent, the biggest criteria

          3    would be perhaps the market value at that

          4    time.

          5        Q.    And by "market value," do you

          6    mean the trading that was being observed in

          7    the market at that time?

          8        A.    It depends on the time, actually.

          9        Q.    Would trading activity in a

         10    security that you held within your

         11    portfolio be one of the factors that would

         12    be considered in setting the valuation of

         13    that security?

         14        A.    Yes, it would be one of the

         15    criteria, yeah.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              So, for example, if there was a

         18    security in your portfolio that had been

         19    valued at, say, 95 percent of par value and

         20    then you purchased more of that security at

         21    80 percent of par value, is that something

         22    that would affect the valuation of the

         23    security held in your portfolio?

         24        A.    When?

         25        Q.    Sorry?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    At what time?

          3        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

          4    Bank.

          5        A.    Yeah, I was there for a fairly

          6    long period of time.  It would depend on

          7    when it was.  Broadly speaking,

          8    potentially, yes.

          9        Q.    What were the circumstances under

         10    which it would not affect the valuation?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    Look, there could be multiple

         13    circumstances.  The value of the security,

         14    the market value of the security could

         15    depend on, for instance, the size it was

         16    traded.  Say you own a $300 million asset

         17    on the book, the size that was traded was

         18    50K, at discount that may not have any

         19    bearing on the size.

         20        Q.    Is trading activity generally a

         21    good indicator for the market value of a

         22    security?

         23              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         24        A.    When you say "trading activity,"

         25    what do you mean?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Sure.

          3              If you trade a security at a

          4    particular price, is that generally a good

          5    indicator of the market value of the

          6    security?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          8        A.    Generally in a normal market

          9    circumstances, it may be.

         10        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         11    Bank, do you know whether the factors that

         12    were considered in determining the value of

         13    a synthetic CDO differed from the factors

         14    that were considered in determining the

         15    value of other types of securities in the

         16    portfolio that you managed?

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    The simple answer is yes, but I

         19    would say for any asset, on an

         20    asset-by-asset basis.

         21        Q.    How did the factors that were

         22    considered in determining the value of

         23    synthetic CDOs differ from the factors that

         24    were considered in determining the value of

         25    other types of securities, again during

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    your time at Deutsche Bank?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          4        A.    What I said is I wouldn't

          5    characterize it specifically from synthetic

          6    versus non-synthetic, as you call it, but

          7    any securities, it is very security

          8    specific, what the value is.

          9        Q.    Understanding that the specific

         10    value of a specific security is obviously

         11    specific to that security, my question is

         12    just generally with respect to synthetic

         13    CDOs as a class, are there different

         14    factors that were considered during your

         15    time at Deutsche Bank in determining the

         16    valuation of those securities as a class as

         17    opposed to other classes of securities?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

         19        answered.

         20        A.    In the same spirit, yes, they

         21    would be different.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              What were some of those

         24    differences?

         25        A.    With a CDS, for instance, you


                                                        95

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    often marked a bid on a cash security.

          3    CDS, from recollection, is marked at bid --

          4    mid, sorry, not bid -- and the value of

          5    that security in a cash format would be

          6    different compared to synthetic security in

          7    the sense that whether you buy it or

          8    protection, it would be different in your

          9    seller protection.

         10              So even though the reference

         11    obligation or the actual underlying

         12    security may have one observable value in

         13    the market, the way protection buyers and

         14    protection sellers look at it is quite

         15    different.

         16        Q.    And in circumstances in which

         17    you're purchasing actual cash notes, but

         18    the notes are, you know, issued by either a

         19    synthetic CDO or a CDO that is not a

         20    synthetic CDO, did the -- during your time

         21    at Deutsche Bank, did the factors that were

         22    considered in setting the valuations of

         23    those two types of floats differ?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         25        A.    There is no specific set of


                                                        96

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    different valuation procedures per se.  In

          3    fact, there was no set of valuing a

          4    procedure.  It is extremely asset-by-asset

          5    dependent.

          6        Q.    Uh-huh.

          7        A.    And I wouldn't even say, go as

          8    far as to go and say that two

          9    similar-looking RMBS security, it depends

         10    on what part of the cap structure, what

         11    tranche it is, what market conditions you

         12    have, I will have two different criteria

         13    for looking at those things.

         14              So yes, in that same spirit, as I

         15    said before, a synthetic may differ from

         16    cash and vice versa.

         17        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         18    Bank, did you ever invest in a synthetic

         19    CDO that permitted noteholders to replace

         20    collateral securities?

         21        A.    Did I personally invest?

         22        Q.    Start there.

         23        A.    No.

         24        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         25    Bank, are you aware of anyone who worked

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    with you on your trading desk in purchasing

          3    a synthetic CDO that allowed noteholders to

          4    replace collateral securities?

          5        A.    It may have happened.

          6        Q.    Sitting here today, do you recall

          7    any specific instance in which you or

          8    anyone who worked with you at Deutsche Bank

          9    purchased a synthetic CDO that allowed

         10    noteholders to replace collateral

         11    securities?

         12        A.    While I was at the bank?

         13        Q.    While you were at Deutsche Bank.

         14        A.    It's a very broad question.

         15    Across the bank I wouldn't have knowledge

         16    about other people.

         17        Q.    I'm just asking about what you

         18    know.  So during your time at Deutsche

         19    Bank, did you -- are you aware of any

         20    circumstance in which you, or the people

         21    who worked with you on your trading desk,

         22    purchased a synthetic CDO that allowed

         23    noteholders to replace collateral

         24    securities?

         25        A.    Correct.

          2        Q.    So you're aware?

          3        A.    I'm aware of it.

          4        Q.    You're aware of a specific

          5    instance?

          6        A.    Yes, yes.

          7        Q.    And what is that instance?

          8        A.    Abacus would come to mind, 06-10

          9    would come to mind.

         10        Q.    Are there any other circumstances

         11    like that that you can recall?

         12        A.    Noteholders can actually ask a

         13    security to be replaced in general in

         14    synthetic securities.  The question is do

         15    they have a contractual right to do that.

         16    They may not even necessarily need a

         17    contractual right to do it.

         18        Q.    My question specifically, though,

         19    is just do you recall any other instances

         20    other than the Abacus 2006-10 instance that

         21    you mentioned in which you or people who

         22    worked with you at Deutsche Bank invested

         23    in a synthetic CDO that allowed noteholders

         24    to replace collateral securities?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    I can answer that.  I'll try a

          3    different way.

          4              Synthetic securities are often

          5    bilateral contracts, and even if the

          6    contract, quote-unquote, does not permit a

          7    change per se, if it's a bilateral

          8    contract, you may be silent about it and

          9    may allow noteholders to replace it, for

         10    instance.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              And do you recall any specific

         13    instances of that?

         14              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Sorry,

         15        just to be clear, specific instances

         16        of what?

         17    BY MR. CROKE:

         18        Q.    Of the circumstance you just

         19    described in which there is a synthetic

         20    security that has a bilateral contract

         21    between two parties in which one party,

         22    being in this case Deutsche Bank, could

         23    seek to replace one of the collateral

         24    securities.

         25        A.    Yeah.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Do you recall any specific

          3    instances in which you or your team at

          4    Deutsche Bank submitted a request to

          5    replace a collateral security in a

          6    synthetic CDO?

          7        A.    Yes, I'm now aware of it, yeah.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              And what do you mean when you say

         10    you're now aware of it?

         11        A.    Well, in context with Abacus

         12    06-10 CDO.

         13        Q.    Sorry.  When you say you're now

         14    aware of it, do you mean that this is

         15    something that you were not aware of at the

         16    time, but you subsequently learned?

         17        A.    Subsequently after the event

         18    happened?

         19        Q.    Yes.

         20        A.    Yes.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              During your time at Deutsche

         23    Bank, were you ever aware of any

         24    circumstance in which you or the people who

         25    worked with you at Deutsche Bank submitted

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    a request to replace a collateral security

          3    in a synthetic CDO?

          4        A.    Was I aware of it at that time?

          5    I don't recall frankly.

          6        Q.    So to be clear, you have a

          7    recollection of a circumstance in which

          8    you, or people who worked with you at

          9    Deutsche Bank, submitted a request to

         10    replace a collateral security in the Abacus

         11    06-10 CDO, but --

         12        A.    I'm saying that I -- sorry to cut

         13    you off.

         14              MR. ITKIN:  Let him finish the

         15        question, please.

         16    BY MR. CROKE:

         17        Q.    I just want to make sure I

         18    understand.  I think I understand what

         19    you're saying and I just want to make sure

         20    it's clear.

         21              Is your answer that you have a

         22    recollection of a circumstance in which --

         23    or rather, sorry, I'm going to strike that.

         24        A.    Uh-huh.

         25        Q.    Are you aware -- is it that

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    you're aware of a circumstance in which you

          3    or your colleagues at Deutsche Bank

          4    submitted a request to replace a collateral

          5    security in the Abacus 2006-10 CDO, but you

          6    don't have a specific recollection as to

          7    whether you were aware of it during your

          8    time at Deutsche Bank or whether you

          9    learned of it after the fact?

         10        A.    That is correct.  I think the

         11    former is correct.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13        A.    It was only recent that I sort of

         14    refreshed my memory about it.  If you had

         15    asked me the same question, let's say,

         16    three years ago, I may not recall in the

         17    same fashion, for instance.

         18        Q.    Sitting here today, do you know

         19    whether you were involved in any

         20    discussions about that replacement security

         21    at the time it happened at Deutsche Bank?

         22        A.    You know, there were thousands of

         23    things that I was doing at DB at that time.

         24    Could have been sort of a minor involvement

         25    possibly, but I have zero recollection.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And I think we're all on the same

          3    page here, but just so the record is clear,

          4    when you say Abacus 06-10 CDO, you're

          5    referring to the Abacus CDO that is the

          6    subject of this proceeding, right?

          7        A.    Yes.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              What do you recall about

         10    Deutsche's request to substitute a

         11    collateral security in the Abacus 2006-10

         12    CDO?

         13        A.    What I do recall now?

         14        Q.    Sitting here today, what is it

         15    that you recall about that?

         16        A.    My memory was recently refreshed

         17    by the fact that there was subprime

         18    collateral that was about to default and

         19    Deutsche Bank at that time had put in a

         20    request to replace that collateral.

         21        Q.    And do you know whether the

         22    collateral security that Deutsche Bank

         23    proposed to replace was, in fact, replaced?

         24        A.    Now I'm aware of it that yes, it

         25    was replaced.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Do you know whether the

          3    replacement collateral security that your

          4    team at Deutsche Bank selected for the

          5    Abacus 06-10 CDO was required to comply

          6    with any eligibility criteria?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  That

          8        mischaracterizes the testimony.  I'm

          9        not sure the witness ever testified

         10        that his team at Deutsche Bank --

         11        A.    Yes, I was going to say that.  It

         12    wasn't my team at that time.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              Do you recall who it was who was

         15    involved in selecting the collateral

         16    security for the Abacus 06-10 CDO?

         17        A.    Do I recall?  No.  Can I guess?

         18    Probably, yeah.

         19        Q.    Was it people that worked with

         20    you on your trading desk?

         21        A.    At that time, yes, that would

         22    have been the natural guess.

         23        Q.    Was it people that reported to

         24    you?

         25        A.    No.  As I said, that wasn't my


                                                       105

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    team at that time.

          3        Q.    So I just want to make sure I

          4    understand.

          5              The trading desk at that time,

          6    and for your own reference, I'll represent

          7    to you this is 2008, at that time you were

          8    working on a trading desk with how many

          9    people was it roughly?

         10        A.    2008 was probably the biggest

         11    flux of the year, frankly speaking.  At

         12    some point it could range from 15, 20, 25

         13    people on the same sort of trading desk to

         14    same part of, depending on the year, month

         15    of the year.  Could be as little as seven,

         16    for instance.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18        A.    So a lot of people.

         19        Q.    And what was your role on the

         20    trading desk at that time?

         21        A.    I was on the structuring side of

         22    that, primarily.

         23        Q.    And did other people on the

         24    trading desk report to you at that time?

         25        A.    2008, yes, they may have, yeah.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    So my question is, do you know

          3    whether any of the people who were involved

          4    in submitting this request to replace a

          5    collateral security reported to you at that

          6    time?

          7        A.    I would say I don't have a

          8    specific recollection about the whole

          9    procedure back then, but I don't recall

         10    anyone reporting in to me would have done

         11    it.  That would be my best guess at the

         12    moment.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              So it would be people who worked

         15    on the desk with you, but you don't recall,

         16    one way or the other, whether it was people

         17    who --

         18        A.    No, no, I do recall that they're

         19    unlikely to be reporting to me.  Just

         20    because I know the subject matter.  It

         21    isn't likely that those people would be the

         22    ones reporting in to me would have

         23    participated in this matter.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25              Do you know whether the


                                                       107

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    replacement on a collateral security that

          3    those people at Deutsche Bank selected for

          4    the Abacus 2006-10 CDO was required to

          5    comply with my eligibility criteria?

          6        A.    Did I know then?

          7        Q.    Do you know now whether the

          8    collateral security that the team at

          9    Deutsche Bank selected was required to

         10    comply with any eligibility criteria?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    So do I know now whether it was

         13    then required, is that the question?

         14        Q.    Sitting here right now, do you

         15    know whether the collateral security that

         16    the team at Deutsche Bank selected for the

         17    Abacus 2006-10 CDO was required at the time

         18    to comply with eligibility criteria?

         19              MR. ITKIN:  Just one second.  I

         20        just want to object and make the

         21        record clear.  I'm not sure that we

         22        established that there was a team that

         23        selected anything at Deutsche Bank.  I

         24        am just going to clarify that and do

         25        with that whatever you want.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    BY MR. CROKE:

          3        Q.    Sitting here right now, do you

          4    know whether the collateral security that

          5    these individuals at Deutsche Bank selected

          6    for inclusion in the Abacus 2006-10 CDO was

          7    required at the time to comply with any

          8    eligibility criteria?

          9        A.    I do not know whether it was

         10    required.  I don't recall whether I had a

         11    recollection at that time if it was

         12    required to do a satisfaction of an

         13    eligibility criteria.  I don't recall that.

         14        Q.    I'm not asking about your

         15    recollection then.  I'm asking you, sitting

         16    here today, do you know whether the

         17    collateral security that these individuals

         18    at Deutsche Bank selected for inclusion in

         19    the Abacus 06-10 CDO was required at the

         20    time to comply with any eligibility

         21    criteria?

         22        A.    Yeah, I think protection buyer --

         23    not now, with the hindsight knowledge, I do

         24    believe that protection buyer is supposed

         25    to qualify every single eligibility


                                                       109

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    criteria of any replacement security,

          3    whether it's replaced by noteholders or

          4    not.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              And do you know whether the

          7    replacement collateral security that these

          8    individuals at Deutsche Bank selected for

          9    inclusion in the Abacus 2006-10 CDO, in

         10    fact, satisfied those eligibility criteria?

         11        A.    I'm not a lawyer.  So I'm not

         12    going to opine on that as a technical

         13    matter.  All I can say is that if I would

         14    assume that if protection buyer went

         15    through the eligibility criteria and said

         16    it satisfied it, then it should satisfy it.

         17    Do I know now technically -- look, I may be

         18    wrong about inference of an eligibility

         19    criteria in a legal context.  So I wouldn't

         20    want to opine on something that I won't be

         21    qualified to opine on.

         22        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         23    Bank, do you recall anyone ever proposing

         24    to substitute a collateral security for a

         25    synthetic CDO that did not comply with some


                                                       110

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    eligibility criteria for that synthetic

          3    CDO?

          4        A.    Again, to clarify the question,

          5    are you asking me whether I recall back

          6    then?

          7        Q.    I'm asking -- I'm asking your

          8    recollection right now of whether, during

          9    your time at Deutsche Bank, anyone ever

         10    proposed to substitute a collateral

         11    security for a synthetic CDO that did not

         12    comply with the eligibility criteria?

         13        A.    I do not have a recollection --

         14    I've stated twice, and maybe I get confused

         15    right now.  I don't have recollection of

         16    it.

         17              Now my memory has been refreshed

         18    that, yes, some securities, or one of the

         19    securities was replaced by Deutsche.  It

         20    now, hence, I do have a refreshing of

         21    memory that yes, it was replaced.  I have

         22    very little recollection of what happened

         23    at that time.  I wasn't involved in it.

         24        Q.    I understand that you have a

         25    recollection now that it was replaced.


                                                       111

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Yes.

          3        Q.    But my question is a little

          4    different.

          5              I'm asking you whether you recall

          6    anyone at Deutsche Bank, during your time

          7    at Deutsche Bank, ever proposing to

          8    substitute a collateral security for a

          9    synthetic CDO that did not comply with the

         10    eligibility criteria for that synthetic

         11    CDO?

         12        A.    You're asking me whether I recall

         13    now.  I don't recall now.  I don't recall

         14    most of it.  So no, I don't recall now or

         15    later it's the memory has been refreshed of

         16    something that happened back then, and I do

         17    recall that something happened.  But very

         18    vague memory of it.  Recollection about a

         19    past event is the same as I have now as it

         20    is later.

         21        Q.    When did you leave Deutsche Bank?

         22        A.    2012.

         23        Q.    About when in 2012?

         24        A.    End of quarter 3, I think.

         25        Q.    So roughly September?


                                                       112

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Yeah, that would probably be

          3    right, but technically it could be October.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5        A.    Okay, so...

          6        Q.    Sure.

          7              And why did you leave Deutsche

          8    Bank?

          9        A.    Because I wanted to.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              Were there any other reasons?

         12        A.    I wanted to do something on my

         13    own, for instance.

         14        Q.    After leaving Deutsche Bank, did

         15    you become employed somewhere else?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    And where was that?

         18        A.    I wouldn't strictly call it

         19    employment.  So I want to retract it back.

         20    I became a partner at Octave, I think.

         21        Q.    That's Octave, is that Octave

         22    Investment Management?

         23        A.    Correct.

         24        Q.    And when was that?

         25        A.    I don't recollect actually, but

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    sometime in end of 2012.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4        A.    So it wasn't immediately after.

          5        Q.    And did there come a time that

          6    you left Octave?

          7        A.    Did I resign as a partner?

          8        Q.    Yes.

          9        A.    Yes.

         10        Q.    And when was that?

         11        A.    I don't recall actually.  It's

         12    '14, '15 maybe, something, a couple of

         13    years later.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              And now, just to avoid any

         16    confusion here.  I know that there are

         17    several Astra-affiliated entities.  If I

         18    refer to Astra, do you have an

         19    understanding of, you know -- is that a

         20    term that you use to refer to the

         21    collective group of Astra entities or is

         22    there some other term that's easier for

         23    you?

         24        A.    So the thing is that we're going

         25    to be pedantic here, so please refer to the


                                                       114

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    full sentence if you can, because when we

          3    refer to Astra, it could mean Astra Fund,

          4    Astra Advisors, Astra Asset Management, LLP

          5    and so on.  There are multiple Astra

          6    entities.  We call them all one.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8        A.    So I would prefer if you use the

          9    full legal name so that we're on the same

         10    page.

         11        Q.    Sure.

         12              And what is the full legal name

         13    of the entity that is the -- that you

         14    understand to be the objector in this case?

         15        A.    It's the Astra Asset Management

         16    UK Limited.

         17        Q.    Okay.  All right.

         18              So is it all right if I use the

         19    term "Astra" to refer to Astra Asset

         20    Management UK Limited?

         21        A.    It is absolutely fine, Jake.  I'm

         22    just simply saying that I might get

         23    confused because, you know, you're just

         24    having one conversation with me.

         25              For the last several years, I've


                                                       115

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    been using "Astra" as a term for kind of

          3    everything, Astra this, Astra that, Astra

          4    Fund.  So I might get confused.  So just

          5    for my own sanity, if you can help it,

          6    great.  If you can't, I'll try to be

          7    careful about it, okay.

          8        Q.    Fair deal.  Fair deal.

          9              Were you involved in founding

         10    some of the Astra-affiliated entities?

         11        A.    Involved?  The answer is no,

         12    actually.

         13        Q.    Who was involved in founding the

         14    various Astra-affiliated entities?

         15        A.    I assume for one it would

         16    probably be Paul Phillips.

         17        Q.    And who is Paul Phillips?

         18        A.    He's an ex-director of Astra

         19    Asset Management UK Limited.

         20        Q.    Are you currently an officer of

         21    any Astra-affiliated entities?

         22        A.    I am.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              And what entities are you an

         25    officer of?


                                                       116

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    A director of Astra Asset

          3    Management UK Limited, for instance.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5              Are there others?

          6        A.    Yes, there are.

          7        Q.    And what are those?

          8        A.    I'm struggling with the word

          9    "affiliate," actually.  So I do not know if

         10    a fund is an affiliate, for instance.  But

         11    Astra came in international, Astra entity.

         12        Q.    Okay?

         13        A.    I would call it just to make

         14    things simple between us, right.

         15        Q.    Uh-huh.

         16        A.    And I do not know whether the

         17    affiliate would be a regular term and also

         18    under U.S. Law, it could be different from

         19    what it is under the UK law.

         20        Q.    Uh-huh.

         21        A.    But Astra Cayman International is

         22    a Cayman limited company for which I'm also

         23    a director of.

         24        Q.    Do you have a title at any of

         25    these entities?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Director.

          3        Q.    Are you the chief investment

          4    officer at any Astra entities?

          5        A.    It's not a granted title, but

          6    often I presume a function of the chief

          7    investment officer of Astra Asset

          8    Management UK Limited.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10        A.    And this is how the investors may

         11    perceive me as well.

         12        Q.    Are you the chief executive

         13    officer of any Astra entities?

         14        A.    We don't have a function like

         15    that at Astra entities.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              Do you report to anyone at any of

         18    the Astra entities?

         19        A.    What does reporting mean

         20    actually?

         21        Q.    Do you report to anyone in your

         22    day-to-day job?  Do you have someone who

         23    oversees your performance?

         24        A.    My performance?  What

         25    performance?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    You conduct business on a

          3    day-to-day business in your role at Astra,

          4    is that correct?  Is there anyone who

          5    oversees your performance?

          6        A.    For example, we have a cumulative

          7    set of directors who discuss matters

          8    together.  We don't have a concept of

          9    performance review, per se.

         10        Q.    Do you report to anyone in

         11    connection with your role at Astra?

         12        A.    As I said, it's not a structure

         13    like that.  I would happily answer this

         14    question if there was one, but --

         15        Q.    Does anyone report to you at any

         16    of these Astra entities?

         17        A.    As I said, we don't have a

         18    structure like that, a reporting line

         19    structure.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              So there is no reporting line

         22    structure at any of these Astra entities?

         23              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

         24        answered.

         25        A.    We have functions, and within


                                                       119

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    certain functions people refer to an

          3    organization chart, for instance.  But it

          4    isn't a formal reporting line on personnel.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              Do you work with Mr. Adler at

          7    Astra?

          8        A.    I do.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10              What is Mr. Adler's role at

         11    Astra?

         12        A.    He's also one of the directors

         13    Astra Asset Management UK Limited.

         14        Q.    Does he have any other roles?

         15        A.    Yes, he just, like I have

         16    multiple roles, he does, too.

         17        Q.    What are his roles?

         18        A.    Amongst other things, he looks

         19    at, for instance, risk on the portfolio.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              Is Mr. Adler involved in trading

         22    securities at Astra?

         23        A.    Involved, yes.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25              Are you involved in trading

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    securities at Astra?

          3        A.    Involved as in a day-to-day

          4    function?

          5        Q.    Whatever you understand that to

          6    mean.  Are you involved in trading

          7    securities at Astra?

          8              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          9        A.    I don't understand it, so I can

         10    try and answer that from what it means, but

         11    involvement is a broader term, and from

         12    that extremely broad term, since I'm the

         13    CIO equivalent of an Astra Asset Management

         14    UK Limited manager, investment manager of

         15    various Astra funds, I'm involved in

         16    everything that Astra does, including

         17    trading of securities.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19              And other than you and Mr. Adler,

         20    are there others at Astra that are involved

         21    in trading securities?

         22        A.    Yes.

         23        Q.    And who is that?

         24        A.    Today?

         25        Q.    Yeah.


                                                       121

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    It would be, for instance, Kyle.

          3        Q.    Kyle who?

          4        A.    Kyle Muscrup.

          5        Q.    Okay.  Are there others?

          6        A.    Yes, could be Shikha Gupta.

          7        Q.    Are there others?

          8        A.    Yes.  It depends on what security

          9    we're talking about, but yes, there are

         10    others as well.

         11        Q.    For asset-backed securities,

         12    sitting here today --

         13        A.    These are the people.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              So that group is the group that

         16    is typically involved in trading

         17    asset-backed securities.

         18        A.    Uh-huh.

         19        Q.    When was Astra founded?

         20        A.    2012.

         21        Q.    And who are Astra's founders?

         22        A.    That's, again, a technical

         23    question.  I don't recall exactly, but I

         24    would have thought one of the founders

         25    would be Tarun Joshi.

          2        Q.    Are you one of the founders of

          3    Astra?

          4        A.    Again, this is a technical

          5    question.  So when you say founder, I mean

          6    am I the founder, the concept, is that the

          7    question?

          8        Q.    Do you consider yourself a

          9    founder of Astra?

         10        A.    Well, a layman term, a founder,

         11    yes.  But technical term founder, no.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13              Have you ever described yourself

         14    as a founder of Astra?

         15        A.    I may have.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              Were you still employed at

         18    Deutsche Bank when Astra was founded?

         19        A.    Probably, but I don't recall

         20    actually exactly when it was founded, to be

         21    honest.

         22        Q.    And when did you become

         23    affiliated with Astra?

         24        A.    Between September and November

         25    sometime in the time, 2012.

          2        Q.    And that's 2012?

          3        A.    Yeah.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5              In your role at Astra, are you

          6    involved in communications with Astra's

          7    investors?

          8        A.    Yes, I am.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10              And have you been involved in

         11    communications with Astra's investors since

         12    you first joined Astra?

         13        A.    Could you -- what's the

         14    difference between the two questions?  I

         15    don't understand.

         16        Q.    Sure.

         17              Has your role at Astra involved

         18    communicating with investors since you

         19    joined or is it something that you took on

         20    at a later stage?

         21        A.    Oh, from the very beginning,

         22    yeah.

         23        Q.    Is there currently a relationship

         24    between Octave and Astra?

         15        A.    Approach?  I'm struggling with

         16    the word "approach."  Did we talk about it?

         17    Yes.  Is that what you call it, approach?

         18    I don't remember whether he approached me

         19    or I approached him per se.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              That was my question, whether you

         22    contacted him or he contacted you.

          3    joining Astra?

          4        A.    I don't remember if I approached

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7        A.    It could have been Christian or

         16        Q.    Has he ever been employed at

         17    Astra?

         18        A.    "Employed" means having an

         19    employment contract?

         20        Q.    You can start there, yeah.

         21        A.    No.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              Has he ever performed any

         24    services for Astra?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    would not -- I don't know whether call it a

          3    service or not, but he was a temp.

          4        Q.    A temp what?

          5        A.    Temporary.

          6        Q.    But a temporary -- sorry, a

          7    temporary what?

          8        A.    I don't know whether you call it

          9    contractor or temporary intern.  I don't

         10    know what kind of legal contract would that

         11    be.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13              What did Mr. Pai do for Astra?

         14        A.    He's working on an IT project,

         15    from memory.

         16        Q.    And is that something that he's

         17    working on now or is that something in the

         18    past?

         19        A.    Something in the past.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              And was there anything other than

         22    an IT project that he worked on?

         23        A.    It was the main task that I

         24    remember now.  But if you, again if you are

         25    not talking about these proceedings, I


                                                       127

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    wouldn't remember what it was.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              And what was that IT process?

          5        A.    Again --

          6              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          7        A.    You mean IT project.

          8        Q.    Yeah, what was that IT project?

          9        A.    Honestly, I do not recall.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11        A.    But somebody refreshed my memory,

         12    so it's hearsay.  Shall I say it?

         13        Q.    You can answer the question.

         14        A.    It is not my recollection, but my

         15    memory was refreshed that he's working on

         16    IT project to automate extraction of

         17    collateral securities.

         18        Q.    Could you just describe a little

         19    bit more about what you mean by that?

         20        A.    That is all, that is all that was

         21    refreshed to me.

         22        Q.    When you say automate the

         23    extraction of collateral securities, what

         24    do you mean by extraction of collateral

         25    securities?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Oh, from the trustee reports.

          3        Q.    So he was working on an IT

          4    project that would automate the process of

          5    identifying or pulling information about

          6    collateral securities from trustee reports?

          7        A.    That's what somebody told me.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              Do you know when Mr. Pai first

         10    began working with Astra?

         11        A.    Yeah, I think it was around 2013.

         12        Q.    Do you remember when in 2013?

         13        A.    No.  Maybe towards the end, but

         14    that would be a guess.

         15        Q.    Do you remember when Mr. Pai

         16    stopped working with Astra?

         17        A.    2014 sometime, but not exactly

         18    when.

         19        Q.    When did you first meet Mr. Pai?

         20        A.    I don't remember, to be honest,

         21    but if I had to guess, sometime in 2006

         22    maybe, sometime in 2006.

         23        Q.    And how did you know Mr. Pai?

         24        A.    He was a friend of a friend.

         25        Q.    Did Mr. Pai work in the financial

          2    services industry?

          3        A.    I believe he did, yes.

          4        Q.    Were you the person that

          5    introduced Mr. Pai to Astra?

          6        A.    Yes.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              And why did you first contact

          9    Mr. Pai?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  With

         11        respect to -- do you want to clarify?

         12              MR. CROKE:  Sure.

         13    BY MR. CROKE:

         14        Q.    Why did you first contact Mr. Pai

         15    with respect to working with Astra?

         16        A.    Why did I?

         17        Q.    Yes.

         18        A.    I didn't think it was me who

         19    contacted him, from memory, but I don't

         20    have an exact recollection.  It could have

         21    been another friend or maybe even his --

         22    I'm not so for sure -- it could even be his

         23    wife, actually.

         24        Q.    Do you recall whose idea it was

         25    to have Mr. Pai conduct this project?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    No.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              Was it your idea?

          5        A.    No.

          6        Q.    But was it the idea of someone

          7    else at Astra?

          8        A.    Must have been, yeah.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10              But so it wasn't Mr. Pai's idea

         11    that he approached you about it?

         12        A.    About what?

         13        Q.    Mr. Pai didn't come to you with a

         14    proposal to perform this project, it was

         15    something that someone at Astra came up

         16    with and approached Mr. Pai about

         17    conducting, is that right?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    I don't understand the question.

         20    Are you talking about him joining Astra?

         21        Q.    You mentioned --

         22        A.    That was eventually me

         23    introducing Rajesh to Astra, but what

         24    project he would work on at Astra it would

         25    have been somebody else at Astra's idea to


                                                       131

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    do that with him.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4        A.    I don't have a recollection of

          5    it, but I just wanted to make sure that we

          6    are on the same page.

          7        Q.    Understood.

          8              Do you keep in touch with

          9    Mr. Pai?

         10        A.    Yes, I do.

         11        Q.    When was the last time you

         12    communicated with him?

         13        A.    Just maybe Monday.

         14        Q.    And what did you discuss?

         15        A.    Some personal matters.

         16        Q.    Have you ever had any

         17    conversations with Mr. Pai about this

         18    proceeding?

         19        A.    I don't recall, actually, no.

         20        Q.    You don't recall any

         21    conversations with Mr. Pai about the Abacus

         22    2006-10 CDO proceeding here?

         23        A.    He's not involved with Astra

         24    anymore.

         25        Q.    Okay.


                                                       132

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    So we don't communicate about

          3    Astra's proceedings with people in general.

          4              So if I were to guess, have I

          5    ever mentioned it to him, it may have

          6    occurred in some conversation in the past.

          7    But if you want me to guess something, I

          8    don't think so.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10        A.    I'm pretty -- I would be pretty

         11    certain that would be very, very low chance

         12    of that happening.  So was the part of the

         13    question that does he even know that I'm

         14    here?

         15        Q.    No.  My question was specifically

         16    have you had any communications with

         17    Mr. Pai about this proceeding?

         18        A.    No.  I don't think I mentioned it

         19    to him.  He probably doesn't even know that

         20    I'm here for this deposition.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22        A.    Not from -- at least not from my

         23    conduct.

         24        Q.    In deciding whether to invest in

         25    a security at Astra, what is your typical


                                                       133

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    investment process?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          4        A.    Investment process is if it fits

          5    in our broader investment criteria that

          6    we've sold to our investors and decide

          7    whether it fits the yield target and the

          8    duration profile alongside the portfolio

          9    management risk that we hold on the book.

         10              And if it fits in the theme, then

         11    yes, we would pick up the asset.

         12        Q.    And during your time at Astra in

         13    deciding whether to invest in a security,

         14    would you review the transaction documents

         15    for that security?

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         17        A.    Would I personally review?

         18        Q.    Yes.

         19        A.    If it requires sometimes, yes.

         20        Q.    During your time at Astra, in

         21    deciding whether to invest in a security,

         22    would you typically review trustee reports

         23    for securities if they were available?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         25        A.    That's not specifically my role


                                                       134

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    at Astra.  But if I was reviewing a

          3    security and if it had a trustee report and

          4    if it was relevant to the security, and if

          5    I'm the one reviewing, doing that security,

          6    then good chance I would.

          7        Q.    When was the first time that you

          8    heard of the Abacus 2006-10 CDO?

          9        A.    I don't recall the exact time.

         10        Q.    Was it during your time at

         11    Deutsche Bank?

         12        A.    Quite possibly.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              Do you recall whether it was, you

         15    know, in 2006 or --

         16        A.    No.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Do you have any sense as to when

         19    it was during your time at Deutsche Bank

         20    that you first heard of the Abacus 2006-10

         21    CDO?

         22        A.    I don't recall exactly when it

         23    was.  It could be '6, '7, it could even be

         24    '8.

         25        Q.    But do you believe it was earlier

          2    during your time at Deutsche Bank as

          3    opposed to later?

          4        A.    First time.  Same answer.  I

          5    don't recall when it was.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              During your time at Deutsche

          8    Bank, were you involved in any decisions to

          9    purchase Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         10        A.    No.

         11        Q.    During your time at Deutsche

         12    Bank, were you aware of people that you

         13    worked with being involved in decisions to

         14    purchase the Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    Was I aware then?

         17        Q.    Yes.

         18        A.    I don't recall, but if I would

         19    guess, no.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              Do you recall ever being involved

         22    in a decision to purchase Abacus 2006-10

         23    securities?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Do you

         25        mean at Deutsche Bank?  Just so the

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        record is clear, because we've been

          3        talking about Deutsche Bank, we've

          4        been talking about Astra.

          5        A.    I'm assuming your line of

          6    question -- I'm not a lawyer, guys, so

          7    please forgive me, I'm trying to be as

          8    accurate as possible here, so I make some

          9    assumptions when you do this -- I was going

         10    to assume you're talking about Deutsche,

         11    but please be clear.

         12        Q.    Sure.

         13              So when I asked whether during

         14    your time at Deutsche Bank you were

         15    involved in any decisions to purchase

         16    Abacus 2006-10 securities, you said no.

         17        A.    Yes.

         18        Q.    So now I'm asking whether you

         19    were ever involved in any decisions to

         20    purchase Abacus 2006-10 securities.  We

         21    already have an answer that you weren't at

         22    Deutsche Bank.  So I'm asking ever.

         23        A.    So I'm struggling to

         24    understand --

         25              MR. ITKIN:  I'm going to object.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Why would you not ask Astra?  So

          3    what is it that you mean by that?

          4        Q.    I'm asking whether you were ever

          5    involved in a decision to purchase Abacus

          6    2006-10 securities.

          7        A.    At Astra, yes.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              Anywhere else other than at

         10    Astra?

         11        A.    I don't recall.

         12        Q.    Do you recall whether you were

         13    involved in a decision to purchase Abacus

         14    2006-10 securities while you were at

         15    Octave?

         16        A.    I may have, yes.

         17        Q.    Do you recall whether Octave

         18    purchased any Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         19        A.    Yes, I think they did.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              And when was that?

         22        A.    It would have been 2013.

         23        Q.    2013?

         24        A.    Uh-huh.

         25        Q.    Do you recall when in 2013?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Either end of first quarter or

          3    second quarter, beginning of second

          4    quarter.

          5        Q.    And were you involved in that

          6    decision?

          7        A.    I would have been at that time.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              What do you recall about that

         10    decision to invest in the Abacus 2006-10

         11    securities?

         12        A.    It's a very broad question.  Can

         13    you be more specific, Jake?

         14        Q.    Can you tell me anything that you

         15    recall about that decision to invest in the

         16    Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         17        A.    Can I tell you anything about

         18    that decision?

         19        Q.    Yes.

         20        A.    Yes, that we bought it and the

         21    decision was to buy it.

         22        Q.    Do you recall anything else about

         23    that?

         24        A.    I recall that we had an

         25    Investment Committee meeting about it.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And that's an Investment

          3    Committee at Octave?

          4        A.    Yes.

          5        Q.    And were you presenting to the

          6    Investment Committee about this investment?

          7        A.    I don't think so.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              Do you recall who was?

         10        A.    I don't recall exactly, no.

         11        Q.    Were you a member of the

         12    Investment Committee at Octave?

         13        A.    Yes.

         14        Q.    So you were one of the people

         15    involved in approving the investment?

         16        A.    That's right, yes.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Do you recall how much of the

         19    Abacus 2006-10 securities were purchased?

         20        A.    I'm going to have to guess

         21    actually.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23        A.    Should I have refreshed my memory

         24    about these things?  I didn't know that you

         25    were going to ask these questions.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    You can just answer, to the best

          3    of your knowledge.

          4        A.    No, I don't remember the exact

          5    number.  I'm just trying to pedantic, can I

          6    make a guess probably, but I don't remember

          7    the exact number.

          8        Q.    Was it tens of millions of

          9    dollars?

         10        A.    Again, it's a guess, but yeah, it

         11    will be in excess of $10 million, I would

         12    have thought.

         13        Q.    And do you recall what class of

         14    Abacus 2006-10 --

         15        A.    Yes, that I recall, A.

         16        Q.    And do you recall who Octave

         17    purchased those securities from?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  I'm going to object

         19        there.  I think we had an agreement

         20        where we're not going to talk about

         21        counterparties.  We disclosed some

         22        trading information but we agreed that

         23        it would be something that would not

         24        be disclosed.  So I think we should

         25        keep out of that.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              MR. CROKE:  Octave is not a party

          3        here.

          4              MR. ITKIN:  I think, as Mr. Adler

          5        explained -- well, I'll let the

          6        witness talk about it before, but as

          7        Mr. Adler explained, there was some

          8        relationship between Astra and Octave

          9        at the time.  So you can explore that

         10        if you want, but ultimately my

         11        suggestion still stands.

         12    BY MR. CROKE:

         13        Q.    So let me come at this from a

         14    different angle that may avoid this.

         15              Did the securities that you were

         16    involved in deciding to purchase while you

         17    were at Octave later transfer to or be

         18    purchased by Astra?

         19        A.    No.

         20        Q.    Do you have an understanding as

         21    to whether those securities are currently

         22    still owned Octave?

         23        A.    No.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25              Do you know whether Octave sold


                                                       142

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    those securities to someone else?

          3        A.    No.

          4        Q.    In connection with that decision

          5    to invest in the Abacus 2006-10 securities

          6    while you were at Octave, do you recall

          7    reviewing any transaction documents?

          8        A.    Do I recall?  No.  Would I have

          9    done it?  Quite possibly.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              Do you recall reviewing any

         12    trustee reports in connection with --

         13        A.    I don't recall anything at that

         14    time as to what I would have done at that

         15    time.

         16        Q.    So I take it you don't recall

         17    whether you reviewed the collateral

         18    securities?

         19        A.    As I said, I would be guessing

         20    right now, Jake.  Do I recall specifically?

         21    No.

         22              We reviewed thousands of

         23    securities, the process may involve trustee

         24    reports -- so the question is, you're

         25    asking me to guess, I will guess.  If


                                                       143

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    you're not asking me to guess, do I recall,

          3    no.

          4        Q.    Do you recall specifically any

          5    factors that you considered in deciding

          6    whether to invest in the Abacus 2006-10 --

          7        A.    I do not recall.

          8        Q.    After that first purchase that

          9    we've talked about at Octave, do you recall

         10    being involved in any other purchases of

         11    Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         12        A.    Yes.

         13        Q.    And when was the next one that

         14    you recall?

         15        A.    I don't think it was the same

         16    year.  Probably the year after or the year

         17    after.  I don't exactly know which year

         18    actually.  But if I had to guess again,

         19    '14.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              Do you recall whether Astra

         22    purchased any Abacus 2006-10 securities in

         23    2013?

         24        A.    Astra Management UK Limited on

         25    behalf of the funds, yes.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And when was that?

          3        A.    The one instance would be, say,

          4    for example, '14 or '15.

          5        Q.    Sorry.  My question is, do you

          6    recall whether Astra Asset Management UK

          7    purchased any Abacus 2006-10 notes in 2013?

          8        A.    The answer would be no.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10              So if there was a decision by

         11    Astra to purchase Abacus 2006-10 notes in

         12    2013, you were not involved in that

         13    decision?

         14        A.    Astra was not a decision-maker to

         15    purchase securities at that time.

         16        Q.    So if Astra Asset Management UK

         17    purchased Abacus 2006-10 notes in 2013, do

         18    you know who would have been involved in

         19    that decision?

         20        A.    As I said before, Astra Asset

         21    Management wasn't the decision-makers, so

         22    how can they make a decision?  Sorry.

         23        Q.    If Astra Asset Management UK

         24    purchased Abacus 2006-10 securities in

         25    2013, do you know who would have been --

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Are you saying they did not, but

          3    if they did, would I be involved?  That's a

          4    hypothetical question, right?

          5        Q.    My understanding is that Astra

          6    purchased Abacus 2006-10 securities in

          7    2013.  If that's wrong, you can tell me

          8    that, but that's my understanding.  So I'm

          9    just trying to understand who would have

         10    been involved in that decision of purchase.

         11        A.    But when did I say that Astra

         12    purchased -- that's what -- are you asking

         13    me whether Astra purchased?  And I answered

         14    no.

         15        Q.    When is the first time that you

         16    recall Astra purchasing Abacus 2006-10

         17    securities?

         18        A.    As I said, 2014 or '15.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20              Have you ever read any portion of

         21    the Abacus 2006-10 indenture?

         22        A.    Yes.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              What portions did you read?

         25        A.    I don't remember specifically.

          2    There could have been various cites, and I

          3    do remember reading some of them.

          4        Q.    Do you recall the first time that

          5    you read it?

          6        A.    No.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              MR. CROKE:  You want to take a

          9    BY MR. CROKE:

         10        Q.    Mr. Mathur, before the break, you

         11    testified that the first time you recalled

         12    being involved in a decision to purchase

         13    Abacus 2006-10 securities was around the

         14    end of the first quarter of 2013 or

         15    beginning of second quarter 2013, is that

         16    right?

         17        A.    Right.  That's right, yes.

         18        Q.    And those were the Abacus 2006-10

         19    Class A securities, right?

         20        A.    Correct, yes.

         21        Q.    Do you recall the credit rating

         22    of those Class A securities at the time of

         23    that investment?

         24        A.    I don't recall what it was then,

         25    no.


                                                       148

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              You also testified that there was

          4    an Octave Investment Committee meeting

          5    about that Abacus 2006-10 investment, is

          6    that correct?

          7        A.    That usually is the case.  I

          8    don't specifically recall.  But I do

          9    remember that -- I do know that every

         10    single investment goes through an

         11    Investment Committee.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13              Was there an Investment Committee

         14    memo prepared in connection with that

         15    decision?

         16        A.    I don't know that actually.

         17        Q.    Is there typically a memo

         18    prepared for the Investment Committee in

         19    connection with each proposed investment?

         20        A.    Not necessarily.

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Just to clarify that

         22        question, are you talking about --

         23        when you're talking about typically is

         24        there a memo prepared, are you

         25        referring to a specific entity where


                                                       149

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        that memo would be prepared?

          3              MR. CROKE:  I think --

          4    BY MR. CROKE:

          5        Q.    So Mr. Mathur testified that he

          6    was on the Octave Investment Committee and

          7    reviewed that, so my question is just

          8    whether there would be in your capacity on

          9    that Investment Committee, whether there

         10    would typically be a memo prepared for your

         11    review in connection with a proposed

         12    investment.

         13        A.    There could be, but I don't

         14    recall anything.  And it's not a specific

         15    requirement to produce a memo.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              The next investment in the Abacus

         18    2006-10 securities that you recall being

         19    involved in, was that in 2014?

         20        A.    I'd say -- I think that would be

         21    around right, but that is a guess.  I think

         22    it could be '14 or '15, but I think if I

         23    had to guess, it will be '14.

         24        Q.    And do you recall whether that

         25    was a purchase of Abacus 2006-10 securities


                                                       150

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    or a sale?

          3        A.    A purchase is what I implied in

          4    the previous one, so yeah.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              What do you recall about that

          7    next decision to investment in the Abacus

          8    06-10 securities?

          9        A.    No specific recollection, Jake.

         10        Q.    Do you recall what the amount

         11    this was purchased was?

         12        A.    I don't recall.  I'm just

         13    thinking what I know.  Will I be able to

         14    calculate it?  No, I don't recall,

         15    actually, no, no.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              And at that time, were you in

         18    your role at Astra in connection with that,

         19    with the decision to purchase those

         20    securities?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    So to be more specific about it,

         23    I was always at Astra even when I was at

         24    Octave as well.

         25        Q.    Uh-huh.


                                                       151

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    So would I be involved through in

          3    capacity at Astra as well?  Yes.

          4        Q.    Okay.  But, so, the first

          5    purchase we talked about, the one in early

          6    first quarter and second quarter of 2013,

          7    that purchase went to the Octave Investment

          8    Committee, correct?

          9        A.    Correct.

         10        Q.    The purchase in 2014, did that

         11    also go to the Octave Investment Committee?

         12        A.    Depends on when it would have

         13    been in '14.  So I think -- I don't recall

         14    exactly when the transition happened.

         15        Q.    Did Astra have a separate

         16    Investment Committee?

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    I'm thinking it through.  The

         19    reason I'm struggling is do I recall

         20    exactly who the members of the Octave

         21    Investment Committee?  It will depend on

         22    when it would be.

         23        Q.    So I think just stepping back, my

         24    first question is just do you recall

         25    whether at the time of this second


                                                       152

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    purchase, whether there was an Astra

          3    Investment Committee?

          4        A.    If Astra was investment manager,

          5    then it would have Investment Committee per

          6    se.  It's not formal committee like we have

          7    a committee note or anything like that.

          8    It's just more to do with when we have a

          9    decision.  It could be even a more informal

         10    thing sitting around a desk, we just turn

         11    around and start having a discussion and

         12    that will also constitute Investment

         13    Committee.

         14              So it's not quite as formal as

         15    you're probably thinking, so I want to

         16    clarify that as yes.

         17        Q.    Are you currently a member of the

         18    Astra Investment Committee?

         19        A.    Yes, I am.

         20        Q.    And when did you first become a

         21    member of the Astra Investment Committee?

         22        A.    When it was formed, I've always

         23    been a member of Astra Investment Committee

         24    for as long as it existed, so...

         25        Q.    So if there was an Astra


                                                       153

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Investment Committee at the time of this

          3    second purchase, you would have been a

          4    member of it?

          5        A.    Absolutely, yeah.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              What is the next purchase or sale

          8    of Abacus 2006-10 securities that you

          9    recall?

         10        A.    If there was one in '15, then '15

         11    will have been next.

         12        Q.    And do you recall whether it was

         13    a purchase or a sale?

         14        A.    I don't exactly recall.

         15        Q.    After that purchase, do you

         16    recall -- what is the next purchase or sale

         17    of Abacus 2006-10 securities that you

         18    recall during your time?

         19        A.    If there were two in 2015, the

         20    next would probably be in '16.

         21        Q.    What is the first time that you

         22    recall being involved in a decision to sell

         23    Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         25        A.    Again, "involved" is a very broad


                                                       154

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    term.  I would have always been involved in

          3    most important ratings decisions, but -- so

          4    I don't know if that answers your question,

          5    but if you can be more specific as to what

          6    you're asking.

          7        Q.    When was the first time that you

          8    recall being involved at all in any

          9    discussions about a potential sale of

         10    Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         11        A.    You're asking me when as a time?

         12        Q.    When?

         13        A.    I don't remember exactly when.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              Do you, sitting here now, do you

         16    recall that Astra, in fact, sold Abacus

         17    2006-10 --

         18        A.    Yes, I'm aware that they sold,

         19    yes.

         20        Q.    Do you remember whether that was

         21    on one occasion or on multiple occasions?

         22        A.    I remember that there were two

         23    occasions.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25              And do you recall being involved


                                                       155

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    in the decisions to sell securities on the

          3    Abacus 2006-10 securities on both of those

          4    occasions?

          5        A.    I would have been broadly

          6    involved, yes.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              Starting with the first one, why

          9    did Astra decide to sell Abacus 2006-10

         10    securities?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    These are broad decision to do

         13    with many factors.  Some of them would

         14    include whether, for instance, a good price

         15    was achieved for a sale, what kind of yield

         16    you would achieve on buy and sell, whether

         17    our view is better, worse than the

         18    collateral, or securities, or market

         19    conditions.  So it's any decision to buy or

         20    sell securities would involve the exact

         21    same thing as it would involve in Abacus

         22    situation.

         23        Q.    And for that first sale of Abacus

         24    2006-10 securities, do you recall was that

         25    sold through an auction process or through


                                                       156

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    a broker?

          3        A.    I would have thought it sold

          4    through a broker.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              Do you know who was the party on

          7    the other side of the broker that you were

          8    selling the securities to?

          9        A.    No.

         10        Q.    Do you suspect that you know the

         11    identity of the party that was on the other

         12    side of the broker that you sold the Abacus

         13    2006-10 securities to?

         14              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         15        A.    I wasn't involved in the trade at

         16    all.  I actually don't even know the

         17    broker.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19              Have you had any conversations

         20    with anyone at Astra about the identity of

         21    the party that was on the other side of the

         22    broker that Astra sold the Abacus 2006-10

         23    securities to in this first sale that

         24    you're referencing?

         25        A.    The other side I know as a


                                                       157

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    broker, yeah.  But I do not know who that

          3    broker is specifically.

          4        Q.    My question is not about the

          5    identity of the broker that you sold the

          6    securities directly to.  My question is

          7    whether you've had any conversations with

          8    anyone at Astra about who was on the other

          9    side of the broker that Astra sold the

         10    Abacus 2006-10 securities to in this first

         11    transaction, first sale that you're

         12    recalling.

         13        A.    I never said I knew who the other

         14    side of the broker was, who the broker sold

         15    it to -- that's what you're asking?

         16        Q.    I'm not asking whether you know,

         17    sitting here today now.  I'm asking whether

         18    you've had any conversations with anyone at

         19    Astra about who was the party on the other

         20    side of the broker in the sale in which

         21    Astra sold Abacus 2006-10 securities for

         22    the first time.

         23        A.    The question is very convoluted,

         24    Jake.  I'm confused.  You're saying whether

         25    or not I knew who the other party is --


                                                       158

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    No, that's not my question.

          3        A.    No, whether or not I knew,

          4    because I don't know who the party was, who

          5    the broker sold it to.

          6        Q.    That's not my question.

          7        A.    I know, so --

          8        Q.    My question is whether you've had

          9    any conversations with anyone at Astra

         10    about the identity of the party on the

         11    other side of the broker in the sale in

         12    which Astra sold Abacus 2006-10 securities

         13    for the first time.

         14        A.    What I'm saying is that despite

         15    the fact that I do not know who the other

         16    side of the broker is, you're asking me

         17    whether I had a conversation about somebody

         18    that I don't know about?

         19        Q.    I'm asking whether you've had any

         20    conversations with anyone at Astra about

         21    who was or who might be the identity of the

         22    party on the other side of the broker in

         23    the sale for the first time that Astra sold

         24    Abacus 2006-10 securities.

         25        A.    You asked me two questions,


                                                       159

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    either who was or who might be.  Which one

          3    should I answer?

          4        Q.    Have you had any conversations

          5    about either of those circumstances?

          6              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          7        A.    Either of what circumstances?

          8        Q.    Have you had any conversations

          9    with anyone at Astra about who might have

         10    been the identity of the party on the other

         11    side of the broker in the first sale in

         12    which Astra sold Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         13        A.    Might have been -- that's the

         14    only time you asked me a question.  Please

         15    ask it the same way.  Yes.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              And what did you discuss?

         18        A.    I don't remember.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20              Do you recall who you discussed

         21    who might be the identity of that party?

         22        A.    Do I recall?  No.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              Sitting here today, you have no

         25    recollection of any discussions --

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    No specific recollection.

          3        Q.    No specific recollection?

          4        A.    No.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              Are you aware that Mr. Adler has

          7    testified in this action that he suspected

          8    that it was Goldman Sachs on the other side

          9    of the broker in Astra's transactions?

         10        A.    Actually, I didn't know that he

         11    did that.  Did he?

         12        Q.    Did you ever have any

         13    conversations --

         14        A.    Sorry, I shouldn't ask that

         15    question.

         16        Q.    Have you ever had any

         17    conversations with Mr. Adler about whether

         18    or not Goldman Sachs was the purchaser on

         19    the other side of the broker in Astra's

         20    sale of, first sale of Abacus 2006-10

         21    securities?

         22              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

         23        answered.

         24        A.    Whether Goldman was, is that what

         25    your question is?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Have you ever had any

          3    conversations with Mr. Adler about whether

          4    Goldman Sachs was the purchaser on the

          5    other side of the broker in Astra's first

          6    sale of Abacus 2006-10 securities?

          7        A.    Sorry, maybe English isn't my

          8    first language.  Your question is might

          9    have been, then yes.

         10        Q.    So you have had a conversation

         11    with Mr. Adler?

         12        A.    Yes.

         13        Q.    In which you discussed the

         14    possibility that Goldman Sachs --

         15        A.    Yeah.

         16        Q.    -- would be the entity --

         17        A.    That could have been.  I don't

         18    have a specific recollection of that

         19    sentence in the way that you're asking.

         20    But could there have been a conversation

         21    about who might have been the party?  Yes.

         22        Q.    And my question is specifically,

         23    do you recall a conversation with Mr. Adler

         24    in which you discussed the possibility that

         25    it was Goldman Sachs that was the entity on


                                                       162

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    the other side?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

          4        answered.

          5    BY MR. CROKE:

          6        Q.    You can answer.

          7        A.    Ask again, please.  I forgot the

          8    question now.

          9        Q.    Do you recall a conversation with

         10    Mr. Adler in which you discussed the

         11    possibility that it was Goldman Sachs that

         12    was the entity on the other side of Astra's

         13    first sale of Abacus 2006-10 securities to

         14    a broker?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Same objection.

         16        A.    Just to get over this question,

         17    I'm going to say no I don't recall a

         18    specific conversation, but I still don't

         19    understand your question very clearly.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              So you testified earlier that you

         22    recalled conversations about potential

         23    entities that were on the other side of

         24    Astra's first sale of Abacus 2006-10

         25    securities, right?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    I didn't quite say that I recall.

          4    I just simply -- I meant to say, even if I

          5    said it, I meant to say that there may have

          6    been conversations.  I don't have a

          7    specific recollection about a specific

          8    event or a specific conversation.  But if

          9    you were to ask me to guess, would I have

         10    had this conversation, yes.

         11        Q.    And again, I'm just

         12    distinguishing between two things.

         13        A.    Uh-huh.

         14        Q.    I'm not asking about whether you

         15    may have had a conversation with Mr. Adler

         16    in which you discussed generally who could

         17    be the counterparties on the other side of

         18    the broker.  I'm asking specifically

         19    whether you had any conversations with

         20    Mr. Adler in which Goldman Sachs was

         21    specifically discussed as one of the

         22    potential counterparties on the other side

         23    of the transaction?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         25        A.    Correct.

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Asked and answered.

          3    BY MR. CROKE:

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5        A.    But I'll answer that question.

          6    The answer is the same as before, I don't

          7    have a specific recollection, but if you'd

          8    ask me to guess, my guess would be yes,

          9    they would have a conversation where I

         10    would have proposed or he would have

         11    proposed that Goldman could have been a

         12    counterparty on the other side, yes.

         13        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.

         14              And you said earlier that you

         15    recall there being two sales of Abacus

         16    2006-10 securities at Astra.

         17        A.    Yes.

         18        Q.    Do you recall when the second

         19    one?

         20        A.    That would have been '16.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              And do you recall whether that

         23    was a sale through an auction or a sale to

         24    a broker?

         25        A.    A sale to a broker.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Do you know who the entity was

          3    that was on the other side of the broker in

          4    that second sale of Abacus 2006-10

          5    securities?

          6        A.    No.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              Do you recall ever having any

          9    discussions with anyone at Astra about who

         10    might have been the entity on the other

         11    side of the broker in that second sale of

         12    Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         13        A.    The recollection, no.

         14        Q.    Do you recall ever discussing

         15    with Mr. Adler whether it was Goldman Sachs

         16    that was the entity on the other side of

         17    the broker in that second sale of Abacus

         18    2006-10 securities?

         19        A.    I may have misunderstood your

         20    previous question that you asked about the

         21    first sale.  I was just giving a general

         22    guess that if I were to guess, would I have

         23    had a conversation about a counterparty on

         24    the other side of the broker, I did not

         25    specifically answer that question with


                                                       166

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    regards to the first sale or the second

          3    sale.  I was just making a general

          4    statement that that is what I would

          5    probably guess would have happened, and I

          6    don't remember whether it was for the first

          7    one or the second one or both of them.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              But, again, I think we keep

         10    getting confused because I'm trying to

         11    distinguish between a conversation about

         12    general discussions about who might be the

         13    counterparty on the other side and a

         14    conversation in which Goldman Sachs was

         15    specifically discussed as the potential

         16    counterparty on the other side.

         17              So my question, again, for the

         18    second sale of Abacus 2006-10 securities by

         19    Astra, do you recall ever having any

         20    discussions in which you talked about the

         21    possibility that it might be Goldman Sachs

         22    that was the entity on the other side of

         23    the broker?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Just so

         25        the record is clear, is there a time

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        limit on your question, or no?

          3              MR. CROKE:  There is no time

          4        limit on this question.

          5    BY MR. CROKE:

          6        Q.    Do you recall any discussions in

          7    which you talked about the possibility that

          8    it might be Goldman Sachs on the other side

          9    of the broker --

         10        A.    I'm seriously confused, because I

         11    thought I answered that question but you're

         12    telling me that I did not understand the

         13    question properly.  Because my answer is,

         14    and it's the same for both the question

         15    that you asked a while ago and the question

         16    that you asked now -- yes, I understand the

         17    reference to Goldman Sachs that you

         18    mentioned, so I will not get technical, I

         19    will get confused, I have to concentrate on

         20    your answer, okay.

         21              So in an answer to your question,

         22    I have a general -- if I had to guess, I

         23    would have said absolutely I would have had

         24    some kind of a conversation like that.

         25    When, where, what one occasion, both

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    occasion, I don't have a specific

          3    recollection about any conversations

          4    regarding this.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6        A.    Okay?

          7        Q.    Uh-huh.

          8        A.    But I hope I have given you the

          9    answer that you are seeking.  If it is not,

         10    then let me know right now.

         11        Q.    No, that's very helpful.

         12        A.    Okay.

         13        Q.    Do you recall when the last time

         14    that Astra purchased or sold Abacus 2006-10

         15    securities was?

         16        A.    It would have been in 2016.

         17        Q.    2016.

         18              And do you recall when in 2016?

         19        A.    No.  It could have been May

         20    actually.

         21        Q.    May?

         22        A.    I sort of recall now.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              Was the Abacus 2006-10 CDO the

         25    first CDO that Astra purchased?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    Do you have the record date at

          4    hand as to when was the first master

          5    purchase?

          6        Q.    Sir, my question first,

          7    specifically, is just whether you recall,

          8    now sitting here, whether the Abacus 06-10

          9    CDO was the first CDO that Astra purchased.

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11              Just to be clear, would it help

         12        you to look at the dates?

         13        A.    The thing is that I don't want to

         14    answer a question that won't be helpful.  I

         15    want to be helpful to answer that question.

         16    But I don't know the exact date when the

         17    first purchase was.

         18        Q.    Okay.  That's fine.

         19        A.    So I'm just calculating -- the

         20    reason I'm trying to help out is if the

         21    answer is do I first recall right now, the

         22    answer is very easy no.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24        A.    But I'm trying to calculate it in

         25    my mind right now, trying to refresh my


                                                       170

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    memory.  If you like me to do that, it

          3    would be helpful if I see the data that you

          4    may have available.

          5        Q.    Since the last time that Astra

          6    purchased or sold Abacus 2006-10

          7    securities, has Astra submitted any bids to

          8    purchase additional Abacus 2006-10

          9    securities?

         10        A.    Since the last purchase?

         11        Q.    Since the last purchase in 2016.

         12        A.    Yes, there may have been, yeah.

         13        Q.    When is the first one you recall?

         14        A.    After the last actual purchase?

         15        Q.    After the last actual purchase.

         16        A.    The first one that I recall?

         17        Q.    The first instance you recall

         18    after the last actual purchase in which

         19    Astra submitted a bid to purchase

         20    additional Abacus 2006-10 securities.

         21        A.    There was a CDO auction recently.

         22    I don't know the exact date, but this

         23    quarter.

         24        Q.    Oh, so within the last few

         25    months?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Yeah.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              And Astra submitted bids?

          5        A.    Yes, yes.

          6        Q.    Did Astra win those bids?

          7        A.    I'll answer this question, but

          8    I'd prefer if you don't ask specific

          9    questions about Astra's trading strategies,

         10    but the answer is no, we did not win.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              Other than that auction that you

         13    recalled in the last quarter, are there

         14    other instances since 2016 in which you

         15    recall that Astra submitted bids to

         16    purchase Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         17        A.    I don't recall a specific

         18    instance, but there would have been --

         19    there were more transactions -- what I

         20    recall is there were more transactions that

         21    happened.

         22        Q.    Sorry, when you say there were

         23    more transactions that happened, you mean

         24    offers to bid or sell that were not

         25    completed?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Yes, yes, like a D&T, for

          3    instance.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5              During your time at Astra, have

          6    you ever been involved in any trading of

          7    Abacus 2006-10 notes other than the Class A

          8    notes?

          9        A.    So would I have been involved?

         10        Q.    Uh-huh.

         11        A.    The answer is -- I'm struggling

         12    because what does that mean, trading

         13    instances in the sense, a completed sale

         14    or --

         15        Q.    A completed purchase or sale of

         16    Abacus 2006-10 notes of any class other

         17    than the Class A notes.

         18        A.    Was I personally involved?  No.

         19        Q.    Do you know whether Astra has

         20    engaged in any trading of Abacus 2006-10

         21    notes other than the Class A notes?

         22        A.    No.

         23        Q.    And just so I'm clear, do you

         24    know that Astra has not engaged in any

         25    trading?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Sorry, can you go back to the

          3    previous question?  I may not have answered

          4    it accurately.

          5        Q.    Sure.

          6              During your time at Astra, have

          7    you ever been involved in any trading of

          8    Abacus 2006-10 notes other than the Class A

          9    notes?

         10        A.    No.  Sorry.  I just want to make

         11    sure.

         12        Q.    I appreciate it.

         13        A.    Okay.

         14        Q.    And are you aware of any

         15    instances in which Astra has traded Abacus

         16    2006-10 notes other than the Class A notes?

         17        A.    No.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19        A.    Sorry, just want to make sure --

         20        Q.    No, I appreciate that.

         21        A.    I thought you were asking about

         22    DB.

         23        Q.    No, no.  We'll get to that.

         24              What is the original face value

         25    of the Abacus 2006-10 securities that Astra


                                                       174

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    currently owns?

          3        A.    When you say Astra currently

          4    owns, do you mean manage?

          5        Q.    Yeah.  The original face value of

          6    the Abacus 2006-10 securities in the funds

          7    that Astra manages and is pursuing this

          8    action on behalf of.

          9        A.    You're characterizing it pursuing

         10    this action, but excluding that for a

         11    moment, but you're asking me --

         12        Q.    I'm just trying to understand

         13    what is the original face value of the

         14    Abacus 2006-10 securities held in the funds

         15    that Astra manages.

         16        A.    I don't know the split between

         17    funds and managed account actually.

         18        Q.    I'm not trying to draw a

         19    distinction between the two of them.  My

         20    question is just what is the original face

         21    value of the Abacus 2006-10 securities that

         22    are either held in funds that Astra

         23    manages, or in managed accounts that Astra

         24    manages, what is the total original face

         25    value of those securities?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Okay, yes.  That is 47 and a half

          3    million to my recollection.

          4        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.

          5              And is the current outstanding

          6    face value of those securities some number

          7    less than that?

          8        A.    Well, that depends.  It is my

          9    belief that it isn't, but there has been

         10    some collections on them.

         11        Q.    What do you mean by that?

         12        A.    The pool factor is less than 1.

         13        Q.    And if the factor is less than 1,

         14    that means that the current outstanding

         15    face value is less than the original face

         16    value, correct?

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    Not -- generally speaking, that

         19    would be the case.  In this instance, it

         20    shouldn't be the case.

         21        Q.    And why shouldn't it be the case?

         22        A.    Because the factor should be 1.

         23        Q.    And why should the factor be 1?

         24        A.    Because the outstanding notional

         25    should be the same as the real face


                                                       176

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    notional on this.

          3        Q.    And why should the outstanding

          4    notional be the same as the original face

          5    value?

          6        A.    Because there should be no

          7    write-downs of this one.

          8        Q.    And why should there be no

          9    write-downs?

         10        A.    We can go into a very long

         11    discussion about this one, but I think

         12    you -- or the answer to the proceedings are

         13    perhaps a testament of why there shouldn't

         14    be one.

         15        Q.    But setting aside for the moment

         16    your views as to what should or shouldn't

         17    be the case, is it correct that the current

         18    outstanding face value of the Abacus 06-10

         19    notes that Astra holds or manages is

         20    something less than $47.5 million?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    I would limit my answer to the

         23    fact that the trustee report states that

         24    the current notional of the notes is less

         25    than 47 and a half million.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              And the way that the trustee

          4    report reflects that is that the trustee

          5    report includes a factor for the notes, is

          6    that correct?

          7        A.    It does.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              And again, setting aside for the

         10    moment the question of what any beliefs as

         11    to what should or should not be the case

         12    here, the way in which you would calculate

         13    the outstanding face value of the notes

         14    would be to multiply the original face

         15    value by the current factor, is that

         16    correct?

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    Talking in case of Abacus?

         19        Q.    Yes.

         20        A.    Yes.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              And do you know what the current

         23    factor for the Class A notes is for the

         24    Abacus 06-10 CD?

         25        A.    06-10 CDO?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    The Abacus 2006-10 CDO.  Do you

          3    know what the current factor is for the

          4    Class A notes?

          5        A.    Oh, Class A notes.  Yes, I do

          6    know what the current factor is.

          7        Q.    And what is it?

          8        A.    It's about .69.

          9        Q.    So if you multiply .69 times the

         10    47.5 million original face value of notes

         11    that Astra owns or manages, that yields

         12    roughly $33 million outstanding face value,

         13    correct?

         14        A.    On the basis of the previous

         15    conversation in that context, yes.

         16        Q.    Were the Abacus 2006-10

         17    collateral securities a factor in any of

         18    Astra's decisions to purchase Abacus

         19    2006-10 securities?

         20              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         21        A.    The factor of Abacus 06-10?

         22        Q.    I'm not using the term factor to

         23    refer to the factor of the notes.

         24              I'm saying in considering whether

         25    or not to purchase the Abacus 2006-10

          2    securities, were the Abacus 2006-10

          3    collateral securities a factor that was

          4    considered?

          5              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          6        A.    Considered when?

          7        Q.    In the decision to purchase

          8    Abacus 2006-10 securities.

          9        A.    When?

         10        Q.    At any point.

         11        A.    Look, like any purchase of any

         12    security, there are a multitude of factors

         13    that are considered, with collateral

         14    security becoming part of those factors, I

         15    would have thought so.  But do I have a

         16    specific recollection about that?  No.

         17        Q.    So you don't have a specific

         18    recollection as to whether the Abacus

         19    2006-10 collateral securities were a factor

         20    considered in any of Astra's decisions to

         21    Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         22              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         23        A.    When you say -- I'm trying to

         24    understand the question here.  When I make

         25    a decision about purchasing securities,


                                                       180

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    does collateral security form a part of the

          3    decision-making process?  Is that your

          4    question?

          5        Q.    No.

          6              My question is whether you have a

          7    specific recollection as to whether the

          8    Abacus 2006-10 collateral securities were a

          9    factor in any of Astra's decisions to

         10    purchase Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    Of course, as I answered before,

         13    when I'm buying these securities,

         14    collateral securities become part of a

         15    decision-making factor.

         16        Q.    I'm not speaking generally.  I'm

         17    asking do you have a specific recollection

         18    that the Abacus 2006-10 --

         19        A.    No, no specific recollection, no.

         20        Q.    So no specific recollection --

         21        A.    No.

         22        Q.    -- as to whether the Abacus

         23    2006-10 collateral securities were a factor

         24    in any of Astra's decisions to purchase

         25    Abacus 2006-10 securities?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    That is correct.

          4        Q.    After Astra's initial purchase of

          5    the Abacus 2006-10 securities, were you

          6    involved in monitoring the risk associated

          7    with that investment?

          8        A.    Involved with, again, is a broad

          9    term.  Yes, I'm involved in pretty much a

         10    lot of things that happen in Astra.  So

         11    involved, yes.

         12        Q.    And do you recall anything in

         13    particular that you did in connection with

         14    managing that risk?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    I don't know how to answer that

         17    question.  When you say what do I recall

         18    specifically.  There is no specific

         19    recollection about how to manage a

         20    portfolio.  A portfolio is being managed by

         21    a multitude of factors and -- but the

         22    reason I hesitate to answer this question

         23    is because you can't be seriously asking me

         24    that right now in this conversation, can

         25    you?  If you be more specific about these


                                                       182

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    questions, I'll be very happy to give you

          3    very accurate answers.

          4        Q.    Sure.

          5        A.    But it's such broad questions.

          6        Q.    Sir, I don't think it's intended

          7    to be a broad question.

          8              I asked whether you were involved

          9    in monitoring the risk associated with the

         10    Abacus 2006-10 securities at Astra, and you

         11    said you were involved.  And I asked

         12    whether you recalled anything in particular

         13    that you did in connection with managing

         14    that risk.

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    When you say particularly you

         17    did, do you mean did I take some actions

         18    specific to Abacus 06-10 securities?

         19        Q.    You said that you were involved

         20    in monitoring the risk associated with the

         21    Abacus 2006-10 investments during your time

         22    at Astra.

         23        A.    Uh-huh.

         24        Q.    What do you recall about managing

         25    the risk associated with the Abacus 2006-10


                                                       183

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    investments during your time at Astra?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Maybe I

          4        can help out.  You keep switching the

          5        terms "monitoring" and "managing" and

          6        maybe that is adding to the confusion.

          7        If you want to clarify that question,

          8        maybe that could help.  But I want the

          9        record to be clear that you are

         10        switching those terms.

         11        A.    But I don't even understand

         12    either of the terms.  What is -- see,

         13    monitoring is a very specific task, which

         14    simply means I look at it, but I don't do

         15    anything.  Managing is a different task, I

         16    look at it and do something, for instance.

         17        Q.    Uh-huh.

         18        A.    Okay.  My job as a portfolio

         19    manager or a CIO, whichever you look at it,

         20    is to manage a whole portfolio.  Unless

         21    you're asking me something specific about

         22    did I do something specific about Abacus in

         23    monitoring that -- that is not my role in

         24    the firm.  My role in the firm is to manage

         25    the borrowed risk of the fund, not about


                                                       184

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    monitoring specific assets.

          3              The reason I'm struggling to

          4    answer that question is do I specifically

          5    monitor or manage a certain asset, the

          6    answer is no.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8        A.    Okay.

          9        Q.    So you don't recall having any

         10    specific involvement in managing or

         11    monitoring the risk associated with Abacus

         12    2006-10?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    I just gave you the answer.  I'm

         15    not going to change that answer.  You've

         16    got the answer, right?

         17        Q.    I'm not asking you to change your

         18    answer.  I'm just trying to make sure it's

         19    clear.

         20              Do you recall having any

         21    specific -- strike that.

         22              Do you have a specific

         23    recollection of anything that you did in

         24    connection with managing or monitoring the

         25    risk associated with the Abacus 2006-10

          2    securities during your time at Astra?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

          4        answered.

          5        A.    Anything specific that I did in

          6    monitoring or managing Astra, I'm still not

          7    clear what you're trying to ask me.

          8        Q.    I understand your point that you

          9    were involved in managing the risk

         10    associated with a large portfolio.

         11              My question to you is very

         12    specific, it's do you recall anything

         13    specific that you did in connection with

         14    monitoring or managing the risk associated

         15    with the Abacus 2006-10 securities.

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         17        A.    I didn't do anything -- when you

         18    use the word "specific," I understand

         19    something particular that I wouldn't do

         20    otherwise for anything else.  Is that what

         21    you mean by "specific"?

         22        Q.    I'm asking you whether you have

         23    any specific recollection of doing anything

         24    specific with respect to monitoring or

         25    managing the risk associated with the


                                                       186

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Abacus 2006-10 securities?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          4        A.    You're putting two specific words

          5    in your sentence, specific recollection on

          6    a specific thing that I do.

          7        Q.    Uh-huh.

          8        A.    Right?

          9        Q.    Uh-huh.

         10        A.    What do you mean by the two

         11    specifics?  That's what I'm struggling to

         12    understand here.  Did I do anything

         13    particular that I wouldn't do for something

         14    else that I did for Abacus?  Is that your

         15    question?

         16        Q.    My question is whether you recall

         17    doing anything specific with respect to

         18    Abacus?  If your answer is that you had a

         19    process that you followed with respect to

         20    the portfolio and that there was nothing

         21    different with respect to Abacus than

         22    something else, then that's fine.  I'm just

         23    trying to understand whether that's the

         24    case.

         25              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    So you want to use one specific

          3    thing right now, do I have a specific

          4    recollection?  That's the only specific you

          5    used in the second question?

          6        Q.    Do you have a process that you

          7    followed at Astra with respect to the

          8    portfolio as a whole?

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         10              MR. CROKE:  Sorry, let me

         11        rephrase.

         12    BY MR. CROKE:

         13        Q.    Do you have a process at Astra

         14    with respect to managing the risk of the

         15    portfolio of the securities that Astra

         16    manages?

         17        A.    Generally, there is a process,

         18    yeah.

         19        Q.    Is there anything that you did at

         20    Astra with respect to managing the risk

         21    associated with the Abacus 2006-10 CDO that

         22    was different from what you did with

         23    respect to managing the risk associated

         24    with other securities in that portfolio?

         25        A.    That's a much better question.


                                                       188

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    It depends on what time you're looking at

          3    and it depends on different assets.  For

          4    example, if I want an RMBS asset, I'll look

          5    to manage the risk of an RMBS asset

          6    differently to managing a AB CDO asset.  So

          7    there are differences in the two aspects.

          8        Q.    I understand that different

          9    securities have different asset classes,

         10    can be managed differently.

         11              My question is do you recall

         12    anything specific about the Abacus 2006-10

         13    CDO that you did that was different from

         14    what you did in managing the risk

         15    associated with the other securities?

         16        A.    For example, if you're asking me

         17    have you done any of the proceedings such

         18    as this, this is something different that

         19    we're doing for Abacus, is sitting here and

         20    having a deposition, for instance.  This is

         21    something different that I've had to do for

         22    Abacus CDO that I wouldn't have had to do

         23    or had to have to do for something else.

         24    Does that qualify?

         25        Q.    Other than this proceeding and

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    the, you know, correspondence between

          3    attorneys leading up to it, in the course

          4    of your day-to-day role as a trader and as

          5    a manager of a portfolio of risk, was there

          6    anything that you did with respect to the

          7    Abacus 2006-10 CDO that was different from

          8    what you did with respect to the other

          9    assets that you managed?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11        A.    My role is much broader in the

         12    firm than a role of an analyst or a trader.

         13    I hope you understand that.  And my role

         14    doesn't become specific in a specific

         15    instance related to an asset.

         16              If somebody comes and asks me a

         17    specific question about Abacus 06-10 Class

         18    A notes, that would be a specific task or a

         19    specific decision that I would have had to

         20    make on that matter and that will be very

         21    specific to Abacus 06-10.

         22              Will there be specific instances

         23    about every other asset that could relate

         24    to this?  The answer is yes.  If you ask me

         25    another, say, European ABS that we own


                                                       190

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    right now, would another trader come to me

          3    with a specific question or a specific

          4    action that I would need to take on that

          5    asset, for instance, a corporate action,

          6    the answer would be yes.  So maybe you are

          7    trying to ask me something, but I'm not

          8    getting it.

          9        Q.    In your role at Astra, are you

         10    involved in setting valuations for

         11    securities that Astra owns?

         12        A.    Was I involved in setting

         13    valuations?

         14        Q.    Are you involved at Astra in

         15    setting the valuations for the securities

         16    that Astra owns?

         17        A.    Again, very broad term -- am I

         18    involved, yes.  But setting valuation, no.

         19    So it's a contradictory question.

         20        Q.    So are you involved in setting

         21    the valuations for the securities?  Because

         22    I think you just said you're involved, but

         23    not in setting the valuations.  I'm just

         24    trying to understand.

         25        A.    I don't set the value of an asset


                                                       191

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    individually.

          3        Q.    Uh-huh.

          4        A.    That's what I'm saying.  Am I

          5    involved, I'm saying yes.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              What is your involvement in

          8    setting the valuations of those securities?

          9        A.    For instance, I am a part of the

         10    Valuation Committee --

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Do you want to take a

         12        pause?  There's a phone ringing.

         13        Okay.

         14        A.    That is, for instance.

         15        Q.    So you're a member of the

         16    Valuation Committee?

         17        A.    Yes.

         18        Q.    And is the Valuation Committee at

         19    Astra responsible for setting the

         20    valuations of the securities that Astra

         21    holds?

         22        A.    Well, ultimately the investment

         23    manager is responsible for the valuation of

         24    it.  The key operating word here is

         25    "responsibility" and who is eventually


                                                       192

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    responsible for it.  The answer is the

          3    investment manager is eventually

          4    responsible for it.

          5        Q.    So who is responsible for setting

          6    the valuation of the Abacus 2006-10

          7    securities that Astra held?

          8        A.    There is a process to come up

          9    with a value of securities.

         10        Q.    Uh-huh.

         11        A.    As I answered before, eventually

         12    it's the investment manager who is

         13    responsible for the value or asserting the

         14    value of every security, which includes

         15    Abacus CDO.  But there is no specific

         16    person.

         17        Q.    And who is the person at the

         18    investment manager who is responsible for

         19    that?

         20        A.    As I just answered, there is no

         21    specific person individually responsible

         22    for it.

         23        Q.    Who are the people who are

         24    involved in that process?

         25        A.    Valuation Committee, for


                                                       193

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    instance, and a lot of other people at the

          3    firm may be involved in that process.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5              So do you know, sitting here

          6    today, who the individuals were who were

          7    involved in setting the valuations for the

          8    Abacus 2006-10 securities that Astra held?

          9        A.    At Astra, yes, I would be.

         10        Q.    And who are those?

         11        A.    I would be able to tell you a few

         12    names, but it depends on which timeframe

         13    you're talking about.

         14        Q.    Sure.  We can just start in 2013.

         15        A.    In 2013, the trading team would

         16    have been involved.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18        A.    Within Astra.

         19        Q.    And who was on that trading team

         20    in 2013?

         21        A.    That included Mark Thomas and

         22    Tereza Svedova.

         23        Q.    And who else was involved at

         24    Astra in 2013 in setting the valuation the

         25    Abacus 2006-10 securities?


                                                       194

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    '13, it could have been Paul

          3    Phillips as well at that time -- yeah,

          4    actually he was in 2013, yes, would have

          5    been there.

          6        Q.    Anyone else?

          7        A.    There could be more people within

          8    Astra.

          9        Q.    Were you involved in 2013?

         10        A.    Yes, I was, yeah.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              In 2014, was the list of people

         13    involved different?

         14        A.    It could have been.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              Do you recall who it was in 2014?

         17        A.    I recall I was there.

         18        Q.    Uh-huh.

         19        A.    I think Tereza would have been

         20    involved as well.  So would have been

         21    Christian, I think.  Yeah.

         22        Q.    Anyone else that you can recall?

         23        A.    '14, Mark Thomas would also have

         24    been involved.  But there could be more

         25    people.  This is not an exhaustive list.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    In 2016, do you recall who would

          3    have been involved in setting the

          4    valuations for the Abacus 2006-10

          5    securities that Astra held?

          6        A.    I have a specific problem with

          7    "setting" things, so please rephrase the

          8    question and then I can answer that

          9    question appropriately.

         10              The Valuation Committee and

         11    people involved in valuation is not

         12    necessarily setting the valuation of it.

         13    They're involved in the process.  It

         14    doesn't mean that they're setting the

         15    valuation of it.  That's why I can't answer

         16    that question.

         17        Q.    Who was involved in the process

         18    of determining Astra's valuation for the

         19    Abacus 2006-10 securities in 2016?

         20        A.    That would have been

         21    administrator, for instance.  That would

         22    have been an external Valuation Committee,

         23    for instance.  And input from traders, for

         24    instance.

         25        Q.    So would an external -- you said


                                                       196

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    external Valuation Committee, would they

          3    have not been involved in 2013 or 2014?

          4        A.    It could have been, but that was

          5    a different question you asked then.

          6        Q.    And what's the distinction, in

          7    your view, between setting and determining

          8    the value of the Abacus 2006-10 securities?

          9        A.    Setting is a deterministic thing

         10    and coming up with a valuation is a part of

         11    a process that needs to be followed, and it

         12    excludes some sort of discretion.

         13        Q.    I think we might be talking past

         14    each other a little bit.

         15        A.    Uh-huh.

         16        Q.    I'm trying to understand who at

         17    Astra was involved in the process by which

         18    Astra would come up with the number that it

         19    used as the value for the Abacus 2006-10 --

         20        A.    I can answer that question.

         21        Q.    Sure.  And who was that at Astra

         22    in 2016?

         23        A.    That would have been the trading

         24    personnel at that time.  So that would

         25    include me.  It could have -- involvement


                                                       197

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    could include in '16 Mark Thomas, Tereza

          3    Svedova, once again.  It could probably

          4    also involve Christian and Michael Holdem,

          5    yeah.

          6        Q.    Was there anyone outside of Astra

          7    who would be involved in that process?

          8              MR. ITKIN:  Objection?

          9        A.    In setting the valuation?

         10        Q.    In the process by which Astra

         11    would come up with a number that it used

         12    for the value for the Abacus 2006-10 CDO.

         13        A.    Yes, I answered that question,

         14    which is other external parties were

         15    involved, too.

         16        Q.    And what were the valuations of

         17    the Abacus 2006-10 securities based on?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    Determination of the Valuation

         20    Committee.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              And what factors did the

         23    Valuation Committee, in determining the

         24    value of the Abacus 2006-10, use?

         25        A.    Generally speaking, for all


                                                       198

          2    assets we use external available prices for

          3    these.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5              Are external prices available for

          6    all securities?

          7        A.    For most securities.

          8        Q.    Do you recall whether external

          9    prices were available for the Abacus

         10    2006-10 Class A securities during this

         11    time?

         12        A.    I don't know if at all times.

         13    But if you ask me in certain times -- or

         14    can you ask me again that question?

         15        Q.    Sure.

         16              In 2016, do you recall whether

         17    external prices were available for the

         18    Abacus 2006-10 Class A securities?

         19        A.    Do I specifically recall?  The

         20    answer is no.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22        A.    But just so that I don't sound

         23    like I'm repeating the question, if you

         24    want me to guess it, I'd say yes.

         25        Q.    Okay.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              Are you aware of any instance in

          3    which Astra did not follow its procedures

          4    in setting the valuation for any security?

          5              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          6        A.    It's a very broad question.  And

          7    do I recall any instance?  I wouldn't think

          8    so.

          9        Q.    Are you aware of any instance in

         10    which Astra's valuations for the Abacus

         11    2006-10 securities were inaccurate?

         15    the market value of the Abacus 2006-10

         16    securities.

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    What do you mean by "market

         19    value" in this instance?

         20        Q.    Sure.

         21              Do you recall any instances in

         22    which you believed that the value of the

         10        Q.    Sure.

         11              A, in this example, is the value

         12    that Astra has on its books for the Abacus

         13    2006-10 securities.  B is your belief as to

         14    the value of the Abacus 2006-10 securities.

         15              I'm asking whether you recall any

         16    instances in which you believed that the

         17    value of the Abacus 2006-10 securities was

         18    different from the value recorded on

         19    Astra's books?

         20              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         21        A.    You, in the previous question,

         22    you asked market value.  Now you're asking

         23    value.  Which one is it?

         24        Q.    Can you answer the question I

         25    just asked?

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    The value?

          4        Q.    I'm asking whether you recall any

          5    instances in which you believed that the

          6    value of the Abacus 2006-10 securities was

          7    different from the value recorded on

          8    Astra's books.

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         10        A.    Those are apples to oranges that

         11    you're asking me to compare.  What I

         12    believe to be a value of the asset may or

         13    may not necessarily be the market value of

         14    the asset or the net asset value that I

         15    meant to record anything.

         16              The whole purpose of buying an

         17    asset is that I consider the value and all

         18    securities, not just Abacus, to be

         19    different and happily higher than what we

         20    buy them at, for instance.  Otherwise, why

         21    would we have them?

         22        Q.    So do you believe that the value

         23    of the Abacus 2006-10 securities was at

         24    some point, in your view, was at some point

         25    higher than the market -- the value of the


                                                       202

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Abacus 2006-10 securities on Astra's books?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          4        A.    We don't record value of any

          5    securities of Astra's book.

          6        Q.    Astra doesn't record the

          7    valuations of any securities?

          8        A.    I just told you that you're

          9    asking two different questions.  In one

         10    instance you're saying market value --

         11    either you're trying to ask value or you're

         12    trying to ask market value.  We have no

         13    procedure in place to assert a value of an

         14    asset.  We have a procedure to assert a

         15    market value of the asset.

         16        Q.    Is there any instance in which

         17    you believed that the market value of the

         18    Abacus 2006-10 securities was different

         19    from the market value of the Abacus 2006-10

         20    securities recorded on Astra's books?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    So what are the two different

         23    things you want me to compare right now?

         24    Market value versus the valuation?

         25        Q.    I'll read back the question.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    I heard it.

          3        Q.    Is there any instance in which

          4    you believe that the market value of the

          5    Abacus 2006-10 securities was different

          6    from the market value of the Abacus 2006-10

          7    securities recorded on Astra's books?

          8              MR. ITKIN:  Same objection.

          9        A.    We record result of the Valuation

         10    Committee on Astra's book, okay.  And that

         11    is the market value that the Valuation

         12    Committee asserts to any security,

         13    including Abacus 06-10 CDO.

         14              The market value in itself is

         15    something that every trader can determine.

         16    For example, Jake, if you're a trader of

         17    Abacus 10 securities, you might think

         18    market value of it is different in your own

         19    analysis compared to what it is.  Unless

         20    there is an observable trading price out

         21    there in the market, you may have a

         22    different value to me.

         23        Q.    Uh-huh.

         24        A.    And what will we believe we

         25    recorded in Astra's books is what we


                                                       204

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    believed the market would be on that

          3    security purely based on the valuation

          4    mechanism that we followed.

          5        Q.    And the valuation mechanism that

          6    you follow is based on market trading

          7    prices?

          8        A.    It is a fairly lengthy document.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10        A.    And it does include market

         11    trading prices when it needs to.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13              And for a security like the

         14    Abacus -- or rather just for the Abacus

         15    2006-10 security, is the input of market

         16    trading prices based on the bid or the

         17    offer?

         18        A.    There is a valuation memorandum

         19    out there in Astra that we pursue.  I don't

         20    specifically recall whether it has a bid or

         21    offer, but if I had to guess, it has to be

         22    a bid.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24        A.    But that would only be one of the

         25    factors to be included in any asset


                                                       205

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    valuation.

          3        Q.    Uh-huh.

          4        A.    With respect to Abacus 06-10

          5    securities or securities similar to that,

          6    there is not always a market observable

          7    trading price for a security that's out

          8    there.  Hence, you have to pursue the

          9    valuation procedures in principal.

         10        Q.    And under those circumstances

         11    when there is an observable market trading

         12    price, is that an important factor used in

         13    setting --

         14              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         15        A.    Again, I've answered that

         16    question before as well.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Has Astra entered into any

         19    agreements related to Abacus 2006-10 notes?

         20              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              What are those agreements?

         24        A.    One of the agreements would be,

         25    for instance, a transfer pricing mechanism,


                                                       206

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    that would be an agreement between fund A

          3    and fund B.

          4        Q.    Are there others?

          5        A.    There could be others, yeah.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              What others are there?

          8        A.    With respect to the securities

          9    that we hold?

         10        Q.    With respect to Abacus 2006-10

         11    securities, what are the other agreements

         12    that Astra has entered into?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    There is a corporation or a --

         15    no, a common interest agreement between

         16    Astra and the counterparty.

         17        Q.    And that's a common interest

         18    agreement between Astra and Deutsche Bank,

         19    correct?

         20        A.    Correct.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              When did Astra and Deutsche Bank

         23    enter into that agreement?

         24        A.    I think sometime in '17.

         25        Q.    Okay.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    I think.

          3        Q.    Is that agreement memorialized in

          4    writing?

          5        A.    I believe so.

          6        Q.    Is that agreement still in effect

          7    today?

          8        A.    What does that mean?  You mean

          9    has it been terminated, is that the

         10    question?

         11        Q.    Do you know whether the agreement

         12    is still in effect today?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    Oh, that's a legal term.  I don't

         15    understand that.  If you ask me if it's

         16    terminated or not, I can answer that

         17    question.

         18        Q.    Sure.

         19        A.    No, it's not been terminated, no.

         20        Q.    When was the last time you

         21    communicated with Deutsche Bank, or anyone

         22    at Deutsche Bank rather, regarding the

         23    Abacus 2006-10 CDO?

         24        A.    The last time -- sometime this

         25    year, but not -- I don't remember in the


                                                       208

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    last couple of months, if that's the

          3    question.

          4        Q.    Has Astra entered into any other

          5    agreements related to the Abacus 2006-10

          6    securities?

          7        A.    Yes.

          8        Q.    What are those other agreements?

          9        A.    Just to clarify, it's not Astra

         10    Asset Management, when you say Astra.  It's

         11    Astra another entity, Astra.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13        A.    There's another agreement,

         14    there's a side letter.

         15        Q.    And is that an agreement with

         16    Deutsche Bank?

         17        A.    That is also an agreement with

         18    Deutsche Bank.

         19        Q.    When did Astra enter into that

         20    agreement?

         21        A.    September 2008 -- wait a second.

         22    I actually don't remember.  Sometime in

         23    late 2018.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25              What are the terms of that


                                                       209

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    agreement?

          3        A.    The terms broadly are that Astra

          4    will partake from any recoveries that may

          5    happen on some of the subordinate notes.

          6        Q.    And those are the subordinate

          7    notes held by Deutsche Bank, correct?

          8        A.    I don't know for sure if they're

          9    still held by Deutsche Bank.

         10        Q.    But at the time that Astra

         11    entered into the agreement, those were

         12    notes that were, at that point, held by

         13    Deutsche Bank?

         14        A.    I can only guess, but I assume

         15    so.

         16        Q.    And pursuant to that agreement,

         17    Deutsche Bank agreed to pay Astra 55

         18    percent of any recoveries that Deutsche

         19    Bank received on those notes, is that

         20    right?

         21        A.    That sounds about right.

         22        Q.    What did Astra give to Deutsche

         23    Bank in exchange for that offer from

         24    Deutsche Bank?

         25        A.    When you say what did he give, do


                                                       210

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    you mean the fund, monies?

          3        Q.    Well, Deutsche Bank agreed to

          4    give Astra 55 percent of any recoveries.

          5        A.    Uh-huh.

          6        Q.    So what did Astra agree to give

          7    Deutsche Bank as part of that agreement?

          8        A.    I'm not sure I understand.  By

          9    giving, you mean -- I'd like to believe

         10    that the conversation that I had with DB,

         11    specifically with regards to the

         12    subordinated securities, are confidential

         13    in nature and I would be breaching my duty

         14    of confidentiality towards them by talking

         15    in depth about what they wanted me to do.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              MR. CROKE:  I'm going to show you

         18        an exhibit here.  I think it will be

          9        Q.    ASTRA 00035204 through 35209.

         10        A.    Uh-huh.

         11        Q.    Do you recognize this document?

         12        A.    It seems like it would be the

         13    side letter.

         14        Q.    So the agreement we were just

         15    discussing?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              If you look at paragraph 1 of

         19    this document, on the first page, do you

         20    see where it says:  Astra hereby agrees

         21    that it will use its reasonable efforts to

         22    achieve a recovery, in quotes, as defined

         23    below for the DB notes, and it continues

         24    on?

         25        A.    Yep.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And if you turn to the last page,

          3    do you see that this is an annex, the top

          4    says the DB notes?

          5        A.    Yep.

          6        Q.    And you see that the DB notes

          7    here include $19 million outstanding

          8    principal balance, it's labeled, of the

          9    Class B notes; 10 million of the Class D

         10    notes, $10 million of the Class F notes,

         11    and $9.5 million of the Class J notes,

         12    correct?

         13        A.    I can read that.

         14        Q.    And this is all for the Abacus

         15    2006-10 CDO, correct?

         16        A.    Correct.

         17        Q.    All of the DB notes referenced

         18    here have written down to zero, is that

         19    correct?

         20        A.    That's what the trustee report

         21    would say.

         22        Q.    Pursuant to this agreement, in

         23    any circumstance in which Deutsche Bank has

         24    an option to exercise voting rights with

         25    respect to the DB notes, Deutsche Bank is


                                                       213

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    obligated to vote in accordance with

          3    Astra's directions except for certain

          4    specified circumstances, is that right?

          5              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          6        A.    If that is what it says, then

          7    yes.

          8        Q.    You can take a look at -- if you

          9    look at paragraph 1, do you see, starting

         10    in the second sentence:  DB hereby agrees

         11    to vote on any matter that arises with

         12    respect to the DB notes in accordance with

         13    Astra's direction, so long as DB receives

         14    such direction from Astra prior to the

         15    deadline or record date for the exercise of

         16    its voting rights with respect to the DB

         17    notes?

         18        A.    I read that.

         19        Q.    And then it goes on to list

         20    certain circumstances where DB is not under

         21    an obligation to vote.

         22              And then in the last sentence, do

         23    you see that it says:  In the event that DB

         24    does not vote in respect of the DB floats

         25    in accordance with Astra's direction, for


                                                       214

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    any reason set forth in clause 1, 2, 3 or 4

          3    of the immediately preceding sentence,

          4    Astra will have the right to exercise the

          5    Astra purchase option as defined below.

          6        A.    Correct.

          7        Q.    Do you see that?

          8        A.    I see that.

          9        Q.    And pursuant to the Astra

         10    purchase option, that gives Astra the

         11    option to purchase all of DB's notes for

         12    $400, is that correct?

         13        A.    Is that correct?  Where do you

         14    read $400?

         15        Q.    Sure.  If you go to the second

         16    page under 2C, at the end there it talks

         17    about "or in the case where the

         18    circumstances described in the last

         19    sentence of paragraph 1 are applicable" --

         20    so that's the sentence we just read --

         21    "Astra shall have the right to purchase the

         22    DB notes prior to any sale, transfer or

         23    conveyance to another party for an amount

         24    in USD in immediately available funds equal

         25    to USD 100 for each class of the DB notes


                                                       215

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    as listed in the annex hereto."

          3              Do you see that?

          4        A.    Yeah, I see that.

          5        Q.    And there's four classes of

          6    notes?

          7        A.    Yeah, yeah, understood.

          8        Q.    So it's $400, is that right?

          9        A.    Yeah.

         10        Q.    And pursuant to this agreement,

         11    Deutsche Bank is also prohibited from

         12    selling its notes to anyone without first

         13    giving Astra an option to purchase the

         14    notes for $400, is that correct?

         15        A.    If that's what it says, yes.  I

         16    mean -- you're not asking me to review in

         17    front of this document, are you?

         18        Q.    Were you involved in the

         19    discussions leading to this document?

         20        A.    Yes, I would have been involved.

         21        Q.    And do you recall discussing that

         22    as one of the terms of the agreement?

         23        A.    Specifically, no.  Actually, no.

         24        Q.    You don't recall any specific

         25    discussion as to whether Astra would have a


                                                       216

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    right of first refusal to purchase Deutsche

          3    Bank's notes?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

          5        answered.

          6        A.    I had a broad inclusion in this

          7    matter.  And in fact, I was the primary

          8    person who had a conversation with DB about

          9    this matter, but I didn't negotiate this

         10    doc.

         11        Q.    Do you remember having

         12    discussions with Deutsche Bank about giving

         13    Astra an option, a right of first refusal

         14    to purchase Deutsche Bank's notes?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    Specifically, no, no.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Was it your idea for Astra and

         19    Deutsche Bank to enter into this agreement?

         20        A.    I don't remember that, actually.

         21        Q.    Do you recall whose idea it was?

         22        A.    No.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              And why did Astra and Deutsche

         25    Bank --


                                                       217

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Actually, I do recall, actually.

          3    I think a portion of it probably came from

          4    Deutsche Bank.

          5        Q.    I'm sorry, a portion of what?

          6        A.    A portion that we should have an

          7    agreement came in from Deutsche Bank is

          8    what my recollection is.

          9        Q.    Sorry, the notion that you should

         10    have an agreement or --

         11        A.    Yes, the notion, the notion.

         12        Q.    Sorry.  Thank you.

         13              Other than this agreement with

         14    Deutsche Bank and other than the common

         15    interest agreement that we just discussed,

         16    has Astra entered into any other agreements

         17    related to the Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         18        A.    With any counterparty?

         19        Q.    With anyone.

         20        A.    Oh, okay.

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    I think there are broader

         23    agreements that specifically involve Abacus

         24    that I don't recall.  But there must have

         25    been some agreements with respect to funds


                                                       218

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    which include, for example, Abacus

          3    Securities.

          4        Q.    And by that you just mean Astra

          5    has agreements with respect to the funds

          6    that it manages, not specific to the Abacus

          7    2006-10 securities, but more broadly?

          8        A.    No, no, no.  Even more specific,

          9    for instance, there could be some

         10    agreement, yeah.

         11        Q.    Do you recall any such specific

         12    agreements?

         13        A.    No, I don't recall any specific

         14    agreement.  But let's, for instance,

         15    agreement to pay, for example, pay for

         16    legal fees, is an agreement.

         17        Q.    Understood, yeah.

         18        A.    So yeah, those kind of

         19    agreements.

         20        Q.    Has Astra entered into any

         21    agreements with any other holders of Abacus

         22    2006-10 securities other than Deutsche

         23    Bank?

         24        A.    Other than Deutsche Bank, other

         25    than Astra-managed funds as well?


                                                       219

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Yes.  Other than Astra-managed

          3    funds and other than Deutsche Bank, has

          4    Astra entered into any agreements with any

          5    other holders of Abacus 2006-10 securities?

          6        A.    No.

          7        Q.    Other than Deutsche Bank, has

          8    Astra had any conversations with any other

          9    Abacus 2006-10 noteholders?

         10        A.    I don't know about Astra.  I

         11    could only answer in all these cases about

         12    myself.  Personally, would somebody have

         13    approached me, some of the noteholders?

         14    Yes, I do think there were other

         15    noteholders who approached me.

         16        Q.    Who was that?

         17        A.    It's another market counterparty.

         18        Q.    Who is that?

         19        A.    It's -- I do not know whether I

         20    should share this information.  Can you

         21    help me, can I ask them whether or not I'm

         22    allowed to say something which is

         23    proprietary information for somebody else?

         24        Q.    You can answer the question.

         25              MR. ITKIN:  We're going to

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        designate this transcript as

          3        attorneys' eyes only, at least in the

          4        initial instance.  So I think you

          5        could say.

          6        A.    Yes, Merrill Lynch or Bank of

          7    America, they approached me.

          8        Q.    And when was that?

          9        A.    2018.

         10        Q.    And what did you discuss with

         11    Merrill Lynch?

         12        A.    Oh, I did not.  I did not have

         13    any discussions with them.  I just simply

         14    said they approached me.

         15        Q.    And when they approached you,

         16    what did they say?

         17        A.    I don't specifically recall what

         18    they said, but something to do with what's

         19    going on kind of -- implying what's going

         20    on with these situations.

         21        Q.    Did you have any conversations

         22    with them?

         23        A.    I just said no, I did not.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25              So they approached you, asking


                                                       221

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    what was going on and you didn't respond?

          3        A.    Yes, that's right.

          4        Q.    Do you know if anyone else at

          5    Astra had responded?

          6        A.    No, not to my recollection.

          7        Q.    And do you know whether Merrill

          8    Lynch was a holder of Abacus 2006-10 notes?

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         10        A.    I do not know, but I suspect it

         11    would be.  Why else would they ask the

         12    question?

         13        Q.    Did they indicate to you whether

         14    they were holders of Abacus 2006-10 notes?

         15        A.    Yes, they indicate that.

         16        Q.    Did they tell you how much of the

         17    Abacus 2006-10 securities they held?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    They may have, but I don't

         20    recall.

         21        Q.    Did they tell you what class of

         22    Abacus 2006-10 securities they held?

         23        A.    I think they did.

         24        Q.    Do you recall whether it was the

         25    Class A securities?


                                                       222

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    I recall that it wasn't the Class

          3    A securities.

          4        Q.    It was not?

          5        A.    Not.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7              Other than Deutsche Bank and

          8    other than Merrill Lynch, are you aware of

          9    any conversations that Astra has had with

         10    any other Abacus 2006-10 noteholders?

         11        A.    When?

         12        Q.    At any point?

         13        A.    Of course.  It's absolutely

         14    possible that we would have had a lot of

         15    conversations about Abacus notes, generally

         16    speaking.  But you need to be more

         17    specific, when and what conversation you're

         18    talking about.

         19        Q.    Sure.

         20              Since the last time that Astra

         21    purchased Abacus 2006-10 notes, after that,

         22    has Astra had any conversations with other

         23    Abacus 2006-10 noteholders other than

         24    Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch?

         25        A.    So you're asking me just to, for


                                                       223

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    my own understanding, after 2016 last

          3    purchase did we have a conversation about

          4    Abacus, directly with other noteholders --

          5    there is a technicality here.  We do not

          6    ever know who the other direct noteholder

          7    is.

          8              For example, I would have to

          9    always guess whether Bank of America and

         10    the previous question, they hold it or not.

         11    I can only make an intelligent guess that

         12    they do hold it.  So yes, in that instance

         13    I've had conversations with the parties who

         14    may be in touch with other Abacus

         15    noteholders and typically the process of

         16    purchasing, for instance.

         17        Q.    And who are those parties?

         18        A.    I don't recall.  I'm just saying

         19    that we may have had it and I gave you the

         20    answer in the last conversation when you

         21    said did you participate in a transaction

         22    such as this.  That would be one instance.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              So, again, just so I'm clear on

         25    this, after the last time that Astra


                                                       224

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    purchased notes in 2016, you don't recall

          3    any specific conversations with other

          4    Abacus 2006-10 noteholders other than with

          5    Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch?

          6        A.    You need to be specific what

          7    conversation and then I'll answer that

          8    question.

          9        Q.    My question was do you recall any

         10    conversations.

         11        A.    But your exclusion did not --

         12    sorry to interrupt you.  Carry on the

         13    question.

         14        Q.    After the last time that Astra

         15    purchased notes in 2016, do you recall any

         16    conversations that had with other Abacus

         17    2006-10 noteholders other than

         18    conversations with Deutsche Bank and

         19    Merrill Lynch?

         20        A.    Yes.  I said that your exclusion

         21    on this occasion does not include exclusion

         22    relating to conversations regarding trading

         23    of Abacus notes, for instance.

         24        Q.    Okay.

         25        A.    Right.  And we do not ever know


                                                       225

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    who the counterparty is, what they hold

          3    them directly or somebody else.  We can

          4    never tell.  So yes, those may be the

          5    holder, but we may not know.

          6        Q.    And who are the people that you

          7    spoke?

          8              THE WITNESS:  I'm aware that

          9        somebody at Astra have spoken to those

         10        people, but I wasn't involved.

         11        Q.    Who were those people that other

         12    people at Astra spoke with?

         13        A.    I don't know who.  It could have

         14    been Kyle, for instance.

         15        Q.    Sorry.

         16              Now, who were those people that

         17    the Astra individuals spoke to at other

         18    institutions?

         19        A.    I do not know.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              MR. CROKE:  Want to take a break?

         22              MR. ITKIN:  Yeah.

          7    BY MR. CROKE:

          8        Q.    In the context of securities, do

          9    you have an understanding of what the term

         10    "pari passu" means?

         11        A.    In the context of financial

         12    securities?

         13        Q.    Uh-huh.

         14        A.    Yes, partly.

         15        Q.    What is your understanding of the

         16    term "pari passu" in connection with

         17    securities?

         18        A.    Again, like every other financial

         19    contract, it depends what you're talking

         20    about.

         21        Q.    Do you have an understanding as

         22    to a general definition of "pari passu" in

         23    connection with securities?

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         25        A.    Pari passu is a word or a phrase,


                                                       227

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    if you want to call it, a compound word, it

          3    could be used in multiple contexts.  So if

          4    you pick a context, I'll answer.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              In connection with evaluating two

          7    securities, if someone were to tell you

          8    that those two securities are pari passu,

          9    what would you understand that to mean?

         10        A.    Exactly that, that they are pari

         11    passu.

         12        Q.    And what does that mean?

         13        A.    Well, it depends on pari passu

         14    for what.  I'm going to ask for the

         15    questions to the person that is telling me

         16    that and then I'll find out what it means.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              If someone told you that those

         19    two securities were pari passu with respect

         20    to principal payments, what do you

         21    understand that to mean?

         22        A.    Then I'm going to have to ask

         23    further questions.  That is not sufficient

         24    information.  But what I could gather so

         25    far from that, that they will receive


                                                       228

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    principal simultaneously in certain

          3    circumstances.

          4        Q.    And what are the circumstances in

          5    which they might not receive principal

          6    simultaneously?

          7        A.    I cannot tell specifically, but

          8    if at the moment they're pari passu, then

          9    they will receive principal simultaneously.

         10              But as I said before, you need to

         11    give me a full circumstance in which you

         12    are talking about, and for instance there

         13    are triggers, and there may not be.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              In the context of securities, do

         16    you have an understanding of what the term

         17    "pro rata" means?

         18        A.    Again, broadly speaking, yes.

         19    These are very broad terms.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              What is your understanding of the

         22    term "pro rata" in the context of

         23    securities?

         24        A.    Exactly as it says, but you need

         25    to give me a specific context, and I'll


                                                       229

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    answer that question.

          3        Q.    If someone told you that two

          4    securities received principal payments pro

          5    rata, what would you understand that to

          6    mean?

          7        A.    It doesn't mean that much more

          8    than what you said before.

          9        Q.    In the context of securities, do

         10    you view the terms "pari passu" and "pro

         11    rata" to be synonymous?

         12              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         13        A.    They're similar, but not

         14    synonymous.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16              What is the difference between

         17    the terms "pari passu" and "pro rata" in

         18    the context of securities?

         19              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         20        A.    Extremely contextual.

         21        Q.    In what respect?

         22        A.    In the respect in which they're

         23    used.

         24        Q.    So if someone were to tell you

         25    that there are two securities that received


                                                       230

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    principal payments pro rata and another two

          3    securities that received principal payments

          4    pari passu, do you understand there to be a

          5    difference between those two groups of

          6    securities?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          8        A.    But both the words -- yeah, I

          9    know they're similar words, but they could

         10    mean different things in different

         11    contexts.  Once again, give me a context,

         12    I'll try and answer.

         13        Q.    But sitting here, just knowing

         14    that two securities received payments pari

         15    passu or pro rata, you can't draw any

         16    conclusions as to what that means in all

         17    circumstances?

         18        A.    I wouldn't want to draw a

         19    conclusion.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              Do you have an understanding of

         22    what the term "senior-most class of

         23    securities" means?

         24        A.    Again, broadly speaking, yes.

         25        Q.    And what is that understanding?


                                                       231

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    That there are no securities

          3    senior to them, for instance.

          4        Q.    Okay.

          5              In your view, if a security is

          6    pari passu to another security, can either

          7    of those securities be part of a

          8    senior-most class of securities?

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         10        A.    There could be a situation, yes.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              And what would that situation be?

         13        A.    For instance, one of the

         14    securities paid down.

         15        Q.    If both securities are still

         16    outstanding, is there any circumstance in

         17    which two securities that are pari passu in

         18    which one of them can be the senior-most

         19    class of securities?

         20        A.    It depends pari passu for what,

         21    for instance?

         22              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         23    BY MR. CROKE:

         24        Q.    So if two securities are pari

         25    passu with respect to principal payments,


                                                       232

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    is there any circumstance in which either

          3    security can be part of a senior-most class

          4    of securities if they are both outstanding?

          5              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          6        A.    Senior-most, again, is a broad

          7    term.  I mean, senior-most with respect to

          8    what?

          9        Q.    So if there is additional

         10    information you need.

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    You cannot ask me a very broad

         13    question and answer me a specific answer.

         14    So either you ask a specific question and I

         15    ask a specific answer or not.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              In your view, if a security is

         18    pro rata to another security, can either

         19    security be part of a senior-most class of

         20    securities?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    Again, I can probably think of

         23    situations where it could happen, but --

         24        Q.    And what are those circumstances?

         25        A.    I gave you one just before.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Where a security is paid down?

          3        A.    Yes, that's one instance.

          4        Q.    So in a circumstance where both

          5    securities are still outstanding, in your

          6    view, is there a circumstance in which two

          7    securities that are pro rata in which

          8    either of one of those securities can be

          9    the senior-most class of securities?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         11        A.    For what purpose, senior-most for

         12    what?

         13        Q.    So there is additional

         14    information you'd need to in order to draw

         15    any conclusions?

         16        A.    You keep asking me that.  I'm

         17    just telling you, you're asking me very

         18    broad questions.  This is not how financial

         19    markets work.  The question is senior-most

         20    for what, pari passu for what?  I ask you

         21    different questions.  You haven't given me

         22    different answers.  I can't answer the

         23    question.

         24        Q.    Uh-huh.

         25              When did you first begin to

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    suspect that there might have been

          3    collateral securities in the Abacus 2006-10

          4    CDO that did not comply with the

          5    eligibility criteria?

          6        A.    Personally, I think it will be

          7    2015, in my opinion.

          8        Q.    2015?

          9        A.    I would have thought so.

         10        Q.    Do you recall ever having any

         11    discussions with anyone else at Astra prior

         12    to 2015 about whether the collateral

         13    securities in Abacus 2006-10 did not comply

         14    with the eligibility criteria?

         15        A.    I don't specifically recall --

         16    oh, but I don't think so.

         17        Q.    So just so the record is clear,

         18    you don't recall ever having any

         19    discussions with anyone else at Astra prior

         20    to 2015 about whether the collateral

         21    securities in Abacus 2006-10 did not comply

         22    with the eligibility criteria?

         23              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

         24        answered.

         25        A.    I do not recall it, no.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              How did you first come to believe

          4    that there were collateral securities in

          5    Abacus 2006-10 that did not comply with the

          6    eligibility criteria?

          7        A.    It was a gradual process when we

          8    started looking at it.  I think somebody

          9    brought it to my attention that something

         10    is going on here.

         11        Q.    And who was it that brought it to

         12    your attention?

         13        A.    I don't specifically recall, but

         14    I can guess probably would have been Mark.

         15        Q.    And that's Mark Thomas?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              And how did Mark Thomas come to

         19    learn that?

         20              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         21        A.    I guess --

         22              MR. ITKIN:  Are you asking him --

         23        A.    You're asking me to estimate?

         24        Q.    I'm asking do you have an

         25    understanding as to how it is that Mark


                                                       236

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Thomas came to the view that there might

          3    have been collateral securities in Abacus

          4    2006-10 that did not comply with the

          5    eligibility criteria?

          6        A.    There wasn't a -- I do not

          7    remember.  It was a lengthy period of time

          8    around which this whole thing happened.

          9        Q.    Uh-huh.

         10        A.    There wasn't an event that, say,

         11    oh, look what I found.  There was never a

         12    eureka moment, if that's what you're

         13    asking.

         14        Q.    Had you asked Mr. Thomas to look

         15    into issues like this?

         16        A.    Issues like what?

         17        Q.    Had you asked Mr. Thomas to

         18    investigate whether there might be

         19    collateral securities that did not comply

         20    with eligibility criteria in the Abacus

         21    2006-10 CDO?

         22        A.    Do I recall?  No.  Mr. Thomas'

         23    task is to generally look at securities and

         24    make sure that all securities have --

         25    follow the docs, securities that follow the


                                                       237

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    criteria that they're meant to follow.

          3    Such a product, just a matter of adhering

          4    to a set of legal contracts and want to

          5    make sure that the Bloomberg is supporting

          6    the right thing.

          7              There are many instances where

          8    the -- I would have asked Mark to make sure

          9    that the index report is reflected

         10    accurately, Bloomberg is reflected

         11    accurately.  So, generally speaking, the

         12    instruction for the analysts or the trader

         13    is to make sure that everything is complied

         14    with.

         15        Q.    And was it you who gave that

         16    instruction to Mr. Thomas?

         17        A.    I don't recall specifically, but

         18    it is not a specific instruction about a

         19    specific security that I would have given

         20    to anyone, is what my guess would be.

         21        Q.    Uh-huh.

         22        A.    Would I have spoken about it?

         23    Yeah, probably.

         24        Q.    Who was the first person outside

         25    of Astra that you contacted regarding your


                                                       238

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    belief that there were collateral

          3    securities in Abacus 2006-10 that did not

          4    comply with the eligibility criteria?

          5              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          6        A.    I don't remember.

          7        Q.    Have you ever had any

          8    conversations with Rajesh Pai as to whether

          9    the Abacus 2006-10 securities complied with

         10    the eligibility criteria?

         11        A.    You know, I was thinking about

         12    it.  I was thinking about it, you might ask

         13    that question.  I can't recall, at least at

         14    that time when he was working at Astra, did

         15    I ever speak to him again about his memory

         16    later on.  I tried to think about it pretty

         17    hard.  I don't remember if I did.

         18        Q.    Uh-huh.

         19        A.    Later on.

         20        Q.    Uh-huh.

         21        A.    But I was thinking that you might

         22    ask that question.  So I tried -- but no.

         23        Q.    And you referenced a memo.  What

         24    memo are you talking about there?

         25        A.    The memo that Rajesh wrote, and


                                                       239

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    we discussed that memo sometime in '15.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              And do you know why he wrote that

          5    memo?

          6        A.    No.

          7        Q.    Do you know when he wrote that

          8    memo?

          9        A.    I know now.

         10        Q.    And when did he write that memo?

         11        A.    I think it was '14.

         12        Q.    But you didn't discuss it with

         13    him until 2015?

         14        A.    I don't remember discussing it at

         15    all, actually.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17        A.    But what I'm saying is that I

         18    can't even recall whether I did discuss

         19    with him or not.

         20        Q.    I think a few moments ago, when I

         21    asked you what memo are you talking about

         22    here, you said the memo that Rajesh wrote

         23    and we discussed that memo sometime in '15.

         24        A.    We, as in not me and Rajesh.  We,

         25    as in me and Astra people.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Do you know whether Rajesh

          3    discussed that memo with anyone else at

          4    Astra in 2014?

          5        A.    Yeah, he may have.

          6        Q.    Do you know whether he did?

          7        A.    I do not know.

          8        Q.    Have you had any discussions with

          9    Rajesh regarding that memo?

         10        A.    As I said before, I tried to

         11    think about it, expecting that you might

         12    ask that question, but I couldn't recall,

         13    actually.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              Do you know why he wrote that

         16    memo?

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    I can guess.

         19        Q.    And why is that?

         20        A.    Why is what?

         21        Q.    What is your belief as to why he

         22    wrote that memo?

         23        A.    So you're asking me to guess,

         24    right?

         25        Q.    If that's what you have as an


                                                       241

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    understanding as to why he may have written

          3    it.

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    I didn't quite understand the

          6    last phrase you used.

          7        Q.    Do you have any understanding as

          8    to why he did write the memo?

          9        A.    Yeah, I do have understanding why

         10    he may have wrote it.  But do I recall it?

         11    No.

         12        Q.    What is your --

         13        A.    I can guess it.  He's working on

         14    a project which I believe now are more

         15    collateral securities.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              Did you ask him to work on that

         18    project?

         19        A.    I don't specifically recall that.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              Over the course of your career,

         22    not limited to your time at Astra or

         23    Deutsche Bank, have you identified any

         24    other synthetic CDOs in which you believe

         25    that certain collateral securities did not


                                                       242

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    comply with the eligibility criteria other

          3    than the Abacus 2006-10 CDO?

          4        A.    Nothing specific comes to my mind

          5    at the moment.  People usually comply,

          6    uh-huh.

          7              MR. CROKE:  I'm going to show you

          8        an exhibit here.  This will be Mathur

          9        Exhibit 2.

         10              (Mathur Exhibit 2, Trading data,

         11        Bates stamped ASTRA-00035203, marked

         12        for identification, as of this date.)

         13    BY MR. CROKE:

         14        Q.    Do you recognize this document?

         15        A.    As in have I seen this document

         16    before?  No.  Do I recognize it?  Yes.

         17        Q.    And what is it?

         18        A.    It's -- looks like a trading

         19    history.

         20        Q.    So I'll represent to you this is

         21    a printout of a tab from a spreadsheet that

         22    Astra produced in this matter with the

         23    production number ASTRA-00035203.

         24        A.    Uh-huh.

         25        Q.    And the tab was labeled "Trading

          2    Data."

          3        A.    Okay.

          4        Q.    Does this document reflect

          5    Astra's trading of Abacus 2006-10

          6    securities?

          7        A.    It probably does.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              And each row in this chart

         10    represents a different trade, right?

         11        A.    I assume so.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13              Do you see the column labeled

         14    "ORIG size"?

         15        A.    Yep.

         16        Q.    Does that column represent the

         17    original face value of the securities that

         18    are being bought or sold in each trade?

         19        A.    Uh-huh.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              Do you see the column labeled

         22    "Price"?

         23        A.    Yeah.

         24        Q.    Does that column represent the

         25    price for the securities being bought or


                                                       244

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    sold in each trade?

          3        A.    If that's what it does, yeah.

          4        Q.    And is that price measured as a

          5    percentage of the original face value of

          6    the securities being bought or sold in each

          7    trade?

          8        A.    That would be my guess, yeah.

          9        Q.    And the first purchase listed

         10    here is a purchase on March 13, 2013.

         11        A.    Uh-huh.

         12        Q.    Correct?

         13        A.    Yeah.

         14        Q.    Is this the purchase that you

         15    were discussing earlier that you recall

         16    being involved at when you were at Astra --

         17    sorry, at Octave?

         18        A.    Yes, yeah.

         19        Q.    And do you see the original size

         20    for that first purchase is listed as $30

         21    million?

         22        A.    Correct.

         23        Q.    And the price is listed as 22?

         24        A.    Uh-huh.

         25        Q.    So just to make sure I'm on the


                                                       245

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    same page with you here, so to get the

          3    amount that was paid to get these

          4    securities, you multiplied 30 million times

          5    22 percent, correct?

          6        A.    Approximately.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              And so that equals $6.6 million,

          9    roughly?

         10        A.    Roughly.

         11        Q.    Do you see that the next row in

         12    this chart indicates that on November 5,

         13    2014, there is a sale of 17.5 million

         14    original face value of the Abacus 2006-10

         15    notes at a price of 52.5.

         16              Do you see that?

         17        A.    Uh-huh.

         18        Q.    Were these the sales that we were

         19    discussing earlier that you recall being

         20    involved in during your time at Astra?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    And looking at this now, do you

         23    have any recollection as to why Astra

         24    decided to sell those securities?

         25        A.    The first thing I want to notify


                                                       246

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    is that it looks like my recollection was

          3    wrong with respect to the 2016 sale and

          4    purchase.  I assume it was in May.  Looks

          5    like it's in September.  So I apologize for

          6    that.

          7        Q.    Not a problem.

          8        A.    I just didn't refresh by looking

          9    at it.  That was my recollection at the

         10    time.

         11              The second question is -- also,

         12    could you repeat the first question?  I was

         13    too involved with that thing.

         14        Q.    Sure.

         15              So looking at this now, seeing

         16    the sale on November 5, 2014, do you have

         17    any recollection as to why Astra decided to

         18    sell those securities?

         19              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         20        A.    It's not a specific recollection,

         21    but I can guess.

         22        Q.    And what is that guess?

         23        A.    Looks -- at that time, looked

         24    like a very good price.

         25        Q.    Do you have any recollection as


                                                       247

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    to the process that you went through in

          3    deciding to sell those securities?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    No.

          6        Q.    And do you have any recollection

          7    as to whether Astra sold these securities

          8    through an auction or bilateral sale?

          9        A.    That I now know, as I said

         10    through this process, my memory is

         11    refreshed, yeah.

         12        Q.    Do you know why Astra sold only

         13    17.5 million of the Abacus 2006-10

         14    securities?

         15        A.    Do I know why?

         16        Q.    Yes.

         17        A.    That's what had been the trading

         18    decision at that time as to how much to

         19    sell, yeah.

         20        Q.    Do you recall any consideration

         21    of whether to sell the entire $30 million

         22    that Astra held at that point?

         23        A.    It probably would have been

         24    considered, given the price.

         25        Q.    But you don't have a specific


                                                       248

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    recollection as to why it was or wasn't?

          3        A.    No.

          4        Q.    And does looking at this now

          5    refresh your recollection as to whether

          6    Goldman Sachs was the party on the other

          7    side of the broker that Astra sold these

          8    securities to?

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

         10        answered.

         11        A.    No, it doesn't give me a

         12    recollection --

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Sorry to interrupt,

         14        but I have to do that.

         15              THE WITNESS:  You have to do

         16        that.  I'm trying to be helpful to the

         17        young man here.

         18              MR. ITKIN:  There is no need to

         19        be.  Just answer his questions.

         20              THE WITNESS:  Okay.

         21        A.    No, I don't have any specific

         22    recollection, no.

         23        Q.    Do you have any recollection as

         24    to why Astra decided to sell those

         25    securities through a broker as opposed to


                                                       249

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    through some other method of selling the

          3    security?

          4        A.    No recollection.  Again, this is

          5    a long time.  But I can guess.

          6        Q.    Okay.  What's that guess?

          7        A.    Typically for CDOs, usually

          8    working out is always a good idea.

          9        Q.    When you say "working out"?

         10        A.    Through a dealer or broker who

         11    looks at the asset and works it out with

         12    multiple parts as opposed to offer in an

         13    auction process.

         14        Q.    Do you recall any concerns about

         15    approaching a potential purchaser directly?

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         17        A.    I can guess what you're asking.

         18    But if you're more specific, I'll probably

         19    be able to answer the question.

         20        Q.    What is your guess as to what I'm

         21    asking?

         22        A.    I'm not going to guess.

         23        Q.    Do you recall, do you recall any

         24    discussions about whether or not Astra

         25    should try to sell its securities directly


                                                       250

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    to another party as opposed to through a

          3    broker?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    There was no discussion of

          6    whether we should go directly to a specific

          7    party at that time, no.

          8        Q.    Do you recall whether it was

          9    Astra that approached the broker about a

         10    sale or whether the broker had approached

         11    Astra?

         12        A.    I'm not directly trading these

         13    securities, neither Abacus nor any other

         14    security.  There's probably -- I don't even

         15    recall trading a specific security or

         16    engaging -- that is not my role at Astra.

         17              Do I recall anything about a

         18    specific trade or transaction?  There is no

         19    clear specific memory that I have about any

         20    of these things.

         21        Q.    Did you have an understanding, at

         22    the time that Astra was selling these

         23    securities to a broker, that there was

         24    somebody else on the other side of that

         25    transaction?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

          3        answered.

          4        A.    If you're selling to a broker,

          5    there is obviously somebody else on the

          6    other side.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              Do you recall any conversations

          9    about why you would prefer to sell it

         10    through a broker to someone on the other

         11    side as opposed to contacting a potential

         12    purchaser directly?

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         14        A.    How would you know who the broker

         15    is going to go to?

         16        Q.    So you don't have any

         17    recollection about any conversations about

         18    whether you should approach a purchaser

         19    directly as opposed to selling through a

         20    broker?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    Wait a second.  To who?  When

         23    you're selling a security to a broker,

         24    you're selling to a broker who sells it to

         25    the market and whoever is the highest


                                                       252

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    bidder, and he makes a bid offer between

          3    the two.

          4        Q.    Uh-huh.

          5        A.    So everybody sells a security

          6    through a broker.  What's unusual about

          7    this one?

          8        Q.    In connection with this sale, do

          9    you recall whether there were any concerns

         10    at Astra about trying to conceal Astra's

         11    identity from Goldman Sachs?

         12        A.    No.  At that time, no.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              MR. ITKIN:  I'm going to object

         15        to the question.  I didn't get a

         16        chance to say it before the answer,

         17        but I just want to make sure it's

         18        there.

         19              THE WITNESS:  Sorry.

         20              MR. ITKIN:  No, it's okay.

         21    BY MR. CROKE:

         22        Q.    So doing the math here, if Astra

         23    sold 17 and a half million in notes at a

         24    price of 52.5, that means that Astra

         25    received roughly 9.2 million in sale


                                                       253

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    proceeds, correct?

          3        A.    Roughly.

          4        Q.    So Astra paid roughly 6.6 million

          5    for 30 million of Abacus 2006-10 notes, and

          6    then in the flex transaction here sold just

          7    over half of those notes for roughly 9.2

          8    million, is that correct?

          9        A.    Yes, looks like it.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              So at that point, Astra had

         12    already made back the entire amount it paid

         13    for the Abacus 2006-10 notes plus millions

         14    more, correct?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    Yeah.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Yes?

         19        A.    Yeah.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              And Astra still had another 12.5

         22    million in Abacus 2006-10 notes, correct?

         23        A.    Uh-huh.

         24        Q.    Looking at the next row in this

         25    chart, do you see that on November 26, 2014


                                                       254

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Astra purchased 20 million original face

          3    value of the Abacus 2006-10 notes at a

          4    price of 30.5?

          5        A.    Yeah.

          6        Q.    Does looking at this refresh your

          7    recollection about any of factors that were

          8    considered in deciding to purchase those

          9    notes?

         10        A.    Just by looking at this, no.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              Do you recall why Astra decided

         13    to purchase more Abacus 2006-10 securities

         14    just a few weeks after it had sold 17.5

         15    million of Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         17        A.    Do I recall why?

         18        Q.    Uh-huh.

         19        A.    My guess is it must be available

         20    for sale.

         21        Q.    Say what?

         22        A.    It must be available for sale.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              Do you recall whether the fact

         25    that Astra had been able to sell 17.5


                                                       255

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    million in Abacus 2006-10 securities at a

          3    price of 52.5 was a factor that Astra

          4    considered in deciding to purchase another

          5    20 million of Abacus 2006-10 securities at

          6    a price of 30.5?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          8        A.    Whenever Astra makes any purchase

          9    or sales, or sells a security, it is purely

         10    based on what our analysis of that security

         11    is and whether or not we're willing to hold

         12    an asset at a certain price.

         13        Q.    And was the fact that three weeks

         14    prior to that purchase Astra had sold these

         15    securities at a price of 52.5 a factor that

         16    Astra considered in deciding to purchase

         17    another 20 million of those securities?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    It may have considered that as

         20    one of the factors possible, but I think I

         21    gave you the answer.

         22        Q.    Do you recall any conversations

         23    about the fact that Astra had recently sold

         24    17 million, 17.5 million of the securities

         25    at a price of 52.5 in connection with the

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    decision to purchase another 20 million of

          3    securities three weeks later?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    No.  I don't specifically recall

          6    it.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8              Looking at the next two rows on

          9    the chart, do you see that on December 31,

         10    2015 Astra purchased 250,000 of the Abacus

         11    2006-10 notes at a price 33, and then on

         12    the same day it says that Astra also sold

         13    250,000 of the Abacus 2006-10 notes at a

         14    price of 33.

         15              Do you see that?

         16        A.    I do.

         17        Q.    Were you involved in these

         18    transactions?

         19        A.    "Involved," again, is a broad

         20    term.  Yes.

         21        Q.    Do these two rows reflect

         22    transfers between Astra funds?

         23        A.    It's a purchase and sale.  I

         24    wouldn't want to call it a transfer, but if

         25    that's a broad term you like to use, a


                                                       257

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    layman's term, yes.

          3        Q.    Do you recall whether the

          4    counterparties on both sides of these two

          5    transactions were both Astra funds or

          6    Astra-managed accounts?

          7        A.    Correct, I do.

          8        Q.    Okay.

          9              And do you recall why Astra

         10    entered into these two transactions?

         11        A.    I broadly recall that, yeah.

         12        Q.    And what was that reason?

         13        A.    Amongst other reasons, one of the

         14    funds is probably looking to consolidate

         15    exposure into the other.

         16        Q.    Was there any other reasons?

         17        A.    Could have been, yeah.

         18        Q.    Do you recall any other reasons?

         19        A.    Yeah, running cost, for example,

         20    of running the funds.

         21        Q.    Do you recall any other reasons?

         22        A.    If you give me more time to think

         23    about it.  Immediately I don't recall the

         24    reasons that could come about.

         25        Q.    Was the fact that it was the last


                                                       258

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    day of 2015 a factor in Astra's decision to

          3    enter into these two transactions?

          4        A.    Yes.

          5        Q.    And why was that a factor in

          6    Astra's decision?

          7        A.    I don't know exactly the specific

          8    reason for that date, but it was the end of

          9    the year.  My recollection is, and it might

         10    be incorrect, so forgive me for guessing

         11    it, but I'm trying to answer the question,

         12    that was a date of consolidation that was

         13    determined at that time perhaps by

         14    accountants or auditors.

         15        Q.    Did these trades impact Astra's

         16    valuation of the Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         17        A.    Which trades?

         18        Q.    These two here that we're talking

         19    about on December 31, 2015.

         20              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         21        A.    I do not recall why an internal

         22    transfer would -- I mean, I'm guessing why

         23    would an internal transfer between two

         24    securities have an impact on the valuation,

         25    but I'm going to have to refer to the


                                                       259

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    valuation memoranda, which I don't have at

          3    hand as to whether it did or not.

          4        Q.    Do you know whether Astra entered

          5    into these transactions in order to impact

          6    the valuation of these notes?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          8        A.    No, it did not.

          9        Q.    If you look at the next row on

         10    this chart, do you see that on September

         11    21, 2016 Astra sold --

         12        A.    Can I go back to the previous

         13    question?

         14        Q.    Sure.

         15        A.    What were you really asking

         16    there?  Can you ask me again in a different

         17    way?

         18        Q.    Sure.

         19              Do you know whether one of the

         20    purposes for these two transactions here,

         21    that are reflected here, was so that Astra

         22    could impact the valuation of these notes?

         23              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         24        A.    Are you alleging that we are

         25    manipulating a price?


                                                       260

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    I'm not alleging anything.  I'm

          3    asking you a question.

          4        A.    I hope you understand what you

          5    said, but if that is what I understood,

          6    that is an allegation.

          7        Q.    I'm asking you a question as to

          8    whether that was a factor that Astra --

          9    whether that was -- whether Astra entered

         10    into these transactions in order to impact

         11    the valuation of these notes.

         12        A.    Well, that is an allegation.  If

         13    I'm artificially making a transfer for the

         14    purpose -- the answer is no.

         15        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.

         16              Looking at the next row of this

         17    chart, do you see that on September 21,

         18    2016 Astra sold 10 million original face

         19    value of the Abacus 2006-10 notes at a

         20    price of 47.75?

         21        A.    I see that, uh-huh.

         22        Q.    Now, looking at this, I know you

         23    mentioned earlier that seeing this now you

         24    recall that, or at least you understand now

         25    that the trades were in September 2016, not

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    in May 2016.

          3        A.    Yeah.

          4        Q.    Does looking at this, you know,

          5    refresh your recollection as to why Astra

          6    decided to sell these securities?

          7        A.    I don't know a specific

          8    recollection by looking at this, no, other

          9    than the month that I mentioned earlier.

         10        Q.    And do you recall why Astra sold

         11    only 10 million of the Abacus 2006-10

         12    securities and not more?

         13        A.    Generally, yeah, selling or

         14    buying action, once again, I'll repeat, is

         15    a matter of broader portfolio management,

         16    and it has other reasons included in that,

         17    not necessarily just that specific asset.

         18        Q.    And I think we've talked about

         19    Astra sold these securities to a broker who

         20    you understood to be selling them to

         21    another party, correct?

         22        A.    Uh-huh, uh-huh.

         23        Q.    And do you recall having any

         24    conversations in connection with this sale

         25    as to who the counterparty on the other


                                                       262

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    side of the broker was?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

          4        answered.  Repeatedly.

          5        A.    I thought I already answered that

          6    question before.  I can refer to the

          7    previous answer.

          8        Q.    I'm asking -- I'll ask it

          9    differently.

         10              Looking at this now, now that you

         11    see more information here, now that you're

         12    seeing these trades were in September 2016

         13    as opposed to May, does anything in here

         14    refresh your recollection as to any

         15    conversations you may have had about the

         16    identity of the counterparty on the other

         17    side of the broker?

         18        A.    No.

         19        Q.    And again, this one's pretty

         20    easy, the math on this one -- if Astra sold

         21    10 million in Abacus 2006-10 securities at

         22    a price of 47.75, that means that Astra

         23    received roughly $4.775 million in sale

         24    proceeds, correct?

         25        A.    Roughly.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Roughly.

          3              And if you look at the last row

          4    on this chart, you see that on September

          5    21, 2016 Astra purchased 25 million

          6    original face value of the Abacus 2006-10

          7    notes at a price of 27, right?

          8        A.    Uh-huh.

          9        Q.    And this is on the same day as

         10    the sale at 47.75, correct?

         11        A.    Uh-huh.

         12        Q.    Do you have any recollection

         13    looking at this as to why Astra decided to

         14    purchase 25 million of Abacus 2006-10

         15    securities on the same day it was selling

         16    10 million?

         17        A.    Could you repeat the question?

         18        Q.    Sure.

         19              Looking at this now, do you have

         20    any recollection as to why Astra decided to

         21    purchase 25 million of the Abacus 2006-10

         22    securities on the same day that it sold 10

         23    million of the Abacus 2006-110 securities.

         24              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         25        A.    I don't have any specific


                                                       264

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    recollection just by looking at it.

          3        Q.    Looking at this now, do you have

          4    any additional recollection as to whether

          5    the fact that Astra was selling these

          6    securities, 10 million of these securities,

          7    of the Abacus 2006-10 securities at a price

          8    of 47.75 was a factor that Astra considered

          9    in deciding whether to purchase another 25

         10    million of the Abacus 2006-10 securities?

         11              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         12        A.    Do I have a specific

         13    recollection?  The answer is no.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15              So looking at a few things

         16    quickly here, Astra purchased 20 million of

         17    the Abacus 2006-10 notes in November 2014.

         18    There's -- and then there is another $25

         19    million purchase in September 2016.

         20              So with those two together, Astra

         21    purchased 45 million of Abacus 2006-10

         22    securities in November 2014 or later, is

         23    that right?

         24        A.    I didn't do the math recently,

         25    but I trust that your math would be okay.

          3        Bates stamped ASTRA 00035203, marked

          4        for identification, as of this date.)

          5    BY MR. CROKE:

          6        Q.    So I'm showing you now what's

          7    been marked as Mathur Exhibit 3.

          8        A.    Uh-huh.

          9        Q.    Do you recognize this document?

         10        A.    It seems like -- no, I don't

         11    recognize it, no, actually.

         12        Q.    Do you know what this is?

         13        A.    It says valuation at the bottom.

         14    So I assume it's valuation.

         15        Q.    So I'll represent to you this is

         16    a printout of another tab from the

         17    spreadsheet that Astra produced.

         18        A.    Uh-huh.

         19        Q.    It's got production number ASTRA

         20    00035203 and this tab is labeled

         21    "Valuation."

         22              Do you see that the columns are

         23    labeled "Period" and "Price"?

         24        A.    Yeah.

         25        Q.    And do these columns represent


                                                       266

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Astra's valuations of the Abacus 2006-10

          3    Class A notes as of the end of the month

          4    from each listed period?

          5        A.    It must have.  If that is what we

          6    represented, then yeah, I would have

          7    thought so.

          8        Q.    Just as a general matter, do you

          9    have an understanding as to whether the

         10    valuations that Astra records are as a

         11    month end or month beginning?

         12        A.    A month end.

         13        Q.    Month end.

         14              And price, does price represent

         15    the percentage of original face value or

         16    outstanding face value?

         17        A.    Outstanding.

         18        Q.    Outstanding face value, okay,

         19    thank you.

         20              So looking at the first row, do

         21    you see where it says MAR-13 for period and

         22    22.00000 for price?

         23        A.    Uh-huh.

         24        Q.    So does this reflect that Astra's

         25    valuation for the Abacus 2006-10 securities


                                                       267

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    as of the end of March 2013 was 22 percent

          3    of the outstanding face value?

          4        A.    Approximately.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              And if you look back at the

          7    exhibit we just looked at, you see that

          8    Astra first purchased the Abacus 2006-10

          9    securities on March 19, 2013 and at a price

         10    of 22?

         11        A.    Uh-huh.

         12        Q.    Okay.

         13              So do you know whether Astra's

         14    valuation of the Abacus 2006-10 securities

         15    in Exhibit 3, as of the end of March 2013,

         16    was based on the price that Astra paid to

         17    purchase the notes?

         18        A.    I would repeat the same thing as

         19    before.  The valuation procedure that we

         20    follow is dependent on that valuation

         21    methodology that would have been effective

         22    at that time.

         23        Q.    Uh-huh.

         24        A.    And if it had included the

         25    inclusion of the trading price, then yes,


                                                       268

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    that is what it would mean.

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4              And in this valuation chart, if

          5    you look at the next two entries, June '13

          6    and September '13, you see that the price

          7    remains at 22 for each of those.  So does

          8    that mean that Astra's valuation of the

          9    Abacus 2006-10 securities as of the end of

         10    June 2013 and September 2013 remained at 22

         11    percent of the outstanding face value?

         12        A.    That is what it would imply.

         13        Q.    And then if you look at the next

         14    row, which is labeled "December '13," do

         15    you see that the price is listed as 38.26?

         16        A.    I do see that.

         17        Q.    So between the end of September

         18    2013 and the end of December 2013, Astra's

         19    valuation of the Abacus 2006-10 notes

         20    nearly doubled, is that right?

         21              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         22        A.    Not quite doubled.  I see it's

         23    increased.

         24        Q.    It increased from 22 to 38.26,

         25    right?


                                                       269

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    I see that.

          3        Q.    Do you know why Astra's valuation

          4    of the Abacus 2006-10 notes increased from

          5    22 to 38.26 in this period?

          6        A.    Astra would have followed a

          7    valuation policy that was effective at that

          8    time, and according to the valuation

          9    policy, that would have been the price that

         10    it would have thrown out.

         11        Q.    Do you have any recollection as

         12    to what the factors were that led to this

         13    change in valuation?

         14        A.    Honestly, the same answer, but

         15    no, no specific recollection, no.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17        A.    We just follow the rules that are

         18    set in the policy and we just pursue that.

         19        Q.    Do you know whether the allegedly

         20    ineligible collateral securities were a

         21    factor in Astra's decision to increase the

         22    valuation of the Abacus 2006-10 securities

         23    from 22 at the end of September 2013 to

         24    38.26 at the end of December 2013?

         25              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          2        A.    I don't recall that.

          3        Q.    Does looking at this refresh your

          4    recollection as to whether this period

          5    between the end of September 2013 and the

          6    end of December 2013 was when Astra first

          7    began investigating whether there were

          8    allegedly ineligible collateral securities

          9    in the Abacus 2006-10 CDO?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         10    securities for Abacus"?

         11        A.    Yeah, I read that.

         12        Q.    And then if you turn to the

         13    second page, do you see that this is a

         14    chart listing various securities?

         15        A.    Yes, I do see that there is a

          2    criteria at this point in time?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          4        A.    Does it trigger a recollection?

          5    No.

          6        Q.    Do you have any recollection of

          7    whether you asked Mr. Pai to compile this

          2    understand he must have worked on it and

          3    that's why he wanted to send to me his

          4    work.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              Does looking at this refresh your

          7    recollection as to whether you asked him to

          8    put this together?

          2        A.    It's a memo that was probably

          3    saved in one of our folders.

          4        Q.    Do you recall who prepared this

          5    memo?

         14    prepared this memo?

         15        A.    I understand that Rajesh Pai had

         16    prepared this memo through hearsay.  I --

         17        Q.    Oh, sorry.  Understood, okay.

         18        A.    As in somebody else told me that

         19    it was prepared by Rajesh Pai.

         21              I'll represent to you that this

          2    looked at.

          3        A.    Okay.

          4        Q.    Could you just take a moment to

          5    read to yourself the paragraph labeled

          6    "Executive Summary" at the top here.

          7        A.    Uh-huh.

          8              (Pause.)

          9              Yep, I read it.

         10        Q.    Does reading this refresh your

         11    recollection as to whether Astra was

         12    looking into issues related to the

         13    allegedly ineligible Abacus 2006-10

         14    collateral securities at some point during

         20    document, the first time I read was, or

         21    seen this document, forget about reading

         22    it, the first time I saw this document was

          3        Q.    Okay.

          4        A.    Before we discussed about these

          5    proceedings.

          6        Q.    Do you see the last sentence of

          7    this where it says, in the executive

          8    summary:  As it is expensive to replace the

          9    collateral, this may translate into higher

         10    bids by Goldman Sachs for the Abacus bond?

         11        A.    Yeah, I read that sentence.

         12        Q.    Do you have an understanding of

         13    what that means?

         14              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Are you

         15        asking what the witness believes

         16        Mr. Pai meant when he wrote it?

         17    BY MR. CROKE:

         18        Q.    I'm asking if you have an

         19    understanding of what this sentence right

         20    here is intended to convey.

         21        A.    I can't say what he intended.  I

         22    can say it's wrong.

         23        Q.    Okay.  Why is it wrong?

         24        A.    I don't see why would it be

         25    expensive to replace the collateral --


                                                       277

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    that's why, for instance.

          3        Q.    So you don't think it would be

          4    expensive to replace the collateral?

          5        A.    Well, in 20/20 hindsight right

          6    now, of course why would it be expensive to

          7    replace the collateral?

          8        Q.    So you're saying, sitting here

          9    now, you don't have an understanding as to

         10    why it would be expensive?

         11        A.    I'm just simply saying that this

         12    sentence doesn't seem right to me.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14        A.    That's what I'm saying.  And do I

         15    have an understanding of an incorrect

         16    sentence -- I understand the sentence is

         17    incorrect.  What the author meant is

         18    something only the author can answer.

         19        Q.    Uh-huh, okay.

         20              And the second half of sentence,

         21    where it says:  This may translate into

         22    higher bids by Goldman Sachs for the Abacus

         23    bond, again seeing this here, does this

         24    refresh any recollection as to any

         25    conversations you had with Mr. Pai about


                                                       278

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    potentially transacting with Goldman Sachs

          3    in connection with the Abacus 2006-10

          4    securities?

          5              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

          6        answered repeatedly.

          7        A.    I answered multiple times before,

          8    no.

          9              MR. CROKE:  I'm going to show you

         10        what's been marked as Mathur Exhibit

         11        6.

         12              (Mathur Exhibit 6, Email chain,

         13        Bates stamped ASTRA-00029218 through

         14        ASTRA-00029220, marked for

         15        identification, as of this date.)

         16    BY MR. CROKE:

         17        Q.    This is an e-mail chain bearing

         18    production number ASTRA-00029218 through

         19    29220.

         20        A.    Uh-huh.

         21        Q.    Do you recognize this document?

         22        A.    I see it's an e-mail traffic.  Do

         23    I recognize it from something else in the

         24    past?  No, but it must be in context with

         25    what you've been saying to me in the past,

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    uh-huh.

          3        Q.    If you turn to the second page,

          4    just look right at the bottom, you see it

          5    starts with an e-mail there.  It says from

          6    Rajesh Pai, sent 12 November 2013 to Anish

          7    Mathur and Tereza Svedova.

          8        A.    Uh-huh.

          9        Q.    And Tereza Svedova, I think you

         10    mentioned this earlier, she was a trader at

         11    Astra at this time?

         12        A.    Analyst probably, but yeah.

         13        Q.    Analyst.

         14              And then if you flip to the last

         15    page to see the body of the e-mail, do you

         16    see where it says, Mr. Pai starts:  Hi,

         17    Tereza.  Please, could you send me the docs

         18    for the various trades you have on the

         19    books.

         20        A.    Uh-huh.

         21        Q.    It carries on.

         22        A.    Yeah.

         23        Q.    Then if you go back to the second

         24    page, do you see Ms. Svedova says in

         25    response:  Do you need any class in


                                                       280

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    particular or just every piece we own?

          3              Do you see that?

          4        A.    Yeah.

          5        Q.    And then Mr. Pai responds:  Anish

          6    mentioned there were about 14.  Please, can

          7    you check with him when he comes in.

          8        A.    Uh-huh.

          9        Q.    And then do you see at the top,

         10    if you go back to the first page, you'll

         11    see these are e-mails between November 12,

         12    2013 or November 13, 2013?

         13        A.    Yep.

         14        Q.    And Tereza says:  He said to send

         15    just Abacus for the moment.

         16        A.    Uh-huh.

         17        Q.    Please find attached the docs.

         18        A.    Yep.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20              Looking at this, does any of this

         21    refresh any recollection as to whether you

         22    asked Mr. Pai to review the Abacus 2006-10

         23    securities in November 2013?

         24        A.    No.

         25        Q.    Do you have any recollection as


                                                       281

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    to why Ms. Svedova might have told Mr. Pai

          3    that you wanted her to send him, send

          4    Mr. Pai, the Abacus documents?

          5        A.    Look, Rajesh Pai was working as a

          6    temp and sort of a personal relationship at

          7    that time with him, and I don't recall

          8    having any kind of work-related

          9    conversation with Rajesh, let alone

         10    specific about Abacus.  He's working with,

         11    it appears to be, at that time, Tereza.

         12              And if I said, in this instance

         13    Abacus, it could be the top one at that

         14    time on the list from alphabetical order,

         15    for instance -- just by looking at these

         16    documents, that would have been my guess.

         17              It also says, in the back it says

         18    Rajesh seems to think I asked him to do '14

         19    stuff, it appears.  I didn't remember that

         20    either.  So no.

         21        Q.    Looking at this, do you have any

         22    recollection as to whether this e-mail

         23    chain relates to the IT project that you

         24    mentioned earlier?

         25        A.    It could have been, yes.


                                                       282

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              But you don't have a specific

          4    recollection, one way or the other?

          5        A.    No.  He's working with another

          6    person on the IT side.

          7        Q.    And who was he working with?

          8        A.    I'm trying to recollect the name,

          9    but I forget now.  Something that starts

         10    with R, Ripps or something like that.

         11        Q.    And the documents we just looked

         12    at, Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 4, first where

         13    he's sending you an e-mail on January 9th

         14    with these attachments and then second this

         15    document from January 10, 2014, do you have

         16    an understanding as to whether either of

         17    these documents were related to IT project

         18    that you mentioned earlier?

         19        A.    It could have been, yeah.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              Turn back to Exhibit 3, the chart

         22    of the Abacus 2006-10 valuations.

         23        A.    Yeah.

         24        Q.    So if you look at December 2013,

         25    the row up here on the left, and then


                                                       283

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    continue down through March 2014, June 2014

          3    and September 2014, do you see that for

          4    each of those periods the price remains at

          5    38.26?

          6        A.    Correct, I see that.

          7        Q.    And then you see in the next row

          8    labeled December '14, the price is listed

          9    as 30.5?

         10        A.    Uh-huh.

         11        Q.    Do you recall why Astra's

         12    valuation of the Abacus 2006-10 securities

         13    declined from 38.26 to 30.5 between those

         14    two periods?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    I think I've answered that

         17    question on a such number of occasions in

         18    the past.  The valuation that Astra carried

         19    out in the past in my opinion is based on

         20    the valuation policy that would have been

         21    outstanding at that time.  Usually, it's a

         22    document that is an active document that is

         23    meant to be followed in a pedantic fashion.

         24        Q.    And during that period between

         25    December -- September, end of September


                                                       284

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    2014 and the end of December 2014 --

          3        A.    September '14 and December '14,

          4    yeah.

          5        Q.    Astra entered into two trades

          6    with respect to the Abacus 2006-10

          7    securities, right, a sale at 52.5 and a

          8    purchase at 30.5?

          9        A.    You're right.  I think so.  Did

         10    you give me a document about that?

         11        Q.    Yeah, you have Exhibit 2.

         12        A.    Exhibit 5, 4, 3 and 2.  Yeah, go

         13    back to the question, please?

         14        Q.    Sure.

         15              So during this period between

         16    September, end of September 2014 and the

         17    end of December 2014, Astra entered into

         18    two trades, a sale at a price of 52.5 and a

         19    purchase at a price 30.5.

         20        A.    Correct.

         21        Q.    Do you have an understanding as

         22    to why the valuation changed -- that

         23    Astra's valuation of the Abacus 2006-10

         24    securities changed from 38.26 to 30.5 to

         25    match the price that Astra paid to purchase


                                                       285

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    the Abacus 2006-10 securities?

          3              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          4        A.    It would seem so, but I would

          5    answer the same question as I said before.

          6    It would have followed a valuation

          7    procedures at this time and if the

          8    valuation procedure came up at 30.5, then

          9    that is what it would have been.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              And looking at this now, do you

         12    have any understanding as to why it might

         13    be that the price would not appear to

         14    reflect the 52.5 price that Astra sold the

         15    Abacus 2006-10 securities for during that

         16    period?

         17        A.    Do I have any understanding?

         18        Q.    Uh-huh.

         19        A.    Could you be more specific?  What

         20    does that mean?

         21        Q.    Sure.

         22              So at the end of September 2014,

         23    the valuation was 38.24.

         24        A.    Uh-huh.

         25        Q.    At the end of December 2014, it


                                                       286

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    was 30.5?

          3        A.    Uh-huh.

          4        Q.    In that intervening period, there

          5    were two trades, a purchase of 30.5 and a

          6    sale at 52.5.

          7        A.    Yeah.

          8        Q.    I'm just asking whether you have

          9    any understanding as to why it might be

         10    that the valuation would decline and be at

         11    the same level as the purchase, but not,

         12    for example, increase to the same level as

         13    the sale.

         14        A.    As I said, it depends on the

         15    valuation policy effective at that time.

         16              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         17    BY MR. CROKE:

         18        Q.    And is that because securities of

         19    the type of the Abacus 2006-10 securities

         20    would typically be marked to bid rather

         21    than to offer?

         22        A.    I don't know how else to answer

         23    this, but I've said that before the

         24    valuation is the valuation according to the

         25    policy that we have in place and there is a


                                                       287

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    sequence of a lot of things that are in

          3    there.  For example, the most recent

          4    trading price is a factor, if that's what

          5    you're asking me.  And if that is the case,

          6    it has to go through that determination

          7    amongst all those list of those factors.

          8        Q.    Uh-huh.

          9        A.    As a Valuation Committee member,

         10    I'm one of the multiple members that are

         11    out there.  A determination is made by the

         12    committee at that time.  Multiple factors

         13    would have been taken into account,

         14    including the factors available at that

         15    time.  Do I have a recollection?  No.

         16        Q.    Okay.

         17              If you continue down this chart,

         18    do you see that the valuation for the

         19    Abacus 2006-10 securities is listed as 30.5

         20    for December '14, March '15, June '15 and

         21    September '15?

         22        A.    Yes.

         23        Q.    And then in December '15, the

         24    price is labeled as 33?

         25        A.    I can see that.

          2        Q.    Does looking at this and seeing

          3    that this is the third year in a row in

          4    which the price for the Abacus 2006-10

          5    securities had changed only at year-end

          6    refresh your recollection as to whether

          7    there was something about Astra's policies

          8    that, you know, would update once a year at

          9    this point?

         10              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Update

         11        what?

         12              MR. CROKE:  The valuation.

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Do you want to ask

         14        that again?  I'm not sure that's

         15        clear.

         16    BY MR. CROKE:

         17        Q.    Does looking at this and seeing

         18    that this is the third year in a row in

         19    which the price for the Abacus 2006-10

         20    securities in this chart changed only in

         21    December at the year-end, does that refresh

         22    your recollection as to whether there was

         23    anything in Astra's procedures that focused

         24    on, for example, year-end prices in setting

         25    new prices?

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    Very smart question, Jake, I'll

          4    give you that, but I don't have -- I think

          5    there are some year-end procedures in

          6    place.  But the valuation policy isn't a

          7    year-end dependent matter.  So yeah, there

          8    could have been some year-end matters that

          9    were there.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11        A.    And it doesn't refresh my

         12    recollection, though, right?

         13        Q.    Fair enough.  Fair enough.

         14              And looking at the next row next

         15    to January 16th, there is an asterisk that

         16    says:  Starting JAN 2016 monthly

         17    valuations.

         18              Is it safe to assume that that

         19    means it's starting January 2016, there

         20    would be monthly valuations rather than

         21    quarterly?

         22        A.    That's what it says here.

         23        Q.    Thought so.

         24              Do you have any recollection as

         25    to why there was a change from quarterly


                                                       290

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    valuations to monthly valuations at the

          3    beginning of 2016?

          4        A.    No specific recollection, but we

          5    decided to convert the valuation from 15

          6    onwards probably, and I'm guessing,

          7    probably because we were going from a

          8    lockup period to a three-month liquidity.

          9    But it doesn't necessary say that, per se.

         10        Q.    Do you recall whether that change

         11    in procedure was limited only to the Abacus

         12    2006-10 securities or for all of Astra's

         13    securities?

         14        A.    Oh, that I recall, for

         15    everything.

         16        Q.    It was for everything?

         17        A.    Yes.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19              So just a few specific months in

         20    here I want to draw your attention to.

         21              Do you see that for month-end

         22    August 2016 the price is listed as 30.22

         23    rounded?

         24        A.    Month?

         25        Q.    August 2016.


                                                       291

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Yeah.

          3        Q.    And then before the next month's

          4    valuation at the end of September 2016,

          5    there are two trades that Astra entered

          6    into, if you look back at Exhibit 2.

          7        A.    Uh-huh.

          8        Q.    There is a sale of 10 million of

          9    the Abacus 2006-10 notes at a price of

         10    47.75 and a purchase of $25 million at a

         11    price of 27.

         12        A.    Uh-huh.

         13        Q.    Do you have any understanding as

         14    to why the valuation listed in this chart,

         15    you know, is essentially unchanged from the

         16    end of August 2016 to the end of September

         17    2016?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    Valuation policy that we have

         20    would have gone through that procedure,

         21    would have resulted in the price that is we

         22    see here.

         23              And as I said, there is no

         24    specific recollection why it isn't changed.

         25        Q.    I'm just trying to understand


                                                       292

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    whether there might have been a change in

          3    the policy just because I think the last

          4    time we looked at it there was a purchase

          5    and a sale, a purchase at 30.5 and a sale

          6    at 52.5, and in the next valuation period

          7    the price had moved to match the purchase

          8    price.

          9        A.    Uh-huh.

         10        Q.    Whereas in this period there is a

         11    sale above the valuation on a purchase

         12    below and the price seems to have moved,

         13    0.02.

         14              So I'm just trying to understand

         15    whether there is any sort of difference in

         16    the policy between the way the policy

         17    operated in 2015 and the way it operated in

         18    2016 that might explain why you don't see a

         19    move one way or the other here.

         20              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         21        A.    I wouldn't know if there was a

         22    specific change on that date or month.  But

         23    if you asked me to make a guess, I would

         24    say the valuation policy is being followed

         25    fairly strictly and there is no change on


                                                       293

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    an asset by asset level for the policy.

          3    The policy is for all assets that's out

          4    there.

          5        Q.    Do you know whether -- sorry, go

          6    ahead.

          7        A.    So what was I saying?  I was

          8    saying that the valuation policy is not for

          9    specific assets.  It is for all assets.

         10    And that policy needs to be followed across

         11    the board.

         12        Q.    Understood.

         13        A.    And as I said, there could be

         14    changes to the valuation policy, which is

         15    what you asked.

         16        Q.    Uh-huh.

         17        A.    I'm simply saying that I don't

         18    recall of an intra period change and all

         19    this valuation policy specifically for that

         20    month.  But my question, if you would ask

         21    me to guess, would be that it wouldn't have

         22    changed.  If the policy came up as a

         23    result, this is what it would be.

         24              The reality is, one of the

         25    important factors is an external policy


                                                       294

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    price provider.  And my gut feeling is to

          3    help you out on the answers that we don't

          4    carry on and on and please try not to

          5    answer the same question multiple times

          6    because I get confused and I might give

          7    different answers and that is not my

          8    intention -- there is a chance that the

          9    external price provider would have provided

         10    a price and hence the price would have been

         11    different to a trading price.  And that,

         12    we're a price taker, we don't set our own

         13    pries, which is what would have happened in

         14    most cases.

         15        Q.    At the end of September 2016,

         16    after all of the trading reflected on this

         17    Exhibit 2, I think as we've discussed,

         18    Astra held 47.5 million original face value

         19    of the Class A notes.

         20        A.    Uh-huh.

         21        Q.    And those Class A notes hadn't

         22    suffered any write-downs at that point,

         23    correct?

         24        A.    What point?

         25        Q.    At that point, at the end of


                                                       295

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    September 2016.

          3        A.    Yeah, I don't think so, yeah.

          4        Q.    So if you multiply 47.5 million

          5    original face value by 30.24, that reflects

          6    a valuation for the Abacus 2006-10

          7    securities of approximately 14.4 million at

          8    that point?

          9        A.    That sounds about right.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              If you look further down this

         12    chart, the valuation chart here -- almost

         13    at the end, I promise -- at the end of June

         14    2018, do you see that the price is listed

         15    as 30.16 rounded?

         16        A.    Yeah.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Do you recall whether the Abacus

         19    2006-10 Class A notes had incurred any

         20    write-downs by the end of July -- sorry --

         21    do you see that -- do you recall whether

         22    the Abacus 2006-10 Class A notes had

         23    incurred any write-downs by the end of June

         24    2018?

         25        A.    I don't recall, no.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And then at the end of July 2018,

          3    do you see that the Abacus 2006-10

          4    valuation has increased from 30.16 to

          5    31.02?

          6        A.    I see that.

          7        Q.    Do you know whether a write-down

          8    in the notional value of the Abacus 2006-10

          9    CDO -- sorry, scratch that.

         10              Do you know whether a write-down

         11    of a portion of the Class A notes held by

         12    Astra could result in an increase in the

         13    valuation of those notes based on the

         14    expectations of the cash flows that would

         15    be received going forward because it's on a

         16    smaller denominator?

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    Could the valuation change with

         19    the write-down, is what I simply hear from

         20    you?

         21        Q.    Uh-huh.

         22        A.    The answer is yes.

         23        Q.    And just because the price is a

         24    percentage of the outstanding face value,

         25    if the outstanding face value declines due


                                                       297

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    to a write-down, but you still expect to

          3    receive the same amount of cash flows in

          4    the bond over time, all else equal, would

          5    that result in an increase in the price as

          6    a percentage of the outstanding face value?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          8        A.    Generally speaking, yes, that

          9    could happen, yes.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11        A.    That's a generic answer.

          8        A.    Uh-huh.

          9        Q.    And then for the Class A notes,

         10    do you see that there is a percentage here

         11    it says 93.66 percent?

         12        A.    Yeah.

         13        Q.    Is that the factor for the Class

         14    A notes listed in the trustee report?

         15        A.    That's one way to put it.

         16        Q.    Is that how you would put it?

         17        A.    No.

         18        Q.    Okay.  How would you put it?

         19        A.    Pool factor.

         20        Q.    Pool factor, okay.

         21              So I think as we discussed, if

         22    you multiply this percentage by the

         23    original face value of the notes, that

         24    yields the outstanding face value of the

         25    notes as reflected in the trustee reports,

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    is that correct?

          3        A.    Generally speaking.

          4        Q.    I have a calculator if you want

          5    to check the math, but I can represent to

          6    you that 93.66 percent times 47.5 million,

          7    original face value, yields an outstanding

          8    face value of approximately 44.5 million.

          9        A.    Okay.

         10        Q.    And then if you multiply that

         11    outstanding face value by the valuation

         12    that Astra has as of the end of July 2018,

         13    is that the process you would follow to

         14    calculate the valuation of the notes that

         15    Astra at that point held?

         16        A.    Uh-huh.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18        A.    Sorry, I didn't understand the

         19    question, just the last part.

         20        Q.    So is that the process you would

         21    follow, you'd multiply the original face

         22    value times the pool factor as of that

         23    month times the valuation that Astra had

         24    for those notes --

         25        A.    Not necessarily.  I'm just simply


                                                       300

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    saying it goes to the valuation procedures

          3    and the valuation procedure will determine

          4    what the value of the security is.

          5        Q.    Sorry, I'm not asking whether the

          6    factor is the cause of anything in the

          7    valuation.  I'm just saying that if you

          8    were trying to determine the value of the

          9    notes that Astra held on its books based on

         10    Astra's valuation policy, if you have a

         11    value of 31.02 percent of the outstanding

         12    face and then you multiply that times the

         13    outstanding face of 44.5 at this point,

         14    that's what yields the value of the notes

         15    that Astra holds at that point?

         16        A.    47.5, you mean?

         17        Q.    Well, 47.5 multiplied by the pool

         18    factor, correct?

         19        A.    That is correct.

         20        Q.    Because the price is percentage

         21    of outstanding.

         22        A.    Got it, got it.

         23        Q.    So if you multiplied 31.02 as the

         24    price, times the 47.5 original face value,

         25    times the pool factor of 93.66 --

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Correct.

          3        Q.    Okay, so I'll represent to you

          4    that that's a valuation of approximately

          5    13.8 million as of the end of July 2018.

          6        A.    Okay.

          7        Q.    And that's the valuation of these

          8    notes that were held at Astra at that

          9    point.

         10        A.    Okay.

         11        Q.    Is that correct, that that's the

         12    process you would follow to get to that

         13    number?

         14              MR. ITKIN:  Let me just object

         15        for a minute because there's just a

         16        long colloquy and maybe we can get to

         17        a question that you can answer.

         18        A.    What is the question?

         19        Q.    The question is this:  If you

         20    were trying to calculate the value of the

         21    notes that were held on Astra's books as of

         22    the end of July 2018, if you multiplied the

         23    original face value of the notes, times the

         24    pool factor, times the price listed in

         25    Astra's books, is that the three steps you


                                                       302

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    would follow to determine the value of the

          3    notes held on Astra's books at that point?

          4              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          5        A.    On this occasion, Abacus

          6    specifically?

          7        Q.    Yes.

          8        A.    Yes.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10              Have you ever had any

         11    communications with anyone at Goldman Sachs

         12    regarding the Abacus 2006-10 CDO?

         13        A.    What time frame are we talking

         14    about?

         15        Q.    During your time at Astra.

         16        A.    I believe we may have, yes.

         17        Q.    What's the first communication

         18    that you recall having with someone at

         19    Goldman Sachs regarding the Abacus 2006-10

         20    securities during your time at Astra?

         21        A.    I think it was in 2015.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23              And what do you recall about

         24    those communications?

         25        A.    What I recall is the


                                                       303

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    communication was requested by Goldman, I

          3    believe, through the trustee -- I'm not

          4    sure, I don't know, but one of those

          5    parties.

          6        Q.    Uh-huh.

          7        A.    And I think my understanding is

          8    and my recollection is, and it's a little

          9    bit hazy, is that Goldman wanted to talk to

         10    us about a question that we had to do the

         11    trustees.

         12        Q.    And do you remember, did you

         13    ultimately have a communication with

         14    Goldman regarding the Abacus 2006-10 --

         15        A.    Yeah, we did.

         16        Q.    And do you recall when that was?

         17        A.    Sometime in '15.

         18        Q.    And after -- was that a telephone

         19    call with Goldman Sachs?

         20        A.    Yes, yes.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              And after that call, do you

         23    recall any other communications with

         24    Goldman Sachs regarding the Abacus 2006-10

         25    CDO?

          2              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          3        A.    As in me, personally, having a

          4    conversation?

          5        Q.    Do you recall you, personally,

          6    having any communications with anyone at

          7    Goldman Sachs regarding the Abacus 2006-10

          8    CDO after that call?

          9        A.    Yeah, actually I may have, yes.

         10        Q.    And what do you recall about

         11    those?

         12        A.    A friend of mine who works at

         13    Goldman who mentioned.

         14        Q.    I'm sorry?

         15        A.    A friend of mine at Goldman

         16    mentioned Abacus CDO to me, who works at

         17    Goldman.

         18        Q.    Do you recall when that was?

         19        A.    I don't exactly recall, but '17

         20    maybe is the first time.

         21        Q.    And who was that?

         22        A.    A guy called Kamal.

         23        Q.    Kamal.  Is that his first name

         24    or --

         25        A.    First name.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And what's his last name?

          3        A.    Ramanani.

          4        Q.    How do you spell that?

          5        A.    I'm going to have to guess.

          6    R-A-M-A-N-A-N-I or R-A-M-A-N-N-I -- but

          7    something R-A-M would be the starting

          8    point, I thought.

          9        Q.    Okay.

         10        A.    It could even be Romani, by the

         11    way.  I hope he doesn't get offended.

         12              MR. ITKIN:  He won't see this.

         13              THE WITNESS:  Good.

         14    BY MR. CROKE:

         15        Q.    And what did you discuss with

         16    him?

         17        A.    I think just vaguely, I just have

         18    a vague recollection.  I'll try and give

         19    you my impression of the whole thing, if

         20    that's okay.

         21        Q.    Sure.

         22        A.    He just said that what's

         23    happening between you guys and Gerst, he's

         24    been running around trying to make sure we

         25    don't trade with you guys.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    And this was in 2017?

          3        A.    Maybe '17, maybe '18, I don't

          4    know exactly when.  So he was curious as to

          5    what's going on.

          6        Q.    And what did you tell him?

          7        A.    I said, from memory, I said look,

          8    I don't know why he's doing it, we just

          9    asked a simple question.  That's the sense

         10    of it.  It's a long time ago.  I don't

         11    recall all the things, but the context was

         12    simply somebody, probably Gerst, trying to

         13    tell everybody at Goldman to stop trading

         14    with Astra, try to put pressure on us, is

         15    what he meant to say -- that's my

         16    impression of it anyway.

         17        Q.    That's your impression of what he

         18    meant to say?

         19        A.    Yes.

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              So other than the call that you

         22    mentioned with Goldman Sachs and this

         23    conversation, do you recall any other

         24    conversations with Goldman Sachs regarding

         25    the Abacus 2006-10 CDO during your time at


                                                       307

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Astra?

          3        A.    So the reason I was hesitant to

          4    begin with, do I characterize this as a

          5    call with Goldman or not?  I don't

          6    understand this.  Because I spoke to him in

          7    his capacity as a friend.  He wasn't

          8    representing Goldman Sachs.

          9        Q.    Sure.

         10        A.    So the answer, I would reiterate

         11    the answer as something else.  He wasn't

         12    speaking to me in his capacity as Goldman

         13    Sachs.

         14        Q.    Sure.

         15        A.    So I wouldn't call it, even the

         16    previous conversation, with Goldman, for

         17    instance.

         18        Q.    Fair enough.

         19              Other than the call that you had

         20    with -- the call that you mentioned with

         21    Goldman Sachs, representatives of Goldman

         22    Sachs and your conversation with Mr. Kamal,

         23    do you recall any conversations you had

         24    with anyone at Goldman Sachs regarding the

         25    Abacus 2006-10 CDOs during your time at

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Astra?

          3        A.    I don't recall actually, but

          4    that's just a recollection.

          5        Q.    Okay.

          6              Do you recall -- the call that

          7    you mentioned with Goldman Sachs, do you

          8    recall who else was on that call?

          9              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         10        A.    I don't know whether the trustee

         11    was on the call or not, but maybe trustee

         12    was on the call.

         13        Q.    Okay.

         14              And who from Astra participated

         15    in that call?

         16        A.    It's Christian and I.  We're the

         17    only two that I have a clear recollection

         18    of.  But Thomas, Thomas would have been

         19    there, but I'm guessing right now, okay?

         20        Q.    Okay.

         21              And were you the person speaking

         22    on behalf of Astra during the call or was

         23    it you and others or some combination?

         24        A.    Generally speaking, I'm not the

         25    person close enough to every transaction.


                                                       309

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    So my guess would be that my conversation

          3    was more -- my capacity was more as an

          4    observer.  I have may have spoken some

          5    things and I don't recall what the extent

          6    of the conversation that I participated in,

          7    but I doubt it, that I was in majority

          8    of -- majority of the conversation came

          9    from me, I would have doubt it.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              And what do you recall about the

         12    substance of that call?

         13        A.    The substance or -- I don't know

         14    substance as in the subject of the call --

         15    is that the question?

         16        Q.    Sure.  What do you recall about

         17    what was discussed during that call?

         18        A.    Well, our understanding was that

         19    Goldman wanted to -- Goldman wanted to seek

         20    this call with us to discuss our questions

         21    with the trustees.

         22              So my perception of the call or

         23    the purpose of the call is that they will

         24    either tell us whether these are eligible

         25    or not.  That is what I thought the

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    substance of the call would be.

          3              I don't think that Goldman ever

          4    got to the point of saying whether they

          5    were eligible or not categorically, but the

          6    thing is that they led us to believe at

          7    that time that they were eligible.

          8              But I'm not a lawyer.  I believe

          9    David Gerst is, so he may have just simply

         10    led us to believe in this legalistic

         11    manner, but this is my own personal

         12    recollection coming out of that call, I

         13    felt that he was trying to convince us that

         14    they were eligible.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16        A.    And we came out -- I can only

         17    talk about myself personally, I came out

         18    thinking, huh, maybe they're eligible.

         19        Q.    Are you aware that that

         20    conference call was recorded?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    Have you listened to the

         23    recording of that call?

         24        A.    Never.

         25        Q.    Have you ever read a transcript

          2    of that call?

          3        A.    I don't recall.

          4        Q.    I'm going to show you what's

          5    already been marked as Exhibit 14 for the

          6    deposition of David Gerst.  So we'll just

          7    use that.

          8              MR. ITKIN:  Do you have a long

          9        line of questioning?  We've been going

         10        for an hour and 20 minutes just on

         11        this topic.  Before we get to the

         12        next, can we take a five-minute break?

         13              MR. CROKE:  That's fine.

         14              THE WITNESS:  Let's take a quick

         15        break, actually.

          4    BY MR. CROKE:

          5        Q.    Mr. Mathur, I'm showing you

          6    what's been marked as Exhibit Mathur No. 8.

          7              I'll represent to you that this

          8    is a transcript that Astra prepared from

          9    the recording of an October 11, 2016 call,

         10    individuals from Astra, Goldman Sachs and

         11    US Bank.

         12        A.    Okay.

         13        Q.    And the call was produced bearing

         14    production numbers GS-ABAC 0610-000089425.

         15        A.    Okay.

         16        Q.    Do you recall whether this is the

         17    call that we were discussing earlier that

         18    you had with Goldman Sachs and US Bank?

         19        A.    I would believe so, but I can't

         20    know for sure.

         21        Q.    And does the fact that this was

         22    from October 11, 2016, does that refresh

         23    your recollection as to when that call took

         24    place -- does that refresh your

         25    recollection as to when that call that you

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    mentioned with Goldman Sachs and US Bank

          3    took place or do you think that there might

          4    have been two calls?

          5        A.    Is that call in 2016?

          6        Q.    This call that you have here that

          7    was transcribed took place on October 11,

          8    2016.

          9        A.    Really?  Okay.  I actually don't

         10    think there were two calls, but maybe there

         11    was.

         12        Q.    During the call that you recall,

         13    do you remember discussing with Mr. Gerst

         14    at Goldman Sachs Astra's belief that

         15    certain of the Abacus 2006-10 collateral

         16    securities didn't comply with the

         17    eligibility criteria?

         18        A.    Yes, I remember that.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20              And do you recall discussing with

         21    Mr. Gerst potential ways to resolve the

         22    issues that you discussed?

         23              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         24        A.    Did I personally do?  I don't

         25    remember, but I may have.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              Do you remember on the call

          4    whether it was you personally or someone

          5    else at Astra having discussions with

          6    Mr. Gerst about potential ways to resolve

          7    those issues?

          8              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          9        A.    The only thing that I sort of

         10    recall is David Gerst being a little bit, I

         11    don't know what's the right polite word for

         12    it, arrogantly saying maybe:  What's your

         13    game here, guys?  That's what I kind of

         14    recall, or at least the impression of it.

         15              So I haven't gone through this

         16    transcript, but that's sort of the

         17    recollection that I had:  What's your game,

         18    guys?

         19              Thinking my understanding of it

         20    is he was proposing a solution, but that's

         21    just us being nice.  Maybe he wasn't.

         22        Q.    Okay.

         23        A.    So that's what you mean by

         24    resolution, then that is what I think of

         25    it.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    If you turn to page 25 of the

          3    transcript and if you look at the bottom,

          4    do you see line 21, it says:  David Gerst,

          5    what would you like to happen, what would

          6    you like?

          7              And then the next line, it says

          8    investor and it starts no, I would -- I was

          9    suggesting David, you suggest to us, and

         10    then it continues on from there.

         11        A.    Okay.

         12        Q.    Do you recall whether this was

         13    you speaking at this point or whether it

         14    was someone else at Astra?

         15        A.    It could have been me, it could

         16    have been somebody else.  Just by looking

         17    at the sentence, I can't say.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19              If you turn on to the next page,

         20    do you see where it continues on, so --

         21        A.    Next page?

         22        Q.    So staying at the bottom of 25 --

         23        A.    26?

         24        Q.    Sorry, at the bottom of 25 for

         25    the moment.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    Oh, okay.

          3        Q.    Do you see where it says:  And

          4    obviously taking it, and then it goes on to

          5    the next page:  Taking it further or

          6    getting into details is in no one's

          7    interest, neither ours, nor yours.  Abacus

          8    has already had its fair share of

          9    publicity, so I don't think that's in

         10    anybody's interest, frankly speaking, and

         11    certainly not ours.

         12        A.    Uh-huh.

         13        Q.    Do you recall saying that?

         14        A.    If I have said it, then I must

         15    have.  I don't recall specifically saying

         16    that, no.

         17        Q.    Do you recall specifically

         18    whether that was someone else at Astra who

         19    said that?

         20        A.    No.

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              Do you have an understanding as

         23    to what this is intended to convey here?

         24        A.    Are you asking me if I had said

         25    it, what I could have said it, what I could


                                                       317

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    have said or what is intended?

          3        Q.    Well, so this is something that

          4    someone at Astra said.

          5        A.    Okay.

          6        Q.    And you don't have a recollection

          7    as to whether it was you or someone else at

          8    Astra?

          9        A.    Correct, uh-huh.

         10        Q.    Do you understand, looking at

         11    this here, what this is intended to convey?

         12        A.    That we are open to suggestion,

         13    for instance, yeah.

         14        Q.    And where it says:  Getting into

         15    details is in no one's interest, neither

         16    ours nor yours, Abacus has already had its

         17    fair share of publicity, so I don't think

         18    that's in anybody's interest, do you

         19    understand what's being suggested there?

         20        A.    Well, I'm going to have to read a

         21    good portion of the transcript to find out

         22    what the potential intent could have been

         23    at that time.  Do I have a recollection of

         24    what I intended to say or if I said it or

         25    if somebody else said it, what that


                                                       318

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    intention would have been?  No, I can't say

          3    that.  Would you like me to read it?

          4        Q.    If you need to read any portions

          5    of this to understand that, then go right

          6    ahead.

          7        A.    Well, I'm going to have to read

          8    the whole transcript.

          9        Q.    If you think that you need to

         10    read the whole transcript to be able to

         11    answer my question, then you can do that.

         12        A.    All right.

         13              MR. ITKIN:  Just to clarify, you

         14        want the witness to read the entire

         15        transcript?

         16              MR. CROKE:  I asked the witness a

         17        question and I said that if he needs

         18        to read the transcript to be able to

         19        answer my question, then he's free to

         20        do so.

         21              MR. ITKIN:  The witness flew here

         22        all the way from London to answer your

         23        questions, but I don't think it makes

         24        any sense to waste any of his time

         25        reading a transcript that you already


                                                       319

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        have or to tell you what a specific

          3        sentence in the transcript means when

          4        you've read the sentence.  I mean,

          5        this is your time for a deposition

          6        that you've asked for, but this is

          7        pretty obnoxious.

          8              MR. CROKE:  I personally don't

          9        think that you would need to read the

         10        entire transcript in order to be able

         11        to answer my question, but if the

         12        witness wants to do so to make himself

         13        more comfortable, he's welcome to do

         14        so.

         15        A.    Jake, you ask me what is the

         16    intention of it.  I can't ask about an

         17    intent of a conversation that happened

         18    several years ago without keeping the

         19    context in.

         20              So if you want me to be accurate,

         21    you want me to do a guesswork, what is it

         22    that you'd like me to do?  And even then,

         23    after having read the whole transcript

         24    which might take me a while, I may not

         25    recollect what I meant to say.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              So I'm happy to read it because

          3    you asked me to come here.

          4        Q.    When you read this where it says

          5    getting into details is in no one's

          6    interest, neither ours nor yours, Abacus

          7    has already had its fair share of

          8    publicity, so I don't think that's in

          9    anybody's interest, frankly speaking, and

         10    certainly not ours.

         11              Looking at that, do you have an

         12    understanding of what that means?

         13        A.    For example, I don't understand

         14    why I would have said, if I said that

         15    sentence, why is it not in our interests to

         16    discuss Abacus, I don't understand why I

         17    would have said it if I said it.  So I'm

         18    going to have to find out why did I say it

         19    is not in my interest to discuss details,

         20    if I said the sentence.

         21        Q.    And when it says Abacus has

         22    already had its fair share of publicity, do

         23    you have any sense as to what that means?

         24        A.    Yes, that Abacus has been talked

         25    about for a while.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              And when you say Abacus has been

          4    talked about for a while, what do you mean

          5    by that?

          6        A.    That we've been talking about

          7    Abacus for a while.  That is what I meant

          8    by that.

          9        Q.    Who is the "we" in your answer

         10    there?

         11        A.    In this case, it is me and Astra.

         12        Q.    So you read the sentence Abacus

         13    has already had its fair share of

         14    publicity, as referring to your

         15    conversations at Astra with respect to the

         16    Abacus 2006-10 CDO?

         17        A.    I'm saying that you asked me to

         18    answer a question relating to a specific

         19    sentence asking me to infer what I might

         20    have said at that time.  Put it out of

         21    context, in context.  What I don't

         22    understand in that sentence is why is it

         23    not in our interest, for instance, to talk

         24    about Abacus?  I don't know why, if I said

         25    it, why would I say something like that?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    I've asked you a question about

          3    this.  I'm trying to find this out, too.

          4        A.    So I don't know.

          5        Q.    Okay, so you don't know.

          6        A.    So I don't know why I would have

          7    said something like that.  So I'm just

          8    trying to refresh, and the only way to

          9    refresh it is to go through the document is

         10    the only way I could do it.  If it means so

         11    much to you, I'll do it.

         12        Q.    And when it says Abacus has

         13    already had its fair share of publicity,

         14    you don't have an understanding of what

         15    that means other than possibly with respect

         16    to the discussions that Astra had been

         17    having regarding the Abacus 2206-10 CDO?

         18              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         19        A.    As I said, you're asking me to

         20    speculate what I would have thought about

         21    at that time.  Do I have a recollection of

         22    what the intention was of that sentence at

         23    that time?  No.

         24        Q.    Do you recall during this call

         25    anyone at Astra suggesting that if Goldman


                                                       323

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    Sachs could not come up with a resolution

          3    acceptable to Astra, that Astra might do

          4    things that would result in bad publicity

          5    for Goldman Sachs?

          6              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

          7        A.    If you show me somewhere, it will

          8    refresh my memory, then I'll answer that

          9    question.

         10        Q.    I'm just asking, sitting here

         11    right now, do you have any recollection

         12    during that call of anyone from Astra

         13    suggesting that if Goldman Sachs didn't

         14    come up with a resolution that Astra found

         15    acceptable, that Astra might do things to

         16    create bad publicity for Goldman Sachs?

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    Why would I do something that

         19    would create -- I don't -- are you saying

         20    that somebody at Astra said something like

         21    that?  Is that what you're saying and

         22    asking me to comment on it?

         23        Q.    Personally that's how I read this

         24    sentence.

         25        A.    Okay.


                                                       324

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    So I'm just trying to

          3    understand --

          4        A.    Oh, is that the only sentence

          5    you're talking about?

          6        Q.    I'm talking about this right now,

          7    this statement that getting into details is

          8    no one's interest, neither ours nor yours,

          9    Abacus has already had its fair share of

         10    publicity, so I don't think that's in

         11    anyone's interest, frankly speaking, and

         12    certainly not ours.

         13        A.    Okay.

         14        Q.    I'm asking, do you have any

         15    understanding as to whether that was a

         16    reference to Astra potentially doing things

         17    that might result in bad press for Goldman

         18    Sachs?

         19        A.    That is not how I read it, but if

         20    you read it like that --

         21        Q.    Okay.

         22              But you don't have any

         23    recollection of discussions about that?

         24        A.    With who?

         25        Q.    During this call, any discussions

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    from anyone at Astra saying that if Goldman

          3    Sachs couldn't come up with an acceptable

          4    resolution, that Astra might do things that

          5    would result in bad publicity for Goldman

          6    Sachs?

          7              MR. ITKIN:  Let me just interpose

          8        an objection, but you can go ahead and

          9        answer.  I'm sorry to interrupt.

         10        A.    I don't understand the young

         11    man's question here.  Are you either

         12    telling me that somebody has said something

         13    like that here or are you asking me if I

         14    had said something like that in the

         15    deposition -- in this transcript?

         16        Q.    At the time of this conference

         17    call, had anyone at Astra spoken with any

         18    members of the press regarding the Abacus

         19    2006-10 transaction?

         20        A.    At the time of this?

         21        Q.    At the time of this call.

         22        A.    I don't recall, but it may have

         23    been possible.  I can only speak for

         24    myself.

         25        Q.    Okay.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2              Since this call, has anyone at

          3    Astra spoken with the press regarding the

          4    Abacus 2006-10 transaction?

          5        A.    It's not in my recollection that

          6    anyone would have spoken to any members of

          7    the press.

          8        Q.    So you're not aware of anyone at

          9    Astra speaking with any members of the

         10    press regarding the Abacus 2006-10

         11    transaction at any point in time?

         12        A.    At any point of time?  This is a

         13    new phrase here.  So you asked me whether

         14    since this transcript, that was your

         15    initial question.  Which one will I answer?

         16        Q.    I asked you whether, at the time

         17    of this call, there had been any prior

         18    considerations, and then whether after this

         19    call there were any conversations and you

         20    said you weren't aware of either one.

         21              So I just want to confirm, you're

         22    not aware at any point during your time at

         23    Astra of anyone at Astra having any

         24    conversations with any members of the press

         25    regarding the Abacus 2006-10 transaction?

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        A.    While my time at Astra, I'm not

          3    personally aware of anyone at Astra

          4    reaching out or speaking to press about

          5    Abacus.

          6        Q.    By "Abacus," you mean Abacus

          7    2006-10?

          8        A.    Correct.

          9        Q.    Are you aware of anyone that has

         10    spoken to the press on Astra's behalf with

         11    respect to the Abacus 2006-10 transaction?

         12        A.    I do not know.  I can't say that.

         13    All I can say is did I instruct anyone --

         14    but no.

         15        Q.    I'm not asking whether you

         16    instructed anyone.

         17        A.    I do not know what history people

         18    may have done on Astra's behalf without my

         19    knowledge.  I can only talk about my

         20    knowledge.

         21        Q.    And all I'm asking about is your

         22    knowledge.

         23        A.    I have no knowledge.

         24        Q.    All I'm asking is if you are

         25    aware of anyone speaking to any members of

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    the press regarding the Abacus 2006-10 on

          3    Astra's behalf?

          4        A.    What if my lawyers would have

          5    spoken about it, is that an inclusion?

          6        Q.    If your lawyers have spoken about

          7    it, that is an answer to my question.

          8        A.    I think my lawyers may have

          9    spoken to somebody at press.

         10        Q.    Do you recall when that was?

         11        A.    No.

         12        Q.    Was it after this call?

         13        A.    I would have thought so, yes.

         14        Q.    Do you recall whether it was your

         15    lawyers at Mr. Itkin's firm?

         16        A.    Yes, I believe so.

         17        Q.    Okay.

         18              Do you recall whether this was

         19    one instance or multiple instances?

         20        A.    Look, I never instructed any of

         21    my lawyers to speak to any members of press

         22    from memory.

         23        Q.    I'm not asking about what you

         24    instructed.

         25        A.    So I cannot tell when this --

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    I'm not asking about what you

          3    were instructed.  I'm just asking about

          4    what you're aware of.

          5              Are you aware of instances in

          6    which your lawyers have spoken to the press

          7    regarding the Abacus 2006-10 CDO?

          8        A.    They may have, as I said.

          9        Q.    Do you have any specific

         10    recollection of any instance in which they

         11    did?

         12              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.  Asked and

         13        answered.

         14    BY MR. CROKE:

         15        Q.    You can answer.

         16        A.    I only have one recollection and

         17    there might be more, but you can speak to

         18    the lawyers directly about that, is when

         19    there was a Bloomberg article around Abacus

         20    2006-10, and from my understanding that my

         21    lawyers had spoken to one of those members

         22    of the press at that time, I thought.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24        A.    That is my recollection at the

         25    moment.

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Okay.

          3              And do you have an understanding

          4    of why your lawyers spoke to the members of

          5    the press at that time?

          6        A.    I have a guess.

          7        Q.    Do you have an understanding?

          8        A.    Well, how can I talk about

          9    somebody else's actions and understanding?

         10    I can only talk about what I guessed they

         11    must have done.  I wasn't there.

         12        Q.    I'm asking if you have any

         13    understanding, to your own knowledge, as to

         14    why your lawyers may have spoken with

         15    members of the press regarding the Abacus

         16    2006-10 CDO?

         17              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         18        A.    As I said before, that I do not

         19    know what the content of the conversation

         20    was.  So I can only make a guess.

         21        Q.    I don't think that that's an

         22    answer to my question.

         23              My question is, if you have an

         25    you about the specifics of that

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    conversation in this question.  My question

          3    is whether you have an understanding of why

          4    your lawyers spoke to the press regarding

          5    the Abacus 2006-10 transaction?

          6        A.    I thought I answered that

          7    question clearly enough, that I do not know

          8    because I did not instruct them to talk to

          9    anyone.  All I can say is that I can guess

         10    why they do that, but it doesn't become my

         11    understanding until they tell me why they

         12    did it.  Does it?

         13        Q.    And why do you think that they

         14    did that?

         15              MR. ITKIN:  Objection.

         16        A.    I'm guessing they did it in

         17    response to an article who -- which they

         18    may have felt mischaracterized the case.

         19    But that's a guess, for the record.

         20        Q.    That's fine.

         21              If you turn to page 23 of the

         22    transcript, about two-thirds of the way

         23    down, do you see the line starts "Investor"

         24    and then it continues onto the next page?

         25        A.    Are you saying number 15?


                                                       332

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2        Q.    Yeah, 15, so it is totally

          3    possible and it continues on.

          4        A.    Yes, I can see that 15, yeah.

          5        Q.    If you can just take a minute to

          6    read this paragraph here, I think it starts

          7    on line 15 there and goes on to the top of

          8    the next page.

          9        A.    Okay, I read it from 15 to line

         10    number 4, next page.

         11        Q.    Okay.

         12              And reading this, does this

         13    refresh your recollection as to whether

         14    this was you speaking at the time?

         15        A.    No.

         16        Q.    Do you see where it says starting

         17    in line 21:  And we own the securities for

         18    a while now and we just ended up finding

         19    out this, and then it continues on?

         20        A.    Yeah.

         21        Q.    Do you have an understanding of

         22    what it means when it says we just ended up

         23    finding out this?

         24        A.    I can only speculate, Jake.  I'm

         25    assuming if the context is supplemental


                                                       333

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    private securities, that's a guess that

          3    I'll make.

          4        Q.    Was it the case at the time of

          5    this call in October 2016 that Astra had

          6    just only recently begun to believe that

          7    the collateral starts in the Abacus 2006-10

          8    transaction did not comply with the

          9    eligibility criteria?

         10        A.    I did not know a specific date

         11    and time when it happened that we started

         12    believing it.  We rely on our lawyers to

         13    find out whether things are eligible or not

         14    eligible.  And it remains doubtful until we

         15    have a resolution in court.  So do I firmly

         16    believe something?  I only firmly believe

         17    in specific things that I know to be true,

         18    not what I estimate to be true.

         19        Q.    Okay.

         20              If you turn to page 26 and if you

         21    look at line 12 starting there, it's

         22    Mr. Gerst, do you see it says:  Okay, well,

         23    I had suggested to Hugo a while back that

         24    if you had interest in selling your

         25    bonds -- and continues -- I'd be happy to


                                                       334

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    try to purchase your bonds.

          3              Do you see that?

          4        A.    I read that.

          5        Q.    And in line 18, do you see where

          6    the response is from an investor:  Okay, we

          7    had never received that request frankly,

          8    but maybe you did make that request.  We

          9    didn't realize that you were happy to bid

         10    on them.

         11              Do you see that?

         12        A.    I see that.

         13        Q.    Reading this, does that refresh

         14    your recollection as to whether this was

         15    you speaking here?

         16        A.    No.

         17        Q.    Were you aware that -- so this is

         18    October '16 -- October 11, 2016, just a few

         19    weeks before that Astra had sold, I think

         20    it's $10 million of the Abacus 2006-10

         21    notes at a price of 47.75, is that correct?

         22        A.    Uh-huh.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              And then if you turn to the

         25    bottom of page 27, and if you need to take

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    a look at the surrounding paragraphs for

          3    context, feel free, but do you see at the

          4    bottom here, Mr. Gerst is talking about,

          5    indicates that he would potentially be

          6    interested in purchasing the Abacus 2006-10

          7    notes at a 48 handle?

          8              Do you see that?

          9        A.    I see that.

         10        Q.    And what do you understand 48

         11    handle to mean?

         12        A.    I assume he be talking about a

         13    price strike.

         14        Q.    And 48 handle just means 48 and

         15    then some decimal after that?

         16        A.    Correct.

         17        Q.    And that 48 and some decimal is

         18    higher than the price that Astra sold the

         19    notes on September 21, 2016, is that

         20    correct?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    And if you look at the next page

         23    here at the top, at page 28, do you see

         24    where it says "investor," in response to

         25    what Mr. Gerst said, it says:  It's far

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    away from what we're thinking, frankly

          3    speaking.

          4        A.    Uh-huh.

          5        Q.    Do you know whether that was you

          6    speaking there?

          7        A.    Could have been.  I don't

          8    remember.

          9        Q.    Do you have an understanding of

         10    what it means when they're saying it's far

         11    away from what they're thinking, frankly

         12    speaking?

         13        A.    I can make a guess.

         14        Q.    What's your guess as to what that

         15    means?

         16        A.    I think the price is far away

         17    from what we are thinking.

         18        Q.    Okay.

         19              And that's even though Astra had

         20    sold 10 million of the Abacus notes at a

         21    price of 47.75 a few weeks prior?

         22        A.    Uh-huh.

         23        Q.    Okay.

         24              You're aware that Astra has filed

         25    several documents with the court in this


                                                       337

          1       A. Mathur - Attorneys' Eyes Only

          2    action, right?

          3        A.    I believe so.

          4        Q.    Have you reviewed those

          5    documents?

          6        A.    No.  I mean, I may have seen a

          7    couple of them, but no, not generally

          8    speaking, not a wide variety.  I don't even

          9    know where they're filed.

         10        Q.    Okay.

         11              So I take it that you wouldn't be

         12    reviewing those before they were filed to,

         13    you know, read through and confirm that the

         14    statements in there were accurate?

         15        A.    That is correct.

         16        Q.    That is correct, okay.

         17        A.    Generally speaking.

         18        Q.    Do you recall reading any of

         19    Astra's filings in this action to confirm

         20    that they were correct before they were

         21    filed?

         22        A.    If the lawyers would have asked

         23    me something, they would have answered that

         24    question at that time.  Do I have a

         25    specific recollection?  No.

          4        other questions for you at this time,

          5        Mr. Mathur.

          7              MR. ITKIN:  I don't have any

          8        questions either.  I just want to

          9        designate this -- no, I know Julie

         10        might, but I want to state my peace --

         11        I want to designate this transcript as

         12        attorneys' eyes only since a lot of

         13        stuff that we discussed was designated

         14        as such when we produced it.

         15        Otherwise, you know, to the extent

         16        that we talk later, we may want to

         17        de-designate some of the sections as

         18        we see fit.

         19              But that was my peace, Julie.  If

         20        you have any questions, let us know.

              1                       (Witness sworn.)

              2    WHEREUPON:

              3                        MANUEL MARTINEZ,

              4    called as a witness herein, having been first duly

              5    sworn, was examined and testified as follows:

              6                           EXAMINATION

              7    BY MR. SUN:

              8         Q.   Could you please state your name for the

              9    record.

    13:04:59 10         A.   Manuel Martinez.

             11         MR. SUN:  All right.  Let the record reflect that

             12    this is the deposition of Manuel Martinez taken pursuant

             13    to all applicable local federal rules and the Federal

             14    Rules of Civil Procedure.

    13:05:10 15    BY MR. SUN:

             16         Q.   Mr. Martinez, have you ever given a deposition

             17    before?

             18         A.   No.

             19         Q.   Okay.

    13:05:15 20         A.   As far as I know, no.

             21         Q.   Okay.  Have you ever been in a room with

             22    lawyers like this, talking with a court reporter,

             23    anything like that?

             24         A.   I -- I believe so.  I believe so.

                                                                           5




              1         Q.   Okay.  And I just assume you have been because

              2    I think there was mention of some litigation in your

              3    discovery.  I don't know...

              4              But were those in the course of lawsuits?

    13:05:39  5         A.   With Home Depot there was a mediator involved.

              6         Q.   Okay.  And how long ago was that?

              7         A.   I would like to say 2016 I believe.

              8         Q.   Okay.  And in that, you mentioned it was a

              9    mediator involved.  There was something with Home Depot,

    13:05:59 10    correct?

             11         A.   That's correct.

             12         Q.   Okay.  Were you suing Home Depot?

             13         A.   I -- well -- they -- I -- I'm not quite sure

             14    if I should say yes on that because they -- they settled

    13:06:14 15    out of court.  So I don't know if it actually was a

             16    lawsuit or not.

             17         Q.   I see.  Okay.

             18              And in that particular incident, I guess, what

             19    was the nature of the dispute?

    13:06:26 20         A.   I hit a 12-by-12 brick on the -- on the floor

             21    of the store.  It was placed as a door prop.

             22         Q.   Okay.  And aside from that Home Depot dispute,

             23    have you ever sat in a room with lawyers/court reporter

             24    like this before?

                                                                           6




              1         A.   No.

              2         Q.   Okay.  So this might be your first deposition.

              3    So I'm going to go over some basic rules for a

              4    deposition --

    13:06:55  5         A.   Uh-huh.

              6         Q.   -- just to help it go a little quicker and a

              7    little more smoothly.  I'm sure your attorney's probably

              8    talked to you about it before.

              9              The first thing is all of your answers today

    13:07:03 10    are going to have to be verbal, like "yes" or "no."

             11    We're going to try to stay away from nods of the head,

             12    shakes of the head, saying words like "uh-huh," "uh-uh,"

             13    and that's just because when the court reporter types it

             14    in, it shows up as "U H U H."  And so when we're reading

    13:07:14 15    it later on, we have no idea if that's a yes or a no.

             16         A.   Correct.

             17         Q.   Okay.  The second part is there's going to be

             18    a lot of times probably where you're going to know where

             19    I'm going to go with the question and you're going to

    13:07:25 20    want to answer it before I finish my question.  You just

             21    have to let me finish the question before you give your

             22    answer and that's, again, so we can keep the transcript

             23    clean so the court reporter doesn't have to type in, you

             24    know, half a question, your answer, and then the other

                                                                           7




              1    half of my question.  Okay?

              2         A.   I understand.

              3         Q.   All right.  I know we talked about this before

              4    the deposition, but I don't anticipate being here too

    13:07:43  5    long.  But if at any point you need to take a break,

              6    just let us know and you're free to take a break

              7    whenever you want.  I just ask that if I have a question

              8    that's pending, like if I ask a question, that you

              9    answer that question before you go take your break.

    13:07:54 10         A.   I understand.

             11         Q.   Okay.  And then the last thing is if I ask a

             12    bad question or I ask something that's really confusing,

             13    you don't understand it, just let me know and I will

             14    rephrase my question.  I'm not here to try to trick you.

    13:08:04 15    Just let me know.

             16         A.   I understand.

             17         Q.   All right.  Mr. Martinez, what is your date of

             18    birth?

             19         A.   12/26/1959.

    13:08:11 20         Q.   And where were you born?

             21         A.   Gary, Indiana.

             22         Q.   Okay.  What's your highest degree of

             23    education?

             24         A.   12th.

                                                                           8




              1         Q.   So that's senior in high school?

              2         A.   That's correct.

              3         Q.   Did you finish 12th grade?

              4         A.   Yes, I -- I did.

    13:08:26  5         Q.   Okay.  So you have a high school degree?

              6         A.   Diploma.

              7         Q.   Diploma.

              8         A.   Right.

              9         Q.   Okay.  And where did you attend high school?

    13:08:34 10         A.   Charlton High School, Plainfield, Indiana.

             11         Q.   Aside from your high school degree, did you

             12    accomplish any other degrees?

             13         A.   Certified at United States Steel Corporation

             14    through an apprenticeship program.

    13:08:50 15         Q.   And you mentioned it's certified.  Is that

             16    like a -- Like, is there a specialty that you're

             17    certified in?

             18         A.   Yes.

             19         Q.   And what is that?

    13:08:58 20         A.   Maintenance.

             21         Q.   Is there a specialty, specifically like what

             22    are you maintain --

             23         A.   Hydraulics.

             24         Q.   Okay.  So it's hydraulics maintenance?

                                                                           9




              1         A.   Oh, yes.

              2         Q.   Okay.  And what did that entail to get that

              3    certification?

              4         A.   Classes.

    13:09:14  5         Q.   Approximately how many classes are we talking

              6    about?

              7         A.   I don't recall.  This is back in '79, '80.  I

              8    don't recall.  It's --

              9         Q.   Was it --

    13:09:26 10         A.   -- numerous classes.  I can say there were

             11    numerous classes.

             12         Q.   Okay.  Was it --

    13:09:31 15         A.   A year, yes.

             16         Q.   Okay.  So classes throughout one year?

             17         A.   Correct.

             18         Q.   And then at the end you had to take a test?

             19         A.   Yes.

             11    take a look at it, they see something that's completely

             24    4455 South Kedzie Avenue.

                                                                          28




              1         Q.   Okay.  I think occasionally those addresses

              2    are -- are filled in based on where --

              3         A.   Okay.

              4         Q.   -- the hospital either is --

    13:29:10  5         A.   Okay.

              7         A.   I see.

              8         Q.   So --

              9         A.   That -- Then basically it may be inside

    13:29:14 10    that --

             11         Q.   It could be, but I -- we will make a note of

             12    that --

             13         A.   Okay.

             14         Q.   -- that you -- you believe it's not.

    13:29:17 15              I will -- I'll talk to your attorneys later

             16    on --

             17         A.   Sure.

             18         Q.   -- and we can --

             19         A.   Okay.

    13:29:20 20         Q.   -- sort that part out.

             21         A.   Other than not [sic], that's the only...

             22         Q.   Okay.  That works.

             23         A.   Yeah.

             24         MR. ADELMAN:  And in my defense, it does say

                                                                          29




              1    "partial itemization" leaving open the possibility that

              2    there was additional itemization.

              3         MR. SUN:  I gotcha.  I gotcha.

              4         MR. ADELMAN:  Okay.

    13:29:35  5         MR. SUN:  Yeah, it's just...

              6         MR. ADELMAN:  Anything else from --

              7         THE WITNESS:  Let's see.

              8         MR. ADELMAN:  -- the interrogatories.

              9    BY THE WITNESS:

    13:29:40 10         A.   I...

             11              The wage losses, will we be going over this or

             12    was this already covered?

             13         Q.   No.  I -- I will go into those --

             14         A.   Okay.

    13:29:59 15         Q.   -- numbers in depth.

             16              But is it wrong, that you see it?

             17         A.   No -- As far as I can see, no --

             18         Q.   Well, there's also a supplemental one that I

             19    think --

    13:30:03 20         A.   Yes.

             21         Q.   -- clarifies --

             22         A.   Okay.  I got just --

             23         Q.   -- some more.

             24         A.   -- question here.

                                                                          30




              1              I -- I think it's fine.

              2         Q.   Okay.  What about that second -- that other

              3    one, the other part of Group Exhibit 1?

              4                       (Discussion off the record.)

    13:31:09  5    BY THE WITNESS:

              6         A.   I'm fine with what I see here.

              7         Q.   Okay.  Just going through that, the first one

              8    that you looked at -- or actually -- I'm sorry.  I guess

              9    it's both of them.  So if I show you question 10 -- I

    13:31:25 10    just wanted to touch base on that first -- where it

             11    states:  State any and all other expenses or losses you

             12    claim --

             13         A.   Okay.

             14         Q.   -- as a result of the occurrence; you see

    13:31:32 15    that?

             16         A.   Yes.

             17         Q.   And the answer says:  Plaintiff sold his 2007

             18    Jeep...

             19         A.   Uh-huh.

    13:31:37 20         Q.   To pay for outstanding bills and purchased a

             21    recliner to keep his leg elevated.  Investigation in

             22    discovery continued; do you see that?

             23         A.   Yes.  Yes, I do.

             24         Q.   Okay.  And then in the other document, I

                                                                          31




              1    believe on the page right behind your signature is a

              2    receipt...

              3         A.   Uh-huh.

              4         Q.   For what appears to be a 2007 Jeep Wrangler?

    13:31:52  5         A.   That's correct.

              6         Q.   Is this the same Jeep?

              7         A.   Oh, yes.  Yes, it is, sir.

              8         Q.   Okay.  So on this -- the second document,

              9    where we see the receipt...

    13:31:56 10         A.   Correct.

             11         Q.   It looks like you -- you sold a 2007 Jeep

             12    Wrangler for 24,400?

             13         A.   That's correct.

             14         Q.   So you made a killing on that sale?

    13:32:10 15         A.   Well, this Jeep only had 60,000 miles on it.

             16    And if you look at the prices of this particular Jeep --

             17    again, this is going back to 2018 -- they're -- they're

             18    selling anywhere between 20- and 25,000.

             19         Q.   Okay.  Was this Jeep in like mint condition?

    13:32:32 20         A.   Yes.  Pristine.  60,000 miles was all it -- it

             21    had on this Jeep.

             22         Q.   Okay.  And who was Angel Guzman (phonetic)?

             23         A.   A friend.  I sold it to a friend of mine.  He

             24    was always asking me about the Jeep and I said maybe

                                                                          32




              1    perhaps someday and it was an opportune time to sell it.

              2         Q.   Okay.  And it mentioned in interrogatory 10

              3    that you sold this Jeep to pay for outstanding bills?

              4         A.   Correct.

    13:33:01  5         Q.   And what outstanding billings did you owe at

              6    that -- Were they medical bills related to this case or

              7    were they unrelated bills?

              8         A.   Well, rent, bills for the business, parts,

              9    various -- various things, some medicals bills, yes,

    13:33:28 10    that were -- that were involved.

             11         Q.   Which medical bills did you pay from selling

             12    the Jeep?

             13         A.   I don't recall at this moment.  I would have

             14    to look into it.  There were -- There were some, not --

    13:33:38 15    not all.

             16         Q.   Okay.  When you say "some," can you give me a

             17    ballpark figure of what amount from this (indicating)

             18    was used to pay medical bills?

             19         A.   They were prescriptions.  Again, I purchased a

    13:33:58 20    recliner, I paid the rent, and other things along the

             21    way.  I can't recall, but -- but the money was needed.

             22    So that's why I sold it.

             23         Q.   Okay.  And at that time you sold it in 2018,

             24    you did not have your driver's license, correct?

                                                                          33




              1         A.   That's correct.

              2         Q.   Okay.

              3         A.   In fact, it sat.  That's why it had low miles,

              4    because it sat for a very long time because I could not

    13:34:34  5    drive it.

              6         Q.   Gotcha.  I think you and I have different

              7    definitions of "low miles," but...

              8         A.   Yeah.  But 60,000 is low miles.

              9         Q.   For -- For me, I mean, 60-, I -- I don't know

    13:34:45 10    if I'd buy a used car for 60-.  I bought it -- I bought

             11    mine used, but it had like 6,000, so...

             12         A.   Oh.

             13         Q.   That mileage was, like, low mileage to me --

             14         A.   Yeah.

    13:34:57 15         Q.   -- but...

             16              In your answer to interrogatory 14, you

             17    mentioned also you had a slip-and-fall accident when you

             18    exited an airplane and that you suffered a low back

             19    injury and was in pain for two months.

    13:35:07 20         A.   Yes.  Yes, I did.

             21         Q.   Did you ever file a lawsuit as a result of

             22    that?

             23         A.   Oh, no.  No.

             24         Q.   Did you ever make a claim or anything --

                                                                          34




              1         A.   No.

              2         Q.   -- as a result of that?

              3         A.   No.

              4         Q.   Okay.  In terms of your answer to

    13:35:26  5    interrogatory 16, you -- it makes reference to an

              6    individual named Jef, J E F, and I'm assuming that's

              7    what was obtained from some of our documentation.  But

              8    in terms of this accident -- again, and when I say "this

              9    accident," I'm referring to the November 24th, 2016

    13:35:43 10    incident at the Cicero Walmart where you were struck by

             11    the pallet jack --

             12         A.   Uh-huh.

             13         Q.   -- that you claim.

             14              The individual that you claim was operating

    13:35:54 15    the pallet jack that struck you, what -- what did he

             16    look like?

             17         A.   Young white male.

             18         Q.   And aside from "young white male," like what

             19    color hair did he have?

    13:36:06 20         A.   Brown.

             21         Q.   Okay.  How tall was he?

             22         A.   Five, five maybe.

             23         Q.   Okay.  So kind of short?

             24         A.   Yeah.

                                                                          35




              1         Q.   Okay.

              2         A.   Somewhere in that area.

              3         Q.   When you say "young," how young are we

              4    talking?

    13:36:22  5         A.   20s.

              6         Q.   Okay.  What was he wearing that day, the date

              7    of your incident?

              8         A.   I don't recall what he was wearing.  T-shirt,

              9    I believe.

    13:36:33 10         Q.   Do you remember the color of the T-shirt?

             11         A.   I don't.

             12         Q.   Do you remember the type of pants he was

             13    wearing?

             14         A.   Jeans.

    13:36:45 15         Q.   Did you speak to this individual at all?

             16         A.   No.

             17         Q.   How do you know that he was an employee of

             18    Walmart?

             19         A.   He was pulling a pallet jack in the store.

    13:37:19 20         Q.   So based on that alone you believe that he's

             21    an employee?

             22         A.   I -- Yes.

             23         Q.   Okay.  In terms of this accident, before being

             24    hit with the pallet jack, did you hear any -- any beeps,

                                                                          36




              1    any honking, anybody yelling, Get out of my way?

              2         A.   No.

              3         Q.   Anything like that?

              4         A.   No.

    13:37:47  5         Q.   You didn't hear anything?

              6         A.   No, sir.

              7         Q.   Okay.  Where were you in the store that day

              8    when you were hit?

              9         A.   I believe I was in aisle 15 talking to a

    13:37:59 10    Walmart employee.

             11         Q.   And what were you talking to the Walmart

             12    employee about?

             13         A.   Items in the store.

             14         Q.   Was that Walmart employee the Toledo --

    13:38:18 15         A.   Yes.

             18         Q.   Okay.  So would she have seen this person hit

             19    you?

    13:38:22 20         A.   No.  She had her back turned.

             21         Q.   Okay.  So when you were talking to her, she

             22    had her back turned towards you?

              2         Q.   Okay.  And -- So I guess then if you're

              3    standing there talking to Ms. Toledo and it hits you in

              4    your left foot as you're standing there, it hit you on

              6         A.   Yes.

              7         Q.   Because it's impossible for it to hit you on

             11    of your left foot was -- were you struck?

             12         A.   The back and the side because I -- I turned --

             13    when it hit me -- I turned very, very quickly when it

             14    hit me.  And the back and the side of it.

    13:45:00 15         Q.   Okay.  How did it strike you in the back?

             16    Because -- In the back of the foot I mean.

             19         A.   Yeah.  We're standing here (indicating) and he

    13:45:15 20    was turning.  While he was turning it, it caught me.  Do

             21    you follow?

             22              Maribel was standing...

                                                                          46




              1         A.   That's correct.

              2         Q.   I'm assuming the circles represent you,

              3    Ms. Toledo, and Maribel?

              4         A.   That's correct.

    13:47:13  5         Q.   Okay.  It'll -- Can you color in the circle

              6    that's you.

              7         A.   I'll put my initials, how's that, M, Toledo,

              8    and Maribel.

              9         Q.   Well, that's two M's so that'll be confusing.

    13:47:28 10         A.   That's -- Oh.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.

             11         Q.   There you go.  Okay.

             12         A.   There we go.

             13         Q.   So you have "T" for the top circle, that's

             14    Ms. Toledo?

    13:47:41 15         A.   That's correct.

             16         Q.   The middle one you wrote "M" next to it,

             17    that's you?

             18         A.   That's correct.

             19         Q.   And then the bottom "O" you wrote Maribel next

    13:47:45 20    to it, that's --

             21         A.   That's correct.

             22         Q.   -- your girlfriend?

             23         A.   Right.

              2         A.   Yes.

              3         Q.   Okay.  And then you drew this arrow that goes

              4    around these people.  That is the -- I'm assuming the

    13:47:55  5    path of the pallet jack.

              6         A.   That's correct.

              7         Q.   Okay.  And that's how when it was passing by

              8    you, you were struck?

              9         A.   That's correct.

    13:48:03 10         Q.   Okay.

             11         A.   He was making a turn and, bam.

             13         MR. SUN:  Okay.  We can mark this as Exhibit 2.

             14    Yeah.

             15    BY MR. SUN:

             16         Q.   And then just -- Can I just get you to sign

             17    this --

             18         A.   Yes.

             19         Q.   -- so that later on --

              3         Q.   Okay.  After getting hit -- or immediately

              4    after getting hit, did the individual who operated the

              8         A.   Maribel told him to be careful.  She told him

              9    to be careful.

    13:48:49 10         Q.   Okay.

             11         A.   And he apologized and said he was sorry.

             12         Q.   Okay.

             13         A.   And then he took off.

             14         Q.   And that was between Maribel and the

    13:48:57 15    gentleman?

             16         A.   Correct.

             17         Q.   Okay.  Did you speak to him at all?

              1         Q.   Okay.  After this incident occurred, did

              2    you -- were you continuing to speak to Ms. Toledo?

              3         A.   At that point the -- we said a word or two and

              4    that was the extent of that.

    13:49:21  5         Q.   Okay.  What was the word or two about?  Was it

              6    about getting hit, or...

              7         A.   No.

              8         Q.   Okay.

              9         A.   No.  It -- it was something -- I don't recall

    13:49:33 10    what it was.

             11         Q.   Okay.  And when was the first time you

             12    reported to someone at the store that you were hit?

             13         A.   I -- I followed her.  I followed Ms. Toledo

             14    and I asked her for her name and she provided me with

    13:49:55 15    her name.

             16         Q.   Okay.  Aside from Ms. Toledo, did you talk to

             17    anybody else?

             18         A.   No, sir.

             21         Q.   Okay.  So on the date of the incident, the

             22    only person that you spoke to was Ms. Toledo from the

             23    store?

             24         A.   I -- I believe -- Now that you bring that up,

                                                                          50




              1    I believe there was a store manager.  And -- Yeah, I

              2    called for a store manager, that I could recollect, and

              3    we were in a hurry that day.  And he said you can come

              4    back and fill an accident report.

    13:50:44  5         Q.   This manager that you talked to, do you

              6    remember his name?

              7         A.   I -- I do not, sir.

              8         Q.   Okay.  Do you remember what he looked like?

              9         A.   He was an elderly black male.

    13:50:59 10         Q.   How tall?

             11         A.   Maybe six.

             12         Q.   Was he wearing the Walmart vest; do you

             13    remember?

             14         A.   Yes, I believe so.

    13:51:09 15         Q.   And he mentioned you could come back to the

             16    store and fill out --

             17         A.   Yeah.

             18         Q.   -- something?

             19         A.   He said -- He said, If you don't -- If you

    13:51:16 20    don't have time, you can come back, and I told him I

             21    would.

             22         Q.   Okay.  Because you were in a hurry?

             23         A.   Well -- Yes, we were.  We were in a hurry.

             24         Q.   Okay.  And then you finished your shopping and

              1    checked out?

              2         A.   Yes.

              3         Q.   Okay.  Immediately as you were hit by the

              4    car -- going back to when you're standing there

    13:51:32  5    talking -- right when the guy tries to go around you --

              6         A.   Uh-huh.

              7         Q.   -- then hits you, did you have any pain in

              8    your foot?

              9         A.   I -- Yes.

    13:51:39 10         Q.   Okay.  And what was the level of pain in your

             14         A.   It was a six.

    13:51:51 15         Q.   Okay.  Was it sharp?  Was it dull?

             16         A.   It was sharp, yes.

             17         Q.   And where exactly in your foot did you

             18    experience this pain?

             19         A.   Left ankle.

    13:52:03 20         Q.   So it was on the ankle as opposed to the foot?

             21         A.   Ankle.

             22         Q.   Okay.

              1         Q.   So it was --

              2         A.   When I -- When I meant "ankle," I should --

              4         Q.   So the foot and ankle?

              6         Q.   Okay.  Prior to the date of the accident, had

              7    you ever had any pain in your left foot or ankle for any

              8    reason?

             18         A.   No, sir.

             19         Q.   Okay.  And just so that I'm clear, as a result

    13:52:58 20    of being hit with this pallet jack, you're only claiming

             21    that your left foot and ankle were injured, correct?

              1         A.   Left ankle and foot.

              2         Q.   Okay.  Did the older gentleman who was the

              4         A.   No, sir.

    13:53:24  5         Q.   Did you tell the older gentleman, the manager

              6    that you spoke with, did you tell him that you were in

              7    pain?

              8         A.   Yes.

              9         Q.   Okay.  And you left the store that night.  Did

    13:53:43 10    the pain get any better that night?

             11         A.   It was the same.

             12         Q.   Did you try to do anything for it, like ice

             13    it --

             14         A.   Ice, yes.  That's exactly what I did.

             16         A.   Yes.  Yes, actually it helped.

             17         Q.   Okay.  So the day after, it would have been

             18    November 25th, how was the pain in your left foot/ankle?

             19         A.   It -- It subsided.  It subsided to, I would

    13:54:08 20    say, five.

             21         Q.   Okay.  So just a little bit?

             22         A.   Yeah, a little bit.

             23         Q.   Okay.  And it looks like at some -- you

             24    decided to return to the store two days later?

                                                                          54




              1         A.   I -- Which I did, yes.

              2         Q.   Okay.

    13:55:10 20         A.   Yes.

             21         Q.   Okay.  Can you just read that into the record

             18         Q.   All right.

             19         A.   -- to say.

    13:58:44 20         Q.   And we're talking about the circular part of

             21    the toilet roll --

              1         Q.   Did you take any pictures of this bruising at

              2    that time?

              3         A.   The -- I did.  They were in my camera.

              4    However, my camera malfunctioned and I purchased a new

    13:59:05  5    phone.  When I tried to retrieve them, the camera would

              6    not -- the phone itself would not work.  So --

              7         Q.   Okay.

              8         A.   -- I was not able to obtain them.

              9         Q.   Did you ever show this bruise to any Walmart

             12         Q.   Okay.  Sorry to jump around on you.  But when

    13:59:32 15         A.   Uh-huh.

             16         Q.   -- what -- what did you discuss with her

             17    about?  I guess, what was the topic of that

             18    conversation?  Just about the accident or is there

             19    any --

    13:59:43 20         A.   Just about filling out the paperwork.

             21         Q.   Okay.

             22         A.   About filling out the paperwork.

             23         Q.   Did she talk to you about anything else

             24    outside of this accident?

                                                                          60




              1         A.   No.

              2         Q.   Okay.  Did she talk to you about who the

              3    individual was that was pulling the pallet jack?

              4         A.   No.

    13:59:56  5         Q.   Okay.  Did she say like, Oh, we've disciplined

              6    that person, or anything like that?

              7         A.   No.

              8         Q.   Okay.  In terms of seeking medical treatment,

              9    it looks like the first doctor you saw was Dr. Ursula...

    14:00:05 10         A.   Gierlachowski.

             11         Q.   I was going to say, I'm not going to try that.

             12              Was she your primary care physician?

             13         A.   Yes.  Yes, sir.

             14         Q.   Okay.  Is she still your primary care

    14:00:15 15    physician?

             17         Q.   Okay.  How long has she been your primary care

             18    physician for up until that point?

             19         A.   Two years I believe.

    14:00:23 20         Q.   Okay.  And before Dr. Gierlachowski, did you

             21    have a primary care physician?

             22         A.   No, no.

             23         Q.   Okay.  So when you went to Dr. Gierlachowski,

             24    what did she do for you?

                                                                          61




              1         A.   Told me to see a podiatrist.

              2         Q.   Okay.  Did she give you a referral for that?

              3         A.   Yes, sir.

              4         Q.   Okay.  And did you follow up with that

    14:00:51  5    podiatrist?

              6         A.   I did.

              7         Q.   Okay.  And sorry.  But did Dr. Gierlachowski

              8    ever perform any X-rays on you?

              9         A.   No.  She -- No, she did not.  She visibly

    14:01:03 10    looked at my ankle.  She looked at my ankle and referred

             11    me to Dr. Betman.  That's all she did.

             12         Q.   Okay.  And was Dr. Betman with Podiatry,

             13    Physician & Spine?

             14         A.   Yes.

    14:01:19 15         Q.   Okay.  Did Dr. Gierlachowski refer you to any

             16    physical therapy?

             17         A.   No.

             18         Q.   Okay.  In terms of seeing Dr. Betman or

             19    following up on that referral, how long did it take you

    14:01:34 20    to follow up on Dr. Gierlachowski's referral?

             21         A.   Well, I -- Well, you have to make an

             22    appointment.  And as soon as I called to make an

             23    appointment I -- I went.  I'm not sure how many -- what

             24    span it was.  I'm not -- I don't recall that.  But it --

                                                                          62




              1    The first opportunity that came up, I went to go see

              2    him.

              3         Q.   Okay.  Because based on my review of the

              4    records, it seemed like it -- it took almost three

    14:02:00  5    months; does that sound about right?

              6         A.   To see Dr. --

              7         Q.   Betman.

              8         A.   Dr. Betman?  Oh, no.

              9         Q.   So you think it was shorter than three months?

    14:02:10 10         A.   Abs- -- Absolutely.

             11         Q.   Okay.  When you went to see Dr. Betman, what

             12    did he do for you on your initial visit?

             13         A.   Examined my ankle, gave me some medication,

             14    and told me to come in -- I think it was -- in a couple

    14:02:30 15    weeks or so.

             16         Q.   Did he perform any X-rays?

             17         A.   I believe he did.  I believe he did.

             18         Q.   Do you remember the results of those X-rays?

             19         A.   No.  No, I don't.  No.  No, I don't.  But he

    14:02:45 20    did do an X-ray.  I'm almost sure he did.

             21         Q.   You mentioned he gave you some medication?

             22         A.   Yes.

             23         Q.   And what was that medication?

             24         A.   Pain medication.

                                                                          63




              1         Q.   In terms of that medication, do you remember

              2    what it was specifically?  Was it -- You know, are we

              3    talking about ibuprofen or are we talking about Vicodin?

              4         A.   No.  It was hydrocodone.

    14:03:05  5         Q.   Okay.  Did he recommend any physical therapy

              6    to you?

              7         A.   Yes, yes.

              8         Q.   Okay.  And was that physical therapy at Saint

              9    Anthony's or was that somewhere else?

    14:03:20 10         A.   Saint Anthony's on Kedzie Avenue.

             11         Q.   Okay.  So again, based on -- just going off

             12    your discovery here, it looks like you started that

             13    physical therapy sometime in May of 2017; is that

             14    correct?

    14:03:28 15         A.   I -- I don't recall the date on that, sir.

             16         Q.   Okay.  Approximately how long of a gap was

             17    there between the first time you saw Dr. Betman and when

             18    you started therapy?

             19         A.   I -- I'm not sure how long of a gap there was.

    14:03:47 20    I don't think there was a very, very long gap.

             21         THE COURT REPORTER:  A very, very long what?

             22         THE WITNESS:  Long gap.  I don't think there was a

             23    long gap.

              1    BY MR. SUN:

              2         Q.   Okay.  In terms of the physical therapy that

              3    he referred you to, how many days a week was it?

              4         A.   Can we go back to the last question you asked

    14:04:08  5    me?  Is it permissible?

              6         Q.   Sure.  I don't remember what was --

              7    specifically the last question.

              8         A.   You asked me how long of a gap.

              9         Q.   Oh, okay.  Yeah.

    14:04:17 10         A.   Before you're able to go see a doctor --

             11         Q.   Uh-huh.

             12         A.   -- I have to have permission from my insurance

             13    company.  In other words, I have to have permissions

             14    that they'll OK that.  And I think the reason why there

    14:04:33 15    was a gap is because the therapist said, We don't have

             16    the OK for us to do the therapy unless we get OK from

             17    your -- from your insurance company.  You know, if

             18    they -- If they approve it, then we can start.  So I

             19    think that's where the gap is, if there is a gap that I

    14:04:53 20    recall because I went in and I had to wait until my

             21    insurance company approved it.

             22         Q.   Gotcha.

             23         A.   Okay.  So that's where that's at.

             24         Q.   Gotcha.  Sorry.  One sec.  Okay.

                                                                          65




              1              Okay.  But eventually you did start physical

              2    therapy?

              3         A.   Yes.

              4         Q.   As recommended by Dr. Betman?

    14:05:18  5         A.   Yes, yes.

              6         Q.   And how many days a week was it?

              7         A.   It was -- I believe it was two days the first

              8    week and then we went to three days.  Was it three -- I

              9    think it was three days the first week and then

    14:05:33 10    gradually went down to two days.

             11         Q.   Okay.  And how many --

             12         A.   Every -- Every week.

             13         Q.   Okay.  And how many weeks was it?

             14         A.   I believe it was over two months.

    14:05:46 15         Q.   Okay.  And in terms of the physical therapy

             16    itself, what types of activities did they do for you?

             17         A.   A lot of step stepping at certain variable

             18    degree -- certain angles.  There were ice packs put on.

             19    There were -- There was movement of my ankle to certain

    14:06:19 20    areas, stretching it, things of that nature.

             21         Q.   Did therapy help you with the pain in your

             22    left foot?

             23         A.   No.

             24         Q.   Okay.

                                                                          66




              1         A.   No.  No, it didn't.

              2         Q.   And I forgot to ask this, but I guess, when

              3    you went to see Dr. Betman, how was your foot doing?

              4    What was the level of pain when you first went to see

    14:06:43  5    Dr. Betman?

              6         A.   Five.

              7         Q.   Okay.  So -- Okay.  And then when you went --

              8    When you first started physical therapy, what was the

              9    level of pain in your foot?

    14:06:50 10         A.   Five.

             11         Q.   So that's almost May of 2017.  So between the

             12    date of your accident in late November of 2016 to May of

             13    2017, it was just a five throughout that time frame?

             14         A.   Yes.  I was insisting that there was something

    14:07:08 15    wrong.  I -- I kept telling Dr. Betman, There's

             16    something more to it.  There's -- Even when I first saw

             17    him, I said, You know, the bruise is good.  There's

             18    something more to it here.

             19         Q.   You mentioned that the bruise was gone.  How

    14:07:20 20    long did it take for the bruise to disappear?

             21         A.   Three -- Three days.  Three -- three -- Yeah.

             22    About three days.

             23         Q.   Okay.  During that time frame, again, that six

             24    months -- it's from November of 2016 to approximately

                                                                          67




              1    May when you started therapy and you had that

              2    five-out-of-ten pain -- were you able to work during

              3    that time frame?

              4         A.   Yes.

    14:07:39  5         Q.   Okay.

              6         A.   Periodically, yes.

              7         Q.   Okay.  Were you able to do other things during

              8    that time frame like play tennis?

              9         A.   No, no.

    14:07:48 10         Q.   Okay.

             11         A.   No, not during that time.

             12         Q.   Okay.  During that time frame, you never

             13    played tennis or any -- and did any --

             14         A.   I -- I had -- There was --

    14:07:53 15         Q.   -- physical activities?

             16         A.   I attempted a couple times to -- for -- for

             17    rehab purposes, but it didn't go far.

             18         Q.   Okay.

             19         A.   So, yeah.

    14:08:03 20         Q.   Are you -- Are you good at tennis?

             21         A.   Yes.  I -- I like tennis.

             22         Q.   What's your serve speed?

             23         A.   70.  At that -- Back then, about 70.

             24         Q.   Okay.  No, I'm just curious --

                                                                          68




              1         A.   Yeah.

              2         Q.   -- because I --

              3         A.   I -- I like -- I just --

              4         Q.   -- I tried to walk on at college, but --

    14:08:16  5         A.   Oh.  I -- I like tennis.

              6         Q.   -- it didn't go so hot.

              7         A.   I like tennis.  I like jogging.  Tennis,

              8    jogging, and bicycling.  You know, I -- I don't smoke

              9    cigarettes.  So I -- I enjoy that.  I enjoy that.  You

    14:08:28 10    know, I used to own a bicycle shop.  So I --

             11         Q.   Oh, nice.

             12         A.   I enjoy bicycling, you know --

             13         Q.   Hey, we'd --

             14         A.   -- be outdoors.

    14:08:37 15         Q.   We'd get along.  I like doing...

             16         A.   Yeah.  You know, it's -- I don't drink.  I

             17    don't smoke.  You know, so I just enjoy the outdoor

             18    activities and that's all I can tell you now, sir.

             19         Q.   Gotcha.

    14:08:46 20              So we went up to the point of the physical

             21    therapy in approximately May of 2017, still out of five,

             22    you start the therapy.  You mentioned it goes for

             23    approximately two months.  During those two months you

             24    mentioned that the physical therapy did not help you.

                                                                          69




              1         A.   That's right.

              2         Q.   So at the end of therapy, was your pain still

              3    a five out of ten?

              4         A.   Yes.

    14:09:06  5         Q.   Okay.  And throughout therapy, did you tell

              6    your doctors or your -- not doctors, but your

              7    therapists --

              8         A.   I told my therapist.  Anybody who cared to

              9    listen to, I told.  I said --

    14:09:17 10         Q.   That your pain was still there?

             11         A.   Yes.  I said, There's something more to this

             12    than just a bruise.  There's something more to it.  And

             13    then finally one of the doctors said, We need to look

             14    into this more, and they did.

    14:09:36 15         Q.   Which doctor was that?

             16         A.   Dr. Rodriguez, the -- he works with

             17    Dr. Goldflies.

             18         Q.   Okay.

             19         A.   Yeah.

    14:09:47 20         Q.   And which hospital is Dr. Goldflies with?

             21         A.   Saint Anthony's.

             22         Q.   Did Dr. Betman give you a referral to see

             23    Dr. Goldflies?

             24         A.   That would have been Gierlachowski.

                                                                          70




              1         Q.   Oh, okay.  So Gierla- --

              2         A.   Well, you know, yes, he -- I believe, yes, he

              3    did.  Dr. Betman, yes, he did recommend that I go see

              4    Dr. Goldflies.  But it still had to come from...

    14:10:06  5         Q.   Your PCP?

              6         A.   Yes.

              7         Q.   Because of the insurance and how --

              8         A.   Correct.

              9         Q.   -- it's set up.

    14:10:10 10         A.   Yes.  Yeah.

             11         Q.   That makes sense.

             12         A.   It's -- it's all in -- It's sometimes --

             13         Q.   So I guess was it one of those scenarios where

             14    Dr. Betman said, kind of, you know, There's nothing more

    14:10:19 15    I can do for you.  If you want to go see someone else,

             16    get another referral?

             17         A.   Yes, yes.  And -- and I kept -- I kept

             18    complaining to him.  I said, you know, Dr. Betman -- to

             19    my therapist -- I go, There's something more to this,

    14:10:35 20    Something more to this, you know, There's something more

             21    to this and finally someone listened to me and they

             22    discovered what they discovered.

             23         Q.   We'll get -- we'll get -- We'll get there.

             24         A.   Yeah, sure.

                                                                          71




              1         Q.   But -- So Dr. Betman's involvement in this was

              2    just really overseeing the physical therapy, or did he

              3    provide other specific treatment to you?

              4         A.   I -- I saw him maybe three or four times.

    14:10:58  5         Q.   Okay.

              6         A.   Because he put me in a boot.

              7         Q.   Okay.

              8         A.   He put me in a boot.  And I was in a boot for

              9    a good while.

    14:11:06 10         Q.   Did that help?

             11         A.   No.

             12         Q.   Okay.  Aside from putting you in the boot and

             13    giving you the medication and prescribing the therapy,

             14    did he do anything else?

    14:11:15 15         A.   No, no.

             16         Q.   Okay.  And then you got your referral from

             17    Dr. Gierlachowski to go see Dr. Goldflies?

             18         A.   Correct.

             19         Q.   Okay.  How did you find out about

    14:11:21 20    Dr. Goldflies?  Like, was that something that you

             21    brought to her, like, I want this?

             22         A.   Through the network -- through the

             23    insurance -- Through the network.

             24         Q.   Okay.

                                                                          72




              1         A.   They advise you of who's available and what

              2    have you.  You just have to follow a chain of command.

              3    You can't -- You can't really do anything unless they

              4    approve it, you know, so...

    14:11:38  5         Q.   I -- I understand how insurance works.

              6         A.   Yeah, so...

              7         Q.   So when was the first time you saw

              8    Dr. Goldflies?

              9         A.   I don't recall that date, sir.  I -- I don't

    14:11:53 10    recall it.  But it was soon -- it was in that area.

             11    Soon after the therapy.

             12         Q.   So approximately in the late summer or fall of

             13    2017?

             14         A.   Late summer.  I would say late summer maybe.

    14:12:08 15         Q.   Okay.  When you first went to see

             16    Dr. Goldflies, did he perform any type of X-rays, MRIs?

             17         A.   I think it was the second -- second visit, I

             18    believe, that they -- I want to say the second or third

             19    visit, there was an intern there, Dr. Matthews, and I --

    14:12:30 20    I kept insisting Dr. Matthews from day one, since this

             21    happened, that there is something there and that no one

             22    had done an MRI.  I kept complaining that no one had

             23    done an MRI.  Finally they did an MRI and then he told

             24    Dr. Goldflies and it went from there.

                                                                          73




              1         Q.   Okay.  I'm assuming Dr. Goldflies ordered that

              2    MRI?

              3         A.   Yes.

              4         Q.   Okay.  Did he -- Did Dr. Goldflies prescribe

    14:12:59  5    you any medication?

              6         A.   Yes.

              7         Q.   And what -- Do you remember what it was?

              8         A.   It was for pain, I believe there was -- I

              9    believe it was hydrocodone.

    14:13:08 10         Q.   Okay.

             11         A.   So it --

             12         MR. SUN:  Counsel, isn't hydrocodone Vicodin?

             13         THE WITNESS:  Yes.

             14         MR. SUN:  Isn't it the same thing?

    14:13:11 15         THE WITNESS:  Yes.

             16         MR. SUN:  Okay.  That's what I thought.  Okay.

             17         THE WITNESS:  I just go by that name because that's

             18    what...

             19         MR. SUN:  Gotcha.

    14:13:16 20    BY MR. SUN:

             21         Q.   Did he do anything else aside from the --

             22    Initially he -- aside from the medication and ordering

             23    the MRI, did he --

             24         A.   They -- They took X-rays over there.

                                                                          74




              1         Q.   Okay.

              2         A.   Yeah.  I remember they did take X-rays.

              3         Q.   Did he try to give you more physical therapy?

              4         A.   No.  No, not that I recall.

    14:13:34  5         Q.   Okay.  Eventually, though, you -- or a few

              6    months later, it looks like Dr. Goldflies performed that

              7    surgery on your left foot, correct?

              8         A.   Yes.

              9         Q.   Okay.  And I think yesterday or today I just

    14:13:53 10    received the pictures of your scars I think that you

             11    sent to your attorney.  And those are -- I'm assuming,

             12    were taken immediately after the surgery, correct?

             13         A.   Yes.

             14         Q.   Because I saw the stitches --

    14:14:05 15         A.   Yes.

             16         Q.   -- and everything like that?

             17         A.   Yes.

             18         Q.   Okay.  In terms of that surgery, was it a

             19    one-day surgery?

    14:14:11 20         A.   Yes, it was.

             21         Q.   Okay.  So you showed up the day, you left the

             22    same day?

             23         A.   Yes.

             24         Q.   Was it general or local anesthesia?  In other

                                                                          75




              1    words, were you out or was it --

              2         A.   I was out.

              3         Q.   -- just --

              4         A.   I was out.

    14:14:23  5         Q.   Okay.  So general anesthesia.

              6              Do you recall how long the procedure was?

              7         A.   No, I don't.

              8         Q.   Okay.

              9         A.   No, I don't.

    14:14:30 10         Q.   Do you recall what the procedure was for --

             11    like what they were going to do to your left foot?

             12         A.   Repair a tear.  I'm not versed well with

             13    medical terminology, but something to do with a torn

             14    tendon, something of that nature.

    14:14:47 15         Q.   Okay.  Were you working -- Up until the date

             16    of the surgery, were you working at all?

             17         A.   Yes, yes.  Off and on I was working, yes.

             18         Q.   Okay.  And when you say "off and on," I guess

             19    during that time you were still -- you're operating your

    14:15:00 20    own company --

             21         A.   Yes.

             22         Q.   -- at that point --

             23         A.   Yes.

             24         Q.   -- correct?

                                                                          76




              1         A.   Yes, I am.

              2         Q.   Okay.  So you don't necessarily have set

              3    hours, but you're on call for these companies that you

              4    service?

    14:15:10  5         A.   That's correct.

              6         Q.   Okay.  So when you saying you're working off

              7    and on, are you saying that there are some service calls

              8    that you're not able to go to or are you saying that

              9    you're working off and on because the service calls are

    14:15:19 10    off and on?

             11         A.   There's service calls that, because of my

             12    ankle, that I could not -- I could not perform, there

             13    were others that I could perform, and others that I

             14    couldn't.

    14:15:29 15         Q.   Okay.  Could you give me an example of one

             16    that you could perform.

             17         A.   One working with my hands and -- One working

             18    with my hands.  One working with my hands so as long as

             19    I don't have to stand for a long period of time.

    14:15:46 20         Q.   Okay.  So what would be one that you could not

             21    perform, a service call?

             22         A.   One that -- where I would have to stand for

             23    long periods of time.  During the winter -- It was very

             24    difficult for me during the winter to -- to work because

                                                                          77




              1    of the -- the cold.  It had an adverse effect on my

              2    ankle.

              3         Q.   Okay.  When you mentioned that there are

              4    certain jobs you couldn't do because you had to stand

    14:16:10  5    for a long period of time, what's a long period of time?

              6         A.   Four, four hours.

              7         Q.   Okay.  So a task that would involve standing

              8    for less than four hours you could do?

              9         A.   Yes.

    14:16:22 10         Q.   Okay.  After the surgery with Dr. Goldflies,

             11    did he give you any type of post-surgery

             12    recommendations, like you can't stand on your feet or

             13    like that?

             14         A.   Yes, yes.  Yes, he did.  He told me to stay

    14:16:44 15    off it as much as possible, told me to move it

             16    slightly -- move it slightly.  Just start to move

             17    your -- Start the rehab slowly.  From then -- He goes,

             18    just to start to move it, just start to move it a little

             19    bit.

    14:17:06 20         Q.   Okay.

             21         A.   Yeah.

             22         Q.   Were you placed in a cast or a boot?

             23         A.   It was a soft cast.

             24         Q.   Okay.  Was the soft cast permanent?

                                                                          78




              1         A.   Well --

              2         Q.   Like -- I mean in terms of everyday life, are

              3    you --

              4         A.   Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

    14:17:21  5         Q.   -- keeping it on --

              6         A.   Yeah.

              7         Q.   -- all 24 hours --

              8         A.   Oh, yeah.

              9         Q.   -- a day?

    14:17:23 10         A.   Yes.

             11         Q.   Okay.

             12         A.   Yes.

             13         Q.   Were you going around in crutches then?

             14         A.   Yes.

    14:17:30 15         Q.   Okay.  During that recovery time, did you do

             16    any calls for your company?

             17         A.   Yes.  Yes, I did.

             18         Q.   Okay.  And some of those calls still would

             19    have involved you standing?

    14:17:40 20         A.   Yes.

             21         Q.   Okay.

             22         A.   It was a matter of losing my business or doing

             23    it.

             24         Q.   Okay.  So you still performed some of the

                                                                          79




              1    service calls?

              2         A.   Some.

              3         Q.   Okay.  During the -- In the month after your

              4    surgery?

    14:17:53  5         A.   Yes.

              6         Q.   Okay.  And when you had to stand, I guess,

              7    for -- For example, one of the service calls, let's say

              8    in that month right after the surgery where you still

              9    have the soft cost on and let's say it involves

    14:18:08 10    standing, what would you do?

             11         A.   Well, Maribel -- Like I told you, since I

             12    can't drive, those who would take me, I would -- I would

             13    tell them what to do.  I -- Unfortunately, they're not

             14    skilled, but I was trying my best.  I didn't want to

    14:18:26 15    lose my clients.

             16         Q.   I understand.

             17         A.   I did not want to lose my clients and I

             18    already lost clients to this.  So I tried my best.

             19         Q.   Okay.  So --

    14:18:35 20         A.   And...

             21         Q.   For -- Let's just say, for example, there's a

             22    job, they call you in -- in that month while you're

             23    recovering.  You bring Maribel along.

             24         A.   Yeah.

                                                                          80




              1         Q.   And if it involved the maintenance or doing

              2    something, you would just have her do it, correct?

              3         A.   Yeah.

              4         Q.   And you would kind of stand to the side and --

    14:18:51  5         A.   I would --

              6         Q.   -- tell her --

              7         A.   Yeah, I would be sitting to the side.

              8         Q.   Okay.

              9              (Continuing.) -- you'd be sitting to the side

    14:18:55 10    and you would be telling her how to do what you would be

             11    doing?

             12         A.   Yeah.

             13         Q.   Okay.

             14         A.   It was not easy, but...

    14:19:02 15         Q.   Okay.  In terms of that maintenance was -- I

             16    mean, was there welding, was there things of that

             17    nature --

             18         A.   No.

             19         Q.   -- going on?

    14:19:08 20         A.   No, that -- any -- any welding to do was --

             21    there's just -- she's not -- She's not a welder.

             22         Q.   Right.

             23         A.   So anything that -- that I felt that she could

             24    do under -- under my tutelage that -- she can do it.

                                                                          81




              1         Q.   Okay.  Could you just give me an example of

              2    something that -- let's -- Can you give me an example of

              3    just a call that she could handle while you're kind of

              4    sitting there.

    14:19:27  5         A.   Okay.  Putting in a thermostat in an oven.  At

              6    times I would have some of the employees there pick it

              7    up for us.  I would -- I would -- Some of the employees

              8    that were there, I would ask them to help and they were

              9    very kind because they saw what I was going through.

    14:19:49 10         Q.   Okay.  And we'll get to the wage loss after

             11    this.

             12         A.   Sure.  Sure.

             13         Q.   I'm just getting through the medical first.

             14         A.   I'm fine.

    14:19:55 15         Q.   Do you need to take a break or anything?

             16         A.   No, no, no.

             17         Q.   Okay.

             18         A.   I'm fine.  I'm fine.

             19         Q.   Okay.  When did you start therapy after the

    14:20:02 20    surgery?

             21         A.   Well, there was an issue with the insurance

             22    company again --

             23         Q.   Okay.

             24         A.   -- which prolonged it.  They said, Well, you

                                                                          82




              1    can't come in until we approve it.  I said, Well, when

              2    is this going to happen?  They said, We'll let you know.

              3         Q.   Of course.  That's --

              4         A.   That's --

    14:20:24  5         Q.   That's how insurance works nowadays.

              6         A.   Yeah.  I -- I didn't have too much say so.

              7    And I found it to be that in most of these cases here,

              8    with me going to see Betman and all, everything has to

              9    be approved.  You -- It's, I'll tell you, you don't call

    14:20:40 10    me, and...

             11              You know, so it was a waiting game.

             12         Q.   Understood.

             13              Before you started physical therapy, though,

             14    after the surgery, during that time, did the pain in

    14:20:51 15    your foot get any better?

             16         A.   Well -- No.  It was pretty painful.  It I

             17    guess because of the opening of the wound or whatever,

             18    it was -- it was painful.

             19         Q.   Okay.

    14:21:02 20         A.   It was painful.

             21         Q.   Was the pain from the surgery or pain from the

             22    original accident or are there both?

             23         A.   Both.

             24         Q.   Okay.

                                                                          83




              1         A.   Both.

              2         Q.   Okay.

              3         A.   Fair to say from both.

              4         Q.   But at some point you did start therapy,

    14:21:15  5    correct --

              6         A.   Oh, yes.

              7         Q.   -- after the surgery?

              8         A.   Yes.  Absolutely.

              9         Q.   Okay.

    14:21:17 10         A.   Absolutely.

             11         Q.   And in terms of that therapy, was it largely

             12    kind of the same as the first bout it in therapy that

             13    you had gone through?

             14         A.   No, no.  Actually --

    14:21:24 15         Q.   It was different?

             16         A.   -- it -- it was -- this was a lot different.

             17         Q.   Okay.

             18         A.   This was a lot, lot different.

             19         Q.   And how was it different?

    14:21:32 20         A.   Well, she controlled my ankle, whereas before

             21    I was able to move it on my own.  This time she was

             22    hands on with it.

             23         Q.   Okay.

             24         A.   Yeah.  Adjusting it with her hands.  And

                                                                          84




              1    whenever she -- She told me, If -- If you feel pain,

              2    stop me.  And of course, you know...

              3         Q.   Okay.

              4         A.   Yeah.  That's how that went until we gradually

    14:21:55  5    went on about therapy.

              6         Q.   Did that therapy help you with the pain in

              7    your left foot and ankle?

              8         A.   Yes.  Yes, to a degree.  To a degree it did.

              9         Q.   Okay.  In terms of the dates that we have from

    14:22:12 10    this chart, it -- it looks to me as if the last date of

             11    your treatment was in April of 2018; does that sound

             12    right?

             13         A.   Yes.  Yes, that sounds about right.

             14         Q.   That was the last date of your therapy,

    14:22:26 15    your -- any follow-ups with Dr. Goldflies?

             16         A.   Yes.  Yes, I did.

             17         Q.   Okay.  As of that date, did you ever report to

             18    your therapist that you had zero-out-of-ten pain?

             19         A.   Yes, I -- I do believe I -- Yes.  It was -- I

    14:22:45 20    believe at the time I said it was six.

             21         Q.   Did you ever tell him "zero" though?

             22         A.   No.  I've never told him it was zero.

             23         Q.   Okay.

             24         A.   That I -- That I recall.

                                                                          85




              1         Q.   Okay.  Did -- Were you able at that point to

              2    jog without any issues?

              3         A.   No.

              4         Q.   Okay.

    14:23:00  5         A.   No.

              6         Q.   Do you currently have any doctor appointments

              7    scheduled for your left ankle or left foot?

              8         A.   No, sir.

              9         Q.   Okay.  Has any doctor, in your past treatment,

    14:23:15 10    ever told you that you will need future -- not the one

             11    by Dr. Goldflies, but additional surgery for your left

             12    foot or ankle?

             13         A.   No.

             14         Q.   Okay.  In terms of -- Again, I saw the photos

    14:23:31 15    that you sent to your attorney right after the surgery.

             16    Do you have any residual scarring on your foot?

             17         A.   I do.

             18         MR. SUN:  Counsel, may I see that?

             19         MR. ADELMAN:  Yeah, of course.

    14:23:41 20         MR. SUN:  Just so -- If I can have --

             21         MR. ADELMAN:  Just pull back --

             22         MR. SUN:  -- for my records --

             23         MR. ADELMAN:  Just pull up your -- You want to take

             24    a picture of it?

                                                                          86




              1         MR. SUN:  Yeah, just so I can have it.

              2         MR. ADELMAN:  He's going to take a picture of the

              3    scar on your left...

              4         MR. SUN:  Because what I have to do is I have to

    14:23:53  5    send it to the client.  So this is actually my evidence,

              6    more or less.

              7              Okay.  Thank you.

              8         MR. ADELMAN:  Sure.

              9    BY MR. SUN:

    14:24:05 10         Q.   In terms of life activities that this left

             11    foot/ankle injury prevented you from doing, I guess,

             12    what -- what could you do before this accident that you

             13    can no longer do now?

             14         A.   Tennis, cycling, jogging.

    14:24:21 15         Q.   In terms of -- All right.  So let's just start

             16    with tennis.  So you -- You don't play tennis at all?

             17         A.   Not -- I -- I attempted to play tennis here

             18    actually about three weeks ago with Maribel and I bought

             19    two gym shoes thinking maybe it's just a gym shoe at

    14:24:42 20    first.  So I went to another gym shoe and, I mean, we

             21    played.  We played for a couple hours and she goes, You

             22    okay?  Just slow down a little bit.  And I just -- just

             23    couldn't -- just couldn't do it like I used to.

             24         Q.   But you played for a few hours?

                                                                          87




              1         A.   Oh, yeah.

              2         Q.   I mean, that's like a full -- full game.

              3         A.   Well, yeah.

              4         Q.   Okay.

    14:25:01  5         A.   I -- I -- Hey, man, this is the sport I enjoy.

              6         Q.   Okay.  So you can -- You can still play it,

              7    just not to the extent that you could before?

              8         A.   I -- I played it forcefully.  I played it

              9    forcefully.  I was uncomfortable playing it.

    14:25:19 10         Q.   Okay.  But you were able to do it, just with

             11    some discomfort?

             12         A.   Well, it was -- I was uncomfortable playing

             13    it.  I forced myself simply to get out there and

             14    exercise.

    14:25:30 15         Q.   Okay.

             16         A.   Simply to play it.  Okay?

             17         Q.   Okay.

             18         A.   Now, if you ask me if I can go out there and

             19    play it again for a couple hours, I'd probably say no

    14:25:39 20    because it felt terrible doing it when I did, so...

             21         Q.   Okay.  And you mentioned that you and Maribel

             22    tried to play tennis.  Was it -- You only tried that one

             23    time or was there other times that you tried it?

             24         A.   No, it was -- No.  We tried it several times.

                                                                          88




              1         Q.   Okay.

              2         A.   And the other times I didn't even last -- I

              3    didn't -- we didn't even last a full game.  I pretty

              4    well much hung my racket there.

    14:26:02  5         Q.   Gotcha.

              6              You mentioned jogging.  Do you still go

              7    jogging at all?

              8         A.   We tried that.  We jog at McKinley Park.

              9         Q.   Yeah.

    14:26:11 10         A.   Which is Archer and Western.  A full -- a full

             11    lap -- A full lap around the entire park, I -- I was --

             12    I was hurting.  It was uncomfortable.  Midway, midway it

             13    was uncomfortable for me.

             14         Q.   It's uncomfortable for me to run around a

    14:26:33 15    park.

             16         A.   Right.

             17         Q.   But it's my lungs.

             18         A.   Yeah.  Well, I try to run on -- I used to run

             19    on concrete so I tried it on grass then --

    14:26:40 20         Q.   Yeah.

             21         A.   -- you know, soften, and it's not like it used

             22    to be.

             23         Q.   Gotcha.

             24              So you can jog, just, again, it's very

                                                                          89




              1    discomfortable?

              2         A.   Very, very.

              3         Q.   Okay.

              4         A.   Very discomfortable.  And there's --

    14:26:52  5         Q.   And what was the third one that you mentioned?

              6         A.   Cycling.

              7         Q.   Okay.

              8         A.   Yeah.

              9         Q.   And have you tried cycling?

    14:26:59 10         A.   A couple times and it's the movement of my

             11    leg --

             12         Q.   Okay.

             13         A.   -- my ankle going up and down --

             14         Q.   Are you using --

    14:27:04 15         A.   -- is uncomfortable.

             16         Q.   Okay.

             17         A.   And I have -- I use snaps-on just --

             18         Q.   I was -- That was my next question.  I was

             19    like, Are you --

    14:27:10 20         A.   I use snaps-on.

             21         Q.   -- actually snapping in or are you --

             22         A.   I snap -- snap it in and --

             23         Q.   Okay.

             24         A.   -- and I was terrified --

                                                                          90




              1         Q.   Oh, yeah because you have to --

              2         A.   I was terrified.  It just -- I --

              3         Q.   Because if you stop --

              4         A.   Yeah.

    14:27:21  5         Q.   -- and you can't get out --

              6         A.   Exactly.

              7         Q.   -- you're -- you're all set.

              8         A.   I was terrified --

              9         Q.   Right.

    14:27:23 10         A.   -- because subconsciously it's like, you know,

             11    My ankle, my ankle.  Next day I go out, I'm all gung-ho

             12    because this is what I enjoy to do and then -- then when

             13    I snap on, it is a fear factor, you know what I mean?

             14         Q.   Yes.

    14:27:37 15         A.   And then -- then -- Then I could feel it.  I

             16    go, Man, this is uncomfortable.  Then I just coast it

             17    somewhere and not just immediately --

             18         Q.   Right.

             19         A.   -- snap off and hurt myself.

    14:27:48 20              I'm afraid that I'm going to reinjure my

             21    ankle.

             22         Q.   Okay.

             23         A.   That's what it boils down to.

             24         Q.   Okay.

                                                                          91




              1         A.   I don't want to reinjure this ankle.

              2         Q.   Okay.

              3         A.   So preventing -- preventing that is my number

              4    one priority.

    14:28:00  5         Q.   Gotcha.

              6              Aside from the tennis, the jogging, the

              7    biking, any other activities that you have trouble doing

              8    or cannot do now as a result of this accident that you

              9    could do before?

    14:28:12 10         A.   Those are -- those were my three favorite

             11    hob- -- Those are my three favorite sports.

             12         Q.   Okay.

             13         A.   During the winter, the cold, it -- it plays

             14    havoc on my foot/ankle and -- very uncomfortable for me

    14:28:32 15    during those months.

             16         Q.   Are you currently back to working normal --

             17    your normal hours?

             18         A.   Yes.  Yes, I am.

             19         Q.   Okay.  And, I guess, when was the first time

    14:28:38 20    you went back to working your normal hours?

             21         A.   Last -- last week -- Last week I had a call

             22    for Naansense.

             23         Q.   The restaurant.

             24         A.   Yeah.

                                                                          92




              1         Q.   Not nonsense like the word.

              2         A.   Yeah.

              3         Q.   Like double A.

              4         A.   That's one of my clients.

    14:28:54  5              Right.  Exactly.

              6         Q.   Yeah.

              7         A.   Good food too.

              8         Q.   And that was the first time you went back to

              9    full-time work?

    14:29:00 10         A.   No.  I mean, before that I've gone back,

             11    but...

             12              Are you saying gone back right after my --

             13    When are you asking...

             14         Q.   I'm asking when was the first time --

    14:29:10 15         A.   Okay.

             16         Q.   -- after the accident.  Because I know after

             17    the accident, you're saying that there's been times

             18    where you couldn't -- you couldn't make certain --

             19         A.   Oh.

    14:29:15 20         Q.   -- service calls.

             21         A.   Right.

             22         Q.   Right?

             23         A.   Right.

             24         Q.   And then you get the therapy, you get the

                                                                          93




              1    surgery, you still can't make certain --

              2         A.   Right.

              3         Q.   -- service calls.

              4         A.   Right.

    14:29:20  5         Q.   When was the first time that you could make

              6    all your service calls?

              7         A.   When was the first time?  Let's see.  Surgery.

              8              Well, I was doing it sporadically.  But to --

              9    to start picking up steam, I'm not sure of dates, but I

    14:29:39 10    remember -- I had no choice.  I really had no choice.

             11    It was either that or drown in bills, you know what I

             12    mean?  It was either that or drown in bills.

             13              So I started taking them all with Fuentes --

             14    Fuentes Restaurant, Naansense, Naf Naf, one of my

    14:30:00 15    clients, Carson's Ribs were one of my clients.  I mean

             16    all those...

             17         Q.   I'll go through those.

             18         A.   Yeah.

             19         Q.   But in terms of -- I'm just trying to figure

    14:30:06 20    out a ballpark figure -- a ballpark range of when you --

             21    back to working again, back to working --

             22         A.   Well, I'd say about --

             23         Q.   -- full time?

             24         A.   After -- Maybe a couple months after that, a

                                                                          94




              1    month after.  After April --

              2         Q.   When you say "after that," you're --

              3         A.   After April.

              4         Q.   -- referring to...

    14:30:22  5         A.   My rehab, correct.

              6         Q.   Okay.  After April of which year?

              7         A.   2017, I mean.

              8         Q.   20- --

              9         A.   I'm sorry.  2018.

    14:30:29 10         Q.   Okay.

             11         A.   Or -- What year are you speaking of?  2018.

             12         Q.   Well, I'm asking you.

             13         A.   Okay.  2018.

             14         Q.   Okay.

    14:30:36 15         A.   2018 because my surgery was in 2017.

             16         Q.   Right.

             17         A.   Okay?

             18              So after the rehab in April of 2018, then from

             19    there on I just took off.

    14:30:45 20         Q.   You're back to full time?

             21         A.   Yeah, yeah.  Yes.

             22         Q.   You're good to go, not missing out on

             23    contracts, not missing out on service calls?

             24         A.   Well, no.  There was -- Because of this, there

                                                                          95




              1    were some contracts that I lost at the beginning -- At

              2    the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018 I lost

              3    contracts.

              4         Q.   Right.  I'll -- I'll get to those --

    14:31:05  5         A.   Okay.

              6         Q.   -- because those are during the time that you

              7    could not work --

              8         A.   Right.

              9         Q.   -- full time.

    14:31:09 10         A.   Right.

             11         Q.   Right.

             12         A.   Exactly.  Okay.

             13         Q.   I'm just saying that you said a few --

             14         A.   I was able to --

    14:31:12 15         Q.   After that April date --

             16         A.   I was able.

             17         Q.   -- you were able to go full time?

             18         A.   Yes, yes.

             19         Q.   Okay.  Because what I have to figure out is

    14:31:16 20    what --

             21         A.   Gotcha.

             22         Q.   -- window of work --

             23         A.   Gotcha.

             24         Q.   -- you're really missing.

                                                                          96




              1         A.   I see.

              2         Q.   So I can at least mark my end point at that

              3    April time --

              4         A.   I see.  I see.

    14:31:21  5         Q.   -- right?

              6         A.   Right, right.

              7         Q.   Okay.

              8         A.   Okay.

              9         Q.   All right.  So now we can dive on into this

    14:31:30 10    wage loss.  I'm still on schedule.

             11              The wage loss that you mentioned, I believe,

             12    was in your answer to interrogatory number 9.  It's on

             13    the first page of this document (indicating).  It's on

             14    this -- that one (indicating).

    14:31:42 15         A.   Yes.

             16         Q.   The other.  Or you can look at that

             17    one (indicating).  That one (indicating) might be better

             18    because it was --

             19         A.   Okay.

    14:31:47 20         Q.   -- more recent.

             21         A.   More recent.

             22         Q.   You mentioned wage loss is undetermined.  I

             23    guess I should read the whole answer:  Plaintiff was

             24    self-employed as a maintenance technician with a

                                                                          97




              1    specialty for the creation of pita ovens along -- among

              2    many other physical skilled labor abilities.  And it

              3    says, Wage loss is undetermined.  Plaintiff was unable

              4    to fill -- to fulfill a contract with Naf Naf that would

    14:32:11  5    have been a two-year contract for $236,800 per year to

              6    service 16 restaurants.  There was also a contract for

              7    35 pita ovens.

              8              And then it mentions the opportunities that

              9    you missed out on.  So we're going to go through this

    14:32:25 10    piece by piece.  So the first thing that you mention is

             11    that you were unable to fulfill a contract with Naf Naf

             12    that would have been a two-year contract for $236,800

             13    per year to service 16 restaurants.  That

             14    200-thousand-dollar figure, that's for all the 16

    14:32:43 15    restaurants?

             16         A.   Actually that figure is wrong.

             17         Q.   Okay.  And what's wrong about it?

             18         THE WITNESS:  Is there any way I can pull that...

             19         MR. ADELMAN:  Reference the document.  If you want

    14:32:56 20    to reference the exhibits you have, yes.

             21         THE WITNESS:  Okay.

             22    BY MR. SUN:

             23         Q.   Yeah.  There's documents at the back of this

             24    that...

                                                                          98




              1         A.   Let's see.  Okay.  Yeah.  There we go.

              2              Well, that -- that particular one, I don't see

              3    it in here.

              4         Q.   The 286,000 or --

    14:33:10  5         A.   Yeah.

              6         Q.   -- 236,000 one?

              7         A.   Right.

              8         Q.   Okay.

              9         A.   I don't see it in here.  I could reference off

    14:33:19 10    of that, but I don't see it in here.

             11         Q.   Okay.  So when you say that that number's

             12    wrong --

             13         A.   Yeah.

             14         Q.   -- are you saying it just doesn't exist at

    14:33:23 15    all, or...

             16         A.   Well, what I'm saying is it was -- it was $925

             17    per store -- I want to say it was a total of 16 stores

             18    to be paid every month.  So I believe that came to

             19    $14,800.  You multiply that by 12.  I believe that

    14:33:55 20    figure comes to $177,000 and it was a two-year contract.

             21    So 177,000 multiplied by that -- by 2, it's $355,000.

             22    That was one that I lost.

             23         Q.   Okay.

             24         A.   So that figure that -- The 236,000 is

                                                                          99




              1    incorrect.

              2         Q.   Okay.  In terms of this contract that you

              3    lost, did you have that contract in place at the time of

              4    your accident?

    14:34:21  5         A.   Yes.  It was -- It was provided to me.  I sent

              6    in the contract and unfortunately I -- I was not able to

              7    obtain it due to my surgery.  And they wrote a letter

              8    stating why I -- why I lost the contract because I could

              9    not perform -- I could not perform my work.

    14:34:47 10         Q.   Okay.  I'm just curious.  In terms of getting

             11    this business, right, from Non- -- this is Naf Naf?

             12         A.   Yes, that's correct.

             13         Q.   Okay.  In terms of getting this business from

             14    Naf Naf, were you required to submit like a bid sheet?

    14:35:02 15         A.   No.  No, actually I -- I was not.  I -- They

             16    purchased an oven from me.  They purchased an oven from

             17    me and they were very delighted with my oven.  It was --

             18    very happy with this oven, and...

             19              Which one are we talking about?

    14:35:21 20         Q.   Just still on the first part.

             21         A.   Okay.

             22         Q.   Just the 236,800.

             23         A.   Yeah.  No, I was not required because I've

             24    already provided services for him.

                                                                         100




              1         Q.   Okay.  So there was never a bid sheet or a

              2    proposal detailing $925 per store for 16 stores --

              3         A.   No.

              4         Q.   -- per month, there -- this was not in

    14:38:05  5         Q.   And so the servicing of the Naf Naf Grill

              6    equipment was different from the purchasing of the pita

              7    grills?

              8         A.   That's correct.

              9         Q.   Okay.  Those are --

             21    were able to do this.  I go, Yes.

             22         Q.   Okay.  And it looks like you did deliver 10

             23    out of the -- a purchase of 35?

                                                                         104




              1    ten.  If you read, I was to deliver ten by January the

              3         Q.   Uh-huh.

              4         A.   And I -- I didn't -- I didn't get them all

             14    purposes of this lawsuit that that was because of your

    14:39:22 15    injury?

             17         Q.   Okay.  To manufacture these ovens?

             19         Q.   And you were manufacturing these ovens by

    14:39:26 20    hand?

             21         A.   Yes.  With brakes, unique brakes.  They're

             22    hydraulic presses that bends the metal.  You form it --

             23         Q.   Okay.

             24         A.   -- and you put it together.

              1         Q.   Okay.

              2         A.   Then they wound up purchasing ovens from

              4         Q.   Understood.

    14:39:45  5              And each oven cost 14,000 --

              6         A.   Yes.

              7         Q.   -- 800 is what you were charging for?

              8         A.   They -- They come with a five-year warranty

              9    and nobody gives you that.  But because I -- Because I

    14:39:55 10    put my name behind these ovens, I guarantee that.

             11         Q.   How much does it cost you to make one of these

             12    ovens?  I know you're charging 14,8- --

             13         A.   Right.

             14         Q.   -- but how much does it cost you to make them?

             22    selling ovens to anybody else?

             23         A.   Pardon me?

             24         Q.   Were you selling --

              1         A.   I never -- Well, I never had the opportunity

              2    to do that because of my -- this incident.  I had to --

              3    I had to stop -- stop dead in my tracks.

              4         Q.   Okay.  In terms of this February 25th, 2018

    14:40:35  5    letter from Mr. Burger, it lists a view invoice --

    14:40:43 10         Q.   These were jobs that you did do?

             11         A.   These were the -- This is how it all started.

             12    These were ovens that they bought from New York.

             13         Q.   Uh-huh.

             14         A.   Ovens that --

             18         A.   Yeah, that sucked.  Exactly.

             19         Q.   Right.

    14:40:55 20         A.   So here he is, he's paying me this money to

             21    prepare a brand-new oven.  He goes, Why am I paying you

             22    this money for a brand-new oven?  I go, Well, you're

             23    going to have to take that up with the manufacturer.

             24         Q.   Right.  Okay.

                                                                         107




              1         A.   And --

              2         Q.   But those dates of service, you --

              3         A.   Yes.

              6         Q.   Okay.

              7         A.   I did --

              8         Q.   So you worked on --

              9         A.   -- those.

    14:41:12 10              Right.

             11         Q.   -- all of those?

             13         Q.   Okay.

             14         A.   You know what I mean?

    14:41:14 15         Q.   These weren't dates that Maribel did them --

             16         A.   Right.

             17         Q.   -- and you charged -- or you --

             18         A.   Well, no.  She was with me.

             21         Q.   Okay.

             22         A.   And that could be verified by the employees

             23    when they saw me with my crutches and Maribel there.

             24    They just -- I had -- I had to do it.  You know, I

                                                                         108




              1    wanted that contract so bad.  You know what I mean?

              2    If -- If I don't go out and do this, they're...

              3         Q.   So some of these are just replacing, it looks

              4    like, certain parts of the oven?

    14:41:44  5         A.   Yeah.  But this is a -- This is a brand-new

              6    oven.  It's not even a month old.  Not -- Not a month

              7    old.

              8         Q.   All right.  I understand.

              9         A.   And when I told Elan, he says, Can you -- Can

    14:41:56 10    you believe this?  I got a brand-new oven that I paid

             11    it's not functioning?  And he said, Manny, he says, Can

             12    you do something for me?  I said, Oh, yeah.  I can

             13    repair it, but I'm -- I want to inform you that this --

             14    this is a poorly designed oven.  And then he -- Then he

    14:42:14 15    said, Well, who do you know -- I said, I can make one

             16    for you.  And then when -- He looked at me, he goes, Are

             17    you kidding me?  I go, No.  I can build one.  I can

             18    design and build one for you.  And when I did, he was

             19    just -- he was astonished.  He had no idea that I

    14:42:30 20    possessed these skills.

             21         Q.   Okay.  Okay.  And so this was the proposal

             22    that was the -- no longer considered for the proposal?

             23         A.   (Nodding.)

             24         Q.   Okay.

                                                                         109




              1         A.   Right.

              2         Q.   Okay.  So that -- That is the 236 -- which is

              3    the wrong number --

              4         A.   That's correct.

    14:42:47  5         Q.   -- for that first part?

              6         A.   Yeah.

              7         Q.   Okay.  And in the second sentence is, There

              8    was also a contract for 35 pita ovens, and we covered

              9    that as well?

    14:42:54 10         A.   Yes.  We just covered that as well.

             11         Q.   Okay.  Then the third part says, Plaintiff

             12    also missed out on other opportunities with -- and it

             13    lists Blackfinn Ameripub Restaurant?

             14         A.   Correct.

    14:43:04 15         Q.   And what opportunities did you miss out on

             16    with Blackfinn?

             17         A.   Well, continue business with them.

             18         Q.   Did you have this type of a proposal sheet for

             19    them as well?

    14:43:12 20         A.   Oh, I have -- I had one contract with them,

             21    but it didn't -- it didn't go that far.  So I'm not --

             22    I'm just saying I just lost service work.  I didn't go

             23    that far with that.

             24         Q.   Okay.  Is there a quantity or a dollar figure

                                                                         110




              1    that you're your claiming --

              2                       (Electronic notifier interruption.)

              3                       (Discussion off the record.)

              4    BY MR. SUN:

    14:43:42  5         Q.   So for Blackfinn Ameripub, I guess, what --

              6    what are we looking at dollar-wise that you're claiming

              7    that you lost as a result of this incident?

              8         A.   That -- that's -- I can't provide that

              9    because -- I can't provide that figure because it

    14:43:57 10    didn't -- I just lost the opportunities to -- to provide

             11    more service work for them had if I had been healthy.

             12         Q.   Okay.

             13         A.   I -- we -- I would have had a long-standing

             14    relationship had if I have not been -- not healthy.

    14:44:15 15         Q.   Okay.  Carson's Ribs of Deerfield, is that the

             16    same type of situation?

             17         A.   Same -- Same type of situation.

             18         Q.   We don't have like the contracts for that or

             19    anything?

    14:44:22 20         A.   No.  We did -- Again, I -- I did have

             21    contracts for them, but I had to stop, I had to stop

             22    because I -- I just couldn't continue.  You know, I'm

             23    not going to say, Hey, you know, I --

             24         Q.   So was -- I guess -- So was your contract

                                                                         111




              1    fulfilled, like for example with the contract for

              2    Carson's Ribs, you would have had some sort of servicing

              3    maintenance contract with them, correct?

              4         A.   Yes.  Yeah, I would have.

    14:44:41  5         Q.   So you would have fulfilled that contract or

              6    not?

              7         A.   I -- with -- With the -- hiring

              8    Ernie (phonetic), I did have a part-time worker.  I -- I

              9    would have gone over there -- No matter what it would

    14:44:52 10    have taken, I would have gone over there, crutches and

             11    all.  I would have made sure the work got done because

             12    that's what I did.  That's what I was doing.

             13         Q.   Okay.

             14         A.   But had if I had been healthy, the sky was the

    14:45:04 15    limit for this, you know -- the sky's the limit for this

             16    business I had.  This was -- This is a really, really

             17    good business that I had going.

             18         Q.   Okay.  So I guess, you know, I don't want to

             19    sound rude to you.

    14:45:15 20         A.   Sure.

             21         Q.   But I'm just trying to understand if -- if you

             22    had this contract with Carson's Ribs and you get a

             23    guy -- a helper person and you fulfill your contract,

             24    what -- what opportunity are you missing out on?

                                                                         112




              1    Because if you fulfilled the contract, per the terms of

              2    contract, and you did it all and everything's done

              3    correctly, what are you -- you know, you see what I'm

              4    trying to get at?

    14:45:34  5         A.   Right, right.  Well, first of all, I -- I have

              6    to find someone with my -- my talents to do this.

              7         Q.   Okay.

              8         A.   Okay?  And was not able to find someone with

              9    those skills that I possess to move forward with that.

    14:45:48 10         Q.   Okay.

             11         A.   So, therefore, I couldn't -- I couldn't move

             12    forward with -- I couldn't move forward with it because

             13    I wasn't in the best of health.

             14         Q.   Okay.  So you just didn't submit like a future

    14:46:00 15    maintenance contract basically?

             16         A.   No.  I mean I -- I did have one, but it was

             17    futile.  It was a futile effort.  Why am I going to try

             18    to force something and, you know what I mean?  And

             19    knowing that I can't do this job here with Carson's --

    14:46:15 20         Q.   Okay.

             21         A.   -- you know, just...

             22         Q.   So -- And is that the same kind with Blackfinn

             23    is that once the contract is up, you just didn't submit

             24    a new bid for it?

                                                                         113




              1         A.   No.  I might as well have the -- How can I say

              2    this?

              3              Might as well work with the ones I have.  I

              4    can't cover the entire field.

    14:46:28  5         Q.   Okay.

              6         A.   That was my attitude.

              7         Q.   So you voluntarily kind of limited the

              8    scope --

              9         A.   Yes.

    14:46:34 10         Q.   -- of your business based on your --

             11         A.   With Carson's --

             12         Q.   -- physical issues?

             13         A.   Yeah.  I -- I had no choice.  I had no choice.

             14         Q.   Okay.  And is that also the case with Taco

    14:46:45 15    Bell, KFC, and Naansense?

             16         A.   Basically, yes.

             17         Q.   Okay.  So for those three, again, Taco Bell,

             18    KFC, and Naansense, did you have any -- did you have any

             19    contracts or written --

    14:46:54 20         A.   No.

             21         Q.   -- agreements?

             22         A.   No, I didn't.

             23         Q.   Okay.

             24         A.   It could have gone farther.  Again, my health

                                                                         114




              1    did not allow me to go farther than what I would have

              2    loved to go.

              3         Q.   Okay.  You mentioned you missed out on 89,000

              4    in income from City Reflections Tavern?

    14:47:11  5         A.   That's correct.

              6         Q.   Okay.  And this was the e-mail from Christine

              7    Nelson that --

              8         A.   Mason.  Yes.

              9         Q.   Mason, right.

    14:47:19 10              And so that was her calculation for you --

             11         A.   Yes --

             12         Q.   -- is seems like --

             13         A.   -- that's correct.  Based on the work that she

             14    provided me, who, in turn, she had to hire other people

    14:47:32 15    to -- to do that type of work.

             16         Q.   Okay.  In terms of -- Oh, wait.  Here we go.

             17              You submitted some letters from recommendation

             18    from F & F, your previous, it looks like, employers.

             19         A.   Yes.

    14:47:45 20         Q.   Just to say that you were -- what you did and

             21    the hours that you worked, right?

             22         A.   Correct.

             23         Q.   Okay.  Aside from that, is there another

             24    purpose of submitting this?

                                                                         115




              1         A.   Just to show you that I've have the mechanical

              2    ability that --

              3         Q.   Okay.

              4         A.   -- that I'm a mechanic.  That's what I do.

    14:48:06  5         Q.   Gotcha.

              6         A.   That's what I do.

              7         Q.   So in terms of how your business is set up --

              8    let's say when -- I guess when you're entering into

              9    these contracts, you're entering into those contracts as

    14:48:18 10    Maintenance Professionals, correct?

             11         A.   Yes.

             12         Q.   Not as Manny Martinez?

             13         A.   Well, it's a self-proprietorship.  So I am the

             14    same person as this entity.

    14:48:26 15         Q.   Okay.

             16         A.   Same person.

             17         Q.   Is the -- Is the flow through of money

             18    100 percent?  So let's say you have a contract for, you

             19    know, 89,000, you fulfill that contract, you are -- you

    14:48:36 20    are getting the entire 89,000 or are there expenses,

             21    other things --

             22         A.   Well, there --

             23         Q.   -- for operating the company?

             24         A.   There's always expenses.  You got to buy

                                                                         116




              1    parts.  You got to buy parts.  And once the parts are

              2    paid for, well, then you subtract that part and I -- I

              3    use the -- my receipts, the invoices that I paid for

              4    that part and turn it in at the end of the year for tax

    14:49:06  5    purposes and that's -- that's how it's -- that's how

              6    it's done.  Turn in all my receipts.  Everything

              7    affiliated with Maintenance Professionals, I turn them

              8    in.

              9         Q.   Gotcha.

    14:49:18 10              So I want to show you, I guess we can mark

             11    these as Group Exhibit -- I don't even know what we're

             12    on at this point, 3?

             13         THE COURT REPORTER:  We're on 4.

             14         MR. SUN:  4.  Okay.

    14:49:23 15                       (Group Exhibit No. 4 marked as

             16                        requested.)

             17                       (Discussion off the record.)

             18    BY MR. SUN:

             19         Q.   All right.  Mr. Martinez, I'm going to show

    14:49:59 20    you what we marked as --

             21         A.   Sure.

             22         Q.   -- Group Exhibit 4.  These are tax returns --

             23         A.   Okay.

             24         Q.   -- that --

                                                                         117




              1         A.   You need this?

              2         Q.   She can -- She'll eventually be taking them.

              3         A.   Okay.

              4         Q.   So Group Exhibit 4 consists of tax returns for

    14:50:11  5    the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017?

              6         A.   Okay.

              7         Q.   Or at least --

              8         A.   Sure.

              9         Q.   -- parts of --

    14:50:19 10         A.   Okay.

             11         Q.   -- '16 and '17.

             12              So I just wanted to -- to confirm that because

             13    some of them say -- I don't think it actually says your

             14    legal name of Manuel Martinez, they say Manny Martinez I

    14:50:28 15    think on a few of them.

             16         A.   Well, yeah.  Everyone calls me --

             17         Q.   Okay.

             18         A.   -- Manny.

             19         Q.   Okay.

    14:50:31 20         A.   Manny's for Manuel.

             21         Q.   No.  That -- That makes sense.

             22         A.   Okay.

             23         Q.   But I just wanted to make sure in terms of

             24    looking at, you know, for example this 2014 one, in

                                                                         118




              1    terms of looking at the numbers --

              2         A.   Okay.

              3         Q.   -- for wages or income, it says, you know,

              4    44,539 --

    14:50:42  5         A.   Yeah.

              6         Q.   -- like, that's -- that's accurate, correct?

              7         A.   Yes.  To the best of my knowledge, it's

              8    accurate.

              9         Q.   Okay.  And then for 2015, for the total income

    14:50:52 10    line, I guess, it -- it states 9,168 --

             11         A.   Yes.  Yes, that's --

             12         Q.   -- and that's correct?

             13         A.   That's correct.

             14         Q.   Okay.  And then 2016, it shows, again, for

    14:51:00 15    the --

             16         A.   Yes.

             17         Q.   -- wages you have the 40,000?

             18         A.   That's correct.

             19         Q.   Flat?

    14:51:04 20         A.   Right.

             21         Q.   Okay.  And then in 2017, it looks like it

             22    drops down to the 6,200?

             23         A.   Yeah.

             24         Q.   And that was when you were injured?

              1         A.   Right, correct.

              2         Q.   Okay.

              3         A.   Okay.

              4         Q.   All right.  I'm not going to make you go

    14:51:20  5    through each page because, trust me, I hated tax law.  I

              6    hated everything about accounting.

              7              Okay.  And then just -- just for reference,

              8    I'm just going to refer to these.  You know what?  Let's

              9    mark it.  We might as well.  We'll mark these as a group

    14:51:34 10    exhibit, 5 --

             11         A.   Thank you.

             12         Q.   -- for -- for the letters from Naf Naf.

             13         A.   Yes.

             14         Q.   And I'll just state in the record, it's the

    14:51:39 15    December 26th, 2017 maintenance proposal --

             16         A.   Uh-huh.

             17         Q.   -- the February 25th, 2018 invoice letter --

    14:51:55 20    letter from doctor -- or from Mr. Burger --

             21         A.   That's correct.

             22         Q.   -- saying you're no longer a consideration?

             23         A.   Yeah.

              2         A.   Yeah.

              3         Q.   Okay.

              4                       (Discussion off the record.)

    14:52:07  5                       (Group Exhibit No. 5 marked as

              7    BY MR. SUN:

              8         Q.   I believe we've covered your wage lost now,

              9    correct?

    14:52:36 10         A.   Yes.

             11         Q.   All right.  Is there anything else about your

             12    wage loss that I have not talked to you about today, to

             13    this point?

             14         A.   Yeah, I think you -- we basically covered --

    14:52:49 15    covered everything then, that you brought -- brought to

             16    my attention.

             17         Q.   Okay.  And in terms of that wage loss,

             18    because, again, like I told you, I'm trying to get --

             19         A.   Right.

    14:52:58 20         Q.   What my job is to try to get a start point and

             21    an endpoint --

             22         A.   Sure.

             23         Q.   -- for when the wage loss begins versus when

             24    it ends.

                                                                         121




              1         A.   I understand.

              2         Q.   So when was the first time that you had to

              3    reject a service call after this accident?

              4         A.   Right after my -- after my surgery.  Even --

    14:53:15  5    Well, before my surgery.  Before my surgery, I -- I -- I

              6    try -- I tried to do some service calls, knowing that I

              7    was in pain.  I couldn't -- I couldn't do it prior to my

              8    surgery.  And then after my surgery, there were many --

              9    many calls that I took and a lot -- a lot more that I

    14:53:36 10    couldn't take.

             11         Q.   Okay.

             12         A.   You know...

             13         Q.   In terms of you running your company with

             14    service calls, with invoices, that type of thing, if a

    14:53:45 15    service call comes in or one of your restaurants calls

             16    you, says, Hey, we need you to come over, is there a

             17    document that's created to reflect that?

             18         A.   And it's called an invoice.

             19         Q.   Okay.

    14:53:54 20         A.   Yeah.  They sign off on it, you know.  I

             21    described the work I did and it shows the cost.

             22         Q.   Okay.  And --

             23         A.   And that's -- that's all -- That's all turned

             24    in at the end of the year for tax purposes.

                                                                         122




              1         Q.   It would be like the February 25th --

              2         A.   Yeah.

              3         Q.   -- 2018 letter in --

              4         A.   All those --

    14:54:12  5         Q.   -- Group Exhibit 5?

              6         A.   All those -- All those are on invoices.

              7    That's turned into the company.

              8         Q.   Okay.

              9         A.   Oh, yeah.

    14:54:19 10         Q.   Okay.

             11         A.   That's all turned in.

             12         Q.   Do you have copies of all of your invoices for

             13    the periods that you're claiming --

             14         A.   I have -- I --

    14:54:26 15         Q.   -- wage loss for?

             16         A.   Well, I -- I turned those in to the -- I might

             17    have -- I still might have those in my possession.

             18    Some -- Some are taken on my phone and then I scan them

             19    later, you know, but I have to have those for tax

    14:54:42 20    purposes.

             21         Q.   Could we get a copy of those?

             22         A.   I --

             23         Q.   Or could you send one to your attorney, or a

             24    copy of -- to your attorney and then -- for production?

                                                                         123




              1         A.   Which ones do you want?  I mean...

              2         Q.   It would be from 2016 -- or -- Let's just say

              3    from 2015 -- from when you started the company until

              4    April of 2018.

    14:55:00  5         A.   I can -- Let me dig -- dig in.

              6         Q.   Because it'll have to reflect, kind of --

              7    it'll go along -- Because your tax returns are for those

              8    years?

              9         A.   Yeah.

    14:55:05 10         Q.   And I know that you started your business --

             11         A.   Oh, yeah.

             12         Q.   And just to give you kind of a background --

             13         A.   Sure.

             14         Q.   -- of what we do is --

    14:55:11 15         A.   Yeah.  Okay.

             16         Q.   -- you know, I have to look at what you're --

             17         A.   Yeah, you --

             18         Q.   -- how much you're doing before the injury --

             19         A.   Right, right.

    14:55:14 20         Q.   -- versus how much you're doing after the

             21    injury.

             22         A.   Exactly.

             23         Q.   So...

             24         A.   Yeah, I understand what you're saying.  I -- I

                                                                         124




              1    just -- Yes.  Let me look into it.  Again, I -- I don't

              2    throw anything away.  So I should be able to provide

              3    that.

              4         Q.   Okay.  Perfect.

    14:55:26  5         A.   Now --

              6         Q.   Yes.

              7         A.   -- I did have an old iPhone that I scanned.  I

              8    took a lot of photos.

              9         Q.   Okay.

    14:55:33 10         A.   Because they want their copy and I got to have

             11    my copy.  So that iPhone no longer functions.

             12         Q.   Okay.

             13         A.   And I don't know if I can be able to provide

             14    those to you.

    14:55:43 15         Q.   Okay.  So some might be missing?

             16         A.   Because of this iPhone.

             17         Q.   Okay.

             18         A.   But...

             19         Q.   But you should have some -- like a lot of

    14:55:50 20    other ones still?

             21         A.   Oh, yes.

             22         Q.   Okay.

             23         A.   Absolutely.

             24         Q.   Okay.  See I'm -- I'm just concerned with

                                                                         125




              1    whatever you can -- you can give me.

              2         A.   Exactly.

              3         Q.   Okay?

              4         A.   Exactly.  Exactly.

    14:55:57  5         Q.   So I'm just going to ask --

              6         A.   Well, that's the only -- That's the only way I

              7    can file taxes.  I got to have that.

              8         Q.   Right.

              9         A.   I also have copies of parts and in- -- you

    14:56:05 10    know, you got to have that.  It's, you know...

             11         Q.   Good.  Okay.  No, no, that's good because --

             12         A.   Okay.

             13         Q.   -- that's -- because I -- I obviously have to

             14    see those to --

    14:56:12 15         A.   Yeah.  I understand.

             16         Q.   -- understand what your wage loss --

             17         A.   Sure, sure.

             18         Q.   -- really is.

             19         A.   I understand.

    14:56:16 20         Q.   So aside from the opportunities that you

             21    missed out that we discussed, any other opportunities

             22    that you missed out for -- workwise?

             23         A.   No.  That's -- That's all that -- that we

             24    covered and I covered, it sums it up.

                                                                         126




              1         Q.   Okay.  I just -- Because this is the only time

              2    that I get to talk to you directly.

              3         A.   I -- Right.  I -- That's --

              4         Q.   You know...

    14:56:37  5         A.   That's -- That's all that's relevant --

              6         Q.   Speak-now --

              7         A.   -- that's relevant.  Right.

              8         Q.   -- or-forever-hold-your-peace type thing.

              9         MR. ADELMAN:  Let him finish --

    14:56:40 10         THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.

             11         MR. ADELMAN:  -- then you talk.  One at a time.

             12    BY MR. SUN:

             13         Q.   You know, but that's the -- the end, these

             14    that we've gone over, that's it?  There's no other

    14:56:48 15    restaurants that you dealt business with that you're

             16    claiming you lost out on?

             17         A.   No.  That's -- That's all.

             18         Q.   Okay.

             19         A.   That's all.

    14:56:55 20         Q.   And, again, just to give you a background --

             21         A.   No.

             22         Q.   -- the only reason I ask that is I just don't

             23    want us to go to trial or go to somewhere else later

             24    on --

                                                                         127




              1         A.   Sure.

              2         Q.   -- and then you throw out a new restaurant

              3    name --

              4         A.   Well --

    14:57:03  5         Q.   -- that we didn't know about.

              6         A.   -- I mean, you know, like these invoices, I

              7    had so many clients.  It's hard to -- There's so many

              8    clients involved.  You know what I mean?  It -- You have

              9    a lot of mom-and-pop restaurants and they all play a

    14:57:18 10    vital part to my income, so...

             11         Q.   Just to go back to that pallet jack that hit

             12    you, do you remember what was on that pallet jack?

             13         A.   There was nothing on that pallet jack.

             14         Q.   It was empty?

    14:57:32 15         A.   It was empty.

             16         Q.   Was it one of those two-pronged pallet jacks?

             17         A.   That's correct.

             18         Q.   Okay.  Where it has, like, on the handlebar

             19    like that little --

    14:57:39 20         A.   Yeah, I believe.

             21         Q.   -- hydraulic --

             22         A.   That's --

             23         Q.   -- press thing?

             24         A.   That's what he had.

              1         Q.   Okay.  Was the gentleman pushing or pulling

              2    the pallet jack?

              3         A.   Pulling.

              4         Q.   Okay.

    14:58:07  5         MR. SUN:  I think that's all I've got.

              6         MR. ADELMAN:  Okay.  I just have a few questions

              7    for you.

              8                          EXAMINATION

              9    BY MR. ADELMAN:

    14:58:15 10         Q.   Was the gentlemen that was pulling the pallet

             11    jack, was he wearing an item of clothing that identified

             12    him as being a Walmart employee as well?

             13         A.   I -- I don't remember that.  I -- I can't -- I

             14    can't recall that.  I can't recall that.

    14:58:36 15         Q.   How would you describe the level of impact

             16    between light, medium, or heavy with the pallet jack in

             17    your left leg?

             18         MR. SUN:  Sorry.  Left foot.

             19         MR. ADELMAN:  Left foot, yeah.

    14:59:06 20    BY THE WITNESS:

             21         A.   I'd say heavy.

             22         Q.   As a result of the pallet jack coming into

             23    your foot, was your body moved at all?  I mean, was it

             24    with enough force that it caused your body to move?

                                                                         129




              1         A.   Yes.

              2         Q.   Did you say anything out loud when you were

              3    hit with the pallet jack?

              4         A.   Ouch.

    14:59:32  5         Q.   And do you recall if this individual

              6    apologized to you?

              7         A.   Yes.

              8         Q.   Okay.  Now, did this appear to be a store

              9    pallet jack?  I mean, this wasn't something that someone

    14:59:43 10    would have been able to bring from home to the store?

             11         A.   No.  This is a store pallet jack.

             12         Q.   When you went to the store two days later, did

             13    you see the woman that you were talking to at the time

             14    of the accident?

    15:00:08 15         A.   No, I did not.

             16         Q.   When you explained the incident that took

             17    place to -- that's in Exhibit 3 -- did the supervisor

             18    appear to be familiar, recall this incident that took

             19    place?  Did the supervisor say, Oh, yeah.  I recall

    15:00:37 20    speaking to Ms. Toledo.  She told me about that?

             21         A.   She did hear something of that nature, but

             22    nothing else was discussed.

             23         Q.   As you've said today, you believe that you

             24    have a specialized knowledge in creating these pita

                                                                         130




              1    ovens and these type of oven systems?

              2         A.   Yes, I do.

              3         Q.   Okay.  Do you know how many other people in

              4    the Chicagoland area have your level of knowledge and

    15:01:09  5    expertise?

              6         A.   Not very many.  There are -- There are people

              7    but not very many with the skills that I possess.

              8         Q.   And what was it about building these -- these

              9    machines that was difficult for you to do when you had

    15:01:29 10    this left foot injury?

             11         A.   Standing for long periods of time and applying

             12    my foot to -- to the metal that was bent in order to

             13    shape it.

             14         Q.   Could you have hired employees to do the

    15:01:55 15    building and you could have supervised this work?

             16         A.   No.  It takes a -- it takes a level -- It

             17    takes a special kind of person with this -- possess type

             18    of skill to -- to perform.  Not anyone can just do this

             19    type of work.

    15:02:21 20         MR. ADELMAN:  I don't have any further questions.

             21         MR. SUN:  Sorry.  Can I just get the question and

             22    answer before the expertise question, if that makes

             23    sense.

             24         THE COURT REPORTER:  Okay.

                                                                         131




              1         MR. SUN:  Because I think missed part of it.  It

              2    was something about Ms. Toledo.

              3                       (Record read as requested.)

              4                      FURTHER EXAMINATION

    15:03:19  5    BY MR. SUN:

              6         Q.   So I'm going to ask you about that.

              7              When you're talking to the manager, was that

              8    the manager that you talked to the two days after the

              9    accident or is this the black gentleman?

    15:03:32 10         A.   No.  It's the lady I spoke -- spoke with after

             11    that.

             12         Q.   So it was the...

             13         A.   Katen.

             14         Q.   Katen.

    15:03:41 15         A.   Yeah.

             16         Q.   Okay.  And Katen had mentioned that she had

             17    talked to Ms. Toledo about the accident?

             18         A.   She heard something -- she was -- She was

             19    aware, but the conversation didn't go any further than

    15:03:53 20    that.

             21         Q.   Okay.  And -- Okay.  In terms of -- I think

             22    Counsel asked you about the gentleman pulling the pallet

             23    jack.

             24         A.   Correct.

                                                                         132




              1         Q.   You mentioned that he apologized to you.

              2    Earlier I thought you had said that she -- he had

              3    apologized to Maribel.  I just want to make sure --

              4         A.   Well --

    15:04:12  5         Q.   -- he --

              6         A.   He -- He apologized to Maribel.  That -- We

              7    were both standing there, but Maribel -- Maribel told

              8    him to be careful and he apologized.  So he was looking

              9    at her.  So --

    15:04:24 10         Q.   Okay.

             11         A.   -- I can say it was -- it was her.

             12         Q.   Okay.  In terms of using that machine to build

             13    the ovens, you mentioned there's something that, like,

             14    bends the metal?

    15:04:35 15         A.   It's called the brake.

             16         Q.   Okay.  And how does that brake operate

             17    specifically?

             18         A.   It's -- It's a vertical machine and you put a

             19    sheet of metal, a 4-by-12 sheet, it's -- it's heavy, put

    15:04:55 20    it in.  You've already designated your measuring points

             21    where you want it to be bent, or in this case where it

             22    needs, it needs to be broke -- terminology -- slide it

             23    in there, press the button or a manual if -- if you

             24    don't want to be automated.  And then you pull it down

                                                                         133




              1    and it takes the metal and it bends.

              2         Q.   Okay.  So does using this machine require the

              3    use of your foot?

              4         A.   Yes.

    15:05:24  5         Q.   And how does it require the use of your foot?

              6         A.   Well, when I reach up, I have to, at times,

              7    stand on my tip -- tiptoes.  I have -- You know, I have

              8    to stand on my toes and move it around, constantly

              9    move -- move my -- my feet around in and position it.

    15:05:40 10    It's just not, you're standing in one direction.  You're

             11    constantly moving --

             12         Q.   Okay.

             13         A.   -- and going up and down with it as you

             14    see (indicating).  Because when it bends up, you got to

    15:05:50 15    reach up and then with one hand grab it and move it

             16    over.  Mind you, this is a very sharp metal that'll cut

             17    you.  So you've got to be extremely careful with this.

             18         Q.   How long does it take you to build one of

             19    these ovens?

    15:06:02 20         A.   It'd take me 4 to 5 days if I'm working 10 --

             21    10, 12 hours a day on it.

             22         Q.   Okay.  Okay.  I think that's all I have.

             23    Well, actually -- sorry -- one more.

             24              In terms of the -- the ovens, so you're

                                                                         134




              1    creating the exterior of the oven.  Are you creating the

              2    interior of it, everything as well, like the heating

              3    elements?

              4         A.   Yes.

    15:06:32  5         Q.   That's all --

              6         A.   Heating -- Yes.  Everything is built in-house.

              7         Q.   Okay.

              8         A.   Everything is built in-house.

              9         Q.   And are these electrical or propane, gas?

    15:06:38 10         A.   No.  These are gas, natural gas.  Natural gas

             11    ovens.  The only things that we -- I source out is the

             12    ceramic tiling, wheels, everything that is -- everything

             13    that's built in-house.  And -- And the valves, those

             14    were purchased outside too.

    15:06:56 15         Q.   Okay.

             16         A.   Yeah.

             17         Q.   But in terms of getting the gas to circulate

             18    properly --

             19         A.   Everything's (indecipherable) --

    15:07:00 20         Q.   -- that's all you?

             21         A.   That's all us.

             22         Q.   Okay.  And is that a part of your

             23    certification for the -- that steel certification --

             24         A.   Well -- No.

                                                                         135




              1         Q.   -- or the hydraulic certification?

              2         A.   No.  That's something that -- I also went to

              3    Ivy Tech.  I also went to Ivy Tech and had some

              4    schooling there as well.

    15:07:15  5         Q.   Okay.  So -- Because we had asked about that

              6    before --

              7         A.   Oh.

              8         Q.   -- but I don't think that was mentioned.

              9         A.   No.

    15:07:20 10         Q.   The -- You said Ivy Tech?

             11         A.   Yes.  I -- I went to Ivy Tech.

             12         Q.   And where is Ivy Tech?

             13         A.   Well, this one was in Evansville, Indiana.

             14    Evansville, Indiana.

    15:07:32 15         Q.   Did you receive a certification for it?

             16         A.   No.  It was a course.  It was -- It was a

             17    course I took and I -- that's all I needed for that

             18    particular course and it was --

             19         Q.   It was like an oven building course?

    15:07:44 20         A.   No.  It was a design and building course

             21    because you got to have -- you got to have design.  You

             22    got to know how to fabricate.  So you -- you need -- You

             23    need that to help you -- guide you.  You got to

             24    understand the -- the numbers involved shapes and sizes,

                                                                         136




              1    so...

              2         Q.   Okay.

              3         A.   But I took that and that -- I took that

              4    course.

    15:08:07  5         Q.   That makes sense.

              6         MR. SUN:  All right.  I think that's all I have at

              7    this time.

              8         MR. ADELMAN:  Okay.  Great.  It's federal court.

              9    So I can't reserve.  So, I mean.  It's automatic

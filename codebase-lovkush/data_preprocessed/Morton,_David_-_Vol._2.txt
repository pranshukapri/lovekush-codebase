 5              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are now on the
 6   record.  The date today is June 28, 2018, and the
 7   time is approximately 9:33 a.m.  This is day two of
 8   the video-recorded deposition of David Morton.  The
 9   witness has previously been sworn in.  Counsel, you
10   may proceed.
11              MR. HOOVER:  Thank you.
12   
13   REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. HOOVER:
14        Q.    Good morning, Mr. Morton.  Good to see you
15   again.
16        A.    Good morning.
17        Q.    We're here to finish up today for your
18   deposition, and I think when we left on Tuesday, I
19   kind of gave you a road map of what's going to happen
20   today.  I'm going to finish up my time with Groton
21   Refrigeration and your father's business and your
22   work there, and then some other folks here in the
23   room may have some questions for you.  Some folks on
24   the phone may have some questions for you.  But kind
0258
 1   of, again, the same rules as Tuesday.  If there's
 2   anything that I ask that you don't understand or
 3   doesn't seem clear, just let me know, and I'll
 4   rephrase it for you.  Fair enough?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And there you go.  Responses have
 7   to be verbal.  But, again, if you need a break at any
 8   time, just let us know.  Okay?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    Okay.  Between Tuesday and this morning,
11   did you do anything to prepare for today?  Review
12   anything?  Talk to anybody, aside from your attorney?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    Okay.  I understand -- did you have some
15   treatment yesterday?  Did you have a medical
16   appointment yesterday?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    Okay.  And how are you feeling today?  Are
19   you okay to continue?
20        A.    Good so far.
21        Q.    Okay.  Good enough.  One of the things I
22   will later on today is probably get into your medical
23   diagnosis and treatment.
24        A.    Yeah.
0259
 1        Q.    But we'll move on, at least right now, to
 2   Groton Refrigeration.  And we spoke briefly about it
 3   on Tuesday.  That was the business that your father
 4   started sometime, as I understand it, in the 1940s?
 5        A.    Correct.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And at one point, he was kind of
 7   employed by Fort Devens as a refrigeration engineer,
 8   correct?
 9        A.    Correct.
10        Q.    And then he also started his own business,
11   Groton Refrigeration, where he would do some
12   commercial and residential work kind of on the side,
13   right?
14        A.    Correct.
15        Q.    All right.  And he retired in 1965-ish?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Okay.  And he retired from the Fort Devens
18   stuff?
19        A.    Fort Devens.
20        Q.    Right.  But continued Groton
21   Refrigeration?
22        A.    Correct.
23        Q.    And he did that up until the time of his
24   passing in 1971?
0260
 1        A.    Yes.  Correct.
 2        Q.    And then the business kind of folded in
 3   '72, but from that '71 to '72 time frame, that's kind
 4   of when you were --
 5        A.    Winding down.
 6        Q.    Right.  Wrapping up the business, correct?
 7        A.    Correct.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So you indicated, I think, on
 9   Tuesday that you began helping your father out maybe
10   on evenings and weekends around the age of 10?
11        A.    Correct.
12        Q.    All right.  So that would have been about
13   1950?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Okay.  Did you help your father while he
16   was performing work here at Fort Devens?
17        A.    Not for Fort Devens.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    He would -- in other words, he was like a
20   subcontractor that would bid off on certain
21   projects that the government wanted done.  I did not
22   work for Fort Devens or the government in any manner.
23        Q.    Okay.  But if your father would bid on a
24   job for Fort Devens, he might get it, and you might
0261
 1   be helping your father --
 2        A.    Correct.
 3        Q.    -- perform work, correct?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And the work that your father was
 6   doing for Fort Devens -- I'm kind of like breaking it
 7   into two areas.  One would be the Fort Devens work,
 8   and then a separate might be the stuff he might do on
 9   the side, right?  Is that kind of how his business
10   ran?
11        A.    We only took care of really two -- the NCO
12   Club and the Officers Club.  Those -- which were sort
13   of separate.  They had separate managers.  In other
14   words, the government didn't really run those.  So,
15   yes, I worked at those two areas.
16        Q.    The NCO Club and the Officers Club?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    Was there any other areas or any other
19   projects that your father did for Fort Devens that
20   you were involved in, aside from working at the NCO
21   Club or the Officers Club?
22        A.    I was basically performing that work for
23   Groton Refrigeration.
24        Q.    Okay.
0262
 1        A.    Groton Refrigeration had the subcontract.
 2        Q.    Gotcha.
 3        A.    If that makes sense.
 4        Q.    It does.  So your father as Groton
 5   Refrigeration --
 6        A.    Right.
 7        Q.    -- would get the bids or the projects for
 8   the Fort Devens?
 9        A.    Correct.
10        Q.    And then as I understand it, those
11   particular projects were essentially -- were they
12   limited to the NCO Club and the Officers Club?
13        A.    No.  No.
14        Q.    They would be --
15        A.    These were owned by Fort Devens, whether
16   -- some of the mess halls.  There was more than one
17   mess hall, so he --
18        Q.    Go ahead.
19        A.    -- he would bid off on certain work that
20   had to be done.
21        Q.    All right.  Well, let's try it this way.
22   With respect to Fort Devens, what particular jobs or
23   what particular sites do you recall assisting your
24   father as part of his work in conjunction with Fort
0263
 1   Devens?
 2        A.    Could you rephrase that?
 3        Q.    Sure.  Yeah.  I'm trying to envision here
 4   that what happens is your father -- bids go off in
 5   Fort Devens for refrigeration work?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    Your father, as Groton Refrigeration, puts
 8   in for particular jobs, correct?
 9        A.    Correct.
10        Q.    All right.  And some of them he may be
11   awarded, correct?
12        A.    Correct.
13        Q.    All right.  And some of those, I want to
14   know which ones he was awarded that you went and
15   assisted him.  Does that make sense?
16        A.    Yeah.  Just on Fort Devens?
17        Q.    Just on Fort Devens.  Right.
18        A.    It was -- the plant is not there anymore.
19        Q.    Uh-huh.
20        A.    But it was a cold storage plant that
21   received the beef from railroad cars.  So we would do
22   some work at those.
23        Q.    Okay.  So -- go ahead.  Were there others?
24        A.    That was the main one that I remember.
0264
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    That was one of the big ones.
 3        Q.    Okay.  With respect to the -- you and your
 4   father's work at the cold storage plant at Fort
 5   Devens, do you recall what particular type of work
 6   you were doing at the storage plant?
 7        A.    As the railcars came in, there was a bunch
 8   of hooks that rode on a track.  So they were going to
 9   dissemble that facility.
10        Q.    Uh-huh.
11        A.    So my main was to disassemble these
12   tracks, and they were done in sections and bolted,
13   and, you know, you undo the bolt, take the track out.
14   So there was a lot of mechanical.
15        Q.    So they were in the process of, what?
16   Dissembling the storage plant?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    Okay.  And how old do you think you were
19   when you went to help your father disassemble this
20   storage plant?
21        A.    I'm going to say 15, 16 years old.
22        Q.    Okay.  And how long were you working with
23   your father to help disassemble this storage plant?
24   How long did that project take?
0265
 1        A.    That was almost a month's project.
 2        Q.    So if you were 15 or 16, that might have
 3   been, like, 1955, '56 time frame?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    And was this in the summer, like, between
 6   school years, or when did this project take place?
 7        A.    A lot of it was weekends, whether it was a
 8   summer or winter -- I think either fall, spring, or
 9   summer and fall.  I mean, I don't remember any major
10   snowstorms or anything like that.
11        Q.    Okay.  And then as I understand, your role
12   here was essentially to kind of disassemble these
13   tracks.  Were they made out of metal?
14        A.    They were made out of metal, yes.
15        Q.    And the hooks -- I assume you hook on a
16   side of meat, and it comes off the train?
17        A.    Yeah, exactly.
18        Q.    So this was essentially just kind of,
19   like, scraping the metal tracks and the hooks and all
20   that?
21        A.    That job, yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  Aside from that, do you have any
23   memory of any other particular work that you did with
24   your father specifically here at Fort Devens?
0266
 1        A.    Yes.  Because Fort Devens was starting to
 2   close things down and downsize.  Put it that way.
 3        Q.    Uh-huh.  Yeah.
 4        A.    So they were closing some mess halls,
 5   which we would de-assemble.
 6        Q.    And what was your role in assisting with
 7   the disassembly of these mess halls?
 8        A.    Basically, a lot of it was pumping the
 9   units down and cutting of pipes so that the
10   refrigeration unit could be removed.
11        Q.    When you say pumping units --
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    -- down, what kind of units are you
14   talking about?
15        A.    Refrigeration units.
16        Q.    Uh-huh.
17        A.    They had a canister, which was called a
18   receiver, and it had a series of valves on it.  You'd
19   close the valve down, run the compressor, and it
20   would store the gas in the receiver so you didn't
21   discharge the gas into the air.
22        Q.    Okay.  And how long of a process would
23   that take to close the valves -- close the valves on
24   the receiver and then once you run the compressor to
0267
 1   basically store the gas in there?
 2        A.    Yeah.  Then, as I say, you cut everything
 3   free.
 4        Q.    Yeah.
 5        A.    Obviously, the compressor, electric motor
 6   was involved.  That was all -- you could remove that
 7   as one unit.
 8        Q.    When you say "it," you mean the
 9   compressor?
10        A.    The whole unit you could remove.  It was a
11   compressor, receiver, condenser, motor.  Those were
12   all bolted onto a frame.
13        Q.    Okay.  So, again, this is more
14   disassembly, correct?
15        A.    Disassembling.
16        Q.    Okay.  So the first step would be kind of
17   to pump the units down?
18        A.    That was -- yeah, that was the big thing.
19        Q.    All right.  And then once the gas is
20   stored, you can then start to, as you say, cut the
21   pipes?
22        A.    Yeah.  Cut the pipes, and, obviously,
23   disconnect the electrical end of it to free the unit
24   up so the unit could be moved out as a unit.
0268
 1        Q.    Okay.  And as a unit, how big of a product
 2   are we talking?
 3        A.    I'm going to say two by three.
 4        Q.    Okay.
 5        A.    That's not exact.
 6        Q.    Sure.  Okay.  And the unit, you said,
 7   would include things like the motor, the condenser?
 8        A.    The whole, yes, shebang, you might say.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And then the unit, the whole
10   shebang, as you say, that's just removed as one
11   complete entity, correct?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    It could easily --
15        Q.    It could easily be taken out once you got
16   everything separated?
17        A.    Right.
18        Q.    The pipes that you had to cut, what kind
19   of pipes were those?
20        A.    Those were copper pipes.
21        Q.    And what kind of tools did you use to
22   remove the copper pipes?
23        A.    A tubing cutter in most cases.
24        Q.    Were there -- when you say "most cases,"
0269
 1   so would there be occasions when you wouldn't use
 2   that type of cutter?
 3        A.    Most of the time it was a tubing cutter.
 4   Other than that, occasionally -- because you could --
 5   there was not room, you'd have to use a hacksaw.  We
 6   didn't have the luxury of a reciprocating saw back
 7   then.
 8        Q.    Were any of these pipes -- these pipes
 9   that you were cutting, were any of them insulated in
10   any way?
11        A.    No, not -- very, very seldom.  Most of
12   them, because of the size, they were anywhere from
13   quarter-inch up to five-eighth to three-quarter-inch
14   tubing, and we didn't have to -- those did not have
15   to be insulated.
16        Q.    Were there tubing or piping in the areas
17   where you were working that were insulated?
18        A.    Not that I remember.
19        Q.    Okay.  And while you were doing this work,
20   I assume that there were other trades present helping
21   to disassemble these mess halls?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    What other types of trades were present
24   while you were helping to remove these units that
0270
 1   were also working in the mess halls?
 2        A.    Well, they were de-assembling and which --
 3   whether carpenters, you want to say, but to rip apart
 4   cabinets.
 5        Q.    Uh-huh.  Were there any sort of walls or
 6   interior structures being removed?
 7        A.    Usually my end of the work got done before
 8   that part of the process was started.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And these mess halls, are they just
10   one-story mess halls?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    Okay.  Were there any sort of furnaces or
13   boilers or anything in these mess halls?
14        A.    I don't remember any boilers.
15        Q.    Uh-huh.
16        A.    I'm not sure how they heated them.
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    Obviously, there had to be some type of
19   boiler, but I had nothing to do with that end of it.
20        Q.    Okay.  With respect to the mess hall
21   itself, how big of a building is this?
22        A.    I'm going to say at least 30 by 60.  I
23   mean, it was a fair-sized building.  I'm going to say
24   probably close to 5,000 square feet, and these are --
0271
 1   obviously, I didn't measure the buildings.  It's just
 2   an approximation.
 3        Q.    Sure.  Do you know approximately how old
 4   you were when you were doing this?  I know you were
 5   about 15 or 16 when the storage plants was
 6   disassembled.  What about the mess hall?  Do you
 7   know, was that before or after the storage plant?
 8        A.    As I say, I really don't remember whether
 9   I was 16 years old or whether I had a license at that
10   point in time.  I can't say.
11        Q.    Okay.  But around the same time that they
12   were taking --
13        A.    Around the same time.
14        Q.    Okay.  Would you know the manufacturer of
15   any of these units, the compressor units, that you
16   were disassembling to remove?
17        A.    Well, as I say, these were a separate
18   electric motor.
19        Q.    Uh-huh.
20        A.    And the big ones that I remember working
21   with was either GE or Westinghouse.
22        Q.    And when you say "that," is that as it
23   pertains to the motor portion?
24        A.    The motor portion.
0272
 1        Q.    Okay.  Now, would you have any information
 2   in terms of when these motors were originally
 3   installed in the mess hall?
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    And would you have any information in
 6   terms of whether or not there had been any prior
 7   repairs or maintenance on these particular motors
 8   before you went to remove them?
 9        A.    Only because -- yes.  Meaning, you had to
10   have some type of maintenance, usually within a year.
11   I mean, I'm not sure -- because these were taking
12   care of their daily work on -- post engineers in the
13   refrigeration end of it.  This was their job to keep
14   these units running.
15        Q.    Right.
16        A.    So I personally did not do the repairs,
17   but there had to be repairs.
18        Q.    Right.  Okay.  So you know that they were
19   done?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    But that's not something that you were
22   personally involved with?
23        A.    Correct.
24        Q.    Okay.  You talk about, you know, the
0273
 1   condenser being part of this unit as well, correct?
 2        A.    Correct.
 3        Q.    Do you know who the manufacturer of the
 4   condensers were?
 5        A.    Not the condensers.
 6        Q.    Okay.
 7        A.    They did not have a nameplate on them.  I
 8   mean, all they were is a steel canister depending on
 9   the size of the unit.  To what size that steel
10   canister was, it was probably, I'm going to say, a
11   quarter-of-an-inch steel that was, obviously, bent or
12   a canister, and then with a welded seam, and both
13   ends were welded, and then they had an inlet and an
14   outlet.
15        Q.    Okay.  What other particular -- I know
16   there's the electric motor that's part of this unit.
17   There's a condenser that's part of this unit.  The
18   receiver, is that also part of what you would call
19   this unit?
20        A.    That's part -- that was actually bolted to
21   the frame.
22        Q.    Okay.  And this receiver, do you know the
23   manufacturer of the receiver that you were removing?
24        A.    No, I would not.
0274
 1        Q.    Okay.  Are there any other component --
 2   major component parts of what we've been calling this
 3   unit aside from the electric motor, the condenser,
 4   the receivers that you're kind of getting ready to
 5   disassemble and remove?
 6        A.    The compressor.
 7        Q.    The compressor.  All right.  There you go.
 8        A.    You got to have that.
 9        Q.    Okay.  So the compressor is a major part
10   of this unit.  Yes?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    Okay.  And so your -- what kind of
13   interaction do you have with the condenser portion of
14   this unit to get it ready for removal, if anything?
15              MR. BECERRA:  Condenser or compressor?
16              MR. HOOVER:  I'm sorry.  Compressor.
17   We've got to change the names here.  Compressor.
18        A.    Well, no, because that was usually removed
19   as a unit --
20        Q.    Okay.
21        A.    -- along with the motor.
22        Q.    So there wasn't anything you needed to do
23   to the compressor as part of that removal process?
24        A.    As I say, it was removed as basically a
0275
 1   unit.
 2        Q.    Okay.
 3        A.    Not -- there were a few times the
 4   compressor and the motor were too heavy to remove.
 5   Then we removed the motor separately and the
 6   compressor separately.
 7        Q.    And in an instance like that, how do you
 8   do that?  Do you have to separate the motor from the
 9   compressor?
10        A.    You have -- no, because they were separate
11   units.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    Obviously, they were all bolted to this
14   frame.
15        Q.    Uh-huh.
16        A.    So the compressor had four bolts on it,
17   which you would have to, obviously, remove to free
18   that up.  But then it also had the valves that went
19   into this compressor.  There was an intake and a --
20   there was a low side and a high side.
21        Q.    Okay.
22        A.    So you had to remove those valves, and
23   there was gaskets that were involved and --
24        Q.    Okay.  And when you were removing the low
0276
 1   side and the high side valves from the compressor, is
 2   that something you had to do every time or when --
 3   you said on occasion?
 4        A.    Just when you had to separate the motor
 5   from the frame.
 6        Q.    Gotcha.  So if you didn't have to separate
 7   it from the frame, you wouldn't have to remove
 8   valves?
 9        A.    Right.  The valves usually stayed there.
10        Q.    Okay.  And when you were doing this work
11   on breaking down the mess halls, how often did you
12   have to actually remove valves versus it could all go
13   out as one unit?
14        A.    That was not a daily process.
15        Q.    Uh-huh.
16        A.    Obviously, once in a while.
17        Q.    And how many mess halls were you involved
18   disassembling?
19        A.    I'm going to say probably a half a dozen.
20        Q.    Okay.  And then in terms of these units
21   that we're talking about, how many units per mess
22   hall were there?
23        A.    Half a dozen.
24        Q.    All right.  So half a dozen.  So six times
0277
 1   six would be roughly 36 total?
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And then of the 36 roughly total
 4   we're talking about of these units, how many of those
 5   would you say you actually had to kind of remove
 6   valves in order to remove the entire unit?
 7        A.    Probably 50-50.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So about half of them would have
 9   required you --
10        A.    Because of the size.
11        Q.    Okay.  The compressors that you were
12   removing as part of the unit, do you recall who
13   manufactured those?
14        A.    Circumference.
15        Q.    Yeah.
16        A.    Copeland.
17        Q.    Yeah.
18        A.    Frigidaire.
19        Q.    Yeah.
20        A.    Let's see.  There was no air-conditioning
21   in those units.  So there would not be
22   air-conditioning.  I think did those were American
23   Standard and Carrier.  Carrier.
24        Q.    Carrier was one of the compressors?
0278
 1        A.    Yeah, but these -- these were units on
 2   air-conditioning, which that was not involved in
 3   the --
 4        Q.    The mess hall teardown?
 5        A.    -- the mess halls.
 6        Q.    Okay.  So in terms of the compressors that
 7   were involved in the mess hall teardown, it would be
 8   Circumference, Copeland, and Frigidaire?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    Okay.  In terms of the valves of the half
11   of them that you had to remove --
12        A.    Right.
13        Q.    -- do you know the manufacturers of the
14   valves?
15        A.    Those valves did not have a name on there
16   that I remember.
17        Q.    Okay.  And some of this work of removing
18   the valves, you said that there were gaskets
19   involved?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  Would you know the manufacturer --
22   well, strike that.
23       In removing these valves, did you have to remove
24   the gaskets?
0279
 1        A.    Because it was a teardown situation, no,
 2   because all this stuff was basically going to be
 3   scrapped.
 4        Q.    Right.  Okay.  So basically, the only
 5   reason you're removing a valve is to make the system
 6   -- be able to remove the system?
 7        A.    In this part of it, yes.
 8        Q.    Yeah.  Okay.  Any other work?  We talked
 9   about your disassembly in the cold storage?
10        A.    Yup.
11        Q.    We talked about you working on roughly a
12   half dozen mess halls, tearing -- helping to tear
13   them down.  What other work do you recall helping
14   your father at Groton Refrigeration at Fort Devens?
15        A.    Just the NCO Club and Officers Club.
16        Q.    Okay.  And so at the NCO Club, what kind
17   of work did you assist your father with?
18        A.    That was more on full maintenance,
19   repairs.  Anything that broke down where we got
20   called on.
21        Q.    All right.  And is this the same type of
22   thing for the Officers Club?
23        A.    Basically, yes.
24        Q.    Okay.  At the NCO Club, did you do any
0280
 1   sort of, like, new construction for them, or was
 2   this, again, all kind of maintenance, repair of
 3   existing units?
 4        A.    This was 90 percent just maintenance and
 5   repairs.
 6        Q.    Uh-huh.
 7        A.    Keeping things operating.
 8        Q.    Right.
 9        A.    Making sure we kept the vehicle.
10        Q.    Right.  What might the other 10 percent,
11   then, encompass?
12        A.    Occasionally, we would have to put in a
13   complete new unit.
14        Q.    Okay.  In case something couldn't be
15   repaired, correct?
16        A.    Well, they would replace some of these old
17   coolers, and when they did, they would, obviously,
18   put in something new.  Usually bigger and better.
19        Q.    Okay.  And the 90 percent maintenance,
20   repairs and 10 percent maybe, you know, replacement
21   of equipment, is that the same for the NCO Club as it
22   is the Officers Club?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    Okay.  And when would you say you first
0281
 1   went to work with your father at the NCO Club?
 2        A.    Oh, that was way back.  That was in the
 3   early '50s.
 4        Q.    And what type of equipment at the NCO Club
 5   do you recall helping your father maintain or repair?
 6        A.    Basically, the same as what was in the
 7   mess halls.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    They were the very same.
10        Q.    So we would have, what?  Kind of, like,
11   these -- we talked about these units, these
12   compressor units?
13        A.    Yes.  This was -- most of these here back
14   then in the early '50s, they would come as separate
15   units.  The late '50s, '60s, '70s, they started
16   coming with a sealed compressor.  Meaning, the motor,
17   the compressor would all be one.
18        Q.    And, again, forgive my ignorance, but
19   these compressor units, what are they utilized for in
20   the NCO Club?
21        A.    Keeping things cold.
22        Q.    Okay.  And does that run anywhere from
23   keeping the beer cold to keeping the club itself
24   cooled?
0282
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    All right.  So it will help for the
 3   refrigeration units where we're sticking the
 4   Budweisers?
 5        A.    Right.
 6        Q.    As well as the little AC unit that helps
 7   keeps the officers cool while they drink the
 8   Budweisers?
 9        A.    That's where American Standard would have
10   come in and -- because they were bigger on the
11   outside units refrigeration -- I mean,
12   air-conditioning units.
13        Q.    Okay.  And as part of your work with your
14   father of maintenance and repairs, would you also
15   work on, for example, the refrigerators that kept the
16   beer cold?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    And would you also, with your father, work
19   on the AC units that kept the club cool?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  And did your father, through his
22   company, ever do any, you know, heating work, for
23   example, on boilers and furnaces, or was it more on
24   the AC side?
0283
 1        A.    AC side.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Now, we talked about at the mess
 3   hall the work that you did in terms of tearing out
 4   these compressor-type units.  Let's stick with those
 5   units first.  What type of maintenance or repair work
 6   would have been done on those at the NCO Club?
 7        A.    Basically, the same.  I mean, preventing
 8   maintenance, you -- we had a portable air blower
 9   because dust was -- it was like a radiator when I say
10   "condenser."
11        Q.    Okay.  Yeah.
12        A.    That's the -- so you had to keep it clean
13   so the air would go through it to condense the gas.
14   So those would have to be cleaned on a -- we did it
15   on a monthly basis.
16        Q.    Okay.
17        A.    Because they did get dirty, and that was a
18   dirty process.  And while you were at it, you also
19   blew out the motors in and around the compressor to
20   keep things as clean as possible because when you had
21   to work on it, I mean, you didn't walk out of there
22   like a grease monkey.
23        Q.    Right.  Okay.  All right.  So one of the
24   things you had to do for maintenance of these
0284
 1   compressors is, again, just kind of keep them clean.
 2   Clean out the units, clean out motors.  When you say
 3   you blew them out, what would you utilize to do that?
 4        A.    We used a portable electric air blower
 5   that we used on a regular basis.
 6        Q.    And do you know who manufactured that?
 7        A.    No.  I would be guessing.
 8        Q.    Okay.  What other types of routine
 9   maintenance -- and when you and I on day two are
10   talking about the presses and the equipment of your
11   printing, we talked about maintaining things versus
12   repairing things?
13        A.    Right.
14        Q.    Were there -- what other sort of
15   maintenance might you do --
16        A.    That was the big monthly maintenance is
17   cleaning.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    As long as everything -- well, when you
20   did that, you also inspected the belts because that
21   was another big thing.  Because you had a separate
22   motor, a separate compressor.  You had to have it
23   driven by something.
24        Q.    Right.
0285
 1        A.    And it was belts.
 2        Q.    Okay.
 3        A.    There was usually either one, two, or
 4   three.
 5        Q.    Uh-huh.
 6        A.    So you would inspect the belts for cracks.
 7   They would only last so long before the rubber
 8   started breaking down, and you would have to replace
 9   those.
10        Q.    Okay.
11        A.    So that was a maintenance, but some of
12   them you found in the general inspection of the unit.
13        Q.    Right.
14        A.    Then you had dryers.  You had sight
15   glasses, expansion valves that would have to be once
16   in a while replaced because every once in a while
17   these units, because of the way the compressors were
18   designed, the front seal would leak a little bit.  So
19   you would have to add gas every once in a while.
20        Q.    Uh-huh.
21        A.    And you always -- you tried to purge your
22   gauges and stuff so no air or moisture would get in,
23   but on occasion, yes, moisture got in.
24        Q.    Okay.
0286
 1        A.    Then two things could take place.  Your
 2   dryer could freeze up and stop the gas flow.  That
 3   was pretty easy because you would just have to go by
 4   touch.  If the dryer was cold, you knew the thing was
 5   plugged up, or the expansion valve could freeze, and
 6   then you're getting no cooling on the evaporator.  So
 7   those two things had to be changed once in a while.
 8        Q.    Okay.  And so for maintenance, it looks
 9   like you kind of clean out it and you do a visual
10   inspection to make sure everything is operating --
11        A.    Correct.
12        Q.    -- as intended?  Both kind of by visual
13   and, like you said, you could -- if you needed to
14   touch the dryer, if you knew it was cold, you knew
15   there might be a little bit more going on there,
16   right?
17        A.    Correct.
18        Q.    Okay.  And then, obviously, if something
19   was going on, whether it be a dryer or something
20   along those lines, then you might make the necessary
21   repairs; is that fair to say?
22        A.    Correct.
23        Q.    Okay.  The compressor itself, that unit,
24   do you know who manufactured the one in the NCO Club?
0287
 1        A.    No, I do not.  Because the compressors,
 2   depending on how many BTUs that you needed --
 3        Q.    Uh-huh.
 4        A.    -- we would just replace a defective
 5   compressor with -- we had spares.
 6        Q.    Right.
 7        A.    And just because it was a Circumference
 8   compressor doesn't mean that we had to put that type
 9   of pump back on.
10        Q.    Gotcha.  It was more the BTUs that were --
11   that you kind of matched up?
12        A.    Yeah.
13        Q.    Gotcha.
14        A.    Just to match it up just like an electric
15   motor.  I mean, you matched up the horsepower.  You
16   matched up the shaft size because you're pulling it,
17   you know.  It had to go on a replacement.
18        Q.    Gotcha.
19        A.    So these units, whatever unit was there,
20   does not mean that was the unit that was on it when
21   it died or whatever.
22        Q.    Because it could be various combinations
23   of things?
24        A.    Because we had spares, whether electric
0288
 1   motor or compressors.
 2        Q.    Yeah.
 3        A.    Then we'd take that compressor back and
 4   rebuild it and repair it.
 5        Q.    Gotcha.  And then that could be, then,
 6   again, put back into service?
 7        A.    That could be put back into service, but
 8   as I say -- excuse me -- that's why I can't say it
 9   was a Copeland, you know, whatever.
10        Q.    Okay.  Gotcha.  And at the NCO Club, was
11   there just one compressor unit that kind of handled
12   the refrigeration?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    How many generally were there for the NCO
15   Club?
16        A.    There again, usually at least a half a
17   dozen.  I say a half a dozen because you had more
18   than one vehicle, and, you know, I don't remember
19   exactly how many coolers.
20        Q.    Right.
21        A.    I can only general -- I'm saying a half a
22   dozen.
23        Q.    Okay.
24        A.    It could be -- it could be five.  It could
0289
 1   be eight.
 2        Q.    And does each compressor then operate just
 3   one of these beer coolers?
 4        A.    Most of them was one.
 5        Q.    Gotcha.
 6        A.    And they had --
 7        Q.    And then now they also had
 8   air-conditioning for the club itself?
 9        A.    Correct.
10        Q.    And would the air-conditioning units have
11   separate compressors as well?
12        A.    Those were sealed units.  When I say
13   "sealed unit," the compressor and the motor was all
14   in one.
15        Q.    And that's for the AC units?
16        A.    For the AC.  And then you had a large
17   condenser fan motor on the AC units.  So those two
18   components really made up your AC unit except for the
19   electrical end of it.
20        Q.    And what was significant about the
21   electrical end of the AC unit?
22        A.    Well, you had to have a -- they were a
23   different type.  There was pressure switches.  There
24   were temperature switches.  Something would have to
0290
 1   tell that unit when to start and when to stop.
 2        Q.    Gotcha.  Yup.
 3        A.    And there were a different process.  You
 4   know, some used temperature from inside.  Some used
 5   pressure.  There were pressure switches, and there
 6   was temperature switches.
 7        Q.    Okay.  With respect to, like, for example,
 8   the beer coolers themselves, did you guys ever have
 9   to do maintenance or repairs on those particular
10   pieces of equipment?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    Okay.  And do you know the manufacturer of
13   any of these beer coolers that you --
14        A.    Not the beer coolers themselves.
15        Q.    Yup.
16        A.    Just a simple fact, once it was moved in
17   place, we didn't -- basically didn't disturb it.
18        Q.    Right.
19        A.    No.  I cannot say what the manufacturer
20   was.  I mean -- no, there was so many different ones.
21        Q.    Yeah.
22        A.    You know, I'm sorry.
23        Q.    It's okay.  And with respect to work that
24   you or your father may have performed on these
0291
 1   coolers, these beer coolers, what did that entail?
 2   What was the maintenance that you guys might do?
 3        A.    Actually, what we've gone through was
 4   almost the same thing.  I don't care if it was a beer
 5   cooler or whether it was a salad unit.
 6        Q.    Yeah.
 7        A.    It was the same maintenance.  The same
 8   procedures.  The only difference is one unit was
 9   maybe a little smaller.
10        Q.    Uh-huh.
11        A.    And the other unit had to be bigger
12   because of the size of the chest.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    That was the only difference.  If -- they
15   operated in the same manner.
16        Q.    Gotcha.  So if things like, you know,
17   having to blow things out?  Visual inspections?
18        A.    Correct.
19        Q.    Okay.  The compressor work that you did,
20   again, you said it was -- they helped to keep the
21   coolers cool as well as help to run the AC units; is
22   that correct?
23        A.    That's correct.
24        Q.    So the AC units at the -- at the NCO Club,
0292
 1   approximately, if you know, how many AC units were
 2   there for the club or was this, like, central air?
 3        A.    Usually it was central.
 4        Q.    Uh-huh.
 5        A.    It was so long ago, I do not remember how
 6   many units.
 7        Q.    Right.
 8        A.    They tried to do it as a central unit.
 9        Q.    Yeah.
10        A.    But some had smaller rooms.
11        Q.    Okay.
12        A.    And those would be done separately.  So
13   you could have had two.  You could have had three.
14        Q.    Gotcha.  And just kind of sticking with
15   the NCO Club, did you help your father perform any
16   sort of maintenance on these -- any of these units,
17   the AC units?
18        A.    Oh, yes.
19        Q.    Okay.  And what type of maintenance is
20   performed on these AC units?
21        A.    Because of the type of compressors that
22   was on the AC unit, it wasn't like the older
23   refrigeration units where the compressors were
24   separate, and so these were all a sealed unit.  So
0293
 1   you didn't get as much leakage of gas, I'm going to
 2   say, because there's no seal involved like there was
 3   on the older compressors.
 4       So other than an external leak, did you have to
 5   add any gas to the AC units.  The biggest part on the
 6   AC units, cleaning the condenser, blowing it out, and
 7   on those it had a large electric fan to circulate the
 8   air through the condenser.  Some of them had to be
 9   oiled.  Some of them had to be greased, and that was
10   on a monthly basis.  And some had to get replaced
11   because usually -- because those were out in the
12   weather, in the element.  Yeah.  They would break
13   down a little more, and so you had to maintain them.
14        Q.    Okay.  So kind of, again, we talked about
15   earlier maintenance is -- in this case, it's more
16   just kind of blowing out the condenser?
17        A.    That was the big thing on the
18   air-conditioners.
19        Q.    And that's just to kind of keep that dust
20   and debris that gathers to ensure efficiency?
21        A.    Get it out of there so the air can
22   penetrate.
23        Q.    Right.  Okay.  And then the other thing
24   you said, they would have these large electrical fans
0294
 1   that on a monthly basis you just kind of need to
 2   grease or to lubricate --
 3        A.    Yeah.
 4        Q.    -- again, for efficiency?
 5        A.    Yeah.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And this was something that you
 7   helped your father do?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Okay.  The manufacturer of the AC units,
10   do you remember who that was?
11        A.    Well, that was either American Standard --
12        Q.    Uh-huh.
13        A.    And now I'm drawing a blank.  There's one
14   more.  There's two of them.  I think I did mention
15   those earlier.
16        Q.    Okay.  And these units, aside from doing
17   this maintenance that you described, did you have to
18   perform any repairs to any of these units?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  What --
21        A.    The coil --
22        Q.    I'm sorry.  I was going to say what kind,
23   but you were about to say.  The coil?
24        A.    The coil is inside, which air passed
0295
 1   through, and that's where you got your cooling.
 2        Q.    Yeah.
 3        A.    So those had to be -- I didn't mention
 4   those on -- those would have to be cleaned out as
 5   well.  The filters would have to be cleaned out.
 6        Q.    Okay.
 7        A.    And those were all the same process of
 8   using the blower --
 9        Q.    Yeah.
10        A.    -- and blowing and cleaning those out.
11        Q.    To blow out the coils and the filters of
12   the AC units, did you have to disassemble the unit in
13   any way?
14        A.    You had to open up -- usually they had a
15   small door that you removed so you could get at the
16   filters and you could get at the evaporators to clean
17   them.
18        Q.    And so once you opened this small door,
19   you were able to get the portable compressed air --
20        A.    No, you don't -- you slid the filters out.
21        Q.    Uh-huh.
22        A.    Then, as I say, you cleaned the filters.
23   You could do that, you know, one or two times.  Then
24   you would have to replace it with new filters.
0296
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    And then you would also have a circulating
 3   fan because somewhere you've got to create the
 4   airflow.
 5        Q.    Right.
 6        A.    And that would have an electric motor, and
 7   that would have to be -- most of it was lubricating,
 8   whether it was grease or whether it was oil.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Any other types of -- and what I
10   hear what you're saying when you talk about cleaning
11   out the coils and occasionally cleaning out filters
12   and then after a while they're going to have to
13   almost be replaced, I kind of see that as maintenance
14   because you guys are going to go in there, and you're
15   going to blow out the coils and blow out the filters?
16        A.    Right.  Correct.
17        Q.    What I'm curious about is, do you have any
18   memory of helping your father perform any specific
19   repairs wherein a unit broke and it was more than
20   just blowing something out or greasing something up
21   that you actually had to perform a repair on
22   something?
23        A.    Yeah.  They also had expansion valves.
24        Q.    Uh-huh.
0297
 1        A.    So on occasion, whether it was moisture
 2   that that valve would be defective and had to be
 3   replaced.
 4        Q.    Okay.  And do you know who made these
 5   expansion valves?
 6        A.    Not the expansion valves.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And to remove an expansion valve,
 8   what does that entail?  How do you go about doing
 9   that?
10        A.    Basically, you've got to pump the unit
11   down --
12        Q.    Uh-huh.
13        A.    -- out of the system.  Then some were
14   flare nuts.  You would have a liquid side and a gas
15   side.  You would have to remove the flare nuts.  Now,
16   on some of the air-conditioners, they had an
17   expansion valve that bolted in because they went to
18   different tubing, different sections of that coil.
19        Q.    Uh-huh.
20        A.    I mean, maybe one you'd be the quarter --
21   the lower part, and then the next -- so it would be
22   like an octopus that had more than one line coming
23   off it.
24        Q.    Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  Yup.
0298
 1        A.    So you could remove the main part of it by
 2   -- usually it was two bolts, and then you would have
 3   the gasket that you replace, and then you'd bolt the
 4   whole thing back in.
 5        Q.    The gasket that you were removing, do you
 6   know who manufactured that?
 7        A.    They were basically -- it was Gasket Pack
 8   or Pack Gasket.  They were, like, a preformed gasket.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Those would be the ones that you
10   would utilize to replace the gasket that you had
11   removed.  I guess my question is, when you go to do
12   this work for the first time on an expansion valve,
13   do you know the manufacturer of that gasket that you
14   are removing?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  And how would you know the
17   manufacturer of the gasket you are removing?
18        A.    Because we bought the gaskets, and they
19   were, like, in a kit, different sizes.
20        Q.    Uh-huh.
21        A.    And you didn't have to cut them.
22        Q.    Right.
23        A.    They were all premolded, I guess, and so
24   you would have different sizes all in this kit.
0299
 1        Q.    Yup.
 2        A.    That's how I would know what the gaskets
 3   were.
 4        Q.    I see.
 5        A.    Just because, as I say, they came out of
 6   this kit.
 7        Q.    Uh-huh.
 8        A.    Nothing to do with the valve.
 9        Q.    Okay.  But those are the ones that you are
10   putting on, right?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    I guess my question is just a slightly --
13   just a little bit different.  You're going to remove
14   that expansion valve for the first time, right?
15        A.    Right.
16        Q.    Let's say that.  And as part of that
17   process, I think you told me there is a valve -- I'm
18   sorry -- there's a gasket involved in that?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    My question is -- and then you have to
21   remove that gasket before you can then take one of
22   the precut ones you have and put it on, right?
23        A.    Correct.
24        Q.    Okay.  The one you're taking off that
0300
 1   first time, do you know who made that one?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And do you know what the gaskets
 4   that you were utilizing, what they were made of?
 5        A.    I'm not sure.
 6        Q.    Okay.  The one that you removed, how did
 7   you go about removing that gasket?
 8        A.    Usually that gasket was either with -- I
 9   used to have a chisel that was in pretty good shape.
10   So you'd chisel it out.  You know, you don't want to
11   damage the steel end of it.
12        Q.    Right.  Right.  Was there ever occasion
13   when you were removing old gaskets that they would
14   just come right out?
15        A.    Yeah.  Usually on compressors, you had a
16   suction side, which was usually cold.  Then you had
17   the high side, which was usually very hot.
18        Q.    Right.
19        A.    The cold side wasn't bad.
20        Q.    Okay.
21        A.    But the high side, because of the heat,
22   had baked them on, so you had to work at them.
23        Q.    Gotcha.  But, again, as you indicated, to
24   do that work, though, if you're using your chisel,
0301
 1   you're going to do it carefully so as not to damage
 2   where the two --
 3        A.    That was the big part.
 4        Q.    Yeah.  Okay.  And the -- the gaskets that
 5   you replaced them with, I'm sorry, did you call them
 6   Gasket Pack?
 7        A.    Yeah.  It -- I'm not sure which -- whether
 8   it was vice versa on the names, and I just -- pack --
 9   I'm sure on "pack."
10        Q.    Okay.  And is that P-A-C-K?
11        A.    Yeah.
12        Q.    Okay.  Where would you get those?  Where
13   did you get the replacement gaskets?
14        A.    From Standard Supply in Worcester.
15        Q.    And the removal process of removing these
16   gaskets, did that create dust in any way?
17        A.    Obviously, when you disturb a gasket and
18   you have to pry it off, I'm going to say yes.
19        Q.    Okay.  And when you were doing this work,
20   did you wear any sort of breathing protection or
21   anything like that?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Okay.  Any other types of repairs?  We
24   talked about a lot of the maintenance that you would
0302
 1   have done on these AC units, and they sound like a
 2   lot of the maintenance is kind of similar --
 3        A.    The same.
 4        Q.    The same type of thing?
 5        A.    The same thing.
 6        Q.    Any other types of repairs that you recall
 7   performing with your father on these units?
 8        A.    Well, basically, if the unit failed, you
 9   would have to replace the unit.
10        Q.    Okay.
11        A.    If the circulating fans, you know, whether
12   it was on the condenser or whether it was on the
13   evaporator, you would have to replace.
14        Q.    And if a fan failed, what's that process
15   entail?  Is that kind of an unscrewing --
16        A.    Yeah.
17        Q.    -- the fan?
18        A.    Yeah.  Some bolts, taking a cage off, and
19   then they had, obviously, a frame to hold the fan in
20   place.
21        Q.    Yeah.
22        A.    And, obviously, you've got the electric
23   end of it where you would have to disconnect your
24   wire.
0303
 1        Q.    Yup.
 2        A.    Most of those were totally replaced, and a
 3   new one were put in.
 4        Q.    Okay.  If you had to remove, you know,
 5   particular units of the, I guess, either the
 6   compressors -- you know, the AC units to get it back
 7   and working -- and I'm assuming every repair is going
 8   to be different because it's going to depend on what
 9   the problem is.  If you had to remove particular
10   component parts of the compressor, how was that done?
11        A.    Well, on the refrigeration compressors,
12   really you had two.
13        Q.    Uh-huh.
14        A.    I call it either the high side or the low
15   side.  You've got a suction side, and you've got the
16   high side.
17        Q.    Right.
18        A.    You would have two gaskets in there.  The
19   low side, usually that gasket came off pretty easily,
20   but on the high side, you had to scrape it and clean
21   it and whatnot.
22        Q.    And removing and replacing these gaskets,
23   that was only done if the unit needed some sort of
24   repair, correct?
0304
 1        A.    Right, if -- yes.
 2        Q.    It's not part of the regular maintenance,
 3   in other words?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And when you were working with your
 6   father at the NCO Club, is it fair to say that most
 7   of your work and your father's work was on the
 8   maintenance side versus the repair side?
 9        A.    Correct.
10        Q.    Okay.  And if you had to break it down
11   percentage-wise for the time that Groton
12   Refrigeration when they were at the NCO Club, what
13   percentage of their time would be maintenance versus
14   having to conduct these actual types of repairs?
15        A.    I'm going to say 75-25.
16        Q.    Seventy-five percent maintenance.  The
17   other 25 percent of the time there might be some type
18   of repair, correct?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    And then of that 25 percent of the time
21   that there might be some sort of repair, it could be
22   all sorts of different types of repairs?
23        A.    Correct.
24        Q.    And not every repair that you might have
0305
 1   to perform at the NCO Club on the compressors or the
 2   units or whatever would involve gasket work; is that
 3   fair to say?
 4        A.    That's fair to say.
 5        Q.    Okay.  So of that 25 percent, then, what
 6   percentage of that repair work might actually involve
 7   the removal and replacement of a gasket?
 8        A.    That would be the lower end because the
 9   compressors were pretty -- it wasn't like an
10   expansion valve.  It was not like a dryer.  It was on
11   occasion.
12        Q.    Uh-huh.  Okay.  So it was -- it would be,
13   let's say, the exception rather than the rule that
14   you might be working removing and replacing a gasket?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  And some of the work you also
17   mentioned that you and your father did involved the
18   Officers Club.  Is the work that you described at the
19   NCO Club essentially the same as the Officers Club?
20        A.    The same thing.
21        Q.    And do the same percentages that we just
22   described in terms of maintenance versus repair kind
23   of apply to the Officers Club?
24        A.    Yes.
0306
 1        Q.    Okay.  And then within that repair
 2   percentage the amount of time you might be removing
 3   or replacing gaskets, again, was about the same at
 4   the Officers as it was at the NCO?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  We've talked about the work that
 7   you did disassembling the cold storage in the mess
 8   halls.  We talked about the general maintenance that
 9   you helped your father with at the NCO and the
10   Officers Club.  Any other work at Fort Devens that
11   you recall assisting your father?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Okay.  When do you think was the last time
14   you helped your father at Fort -- at something at
15   Fort Devens?  I know we were around 15 or 16 when we
16   were disassembling things?
17        A.    Yeah.  I'm going to say in the '60s.  I'm
18   going to say 1965 because Fort Devens was winding
19   down, and most of the mess hall work and stuff like
20   that was done, and, you know, the rest was up to
21   whether they tore the thing down or what they did
22   with it.
23              MR. HOOVER:  Okay.  Okay.  We've been
24   going a little over an hour.  I'm going to kind of
0307
 1   move into some of the commercial work that Groton
 2   Refrigeration did as a side part of your dad's side
 3   business.
 4              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
 5              MR. HOOVER:  Do you want to take a quick
 6   break, or are you good to go to talk about --
 7              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
 8              MR. HOOVER:  Yes, what?  Keep going?
 9              THE WITNESS:  A quick break.
10              MR. HOOVER:  A quick break it is.  There
11   you go.
12              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
13   approximately 10:38, and this is the end of media
14   number one.
15              (A break was taken from 10:38 to 10:52
16              a.m.)
17              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
18   approximately 10:52.  We are back on the record.
19   This is the beginning of media number two.  Counsel,
20   you may proceed.
21              MR. HOOVER:  Thank you.
22   BY MR. HOOVER:
23        Q.    All set to --
24        A.    All set.
0308
 1        Q.    All right.  I just want to make sure -- to
 2   clarify things.  When your father was up at Fort
 3   Devens, he was employed by Fort Devens; is that
 4   correct?
 5        A.    That's correct.
 6        Q.    And I think I remember on day one that he
 7   started working at Fort Devens in the 1940s, correct?
 8        A.    Correct.
 9        Q.    And that was when he started and worked up
10   at Fort Devens as a refrigeration engineer, correct?
11        A.    Correct.
12        Q.    So he was a government employee
13   essentially, correct?
14        A.    Correct.
15        Q.    And to get onto the base to work up at
16   Fort Devens, he needed special permission, a pass to
17   get in there?
18        A.    They had a pass.  A sticker on the front
19   of the vehicle.
20        Q.    Okay.  And so when he worked at doing the
21   maintenance and the repairs of the NCO Club and the
22   other areas of Fort Devens, he was doing that as a
23   government employee, correct?
24        A.    I do not know.
0309
 1        Q.    Okay.  So I guess what I'm trying -- what
 2   I'm a bit confused at, when you would go up and help
 3   your father, for example, you were able to go up and
 4   onto the -- and into the Fort Devens?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Did you need any sort of special
 7   permission or any special permit to get onto the
 8   base?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Okay.  And when you would go up there, was
11   this essentially kind of on weekends or in the
12   evenings?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    When your father went to go do this work
15   on the weekends or the evenings, was he doing it as a
16   Fort Devens government employee, or was he doing it
17   as a -- Groton Refrigeration as part of his separate
18   business?
19              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
20   answered.  If you know, Mr. Morton.  We don't want
21   you to guess.
22        A.    I don't know.
23        Q.    Okay.  When you were present, you were
24   actually doing some of this work; is that correct?
0310
 1        A.    Correct.
 2              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
 3   answered.
 4   BY MR. HOOVER:
 5        Q.    Were there any other employees that your
 6   father had that also did this work?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    How many other employees did he have that
 9   was also doing this work that you were assisting him
10   on?
11        A.    Two.
12        Q.    And who were those two individuals?
13        A.    Bill Hanson.
14        Q.    Uh-huh.
15        A.    And Yuno Nugel (phonetic).  Don't ask me
16   how to spell it.
17        Q.    I'm not going to.  Do you know if
18   Mr. Hanson is still alive?
19        A.    No.
20        Q.    Do you know if Mr. Nugel is still alive?
21        A.    They're not.
22        Q.    They're not.  And were these full-time
23   employees of Groton Engineering -- Groton
24   Refrigeration?
0311
 1        A.    No.
 2        Q.    Who were they employed by?
 3        A.    Basically, they worked with my father for
 4   the government on Fort Devens.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And so on the side, they might also
 6   help your father out, correct?
 7        A.    Correct.
 8        Q.    All right.  When your father did this work
 9   on the evenings and the weekends where you assisted
10   him, did he have some sort of contract or agreement
11   with Fort Devens to do this kind of work?
12        A.    I do not know.
13        Q.    With respect to any of the replacement
14   parts that you had to get when you were conducting
15   repairs on any of these particular pieces of
16   equipment, did the government supply them, or did
17   your father get them from somewhere else?
18        A.    Groton Refrigeration.
19        Q.    Okay.  He would get them from Groton
20   Refrigeration?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    And did Groton Refrigeration operate out
23   of the family home?
24        A.    Yes.
0312
 1        Q.    Were there ever any sort of military
 2   personnel that kind of oversaw or supervised any of
 3   the work that you and your father performed on the
 4   weekends?
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    You mentioned sometimes that you might
 7   take a particular unit back to the, quote, "shop" to
 8   perform some repairs on, and then you might then put
 9   it back into circulation.  Do you remember talking
10   about that earlier?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    What types of repairs are you -- and by
13   "shop," you mean back there at the family home?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Okay.  What types of repairs are you
16   performing on these units that you bring back to the
17   family home?
18        A.    Usually two depending on what we
19   determined was wrong with the unit or the compressor.
20        Q.    Okay.  And what are those two types of
21   repairs?
22        A.    The front seal and the valve plate on the
23   compressors.
24        Q.    With respect to the front seal, what types
0313
 1   of repairs were performed on the front seal?
 2        A.    Removing the front pulley, removing the
 3   old seal, cleaning the shaft, and also cleaning the
 4   area that the seal casing fit into.
 5        Q.    Okay.
 6        A.    Replacing it with a new seal, which was
 7   one unit, and the seal was usually, as far as I know,
 8   was some type of rubber gasket that formed around the
 9   shaft.
10        Q.    Okay.  And then replace the front pulley?
11        A.    Replace the front pulley, and that part
12   was done.
13        Q.    Gotcha.  The other thing you might -- type
14   of repair you might do back at the shop was to fix a
15   valve plate compressor?
16        A.    Fix a valve plate.
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    Taking the head off of the compressor.
19        Q.    Yeah.
20        A.    This involved some -- quite a bit of
21   scraping because you had to scrape from the bottom of
22   the pump and the bottom of the valve plate.
23        Q.    What are you scraping?
24        A.    The gasket.
0314
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    In other words, there was a bottom gasket
 3   and a top gasket.
 4        Q.    And how big are these gaskets?
 5        A.    I'm going to say six by three.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And how thick generally are these
 7   gaskets?
 8        A.    Probably a sixteenth of an inch.
 9        Q.    And what type of tool would you utilize to
10   scrape the bottom gasket and the top gasket?
11        A.    Usually a sharp chisel.
12        Q.    Okay.  And was there ever an occasion if
13   you took the head off the compressor to get to the
14   gaskets that the gasket itself would just come right
15   off?
16        A.    No.  You would have to work at them with
17   either a chisel or -- usually that would do it.  You
18   didn't want to damage the bottom, the base of the
19   pump or anything like that, the steel where your new
20   gasket had to bond to.  You would replace the valve
21   plate --
22        Q.    Yeah.
23        A.    -- by installing a new gasket on the top
24   and bottom of the valve plate.
0315
 1        Q.    All right.
 2        A.    And then replacing your head bolts and
 3   tighten them down.
 4        Q.    Gotcha.  All right.  And with respect to
 5   the removal of the old gaskets, how long did that
 6   process take?
 7        A.    Usually an hour would be a guess.
 8        Q.    Well, as we said, we don't want you to
 9   guess.  Do you have an estimate of how long it might
10   take?
11        A.    Half an hour to an hour.
12        Q.    And is that for both or per?
13        A.    That is either doing the head gaskets --
14   the seal, depending on how easy you could get the old
15   seal out.  Some were more difficult than others, so I
16   can't give you an actual time on that.
17        Q.    You mentioned seal.  Are you talking about
18   the front seal work?
19        A.    The front seal work.
20        Q.    Okay.  Right now I'm still kind of
21   concentrating on the valve plate work.
22        A.    Right.
23        Q.    There were two gaskets that you had to
24   remove?
0316
 1        A.    Right.
 2        Q.    And what I'm trying to get a sense of is
 3   how long it would take in the whole process just to
 4   remove the two gaskets?
 5        A.    Put the head back on?
 6        Q.    No.  I'm asking you just the removal of
 7   the gasket portion.
 8        A.    I'm going to say 15 minutes.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Would you know the manufacturers of
10   any of the gaskets that you removed as part of this
11   valve plate work?
12        A.    No, because those came with the valve
13   plate.
14        Q.    Okay.
15        A.    And, no, I do not know the name.
16        Q.    Do you know the manufacturer of the valve
17   plate?
18        A.    No.
19        Q.    With respect to any sort of replacement
20   gaskets that you then -- and I'm assuming, again,
21   these are preformed gaskets?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    Okay.  And so it's just a matter of -- a
24   question of opening the package and putting the
0317
 1   replacement gasket in place?
 2        A.    Can I back up just a little?
 3        Q.    You can back up just a little.
 4        A.    Basically, the valve plate was purchased
 5   -- that had to be the same as the pump.
 6        Q.    Okay.
 7        A.    Whether it was a Circumference pump, I --
 8   because we used about four different pumps.  I can't
 9   say which -- which one.
10        Q.    Okay.  What pumps did you use?
11        A.    Copeland, Frigidaire.  Those were the
12   three main pumps that we used, not counting the
13   air-conditioning pumps.
14        Q.    Okay.  I just heard Copeland and
15   Frigidaire, so that would be two.  You said those
16   were the three mains ones?
17        A.    Circumference.
18        Q.    Oh, Circumference.  Thank you.  And so
19   with respect to replacement gaskets, do you know who
20   manufactured the replacement gaskets?
21        A.    They would have come with the plate.  Now,
22   who manufactured them, I don't know.
23        Q.    Okay.  Well, when you -- when you -- so
24   you would replace a new plate?
0318
 1        A.    You would replace it to match the pump.
 2        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  And then part of that
 3   replacement plate includes the gaskets?
 4        A.    The gaskets.  So they came -- as I say,
 5   depending -- I'm not sure if it was a Copeland or
 6   depending on which pump was being worked on.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Were -- did you ever do valve plate
 8   work on, for example, on AC units?
 9        A.    Those were a sealed compressor.
10        Q.    We talked about that, right.  Okay.
11        A.    So, no.  If something happened there, you
12   would have to replace the compressor.  You could not
13   replace these components to a sealed unit.
14        Q.    Okay.  So you just take out one -- you
15   take out the sealed unit, and you put in a new sealed
16   unit?
17        A.    Right.
18        Q.    Gotcha.  So if you were doing that kind of
19   work, taking out a sealed unit and putting in a
20   sealed unit, it didn't involve any gasket work?
21        A.    Not usually.
22        Q.    Okay.  Which begs the question,
23   occasionally it might?
24        A.    I'm trying to think on some of the
0319
 1   air-conditioners, but -- no, there was not a lot of
 2   gasket work on a sealed unit.
 3        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  Other than those two types
 4   of repairs that you talked about, the front seal and
 5   the valve plate compressor work, any other types of
 6   repairs that might be performed -- basically, it's
 7   not in the field.  You're taking the unit back to the
 8   shop?
 9        A.    Right.
10        Q.    Were those the two types of repairs you'd
11   perform?
12        A.    Those were the main -- main type, yes.
13        Q.    Were there any other types --
14        A.    If it would get any worse than that, we
15   just replaced it.
16        Q.    Fair enough.  So if you could replace the
17   front seal or replace the valve plate, you might do
18   that.  Anything above that, it just wasn't worth
19   saving, per se?
20        A.    Per se, yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  When your father was employed by
22   Fort Devens, that was a full-time job for him,
23   correct?
24        A.    Correct.
0320
 1        Q.    Was he also on call?  In other words, if
 2   there was some sort of emergency repair that was
 3   needed, would he be called to the base?
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    What were his hours, if you recall, at the
 6   base?
 7        A.    I'm going to say 8:00 to -- 8:00 to 5:00.
 8        Q.    All right.  And was this a
 9   five-day-a-week --
10        A.    It was a standard five-day-a-week.
11        Q.    And then, as I understand your testimony
12   from day one, in addition to doing this work at Fort
13   Devens as a Fort Devens employee on a full-time
14   basis, he also had some side work, correct?
15        A.    Correct.
16        Q.    All right.  And this side work involved --
17   we talked a little bit about maybe going up on the
18   evenings to help do some demo work at Fort Devens; is
19   that correct?
20        A.    That's correct.
21        Q.    And this work that you talked about at the
22   NCO Club and the Officers Club that you helped him,
23   was this also not, again, Monday through Friday, 8:00
24   to 5:00?  It would have been sometime outside of that
0321
 1   schedule?
 2        A.    Yes.
 3        Q.    What other type of side jobs did your
 4   father have as part of Groton Refrigeration?
 5        A.    The company?  The company names?  Is that
 6   what you're --
 7        Q.    Yeah.  I mean, did he have particular
 8   accounts that he did these side jobs on?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    What sort of companies did he do this side
11   work for?
12        A.    Most of that -- well, either diners, meat
13   markets.  I'm going to use the term "barrooms."  Now
14   they're -- they don't call them barrooms anymore, but
15   now -- but basically back then it was.
16        Q.    Okay.  So diners, meat markets, these
17   barrooms?
18        A.    Yeah.
19        Q.    Any other types of businesses that he did
20   work for on the side?
21        A.    There were some that were strictly meat
22   companies.
23        Q.    Okay.  Is that different than a meat
24   market?
0322
 1        A.    No.  It's pretty much the same except
 2   there were a few of them that dealt more in just
 3   certain cuts of meat.
 4        Q.    Uh-huh.
 5        A.    So they didn't have the canned goods that
 6   a particular grocery store type of situation.
 7        Q.    I see.  Okay.  So he might do some work on
 8   the side for grocery stores, and he might do some
 9   that are strictly meat markets?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    All right.  Did he also do any sort of
12   residential or work for individuals?  Homeowners?
13        A.    Very few.
14        Q.    If you had to put a percentage -- this is
15   just looking at your father's side work -- what
16   percentage of his time would have been spent doing
17   commercial work verus doing any kind of residential
18   work?
19        A.    Ninety-10.
20        Q.    Okay.  And the work, again, that your
21   father is doing on the side, that's going to be,
22   obviously, maybe on the weekends or sometime after
23   work during the week, correct?
24        A.    That's correct.
0323
 1        Q.    On average, do you recall how often on,
 2   like, per month he might be working a weekend on
 3   these side jobs?
 4        A.    Weekends, at least one day a weekend.
 5        Q.    Okay.
 6        A.    Sometimes two.
 7        Q.    Yeah.
 8        A.    What percentage?  I'm going to say 50-50
 9   on that one.
10        Q.    Okay.
11        A.    Nights, I really can't give you.  It
12   depended on the weather, how hot it was, and how many
13   breakdowns.
14        Q.    Okay.
15        A.    That's when there were emergency calls and
16   we'd do the night work.
17        Q.    So if it was during the week, it might be
18   on a -- during the summertime if there was some sort
19   of emergency need for some sort of service?
20        A.    Yeah.
21        Q.    And was the weekend work more like the
22   general maintenance work we've talked about?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    Did your father employ anybody?  I know --
0324
 1   strike that.
 2       Did your father employ anybody to help do these
 3   jobs on the weekends and at night?
 4        A.    I'm just trying to figure out how to
 5   answer it.  On occasions.
 6        Q.    And we talked about those two individuals
 7   that you recalled, Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nugel --
 8        A.    Yeah.
 9        Q.    -- that were Fort Devens employees that
10   helped out at Fort Devens?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    Were those the type that he might get
13   someone from Fort Devens to come and help?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    -- at a diner, for example?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Other than Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nugel, do
18   you remember any other employees --
19        A.    Not -- no, not employees.
20        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember any other
21   individuals that would help your father?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    And I'm pretty sure I asked you this on
24   day one, but I just want to confirm.  Did your father
0325
 1   ever incorporate --
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    -- Groton Refrigeration?
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    He never did?
 6        A.    No.  I'm --
 7        Q.    Do you have any memory of any -- let's
 8   just start -- you mentioned one of the types of
 9   companies he might do work for were diners, right?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    Okay.  Before I get into that, did you
12   ever work with your father at any diner doing any
13   sort of refrigeration work?
14        A.    Oh, yes.
15        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember any specific diners
16   that you worked with your father at?
17        A.    Park Street Diner was one of the big ones.
18        Q.    Park Street?
19        A.    Park Street Diner.
20        Q.    Yeah.
21        A.    It's a bank now.
22        Q.    That's a bummer.  Where was Park Street
23   Diner located?
24        A.    Right there on Main Street and 225.  Where
0326
 1   the two meet.
 2        Q.    And what town is that in?  What town is
 3   that in?
 4        A.    What kind?
 5        Q.    What town?
 6        A.    Ayer.
 7        Q.    Ayer?
 8        A.    Ayer.
 9        Q.    Thank you.  And what type of work do you
10   recall performing with your father at the Park Street
11   Diner?
12        A.    Installation and then general repair or
13   maintenance, or I'm not sure what you want to call
14   it.
15        Q.    Okay.  Installation.  What were you
16   installing?
17        A.    We were installing the units.
18        Q.    What units were you installing?
19        A.    Whether a salad case unit.  They had
20   beverage coolers.  They had, obviously, central
21   air-conditioning, and they had walk-in cooer units.
22        Q.    When was this installation work performed?
23   Was this part of new construction of this diner?
24        A.    This was new construction.
0327
 1        Q.    How old were you when this new
 2   construction was performed?
 3        A.    I'm going to say 12, 13.
 4        Q.    And was your father -- was there a general
 5   contractor and your father subcontracted the
 6   refrigeration work?
 7        A.    I'm not sure.
 8        Q.    Okay.  What was entailed in terms of
 9   installing, for example, the salad and beverage
10   coolers?  What work was involved in that?
11        A.    The coolers were upstairs.  The units were
12   all in the cellar on a bench in a line.
13        Q.    Okay.  How many units were there?
14        A.    I don't know exactly.  I'm going to say at
15   least 15.
16        Q.    And then what did you have to do with
17   those units?
18        A.    The electrician had to wire them in, which
19   they did that.  We had to run the tubing from the
20   unit -- from the compressor to the unit itself.
21   Meaning, the cooler.  Wherever the cooler was
22   located.
23        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  And what does -- how does
24   one go about running the tubing, then, from the unit
0328
 1   up to the -- where, you know, the salad or beverage?
 2        A.    Well, that involved putting in a new sight
 3   glass, a new dryer.  The dryer's name was Catch-All.
 4   I finally came to the memory of that.  And then you
 5   had to run it up to the case itself.
 6        Q.    Uh-huh.
 7        A.    You would have to install the expansion
 8   valve, and that had two lines going to it.  Usually
 9   anywhere from a quarter inch to three-eighths on the
10   liquid side, and five-eighths to three-quarters on
11   the suction side.
12        Q.    And this is all essentially -- not to --
13   well, this is essentially, like, taking a tube,
14   adding the necessary component parts to get from the
15   basement up to the particular cooling unit?
16        A.    Up to the unit itself.
17        Q.    Okay.  And how long would you say you were
18   working at the Park Street Diner to do this type of
19   work?
20        A.    At least a month.
21        Q.    Okay.  And this would have been done on
22   weekends and in the evening?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    And if you were working at -- in the
0329
 1   evening during the week, 12 to 13, you're still going
 2   to school; is that correct?
 3        A.    Yup.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Would you work after school or when
 5   your father got home, or was it mostly, for you
 6   anyway, on weekends?
 7        A.    Mostly me was weekends, and if there was
 8   any way I could fit in anything else.
 9        Q.    Right.
10        A.    But mostly weekends.
11        Q.    Okay.  And specifically at this Park
12   Street Diner, did you -- were you the one who was
13   helping to run tubes to the coolers?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Okay.  What other jobs did you personally
16   do in terms of work at the Park Street Diner on
17   weekends?
18        A.    Depending on what type of unit it was.
19   Some was air-cooled.  Now, some was water-cooled.
20   Those needed circulating pumps.  Circulating pumps
21   were -- Crane was one name.  Bell & Gossett was
22   another name.  And some needed air, which was usually
23   Ingersoll-Rand.  In various occasions was a Gould.
24        Q.    And your involvement with, whether they be
0330
 1   air or water pumps, is this essentially you're just
 2   helping to hook them up and set them up?
 3        A.    Correct.
 4        Q.    Okay.  And these are new pumps, and so it
 5   was just a matter of physically attaching the pumps
 6   to where they need to go?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    As I said, some were air-cooled.  Some
10   were water-cooled.
11        Q.    Uh-huh.
12        A.    Some had to have air, and as I say, there
13   were just plain circulating pumps.  Condensation
14   would build up.  You had to extract that water in
15   some manner, and these would involve the pumps.
16        Q.    But, again, for your work here, this is
17   just simple installation of these pumps?
18        A.    Simple install -- yes.
19        Q.    Right.  And I don't mean, like, simple --
20        A.    It's not simple.
21        Q.    It's not a simple thing to do, but that's
22   essentially what you're doing?
23        A.    But, yes.  Basically, yes.
24        Q.    Okay.
0331
 1        A.    Now, obviously, some units were bigger
 2   than others, so that depended on the size of the
 3   unit, whether quarter horsepower, whether half
 4   horsepower.  You know, and it went all the way up to
 5   -- we had a couple that were 15, 20 horsepower.
 6        Q.    Okay.  You also indicated that one of the
 7   things that your father's company did was to help
 8   with the central AC?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    The installation of that.  Were you
11   involved in that aspect of the construction?
12        A.    I was more involved with the maintenance
13   of it.
14        Q.    Okay.  And we'll get to maintenance in a
15   bit.  I just want to get the new construction that
16   you did.
17        A.    Okay.  That particular unit came more as a
18   one-piece.  Everything was assembled except for
19   ductwork.  We did not do any of the ductwork.  That
20   was subcontracted out to a company that performs the
21   ductwork.
22        Q.    Gotcha.  Do you recall who manufactured
23   the central AC unit?
24        A.    I'm going to have to say no.
0332
 1        Q.    Okay.  And the last thing you indicated in
 2   terms of the new construction that your father's
 3   company was involved was the walk-in cooler units?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    For that new construction, were you
 6   involved at all from the refrigeration standpoint of
 7   these walk-in cooler units?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    What was your involvement?
10        A.    Well, first of all, we had to determine
11   the size of unit it was going to take to cool that
12   area.  We did have an engineer that would come out,
13   look at this particular application, and tell us what
14   we were going to need.  Then it was my job to
15   install.  There again, your compressor sat by itself.
16   You had to run the tubing into the walk-in cooler.
17   You had to hang an evaporator.  That's a cooling unit
18   to cool the walk-in cooler.
19        Q.    Okay.
20        A.    That was probably three feet by four feet
21   by -- I don't know -- a foot and a half deep maybe.
22   With a -- obviously, a circulating fan that sat on
23   the back of it to blow the air through the cooler or
24   the evaporator.  Whatever you want to call it.
0333
 1        Q.    The unit that you ran that you would have
 2   had to run the tubing from up to the walk-in cooler,
 3   do you know the manufacturer of that particular unit?
 4        A.    All I know is it could have been one of
 5   the three compressors that we used.  It could have
 6   been the Circumference.  I really don't remember
 7   exact because we -- we did more than one of these.
 8        Q.    Right.
 9        A.    And it was the engineer, and it was from
10   Standard Supply in Worcester that he worked for.  So
11   the unit would have came from them.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    And I cannot tell you the name of the unit
14   just because most of the time we got what they had in
15   stock.
16        Q.    Okay.  This engineer, was this someone
17   that your father hired or the diner hired or --
18        A.    Someone that worked -- in other words, he
19   worked for the company, Standard Supply.  He was like
20   a salesman.
21        Q.    Do you remember this individual's name?
22        A.    Pelletier was his last name.  I believe it
23   was Gill Pelletier.  I have no idea if he's still
24   living or not.
0334
 1        Q.    So he might come from Standard Supply --
 2        A.    He would have come from Standard Supply
 3   basically as a salesman.
 4        Q.    Uh-huh.
 5        A.    All right.  This cooler was -- I don't
 6   know -- 15 by 20 or something.
 7        Q.    Right.
 8        A.    And it had X amount of insulation, and he
 9   would have to design and sell us a unit that was
10   going to keep this cooler at the temperatures that it
11   had to be.
12        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  So this engineer, slash,
13   salesman was the one who determined what size unit
14   needed to be put into the basement in order to keep
15   that walk-in cooler --
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    -- functioning?
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    Okay.  So your father and you didn't
20   really have any sort of say on what particular unit
21   was put into the basement.  That was based upon the
22   engineers looking at what was needed?
23        A.    Right.
24        Q.    Okay.  And so Standard Supply would
0335
 1   basically say this is what you need, and they sell it
 2   to the diner?
 3        A.    That's what we got.
 4        Q.    And that's what you got.  You indicated
 5   that part of the work that your father's company did
 6   was not only the installation here on the Park
 7   Street, but also some general repairs and
 8   maintenance?
 9        A.    Yeah, that was -- yes.
10        Q.    Okay.  Were you personally ever involved
11   in any sort of general repairs or maintenance on the
12   refrigeration equipment that had been installed at
13   the Park Street Diner?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Okay.  How often were you involved in any
16   sort of general repairs or maintenance on the
17   refrigeration equipment?
18        A.    At least once a month.
19        Q.    Okay.
20        A.    And --
21        Q.    And what did -- and one time a month.
22   Would this be kind of a -- I'll use the word -- like,
23   a customer might have a general contract that says,
24   hey, once a month come in and make sure our
0336
 1   refrigeration stuff is working properly?
 2        A.    Correct.
 3        Q.    All right.  And so what did this general
 4   maintenance entail?  What services did your father
 5   provide?
 6        A.    Basically, the same thing that -- the
 7   biggest thing is blowing things out.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    It was a very dusty process because the
10   amount of units that were down there, and you were in
11   a confined area in the cellar.
12        Q.    Gotcha.
13        A.    Then after you did your initial blowing
14   out of these units, the motors, then you checked the
15   belts, and the big thing was you had to check the gas
16   to make sure the unit was up to capacity on the
17   amount of gas that it would hold.
18        Q.    The building that this diner was in, was
19   this an old building, or was the --
20        A.    A brand-new building.
21        Q.    A brand-new building.  And how was this
22   particular building heated?  We know your work was on
23   the AC side, but I'm assuming it was heated as well?
24        A.    That was on the AC side, but it also had a
0337
 1   -- I don't remember a boiler.
 2        Q.    Uh-huh.
 3        A.    It could have been electric, but,
 4   obviously -- I'm not sure.  It did have a -- heating
 5   coils in there.  Now, how the heating coils worked,
 6   whether it was electric or forced hot water, I don't
 7   think it was forced hot water because you would have
 8   needed some type of boiler.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    And I don't remember any boiler.
11        Q.    Gotcha.  Other than performing monthly
12   routine maintenance for the diner, what other sorts
13   of work did you personally perform at the Park Street
14   Diner?
15        A.    I'm going to say repair work.
16        Q.    Okay.  Do you have a specific memory of
17   performing repairs on any of the refrigeration
18   equipment at the Park Street Diner?
19        A.    That was a lot of valves breaking down or
20   not -- or burning out.  So it could have been
21   replacement of the valves.  And then the dryers on
22   occasion would mess up.  So you would have to pump
23   the unit down, change the dryers, or the other big
24   component was the expansion valve.
0338
 1        Q.    So the primary repairs would have been to
 2   replace the dryers or the expansion valves?
 3        A.    That -- yeah.  The motors -- obviously, if
 4   the motor failed or burnt out, you either repaired it
 5   or replaced it.
 6        Q.    Under what circumstances would you repair
 7   a motor versus just simply replacing it?
 8        A.    The brush motors, occasionally you would
 9   have to change the brushes and put in a new set of
10   brushes.
11        Q.    Okay.  So that would be a repair, right?
12        A.    That would be a repair.
13        Q.    Okay.  What if it was something more than
14   just replacing the brushes?
15        A.    Then usually removing the motor, replacing
16   the motor, and getting the motor rebuilt.
17        Q.    And rebuilding the motors, where would
18   that take place?  Back at the family --
19        A.    No.
20        Q.    Okay.
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    What would that -- where would that be
23   done?
24        A.    That went to -- we sent all our electric
0339
 1   motors to a place in Leominster.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember the name of the
 3   place in Leominster?
 4        A.    No.  It was -- he did this on the side, so
 5   I'm not sure what the name or if he had a name of the
 6   business.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And when you say "he," it means
 8   this guy in Leominster?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturers of any of
11   the motors that you may have repaired or replaced?
12        A.    Well, I worked on many that were either GE
13   or Westinghouse.  Those were the two big ones.  I
14   know there were a few.  I do not remember those
15   names.
16        Q.    Do you remember the manufacturer of any of
17   the dryers that you would have had to replace?
18        A.    Not the dryers.
19        Q.    Okay.  You talked about expansion valves
20   in terms of repairs?
21        A.    Now, they could have been made by any one
22   of the pump and valve companies, but I really can't
23   pick one.
24        Q.    Okay.  Any other repairs or maintenance
0340
 1   that you recall personally performing for your father
 2   at the Park Street Diner?
 3        A.    No.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Were there other diners that your
 5   father did this type of work for?
 6        A.    That was the main big account that we had.
 7        Q.    Okay.
 8        A.    There were a few other small ones, but --
 9   I failed to mention ice cream companies that --
10        Q.    Okay.
11        A.    -- we did work for.
12        Q.    And when you say "big account," is it fair
13   to say that the Park Street Diner was your father's
14   primary account across all of these, whether they be
15   meat markets, bars, or ice cream?
16        A.    That was a single biggest account just
17   because it was new.
18        Q.    Yup.
19        A.    And we did all the installation per se --
20        Q.    Gotcha.
21        A.    -- on the refrigeration.  Other accounts,
22   I can name them, some of them, all of them, whatever,
23   but a lot of those were already installed.
24        Q.    Right.
0341
 1        A.    So now it was just a matter of repairing
 2   and maintaining.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And I guess I'd like to talk to you
 4   a little bit about some other accounts that you did
 5   have where you did do this type of maintenance or
 6   repair work.  So what other establishments, what
 7   other companies, did your father perform this
 8   maintenance or repair work at?
 9        A.    The Triangle, which was in Groton, which
10   was a beer establishment.  Johnson's Ice Cream, which
11   was before that Urgon's Ice Cream Stand (phonetic).
12        Q.    Where is Johnson's located, just before
13   you --
14        A.    119 in Groton.
15        Q.    Okay.
16        A.    Ayer Meat Market, Ayer, Mass., Main
17   Street.  That's no longer.  Then I had mentioned a
18   meat market, and I'm going to say good luck on
19   spelling.  It was Cornelia's Meat Market, Main Street
20   in Ayer.  That was basically a general meat market.
21        Q.    Okay.
22        A.    Obviously, the -- we -- Hotel Lincoln was
23   Main Street, Ayer, which is no longer.  It was the
24   Wigwam, which was a beer establishment, which is no
0342
 1   longer there.  The Shell Club in Shirley.  That's
 2   closed.  And then there was Carlin's, which was a
 3   beer establishment, and I know we did some for the
 4   Rotar Club (sic), which is a dance place and function
 5   type of situation.
 6        Q.    Uh-huh.  Yeah.
 7        A.    Those are -- and many more.
 8        Q.    Okay.  But this list of places that you
 9   just gave to us are ones that you recall your father
10   had accounts with where he would perform routine
11   maintenance or repairs as needed for the
12   refrigeration, correct?
13        A.    Yes.  And as I say, there were more --
14        Q.    Uh-huh.
15        A.    -- but I just can't without, you know,
16   doing some research.
17        Q.    If you had to do some research, what would
18   you do?
19        A.    What's that now?
20        Q.    If -- you said I could think of some more
21   if I could do some research.  What would you do?
22   What kind of research would you do?
23        A.    I guess sit down and start writing.
24        Q.    Okay.  It would be all up in here, right?
0343
 1        A.    Yeah, and that's tough.  Yeah, we had many
 2   more.  I had some in Pepperell.  I had some in
 3   Littleton.  So, yes, there were pizza shops.  There
 4   were other pizza shops in Ayer that we did work for,
 5   so, yeah, as I say.
 6        Q.    Were you working -- did you help your
 7   father at each and every one of these establishments,
 8   or is it one of those, I just know we had these as
 9   accounts; I can't tell you which ones I did work at
10   versus which ones I didn't work at?
11        A.    I worked at all of them at one time or
12   another.
13        Q.    And the type of work that was performed
14   at, for example, The Triangle, the bar in Groton, do
15   you have a specific memory of the type of work and
16   the type of equipment that was worked on at The
17   Triangle in Groton?
18        A.    As a simple fact, I worked on so many, and
19   whether it's a beer cooler or a meat cooler, the
20   functions are the same, and pretty much the products
21   that I have named I couldn't name while there were so
22   many of these Crane pumps, or, you know, what type
23   because a lot of them you just interchanged.  You
24   looked at the size.  You looked at the horsepower.
0344
 1   You looked at whether it was a pump.  How much, you
 2   know, water that -- PSIs that involved.  So you
 3   matched it up.
 4        Q.    So I guess is it fair to say that you
 5   can't put a particular brand name product at a
 6   particular location?  For example, product X was at
 7   The Triangle and compressor Y was at Johnson's, and
 8   pump Z was at Ayer Meat Market; is that fair to say?
 9        A.    Exactly, because the functions were all
10   the same.
11        Q.    Okay.
12        A.    You know, you wanted to cool an area, and
13   depending on how big the area is to how big of a unit
14   you had.
15        Q.    Okay.  And we've been talking about
16   performing routine maintenance versus repair of these
17   particular units, particular pieces of equipment?
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    And earlier you had mentioned that routine
20   maintenance, the blowing out of the particular units,
21   for example --
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    -- that routine maintenance was the
24   primary work that you performed; is that fair to say?
0345
 1        A.    That's correct to say.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And I thought we talked something
 3   about, like, 75 percent of the work might be
 4   maintenance versus 25 percent was repair?
 5        A.    Repair.
 6        Q.    And is that the same for what your
 7   father's business was, 75 percent maintenance, 25
 8   percent repair?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    Okay.  And the products that you worked
11   with or the equipment that you worked with that you
12   talked about thus far in terms of the NCO Club and
13   The Officers Club, the diner, is that essentially the
14   same type of equipment and units that were in these
15   other places?
16        A.    Yes, it is.
17        Q.    Okay.  But, again, unable to tell me
18   exactly what piece of equipment or manufacturer of
19   what piece of equipment is at what place?
20        A.    Correct.
21        Q.    Okay.  When you -- what portion of your
22   work for your father involved actually taking
23   particular product, particular pieces of equipment
24   back to the shop and doing some work on them?
0346
 1   Remember we talked about that stuff in Fort Devens.
 2   On the side work, did your father do that kind of
 3   same stuff?
 4        A.    That same stuff, yes.
 5        Q.    But if it was a -- if it involved a motor,
 6   that was sent out?
 7        A.    The motor was replaced.  Then the motor
 8   that I took off --
 9        Q.    Uh-huh.
10        A.    -- was replaced.  As I said, to replace
11   that motor, whether it happened to be a GE, really
12   didn't make any difference to me.  As long as the
13   shaft size was the same, the horsepower was the same,
14   my voltage was the same.  Whether it was a
15   single-phase motor, a three-phase motor, that didn't
16   matter as long as I had matched it up to what was
17   there and replaced it.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    So I didn't always replace it with the
20   same brand of motor.
21        Q.    Right.
22        A.    Because that didn't make any difference to
23   me.
24        Q.    Right.  And I think you said the same
0347
 1   thing about, for example, pumps.  As long as it -- as
 2   long as the function of the pump was the same, it
 3   didn't matter?
 4        A.    As long as the function was the same.  If
 5   they didn't happen to carry the type of pump I
 6   needed, but they had a pump that was going to do the
 7   same job, I took the pump that was going to do the
 8   same job.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Now, you began working full-time in
10   1961 in the printing industry, correct?
11        A.    Correct.
12        Q.    All right.  So around the age of 21?
13        A.    Correct.
14        Q.    All right.  And once you started working
15   for the printing company around the age of 21, and
16   when you -- you got married in '61, right?
17        A.    Yeah.
18        Q.    Okay.  Did your time working for your
19   father stay the same, decrease, because now you had
20   your full-time job and family and whatnot?
21        A.    It decreased.
22        Q.    Okay.
23        A.    I spent more time on the maintenance end
24   of it on weekends.
0348
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    Because now I'm starting to have a family
 3   and --
 4        Q.    You have your own responsibilities?
 5        A.    -- I've got other obligations.
 6        Q.    Exactly.  Exactly.  So from 19 -- is it
 7   fair to say, then, from 1950, around the age of 10,
 8   to around 1961, was when you were more involved with
 9   your father's business?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    And mostly on weekends?
12        A.    Mostly, and nights was a big emergency
13   problems.
14        Q.    Okay.  All right.  So if there was an
15   emergency, that's when your father might get a call?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Okay.  But the regular maintenance that
18   you might be involved in would be more on the
19   weekends, right?
20        A.    More on the weekends.
21        Q.    Okay.  And I meant to ask.  Was your
22   father a licensed AC guy?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    Okay.  When he went and did his work, did
0349
 1   he have to get any sort of special permits or
 2   anything to do his work?
 3        A.    Not back then.  That --
 4        Q.    Go ahead.  Back then --
 5        A.    Back then you didn't need it.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And then beginning in 1961 up until
 7   essentially 1971 when your father passed, your
 8   involvement with his company became less because,
 9   again, you had your own family, correct?
10        A.    Correct.
11        Q.    And so if you were working, it would have
12   been more on the weekends doing some maintenance?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    And then when your father passed in '71,
15   your involvement with the company was essentially
16   just to kind of wrap it up, right?
17        A.    Right.
18        Q.    All right.  And since 1972, there's been
19   no involvement with any sort of refrigeration work?
20        A.    Fair to say there were a few times trying
21   to help someone out, but full-time involvement, no.
22        Q.    You mentioned that your father on the
23   side, as part of his side job, might also do some
24   residential work?
0350
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    Were you ever -- did you ever assist your
 3   father at all in any of the residential work?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    Do you have a memory of particular
 6   addresses that you helped your father with?
 7        A.    Well, all I know is there were two in
 8   Groton that I remember.
 9        Q.    Yeah.
10        A.    Both of them happened to be down on Route
11   40, and I can't say that I can remember the name of
12   either one.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    I'm sorry.
15        Q.    That's all right.  Do you remember what
16   type of work you helped your father perform at these
17   two residences in Groton?
18        A.    Usually it was refrigerator door gaskets
19   and temperature switches.
20        Q.    A refrigeration door gasket, is that just
21   kind of a gasket?
22        A.    That was a seal that goes around your
23   door, and for some reason back then people hung onto
24   things longer than they do today.  So they got ratty
0351
 1   after a while --
 2        Q.    Yeah.
 3        A.    -- and leak and whatnot.  So you would
 4   replace it.  It was -- I didn't do that many.  So
 5   they were a pain in the neck, and that's why we
 6   basically never did home stuff.
 7        Q.    Okay.  But the door gasket, that's just a
 8   rubber gasket?
 9        A.    That's a rubber gasket.  It's held on some
10   manner with some type of screws and plate.  Something
11   to hold it in place.  Even back then they were not
12   magnetic like they are today.  So you had a door
13   latch that held the door tight.  So it was just a
14   matter of replacing the gasket.
15        Q.    The temperature switches, what did that
16   entail?
17        A.    That basically -- it's a temperature
18   switch.  In other words, it's set to come on, like,
19   at 38.  When the evaporator gets to a certain
20   temperature, whether 34 or something like that, it
21   would shut the unit off.  So it was basically a start
22   and stop switch, and it worked off of temperature.
23        Q.    Okay.  And if that was faulty, what did
24   you have to do to replace, to swap those out?
0352
 1        A.    You had a temperature control line.  It
 2   was like a flexible line, but it was made out of some
 3   -- like, aluminum.  It was soft.  It could get bent
 4   and whatnot.  And so you usually -- it's around the
 5   front of the door where you can see it when you open
 6   the door, and it's got, like, 1 to 10 on it or
 7   something like that --
 8        Q.    Yeah.
 9        A.    -- depending on what number you set it to.
10   So then it's got the tubing that runs to the
11   evaporator, and it works off of the temperature.  In
12   other words, that's the sensor that comes to the
13   switch.  Usually what happens is the points burn out,
14   and once that happens, your switch is no good and
15   doesn't function properly.
16        Q.    So then you just -- it's just a matter of
17   removing the old switch --
18        A.    Yeah.
19        Q.    -- and replacing that?
20        A.    Right.
21        Q.    Okay.  Was that -- was there any other
22   type of work you recall doing with your father or for
23   your father as part of his side work in any sort of
24   residence -- residential setting other than the door
0353
 1   gaskets or removing and replacing a temperature
 2   switch?
 3        A.    The only other one that I can think of
 4   right offhand was for Donald Priest.  We knew him.
 5   We did work for him in the cold storage.
 6        Q.    Right.
 7        A.    And he had an old refrigerator that we had
 8   to tie in a service valve and charge it every once in
 9   a while.  It had a slow leak somewhere.  We never did
10   find it.
11        Q.    Okay.  So this was just a matter of
12   replacing whatever was leaking?
13        A.    Yes.  Replace every once in a while.
14   About once a year we'd have to charge it with a
15   little more freon.
16        Q.    Okay.  Any other residential work that you
17   recall?
18        A.    No.
19        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  Having talked about -- are
20   there any other types of work that you recall
21   assisting your father at Groton Refrigeration that
22   we've not touched upon?
23        A.    Well, there are some places that I didn't
24   name without -- yeah.
0354
 1        Q.    Right.  I mean --
 2        A.    There were many more, but nothing that
 3   would have meant doing any more serious work type of
 4   thing.
 5        Q.    Right.
 6        A.    It was just maintenance.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And, yeah, you talked about The
 8   Triangle, and we kind of went through the Shell Club
 9   and Carlin's?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    And I understand that there are other
12   businesses --
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    -- that you may have performed some
15   maintenance --
16        A.    Right.
17        Q.    -- at as part of your father's side jobs?
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    But I also understand, and correct me if
20   I'm incorrect, that the Park Street Diner was your
21   father's primary account for businesses?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    Okay.  And these other ones --
24        A.    It was, as I said, one of the largest ones
0355
 1   because of the amount of equipment that was in there.
 2        Q.    Right.  And these other ones that you
 3   mentioned, and even the ones that you can't remember
 4   the exact names, those were the smaller accounts that
 5   he had?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    Okay.  So you would be going there less
 8   frequently than you might be to the Park Street
 9   Diner?
10        A.    Correct.
11        Q.    Okay.  Other than that type of work that
12   we've talked about for the -- on the commercial side
13   and the couple of residents on the residential side,
14   is there any other type of general work that you
15   recall performing for your father as part of his side
16   business that we've not discussed?
17        A.    I think -- no.
18        Q.    Okay.  We've covered it?
19        A.    We've -- pretty much so.  As I say,
20   there's other names.
21        Q.    And I understand that, yeah, there are
22   other companies you can't remember and other pizza
23   shops you can't remember?
24        A.    Yes.
0356
 1        Q.    But the general work, the type of work
 2   we've discussed?
 3        A.    Yes.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Now, so to wrap that up, then, from
 5   all that we spoke on Tuesday in terms of your
 6   employment and the Groton Refrigeration work that we
 7   just finished talking about, is there any other type
 8   of employment that you've had that we have not
 9   discussed either on Tuesday or today?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    Okay.  We've covered it all?
12        A.    Yes.
13              MR. HOOVER:  All right.  At this juncture
14   right now, I want to kind of poll these folks and see
15   what's what.  It's a little bit after 12:00 anyway.
16   So can we just have the room for a bit, and we figure
17   out what we want to do next type deal?
18              MR. BECERRA:  Yeah.  Do you guys want to
19   just take a lunch break now?
20              MR. HOOVER:  We can do lunch now.  Does
21   that work?  That's fine with me.
22              MR. BECERRA:  All right.  Let's do that,
23   then, Mark.  Why don't we -- we can go off the
24   record.
0357
 1              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
 2   approximately 11:59, and this is the end of media
 3   number two.
 4              (A lunch break was taken from 11:59 a.m.
 5              to 1:04 p.m.)
 6              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
 7   approximately 1:04.  We are back on the record.  This
 8   is the beginning of media number three.  Counsel, you
 9   may proceed.

11   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LENKIEWICZ:
12        Q.    Good afternoon, Mr. Morton.  Are you okay
13   to continue?
14        A.    Good afternoon.  Yes.
15        Q.    All right.  My name is Thad Lenkiewicz.
16   I'm going to ask you a few more specific questions
17   about some of the stuff you testified about on
18   Tuesday.
19       First of all, I'd like to talk about the heating
20   system in the house that you currently reside in.
21   You talked about there being a series of furnaces in
22   the basement that you've installed from 19 -- or that
23   have been installed from 1961 up to the present.  Do
24   you recall that testimony?
0358
 1        A.    Correct.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Sir, the system that heats the
 3   home, is it a heated air system, or is it a heated
 4   water system?
 5        A.    It is forced hot water.
 6        Q.    Forced hot water.  Okay.  You sort of
 7   alternatively testified to using the term "furnace"
 8   or "boiler" on Tuesday.  Do you use those terms
 9   interchangeably?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    Okay.
12        A.    I -- I can, yes, relate to both.  Meaning,
13   that's one.  The furnace or boiler is the same as far
14   as my explaining it.
15        Q.    Okay.  So the -- you identified it as a
16   Weil-McLain furnace that was installed in 1961 by a
17   company -- I believe you said it was May & Haley?
18        A.    Yup.
19        Q.    And was that the -- was that the
20   subcontractor on the building of your home?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  Do you know if that company is
23   still in business?
24        A.    They had sold out to Ayer Oil Company.
0359
 1        Q.    Okay.  Do you know where they purchased
 2   the furnace that was installed in 1961?
 3        A.    No.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Do you know, other than the name of
 5   the company, any of the employees who installed it or
 6   anyone who was working for the company at the time --
 7   at that time involved in the project?
 8        A.    Not that I remember.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Sir, do you know who manufactured
10   -- did this system have a burner that went along with
11   it?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    Okay.  Do you know who manufactured the
14   burner?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Okay.
17        A.    Not without looking at it.  I mean, if I
18   heard the name, I would remember it.  Put it that
19   way.
20        Q.    Okay.
21        A.    No, I cannot name it.
22        Q.    All right.  If it comes to you -- if it
23   comes to you along the way, just let me know.  Okay?
24        A.    All right.
0360
 1        Q.    All right.  Do you know whether May &
 2   Haley purchased the furnace or boiler, as you called
 3   it, and the burner from the same source or from two
 4   different entities?  Do you have any knowledge?
 5        A.    The same source.  The reason I say that is
 6   because it came as a packaged unit.  Meaning, it was,
 7   like, all crated, and when they uncrated it, it was
 8   the boiler, and the burner was all in place.
 9        Q.    Okay.  The burner had already been
10   installed -- had already been installed with or
11   connected to the boiler by the time it reached your
12   home?
13        A.    Correct.
14        Q.    Okay.  Other than the work or the cleaning
15   that you described doing, was there any maintenance
16   work done on this system -- this boiler by an outside
17   entity after it was installed?  Did you ever have
18   anyone come in and do any maintenance work on it or
19   any repairs?
20        A.    Other than the initial startup, no.
21        Q.    Okay.  And May & Haley took care of the
22   initial startup, correct?
23        A.    Correct.
24        Q.    Okay.  Sir, I believe you said on Tuesday
0361
 1   that this -- I think the measurements, you said, were
 2   12 by 15 by 4 for the furnace or boiler; is that
 3   right?
 4        A.    That's correct.
 5        Q.    So 12 inches by 15 inches by 4 feet?  Is
 6   that -- I just wanted to clarify.
 7        A.    Well, 14 by 12 by the height.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So it was about four feet high?
 9        A.    About four feet high.
10        Q.    Okay.  How are you able to identify this
11   as a Weil-McLain furnace or boiler?
12        A.    Because it's got their name and tag right
13   on the front of it.
14        Q.    Okay.  How was the name displayed?
15              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.  Are you
16   asking, like, what type of font?
17              MR. LENKIEWICZ:  Sure.  I can be more
18   specific.
19   BY MR. LENKIEWICZ:
20        Q.    Was the name displayed as a sticker?  Was
21   it embossed on a plate?  Was it molded into the --
22   into the machine?  How did it -- was it sort of
23   affixed?
24        A.    It was a metal plate.
0362
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    And that was in some manner attached to
 3   the boiler.  Whether it was -- it wasn't screwed on.
 4   It had a -- like a rivet, I'm going to say.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And other than -- other than the
 6   name itself, do you remember any other information on
 7   the nameplate?
 8        A.    Yes.  It gave you the BTUs of the boiler.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    I guess I should have been calling it a
11   boiler because it produces hot water --
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    -- instead of a furnace.
14        Q.    Okay.  Was this -- and this was used to
15   provide heat to the home, correct?
16        A.    And hot water.
17        Q.    And hot water.  Okay.  Do you recall what
18   the BTUs were?
19        A.    Not -- I would be guessing.  I'm not
20   supposed to guess.
21        Q.    Fair enough.  Sir, you said that you
22   replace -- you discussed on Tuesday that you've
23   replaced the boiler over time several times, and that
24   you currently have a boiler in your home as well.
0363
 1   Would it be -- would the boiler in your home now be
 2   the same BTUs as the one that was present in the
 3   1960s and '70s?
 4              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    The -- the -- you said you had the boiler
 7   -- the first boiler replaced in 1985?
 8              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
 9   BY MR. LENKIEWICZ:
10        Q.    And then, again, you had a boiler replaced
11   -- you talked about the wood -- the wood --
12        A.    Yeah.
13        Q.    -- fire experiment?
14        A.    Yeah.
15        Q.    And then going to a third boiler --
16        A.    Experiment, yes.
17        Q.    Okay.  And then you said you had a third
18   Weil-McLain boiler that you installed sometime in the
19   2000s that's still there?
20              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
21   BY MR. LENKIEWICZ:
22        Q.    Were the three Weil-McLain boilers, are
23   they all -- were they all roughly the same size?
24        A.    Yes.
0364
 1        Q.    Okay.  Other than replacing an old boiler
 2   with a new boiler, were there any distinguishing
 3   features between the first one and the second one or
 4   the second one and the third one?
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    Was their appearance generally the same?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Sir, has the layout of your
 9   basement changed at any time during -- from the time
10   you moved in in 1961 until the present?  And what I
11   mean by that is have you partitioned off the room at
12   all?  Has it gone from unfurnished to furnished?
13   Anything like that?
14        A.    No.  To answer, nothing has been
15   refinished or partitioned or anything like that.  The
16   cellar is basically the same as it was when the house
17   was built.
18        Q.    Okay.  And is it -- it's just -- it's one
19   open room?
20        A.    One open room.
21        Q.    Okay.  Was there a specific time of year
22   when you would clean out or clean the boiler as you
23   described on Tuesday?  You said you would do it
24   annually?  Was it -- did you keep a schedule and do
0365
 1   it every, you know, certain month or something?
 2        A.    Obviously, I did it in the fall.  Early
 3   fall before it got too cold.
 4        Q.    So you would clean it out before you were
 5   going to need to use it for the winter, correct?
 6        A.    Cleaned it out before you went into the
 7   heating season.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever -- with regard to the
 9   boiler that was present from 1961 to 1985, did you
10   ever change the burner on it?  Was it ever replaced?
11              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Okay.  Sir, can you just estimate for me
14   the rough dimensions of your basement at your home?
15        A.    I want to say 28 -- 25 by 34 something.
16   That's rough.  I can't say that I measured it.
17        Q.    Understood.
18        A.    It's a Cape.
19        Q.    When the boiler arrived to be installed,
20   it was already factory -- or sorry.  Strike that.
21       When the boiler arrived to be installed, it was
22   already assembled and simply had to be attached to
23   piping and wiring; is that correct?
24        A.    That's correct.
0366
 1        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall -- and I'm just
 2   talking about the first one, the 1961 to roughly 1985
 3   boiler.  What did its outside appearance look like?
 4   Do you recall what color it was?
 5              MR. BECERRA:  And I'm just going to
 6   object.  You keep referring to this boiler as a 1961
 7   to 1985 boiler.  Having reviewed the transcript, he
 8   never said 1985.  He said he replaced it in the early
 9   '80s.  That was his testimony.  So the objection is
10   misstating his prior testimony.  You can answer, sir.
11   BY MR. LENKIEWICZ:
12        Q.    Sir, with regard to all the questions I
13   previously asked you today, if I said "1985," you
14   understand that we're talking about the boiler -- the
15   first boiler that was present in your house from '61
16   to sometime in the '80S or early '80s.  Is that fair
17   that you've understood all my questions, sir, so far?
18        A.    I think what you're asking me --
19        Q.    Let me rephrase it.
20        A.    Okay.
21        Q.    The boiler we were talking about all the
22   way up to this point when I asked you about the first
23   one is the one that was installed in 1961 and was
24   replaced in the 1980s; is that fair?
0367
 1        A.    That they're all -- basically looked the
 2   same and the same color?  Is that the question?
 3        Q.    Sorry.  No.  I'll just ask a different
 4   question.  The first boiler, I just want to talk
 5   about the first one that was there.  What color was
 6   that boiler, if you recall?
 7        A.    I don't know.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    All right?  It's fair to answer, I really
10   didn't pay attention to the color.
11        Q.    Okay.  That's fine.  Did it have a metal
12   exterior?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    Okay.  Was it a painted metal exterior, if
15   you recall, or was it exposed metal?
16        A.    No.  Painted.
17        Q.    Okay.  The first one, did it sit on -- the
18   first boiler, did it sit on a pad or any kind of
19   lifts or anything like that?
20        A.    Not the first one.
21        Q.    And the -- the second one, I believe you
22   said when you installed it, you put it on a base or
23   on blocks; is that correct?
24        A.    That's correct.
0368
 1        Q.    How was the burner on the first boiler
 2   powered?
 3        A.    How was it powered?  Oil and electricity.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall the grade of oil that
 5   was used?
 6        A.    Meaning?
 7        Q.    A number grade of oil, whether it was
 8   grade 2 oil, grade 3 oil, grade 4 oil?  Do you recall
 9   that?
10        A.    I guess I really don't know.  Well, I
11   can't guess, so --
12        Q.    Okay.  For the three Weil-McLain boilers
13   that you described on Tuesday, did anything about the
14   way they were powered change between the different
15   boilers, or were they all powered the same way with
16   oil?
17        A.    They were all powered the same way.
18        Q.    Okay.  And the system for all three was
19   generally the same?
20        A.    Correct.
21        Q.    Okay.  Do you know if the oil system had
22   any preheating equipment?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    No, it did not?
0369
 1        A.    Meaning, it did not.
 2        Q.    Okay.  So the piping to the boiler, was
 3   there a piping for water and a piping for oil coming
 4   to the boiler?
 5        A.    Obviously, it's separate piping, yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And what did the piping look like
 7   coming from the boiler?
 8        A.    Coming from the boiler?
 9        Q.    From the boiler to heat the home?
10        A.    It was inch-and-a-half copper.  Can we
11   look at that question again?  I just want to make
12   sure I answered you correctly.
13        Q.    You said it was an inch-and-a-half copper
14   coming from -- coming from the boiler?
15        A.    Coming from the boiler to feed the house.
16        Q.    Correct.
17        A.    That is inch and a quarter.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    The return -- I know you didn't ask me --
20   the return is the inch and a half.
21        Q.    All right.  The first boiler, was it
22   affixed to the ground?  Was it bolted to the cement?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    It just stood on its own weight?
0370
 1        A.    It just sat on the cement.
 2        Q.    Okay.  You described on Tuesday the
 3   cleaning that you did was to remove the burner and
 4   vacuum out the interior; is that correct?
 5        A.    The lower chambers, yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And you said that you had to remove
 7   a piece that had insulation on it; is that correct?
 8        A.    That was to get at your top of the boiler.
 9   You had to remove that top plate.  Under that top
10   plate was some insulation that you had to remove.
11   Now you exposed the tubes for your boiler.  You had a
12   long brush that you fed down through the tubes to
13   scrape and clean the tubes.
14        Q.    Is this to clean out soot from the tubes?
15        A.    Is --
16        Q.    Is it to remove soot or --
17        A.    Yeah.
18        Q.    -- whatever -- the burned residue; is that
19   correct?
20        A.    Buildup, yes.
21        Q.    Is this brush, does it look like a large
22   pipe cleaner?
23        A.    It was on that idea, yes.
24        Q.    Okay.  The metal piece on the top of the
0371
 1   -- on the top of the boiler is just a square top or a
 2   rectangular top; is that correct?
 3        A.    It's basically a square -- well, square is
 4   not quite, but, yes, it was a metal -- metal plate.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And was the insulation affixed
 6   underneath the metal plate?
 7        A.    No.  It was -- it was set in between the
 8   metal plate and the -- the tubes that you cleaned.
 9        Q.    Okay.  When you lifted off the metal
10   plate --
11        A.    Yeah.
12        Q.    -- would the piece of -- would you then
13   have to take off the insulation separately, or was
14   the insulation -- would it stay within the metal top
15   plate?
16        A.    No.  You had to take the insulation off
17   separately.
18        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever change the insulation
19   on the -- on the boiler?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Okay.  Other than lifting the insulation
22   off the top of the -- off the top of the boiler after
23   the lid was removed, did you ever have to do anything
24   else with that piece of insulation?
0372
 1        A.    Other than putting it back in place?
 2        Q.    Other than taking it off and putting it
 3   back in place?
 4        A.    Right.  That's it.
 5        Q.    That's it.  Okay.  Did you have to remove
 6   any insulation to access the lower chamber?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Okay.  I believe you said on Tuesday that
 9   the insulation was yellow; was that correct?
10        A.    I'm going to say yes.
11        Q.    Okay.  When you took it off the top, it
12   was one rectangular piece approximately the size of
13   the lid; is that correct?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Okay.
16        A.    That's correct.
17              MR. BECERRA:  I just want to log a belated
18   objection to, again, misstating his testimony.  I
19   believe the reference to yellow insulation was in
20   reference to the wood boiler, not the one we're
21   talking about.
22   BY MR. LENKIEWICZ:
23        Q.    Okay.  With regard to the first boiler, is
24   it your testimony today that to the best of your
0373
 1   recollection the insulation was yellow?
 2              MR. BECERRA:  Without guessing,
 3   Mr. Morton.
 4        A.    Well, there's many different colors of
 5   yellow.  I'm saying it was sort of a yellowish color.
 6   That's all I can say.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.  You said that when you
 8   -- aside from -- aside from cleaning this first
 9   boiler, the other interaction with it is that you
10   removed it with your nephew; is that correct?  The
11   first boiler.
12        A.    When I removed it from the cellar, you
13   mean?
14        Q.    Yes.
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  And you described on Tuesday that
17   you took the burner out to make it a lighter piece
18   and then had the remainder of the boiler carried out;
19   is that correct?
20        A.    On a dolly.  That's correct.
21        Q.    Okay.  What did you do with the -- with
22   the old boiler to dispose of it?
23        A.    I don't remember exactly.
24        Q.    With regard to cleaning out the second
0374
 1   boiler, the one that was installed in the 1980s, was
 2   the process the same as what you just described to me
 3   with the first boiler, to the best of your
 4   recollection?
 5        A.    That is correct.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Was the -- did it also involve
 7   removing a piece of insulation off the top when you
 8   needed to access the above chamber piping to clean
 9   out?
10        A.    In that point in time, yes.
11        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall if the appearance of
12   the insulation on the second boiler was different
13   from the appearance of the insulation on the first
14   boiler?
15        A.    I didn't notice any difference.
16        Q.    Okay.  Other than the -- other than the
17   pipe cleaning or the pipe cleaner that we talked
18   about or the brush --
19        A.    Yeah.
20        Q.    -- was there any other equipment used to
21   do the cleaning out work?  Any other tools?
22        A.    A vacuum.
23        Q.    And was that to vacuum out the lower
24   chamber?
0375
 1        A.    Yeah.  Soot.
 2        Q.    When the second boiler was installed, did
 3   -- did you hook it up yourself, or did you have
 4   someone else hook it up?
 5        A.    I had it hooked up myself.
 6        Q.    You did it yourself?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Okay.  What did that consist of?
 9        A.    What was that?
10        Q.    What work did you have to do to connect
11   the second boiler?
12        A.    Well, you had two copper lines, your feed
13   and your return, and you had your oil line to hook
14   up.
15        Q.    Okay.  Did you have to do any electrical
16   work as part of that?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    And what did that consist of?
19        A.    Basically, just hooking up -- I didn't
20   have to do anything with the internal wiring.  It was
21   just a matter of hooking up the two leads plus the
22   ground to the boiler.
23        Q.    Okay.
24        A.    So it wasn't running any new wire or
0376
 1   anything like that.  Using the existing wire.
 2        Q.    Where did you purchase the second
 3   Weil-McLain boiler, if you recall?
 4              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.
 5        A.    I don't recall.
 6        Q.    Did you purchase the burner with the
 7   boiler, or did you purchase it separately?
 8        A.    With the boiler.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Do you know who the manufacturer of
10   that burner was?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    Okay.  Sir, with regard to the first
13   boiler that was installed, is there any other
14   equipment that you recall associated with the boiler
15   that we haven't talked about?
16        A.    Other than changing the second one to go
17   to wood --
18        Q.    I just want to talk about the first
19   boiler.  Was there any other equipment associated
20   with the first boiler that had to be installed at the
21   same time?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Okay.  Sir, you yourself have never had
24   any formal training on boiler work, correct?
0377
 1        A.    Correct.
 2        Q.    And you yourself never did any commercial
 3   work on boilers; is that correct?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    Okay.  For either of the first two
 6   Weil-McLain boilers, do you recall at any time having
 7   to have maintenance work done on them by an outside
 8   -- by an outside person or entity?
 9        A.    No, except for the initial startup.  I
10   would have May & Haley come in and do the initial
11   startup, which they did on the first one, and they
12   did on the second one.
13        Q.    Okay.  So the second one --
14        A.    I didn't have --
15        Q.    I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I didn't mean to
16   interrupt, sir.
17        A.    That's all right.  I didn't have some of
18   the equipment that was needed to make sure the boiler
19   was running at top efficiency or not, so --
20        Q.    Was that a -- was that equipment that they
21   had to -- to essentially run diagnostic testing?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    Okay.  So it was something they brought,
24   tested, and then they took away with them when they
0378
 1   left, correct?
 2        A.    Correct.
 3        Q.    Do you recall the color of the second
 4   boiler, exterior?
 5        A.    The same as the first boiler.  I'm pretty
 6   sure of that.
 7        Q.    That they looked the same, but you don't
 8   recall the outside color?
 9        A.    Yes, they looked the same.
10        Q.    Sir, do you recall any warnings being
11   affixed to the either the first or second boiler?
12        A.    Absolutely not.
13        Q.    There were not any?
14        A.    No.
15        Q.    Did you ever review any instruction
16   manuals or any type of product information from
17   Weil-McLain with regard to any of these boilers?
18        A.    No, I did not.
19        Q.    Did you -- have you ever had any contact
20   with any employee or representative from Weil-McLain,
21   to your knowledge?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    And as far as warnings and manuals, that
24   includes you never reviewed any product instructions
0379
 1   related to these boilers; is that correct?
 2        A.    No.  Meaning, I did not, yeah.
 3        Q.    How did you learn or know to do the type
 4   of cleanout work that you were doing on an annual
 5   basis for these boilers?
 6        A.    I guess most of it was when they did the
 7   initial startup, I went over with their person,
 8   technician, or whatever.
 9        Q.    You're talking about someone from May &
10   Haley; is that correct?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    Okay.  Sir, I believe on Tuesday you
13   mentioned there being a water pump in your basement;
14   is that correct?
15        A.    A Goulds, one horsepower, yes.
16        Q.    That was a Goulds water pump?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    Okay.  I think -- I thought I heard when
19   you were being questioned on Tuesday that you said
20   Weil-McLain with regard to the water pump.  Would you
21   agree with me that it was not a Weil-McLain water
22   pump?
23        A.    I agree with you, yes.  It was a screwup
24   on my part.
0380
 1        Q.    We fixed it.  It's okay.  Sir, when you
 2   removed the first boiler, you had to disconnect it
 3   from the piping; is that correct?
 4        A.    Yes.  That's correct.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And I believe you said on Tuesday
 6   that there were -- that there was gaskets in some of
 7   the piping?
 8        A.    That's correct.
 9        Q.    Do you remember specifically where the
10   gaskets were?
11        A.    Yeah.  The return, you've got a
12   circulating pump, and that circulating pump you had
13   two sets of gaskets.  One in the lower section, and
14   one on the upper section.
15        Q.    So the -- sorry.  Go ahead.
16        A.    That connected.  It would be an
17   inch-and-a-half return.
18        Q.    So the gaskets were related -- connected
19   to the -- the gaskets were at the connections with
20   the circulating pump?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  Do you know if Weil-McLain
23   manufactured the circulating pump?
24        A.    I do not know.
0381
 1        Q.    Okay.  Do you know who the manufacturer of
 2   -- sorry.  Do you know who installed those gaskets?
 3   Were they installed when the -- when it was -- when
 4   the boiler was initially installed in 1961?
 5        A.    I don't know.  I can't remember now
 6   whether the circulating pump came with a boiler or
 7   not.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    I do not remember.
10        Q.    Okay.  The piping coming from the boiler
11   was not insulated, correct?
12        A.    Correct.
13        Q.    Okay.  Sir, there's a couple of other
14   questions that are unrelated to what we just talked
15   about.  I want to talk about Hale & Moore now when
16   you worked there.  You mentioned that there was one
17   Harris press that was present at the facility; is
18   that correct?
19        A.    That's correct.
20        Q.    Was this the same Harris press the entire
21   time you were there?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    Okay.  And it was present before you
24   started working there, correct?
0382
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    So you don't know the manufacture year of
 3   that Harris printing press, correct?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And you don't know when it was
 6   installed at Hale & Moore, correct?
 7        A.    That's correct.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Do you know whether Hale & Moore
 9   purchased this printing press new or used?
10        A.    I do not know.
11        Q.    Whenever they purchased it, it was
12   sometime before you started working there?
13        A.    Before I started working there.
14        Q.    Okay.  And you don't know the maintenance
15   history of this press from however long between when
16   it was installed and when you started working there?
17        A.    Not before I got there.
18        Q.    Okay.  Sir, did any of your siblings work
19   outside the home, full-time jobs while you were
20   living with them?  I mean, was there a time when any
21   of your siblings were working full-time jobs but
22   still living with you and your parents?
23        A.    They -- I -- I'm going to say no.
24        Q.    Okay.  Was there a follow-up to that?
0383
 1        A.    Well, do you consider the part-time work?
 2        Q.    Let me put it this way.  Did any of your
 3   siblings assist your father the way you did?
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Did they work -- did they have
 6   part-time jobs for pay while you were living with
 7   them?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Okay.  What -- what was that employment,
10   if you recall?
11        A.    One was at Groton school.  And these were
12   summer jobs.
13        Q.    Okay.  Who was at Groton school?
14        A.    Susan.
15        Q.    What did Susan do at Groton school?
16        A.    Helped out in the cafeteria.  Did -- she
17   also, I guess, did a little bit of painting, believe
18   it or not.  But, yeah, I remember her talking about
19   that.
20        Q.    Okay.
21        A.    Summer work filling in, I guess, doing
22   whatever they wanted you to do.
23        Q.    Repainting the school between -- when the
24   school year was out?
0384
 1              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    How about your brothers Finamore or
 4   Donald?  Did either of them work outside the home
 5   while you were living with them?
 6        A.    Basically, they were all -- Donald was
 7   moved out.  There's nine years between me and Donald
 8   and even more between the rest.  Finn lived in the --
 9   the home for a while.  He rented from my mother and
10   father.
11        Q.    Okay.  Where was he working at the time
12   that he was renting?
13        A.    I'm going to say the tannery in Ayre,
14   which burnt down.
15        Q.    What was his job at the tannery in Ayer,
16   Mass.?
17        A.    I have no idea.
18        Q.    Do you remember the -- the company name of
19   the tannery?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Okay.  Do you know how -- roughly how long
22   he worked there or roughly what years or decade he
23   worked there?
24        A.    No.
0385
 1        Q.    Okay.  Do you know roughly how old he was
 2   when he worked there?  Would he have been in his 20s
 3   or his late teens?
 4        A.    When he went where?
 5        Q.    When he was working at the tannery, do you
 6   recall roughly how old he was?
 7        A.    In his 20s.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Sir, who did the family laundry at
 9   your home when you were growing up?
10        A.    I can tell you who didn't.
11              MR. BECERRA:  Don't guess, sir.
12        A.    Basically, my mother, as far as I know.
13   Yeah.
14        Q.    And what was the setup for doing the
15   laundry in your home when you were growing up?
16        A.    Oh, actually back then, going to the
17   laundromat.
18        Q.    Okay.  There -- back then there was no
19   washer or dryer or anything like that in the home; is
20   that correct?
21        A.    That's correct.
22        Q.    Okay.  Sir, were there any changes that
23   needed to be made to the piping or the heating system
24   in your home when you installed the wood boiler?
0386
 1        A.    Yes.  I tied in a series of valves so I
 2   could go from one to the other.  In other words, I
 3   could use a wood boiler, and I could use the oil
 4   boiler.
 5        Q.    Did you have the wood boiler and the oil
 6   boiler at the same time?
 7        A.    At the same time.
 8        Q.    Okay.  When was the second Weil-McLain
 9   boiler, the second oil burner, when was that removed?
10              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
11   answered.
12        A.    '80, '85.  In that vicinity.
13        Q.    The second -- the second Weil-McLain
14   boiler?
15        A.    That was not there that long because of
16   the wood boiler and the way that I had tied them in.
17        Q.    Okay.  So you had the second Weil-McLain
18   boiler.  You purchased the wood boiler?
19        A.    Yeah.
20        Q.    You got rid of the second Weil-McLain
21   boiler, and for a certain time period you just had
22   the wood boiler?
23        A.    I took both of them out and replaced it
24   with one new one.
0387
 1        Q.    And the one new one was the third
 2   Weil-McLain oil burner, correct?
 3        A.    That was the third one.  That's why
 4   there's a shorter period of time from the first to
 5   the second and from the second to the third.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And the third one is still there;
 7   is that correct?
 8        A.    The third one is still there.
 9              MR. LENKIEWICZ:  All right.  I think those
10   are all the questions I have, sir.  I appreciate your
11   patience.  I was longer than I wanted to be, but
12   that's my own fault, so --
13              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
14              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
15   approximately 1:46, and we are off the record.
16              (A break was taken from 1:46 to 1:48 p.m.)
17              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
18   approximately 1:48, and we are back on the record.

20   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MOCCIA:
21        Q.    Okay.  Mr. Morton, my name is Anthony
22   Moccia, and I'm going to try to be as brief as I can.
23   And thank you for hanging with us today.
24       I want to first ask you some background questions
0388
 1   about the refrigeration units that you described, I
 2   guess, somewhat generically that they -- I think you
 3   told us this morning that they were pretty much
 4   configured the same way regardless of whether it was
 5   in the -- one of the -- one of the halls or in maybe
 6   one of the commercial establishments that your father
 7   serviced for Groton Refrigeration.  And I think you
 8   told us that there were -- they were the units, if I
 9   can use that word, were comprised of essentially four
10   parts.  You said there was a compressor, a receiver,
11   a condenser, and a motor; is that accurate?
12        A.    The only thing that's missing there is a
13   pressure switch --
14        Q.    And a pressure switch.  Okay.
15        A.    -- on -- there again, every unit didn't
16   have a pressure switch because some of them operated
17   off of a temperature switch.
18        Q.    Okay.  So I'm not a refrigeration expert,
19   so --
20        A.    So there could have been one more
21   component depending on whether the system operated
22   off of pressure or whether it operated off of
23   temperature.
24        Q.    Okay.  So help me with something because
0389
 1   you did tell us earlier that in the early days the
 2   older systems that you came across while helping your
 3   dad out were not, I think you used the word
 4   integrated units?  They were separate component parts
 5   that were bolted to a frame.  Do you remember that
 6   testimony?
 7        A.    That is correct.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So at some point in time during
 9   your -- your work around these refrigeration units,
10   did you start to see the integrated units become more
11   common?  When I say an "integrated unit," I mean --
12   I'll call it a closed unit.
13        A.    Sealed compressor.
14        Q.    Sealed compressor?  Thank you.
15        A.    Correct.  You had the motor and compressor
16   was all in one unit.
17        Q.    All right.  So when you did the
18   disassembly work, for example, this was in the -- in
19   the earlier days.  I think you told us you were in
20   your early teens when you were helping your dad with
21   the disassembly work.  Remember that?
22        A.    That's correct.
23        Q.    Now, those units that you were
24   disassembling -- I'm calling them units.  Those
0390
 1   refrigeration units that you were disassembling, were
 2   those units -- those were older units, I take it?
 3   Those buildings were being demolished?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    So your work in disassembly was
 6   essentially in conjunction with salvage work or
 7   demolition work?
 8        A.    Correct.
 9        Q.    Okay.  So you were taking the mechanical
10   system out of the structure before the wrecking ball
11   hit, correct?
12        A.    That's correct.
13        Q.    All right.  And when I say you were taking
14   the systems out, I think you told us that you folks,
15   you and your dad and, I guess, to the extent that the
16   other two fellows may or may not have been with you,
17   you were not physically removing those systems from
18   the buildings.  You were disassembling the systems
19   from, for example, the power source and the piping
20   sources so that the next group could come in and haul
21   them out of there, correct?
22        A.    Not really because basically we did remove
23   them as long as they were not too large.
24        Q.    All right.  Well, when you get to be a
0391
 1   certain size, you need a millwright in there, don't
 2   you?
 3        A.    You need, yes.
 4        Q.    I mean, I know you were a strong guy in
 5   those days but -- as a 13-year-old strapping youth --
 6        A.    Right.
 7        Q.    -- but I'm not sure how much -- you
 8   weren't hefting 3- and 400-pound units, correct?
 9        A.    Right.  Right.
10        Q.    Okay.
11        A.    Depending on the size of the unit.
12        Q.    All right.  And with respect to those
13   units that you did physically remove, you and your
14   dad, what did you do with them?  You left them in a
15   dumpster or --
16        A.    A scrapyard.  Meaning, a junkyard --
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    -- where -- salvage where they took the
19   metal if it was steel or copper or anything like
20   that.
21        Q.    And the government let you take the -- the
22   government let you take those units, put them on a --
23   put them in the van or wherever they were going, and
24   you'd take them and sell them for scrap?
0392
 1        A.    That was -- yes.
 2        Q.    So do you have a memory, as you sit here
 3   today, of going with your father to a scrapyard?
 4              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.
 5        A.    Oh, yeah.
 6              MR. BECERRA:  That's what he just talked
 7   about.  Unless you're suggesting that he's making
 8   this up?
 9              MR. MOCCIA:  Well, I'm not sure of your
10   objection.  The objection --
11              MR. BECERRA:  I'm objecting to the form of
12   the question.  It's asked and answered.
13              MR. MOCCIA:  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.
14              MR. BECERRA:  No.  You don't need to
15   apologize.  I'm just logging an objection.
16              MR. MOCCIA:  No.  I know, but usually here
17   we object, and they're usually not speaking
18   objections, but that's okay.
19   BY MR. MOCCIA:
20        Q.    So I'm going to ask you -- this is the
21   first testimony that we've had about him going to a
22   scrapyard.  I don't believe it came up this morning,
23   unless I'm mistaken.  So I just wanted to ask you
24   briefly, and forgive me if this was asked and
0393
 1   answered.  So there were occasions when you took them
 2   to a scrapyard and scrapped the systems?
 3              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.  You can
 4   answer, sir.
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And the other times, you would just
 7   leave the units and someone else would come in
 8   afterwards and dispose?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Now,
11   you also testified this morning that some of these
12   systems were -- I'm not sure if you used the word
13   "air fed," but you said some of them were -- were --
14   the element was air, gas, and some were liquid.  Is
15   that -- is that your memory?
16              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
17   BY MR. MOCCIA:
18        Q.    It's not -- it's not -- I'll strike the
19   question.
20       Were some of the systems that you encountered
21   during the period of time that you were at Devens
22   refrigeration systems that were air fed?
23        A.    Air-cooled or water-cooled.
24        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.  And would an air-cooled
0394
 1   system have the same components as a water-cooled
 2   system?
 3        A.    No.
 4        Q.    Okay.
 5        A.    Air-cooled had a fan blade on the motor
 6   that ran the compressor.
 7        Q.    Okay.  So air-cooled --
 8        A.    Had something that's got to move the air
 9   over the condenser.
10        Q.    And do you know what an evaporator is?
11   Have you ever heard of an evaporator?
12        A.    Yeah.
13        Q.    Okay.  Is that a part that's sometimes
14   used in a refrigeration unit?
15        A.    Very much so.
16        Q.    Okay.  But you haven't mentioned that.
17   What's the function -- at least I didn't hear that
18   this morning.  Maybe it was on Tuesday, but --
19        A.    An evaporator is the cold section of,
20   whether it's in a refrigerator or a cooler or
21   whatever.  You have a cold plate, whether it's a cold
22   plate or cold tubing.
23        Q.    And what's the function of the evaporator?
24        A.    To cool the refrigerator, the bottle
0395
 1   cooler.  Whatever it was.
 2        Q.    Well, is an evaporator -- Mr. Morton, is
 3   an evaporator -- is there an evaporator present in an
 4   air-cooled system?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    It is.  Okay.
 7        A.    Evaporator, yeah.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So could you describe for me in
 9   laymen's terms, please, how -- how cooling is
10   accomplished with, let's say, a liquid -- a
11   liquid-cooled system, if you know?  You have a
12   refrigerant, correct?
13        A.    Yes, you have a refrigerant in both cases.
14        Q.    Yes.  So let's start with the refrigerant.
15   What happens?
16        A.    Basically, that's what you've got a
17   compressor for.  It compresses the gas.  Now it goes
18   through your evaporator.  As it goes through the
19   evaporator, it changes it over to a gas.  Then when
20   it comes up to the evaporator, in the refrigerator it
21   goes through an expansion valve, and that's like you
22   open up your -- the older freezers, the evaporator
23   was that whole section that got all ice on the inside
24   in time.
0396
 1        Q.    So --
 2        A.    And that's where your expansion valve or
 3   to change it to a liquid under high pressure, and
 4   that's where you got your cooling.
 5        Q.    Yeah.  Okay.  So we've got a couple of
 6   steps here, so it's a little confusing.
 7        A.    Yeah.  It goes from liquid to gas, and it
 8   keeps coming back again.  Meaning, depending on where
 9   it was going, whether it comes back as a gas stage,
10   and then it's compressed to a liquid stage through
11   the condenser.
12        Q.    It's a cycle, is it not?  It's a cycle?
13   It just keeps --
14        A.    It is a cycle.
15        Q.    Okay.  All right.  So if we start with a
16   liquid refrigerant, would it be fair to state that if
17   we start with a refrigerant that's liquid, it
18   vaporizes at some point in the system and becomes
19   gaseous, correct?
20        A.    That's right.  You go from one to the
21   other.
22        Q.    Okay.  And then in the system, the gas
23   eventually gets condensed back into liquid?  Is that
24   -- in laymen terms, is this -- am I understanding the
0397
 1   system correctly, sir, based on your understanding?
 2        A.    That's what a condenser is for.
 3        Q.    Now, you talked about a compressor
 4   earlier.  What is the compressor doing?  Is that
 5   changing the gas to a liquid?
 6        A.    No.  It's building up pressure to send it
 7   to the condenser so now it can condense back to
 8   liquid.  It goes through the compressor as a gas.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Now, when you helped your dad out
10   with respect to worksites outside of Fort Devens, you
11   told us about the diner.  That was an installation.
12   Were there any other installations other than the
13   diner that you can recall that you worked on, or was
14   it all maintenance and repair?
15        A.    It -- it was both.  Obviously, these units
16   you tried to keep them going, but you can't keep them
17   going forever.  There is a life span, or whatever you
18   want to call it, and then they've got to be replaced.
19        Q.    Okay.  Let me ask a better question.  Was
20   the Park Street Diner the only site that you can
21   recall that was a new installation?  When I say
22   "new," I mean it was being installed when the
23   building was being built or the addition was being
24   put on; is that correct?
0398
 1        A.    That's correct basically.
 2        Q.    All right.  Okay.  All right.  And when
 3   you got out there in the field and you were going to
 4   these ice cream shops, and I'll call them barrooms --
 5        A.    Yeah.
 6        Q.    -- I take it that the systems that you
 7   were -- that your dad was being called out to
 8   service, they would be -- they were not installed by
 9   your father, correct?
10        A.    Correct.
11              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
12   BY MR. MOCCIA:
13        Q.    Okay.  And were these systems the
14   integrated systems that we talked about that came
15   online, or were they the separate component parts
16   affixed to a frame?  Do you recall?
17              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
18              THE WITNESS:  Can I answer that, or --
19              MR. BECERRA:  Yes, assuming you understand
20   the overly broad question, yes, you can.  I'm just
21   trying to help you out.  I saw you wondering.
22              MR. MOCCIA:  I appreciate it.  Thank you.
23   Thanks for your assistance.
24              MR. BECERRA:  Go ahead.
0399
 1        A.    Do you want to just repeat --
 2        Q.    You want me to repeat the question?
 3        A.    Yeah, if you would, please.
 4        Q.    Yeah.  I'm not trying to trick you.  I'm
 5   asking you -- I'll ask a -- I'll rephrase the
 6   question for you.  Hopefully I'll put it in a form
 7   that's not objectionable.
 8       Out in the field with your dad, after Devens,
 9   you're out doing commercial work.  Were the systems
10   that you were encountering in the field in the work
11   that you were doing with your dad, were they the
12   integrated sealed systems that you described, or were
13   they the separate component parts affixed to a frame?
14   Do you understand that question, first of all?
15        A.    Yes, I do.
16        Q.    Okay.  Then you can answer it.
17        A.    All right.
18        Q.    Thank you.
19        A.    Basically, because of the time frame that
20   I was involved in the refrigeration, most of it was
21   the separate units.  Meaning, you had to connect it
22   to a steel frame where you had a separate motor and a
23   separate compressor.
24        Q.    Now, could you describe for me, sir --
0400
 1   let's take the compressor first.  Could you describe
 2   how was -- how would the compressor be affixed to the
 3   frame?
 4        A.    Basically, with four bolts and affixed to
 5   a quart -- I'm saying a quarter-inch steel frame.
 6   Obviously, everyone didn't make their frame out of
 7   the same thickness of metal, but I'm using that as a
 8   rule of thumb.
 9        Q.    So the bolts would seat the compressor on
10   the frame?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    And these bolts -- it was a bolt with a
13   nut?
14        A.    Right.
15        Q.    Okay.  And how -- what tool or tools would
16   you or your dad use to, let's say, remove a
17   compressor?
18        A.    Basically, half-inch, nine-sixteenths,
19   whether an open end, a box, depending on how much
20   room you had and -- because usually we were only
21   removing four bolts.  So we really didn't get into a
22   ratchet with a socket.
23        Q.    Okay.  And what about the condenser?  How
24   would that be affixed to the frame?
0401
 1        A.    Basically, it was bolted to the frame and
 2   very seldom removed from that frame.  Meaning, that
 3   was a part that -- not unless there was some
 4   vibration and some wear that wore through the line
 5   you would be involved in replacing that, but usually
 6   that was very rare.
 7        Q.    Okay.  How about the receiver?
 8        A.    The receiver was nothing more than a
 9   cylinder.  As I say, it was welded and then welded on
10   the two ends.
11        Q.    So would it be unusual to remove the
12   receiver from the frame --
13        A.    Yes, definitely.
14        Q.    -- Mr. Morton?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    And could you tell me -- I'll get to the
17   -- I'll get to the -- I guess the last piece would be
18   a motor, but can you tell me the sizes approximately?
19   I take it it's going to vary depending upon the
20   output of the system?
21        A.    Right.  The amount of gas that's in the
22   system, they would engineer the receiver to be able
23   to hold all the gas in that system.
24        Q.    So the receiver was a cylinder or a tank,
0402
 1   if you will?
 2        A.    That's correct.
 3        Q.    And it's holding gas.  It's not holding
 4   liquid, if you know?
 5        A.    It's -- when you pumped it down and pumped
 6   it into the receiver, it was usually gas.  It was not
 7   in a liquid form.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So what -- so could you give me
 9   your best estimate of the range of sizes --
10   dimensions of receivers that you encountered with
11   your dad in the --
12        A.    Well, as I say, that depended on the size
13   of the compressor and the unit.  You know, if it was
14   a half horsepower, you may have had a gallon-,
15   gallon-and-a-half tank.  If it was a five horsepower,
16   you would probably have a 15- to 20-gallon tank at
17   least.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    So that would be a much longer tank that
20   usually went on the bottom.
21        Q.    But this tank, it's not welded onto the --
22   is it welded onto the frame?
23        A.    Usually they had, like, a U-bolt or
24   something like that to hold -- hold it in place.
0403
 1        Q.    Okay.  And how about the motor?  Is -- was
 2   the motor also affixed by these -- this bolting
 3   system?
 4        A.    By bolting systems.  The motor itself had
 5   slots so you could tighten the motor up to tighten up
 6   your belts.  So it could move one way or the other at
 7   least an inch.
 8        Q.    And when you say "to tighten up your
 9   belts," you're talking about the -- the belts that
10   the motor -- that are being driven?
11        A.    The motor turned the belts.
12        Q.    Right.
13        A.    And the belts turned the compressor.
14        Q.    Okay.  And is the motor -- I know I asked
15   this, but I'm not sure you got to it in your answer,
16   but you told us that the -- you know, there is --
17   there's play that was designed into the system to
18   permit the motor to be moved, and I think you said
19   approximately an inch, so that the belts stayed
20   tight.  But how was the motor -- how were the motors
21   affixed or seated in the frames?
22        A.    Basically, they were seated in the frame
23   as nuts and bolts.
24        Q.    So these nuts and bolt -- with respect to
0404
 1   these pieces of equipment, I take it there were legs
 2   -- were there legs on the pieces of equipment that
 3   through which the bolt -- the nut and bolt system --
 4   in other words, how did it -- it's sitting -- I'm
 5   trying to visualize this.
 6        A.    It did not sit flat.
 7        Q.    I see.
 8        A.    Most of them, whether it was pressed and
 9   cut metal.  The frame was cut, so the frame sat up,
10   and, yeah, there were four legs.
11        Q.    With feet?
12        A.    Yeah.  In some manner.
13        Q.    So the frames -- I'm just trying to move
14   this along.  The frames -- would it be fair to state
15   that the frames were engineered and designed in such
16   a way as to accept affixing of the various pieces of
17   equipment on the frame so that the pieces of
18   equipment on the frame vibrated as least -- as little
19   as possible, correct?
20        A.    You've got that correct.
21        Q.    Okay.  Now, you told us that your dad had,
22   for lack of a better description, had a shop, if you
23   will, in the garage at your home?
24        A.    Correct.
0405
 1        Q.    And I think you told us that you -- from
 2   time to time your father took back to the garage
 3   compressors -- no.  Strike that.  Condensers.  Let me
 4   ask a better question.  Sorry.  Strike the question.
 5       I think you told us this morning that from time
 6   to time your father would take back to the home, to
 7   the garage, condensers that needed attention?
 8              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  You're
 9   misstating his testimony.  You can answer,
10   Mr. Morton.
11              THE WITNESS:  So what am I supposed to do
12   here?
13              MR. BECERRA:  Just for future reference,
14   Mr. Morton, I may need to object to the attorneys'
15   questions throughout the day.  But unless I instruct
16   you not to answer, I want you to assume that you have
17   to answer all of the questions.  He's asking you
18   about a topic that we already discussed earlier
19   today, but I'm going to allow you to clarify or to
20   continue to answer his question for now.  Okay?
21              THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I'm certainly going
22   to need you to repeat it.  I'm sorry.
23              MR. MOCCIA:  Well, after that, I'm not
24   sure I remember it, so I'll ask another question.
0406
 1              MR. BECERRA:  We can get a read back if
 2   you need it.
 3              MR. MOCCIA:  We don't need a read back.
 4   I'll ask another question to move this along,
 5   Counsel.
 6              MR. BECERRA:  Thank you.
 7   BY MR. MOCCIA:
 8        Q.    Did your dad from time to time take
 9   condensers from worksites back to the garage at your
10   home for work?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    Okay.  Then let me ask you another
13   question.  Did your dad from time to time take
14   compressors from worksites back to the garage for
15   attention?
16        A.    Yeah.
17              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
18   answered.  He clearly -- he made that abundantly
19   clear earlier this morning.
20              MR. MOCCIA:  Sir, it's a foundational
21   question.
22              MR. BECERRA:  It's also asked and
23   answered.  He talked at length about compressors that
24   his dad used to bring back.  Now you're asking him if
0407
 1   his dad brought back compressors.  It's asked and
 2   answered.  If you want to ask a follow-up question, I
 3   think that would be more appropriate.  If we were to
 4   ask a foundational question for all your questions,
 5   we'd be here for days.  That's my only point, sir.
 6              MR. MOCCIA:  Are you finished?  Yes?
 7              MR. BECERRA:  Go ahead.
 8              MR. MOCCIA:  I've got to find out if
 9   you're finished.  I don't want to speak over you.
10   BY MR. MOCCIA:
11        Q.    Your father took condensers back to your
12   garage, correct?
13              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
14   answered.  You just asked him that question, and he
15   said that no condensers were brought back to the
16   shop.  If you want, we can get a read back to confirm
17   that.
18   BY MR. MOCCIA:
19        Q.    What equipment did your father take back
20   to the shop for --
21              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
22   answered.  We went over this this morning.
23   BY MR. MOCCIA:
24        Q.    You can still answer.
0408
 1              MR. BECERRA:  And he talked about the
 2   compressors and the valve plates that his dad used to
 3   bring back to the shop.  This is becoming harassment
 4   at this point.  These same questions were asked
 5   earlier this morning.  These same exact questions.
 6   Am I missing something here, guys?
 7              MR. HOOVER:  We've established that
 8   compressors were back brought, right?
 9              MR. BECERRA:  We did.  We absolutely did.
10              MR. HOOVER:  Okay.  Now there may be some
11   follow-ups there.
12              MR. BECERRA:  Okay.  And that's fine.  I'm
13   not objecting to any follow-up questions regarding
14   the compressors.
15              MR. HOOVER:  Fair enough.
16              THE WITNESS:  Can I answer the question?
17              MR. BECERRA:  Not yet, sir.  Just let him
18   ask the question.
19              THE WITNESS:  All right.
20   BY MR. MOCCIA:
21        Q.    In order to take a compressor from a
22   worksite back to the garage at your dad's home,
23   describe for me physically what had to be done to
24   remove the compressor from the unit.
0409
 1        A.    Basically, you would -- as long as the
 2   compressor still worked halfway, you'd pump the unit
 3   down, meaning the gas out of the system into the
 4   receiver.
 5        Q.    Okay.
 6        A.    Then you'd -- then you could remove the
 7   compressor without losing all the gas into the
 8   atmosphere.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    Then you would remove the compressor by
11   removing the valves.  There were two valves.  There
12   was an intake and a high side and a low side.
13   Meaning, one was a cold return, and the other was hot
14   gas that came out of that side.  The cold side, you
15   usually could remove that gasket fairly easy.  On the
16   high side, it was a very hot application, so that
17   gasket you had to work at.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    When I say "work at," meaning, usually
20   using a chisel to separate it.
21        Q.    And how would you physically remove the
22   piece of equipment from the frame?  Is this the bolt
23   system?
24        A.    Then -- now your compressor is separated.
0410
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    Your lines are no longer going to --
 3        Q.    I'm with you.
 4        A.    Now you take your four bolts off the
 5   bottom and remove the compressor.
 6        Q.    Okay.  I got it.  So with respect to the
 7   other components of a system, those being the
 8   receiver, the condenser, the motor, and let's leave
 9   the switch aside for a minute.  The condenser -- the
10   condenser, the motor, and the receiver, were there
11   ever occasions when you -- when your dad had to
12   remove one of those components from the system and
13   take it back to the garage at your house?  Yes or no?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Okay.  Which components?
16        A.    The electric motor.
17        Q.    Okay.  Any others?
18        A.    No.
19        Q.    Okay.  And with respect to the electric
20   motors, how many times did that happen, if you can
21   recall?
22        A.    Many.
23        Q.    Okay.  And could you describe for me how
24   you would disassemble and remove the electric motor
0411
 1   from the system?
 2        A.    To explain it very simple, obviously, the
 3   electric motor failed, and you had to replace it.
 4   Meaning, you had four bolts.  You had a fan blade if
 5   it was an air-cooled unit, and you'd have at least
 6   two belts.  Maybe one or two belts.  Maybe three.
 7   Then you would have to remove the pulley and fan
 8   assembly from the motor, and then you could
 9   physically pick the motor up and bring it back to the
10   shop.
11        Q.    Okay.  And when you -- before physically
12   picking the motor up and bringing it back to the
13   shop, I take it you had to unbolt it?
14        A.    You had to unbolt it.  You had to have a
15   replacement motor.
16        Q.    Okay.  And when you got these motors back
17   to the garage, is that where you were taking them?
18   Or perhaps you were taking them to another location
19   depending on what was wrong with the motor?
20        A.    Correct.
21        Q.    All right.  So if they were going back to
22   your garage at your house -- strike that.
23       Did any go back to your garage at the house?
24        A.    Yes.
0412
 1        Q.    Okay.  And on what occasions would they go
 2   back to your garage at the house?
 3              MR. BECERRA:  You mean for what reasons?
 4   BY MR. MOCCIA:
 5        Q.    For what reason -- strike the question.
 6       For what reason would they go back to your garage
 7   at the house?
 8        A.    Very seldom did they go back to the garage
 9   or the shed, whatever you want to -- more of a shed
10   would be the proper terminology.  It was not a garage
11   as would you think.
12        Q.    Okay.  I'll call it a shed from now on.
13        A.    Okay.  Very seldom did they go back there
14   because usually when we had to replace them, the
15   motor had failed, and we just took them to Leominster
16   to the person that rebuilt the motors for us.
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    He would then take care of that end of it
19   and repair the motor.
20        Q.    Okay.  So would it be fair to state, sir,
21   that your dad and you never rebuilt a motor?
22        A.    That's fair to say.
23        Q.    And if the motors were being brought back
24   to the shed -- and I know you said it was very seldom
0413
 1   -- were they being brought back to the shed to be
 2   held to bring back to Leominster?
 3        A.    That is about the only reason we'd bring
 4   it back to the shed, to tell you the truth.
 5        Q.    Got it.  Okay.
 6        A.    Because if it was only one motor involved
 7   and we had some spares, we would wait until we had
 8   more than one motor to take back -- take to
 9   Leominster at a time.
10        Q.    Okay.  Now, the shop in Leominster, I
11   think you were asked, but you don't recall the name
12   of the shop in Leominster?
13              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
14   answered.
15        A.    No, I don't.
16        Q.    Do you know the name of the person who
17   worked at the shop?  The owner of the shop or any of
18   the workers at the shop?
19        A.    No.
20        Q.    Is the shop still in existence, as far as
21   you know?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Where was it located in Leominster?
24        A.    All I know it was off of Route 13 in
0414
 1   Leominster.  I know that's one of the side streets.
 2   I do not know the name of the street.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Now, earlier this morning, you also
 4   told us that from time to time -- strike that.
 5       Also this morning, you told us that you worked on
 6   brushes.  You had occasion to work on brushes and
 7   motors.  Do you remember that testimony?
 8        A.    Yes.  Yes.
 9        Q.    So describe for me what's a brush in a
10   motor, please?
11        A.    It is -- either your electrical motors had
12   two starting.  One was what they call a brush
13   motor -- all right -- where the brushes actually
14   started that motor.  Then you had a capacitor motor.
15   The brushes rode up against an armature, and they
16   would wear out, and you would have to replace these
17   brushes.  These brushes were a carbon material.  All
18   I know is it was a black carbon material.  And you
19   would replace the brushes, and you would clean the
20   armature because with the old brushes that arced over
21   a period of time, the armature got very dirty.  So
22   you take emery paper and clean that armature, blow
23   the motor out, and then you put in new brushes.  So
24   basically, you were usually off and running.
0415
 1        Q.    Okay.  And where did you do this brush
 2   replacement work?
 3        A.    Usually you did it --
 4        Q.    On-site?
 5        A.    -- on-site.
 6        Q.    And do you recall whether the brushes came
 7   in a brush assembly?  Did they snap in, sir?
 8        A.    You could replace both.  Usually we just
 9   replaced the brushes.
10        Q.    Okay.  So let me ask you with respect to
11   the brushes, if I could, sir.  Were they -- were they
12   part of what I might call a brush assembly?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    Okay.  And would it be fair to state that
15   it was a -- do you know what a tension control system
16   is?
17        A.    Yeah.  Basically -- yes.
18        Q.    What's a tension control system?
19        A.    Basically, it controls pressure.  These
20   pressures had to be up against the armature.  All
21   right.  Once you -- the motor was called to start --
22   all right -- and gets up to a certain speed, this
23   brush assembly would click out.  So now the motor is
24   running strictly on the armature.
0416
 1        Q.    Yes.  And when I use the term a "tension
 2   system" -- not attention -- "tension system" -- the
 3   tension system was designed to provide a mechanism
 4   through which the brushes could maintain contact with
 5   the armature, correct?
 6        A.    To my knowledge.
 7        Q.    But that wasn't an area that -- that you
 8   were trained in in any way, were you?
 9        A.    I was trained in how to change the
10   brushes.
11        Q.    Okay.
12        A.    Not to change the brush assembly --
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    -- end of it.
15        Q.    Okay.  Other than changing the brushes,
16   did you repair or replace any other parts of any
17   motors?
18        A.    No.
19        Q.    And in conjunction with your changing
20   brushes, did you have to disturb or remove any other
21   component parts of the motor?
22        A.    When I would clean, no.
23        Q.    Should I ask -- do you want me to ask the
24   question again or --
0417
 1              MR. BECERRA:  No.  I think you understood
 2   the question.  Just finish your answer, Mr. Morton.
 3        A.    Well -- yeah, give me the question again.
 4   I mean --
 5        Q.    Okay.  When you changed brushes --
 6        A.    Yeah.
 7        Q.    -- in motors --
 8        A.    Right.
 9        Q.    -- did you have to disturb or remove any
10   component parts inside the motor?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    Where did your father obtain replacement
13   brushes?
14        A.    From the same person that repaired the
15   motor for us.
16        Q.    This is the fellow in Leominster?
17        A.    This is the fellow in Leominster.  I
18   didn't go there that often.
19        Q.    How many times did you go to Leominster,
20   if you can give me your best estimate, as you sit
21   here today?
22        A.    Usually it was my father that went to
23   Leominster with him.
24        Q.    But you did go at least once?
0418
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    You told --
 3        A.    Yes.
 4        Q.    So can you give me an estimate -- your
 5   best estimate how many times you went to the shop in
 6   Leominster, if you can?
 7        A.    Twenty-two.
 8        Q.    Twenty-two.  Okay.
 9        A.    At least once a year.
10        Q.    Let me ask you a couple more questions
11   about the motors.  The motors that you encountered
12   while assisting your dad, do you know if they were AC
13   or DC motors?
14        A.    Yeah.  They were all AC motors, either
15   single-phase or three-phase.
16        Q.    And could you tell me, sir, what
17   horsepower range was there that you encountered with
18   respect to motors?
19        A.    Oh, the horsepower went anywhere from a
20   third horsepower up to 20 horsepower.
21        Q.    Okay.  And how about shaft size?  What
22   range of shaft sizes?
23        A.    I'm going to say anywhere from a half inch
24   up to at least -- on the larger ones were an inch to
0419
 1   an inch and a quarter.
 2        Q.    And were there voltage ratings of these
 3   motors?  Do you know?
 4        A.    That depended on the horsepower.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Was there a voltage range, if you
 6   know?
 7        A.    No.  There were -- single-phase was 20 to
 8   30 amps.  Three-phase went up to 60 amps.
 9        Q.    Was there -- were there -- did you replace
10   brushes -- strike that.
11       Could you -- the replacement of brushes, did you
12   replace brushes in both single-phase and three-phase
13   motors or only one of those types?
14        A.    No.  Both of them.
15        Q.    You testified this morning that you
16   remember encountering both General Electric and
17   Westinghouse motors in the field.  You also told us
18   that you believe there were one or more other brand
19   names of motors and you couldn't recall.  Do you have
20   any memory now, as you sit here, of any other brand
21   name motors that you encountered while assisting your
22   dad?
23        A.    Yes, but I do not remember the name of
24   them.
0420
 1        Q.    Okay.  And I take it, as you sit here
 2   today, you can't -- strike that.
 3       Are you able to tell me this afternoon at what
 4   sites there were particular brands of motor?
 5        A.    No, because there were many, and where we
 6   replaced motors, but not necessarily with the same
 7   brand of motor that was on there.  The only thing we
 8   replaced had the same shaft size.  It had the same
 9   whole configuration, meaning where the slots were in
10   the motor.  And, obviously, the horsepower.  The
11   voltage.  So if it was the same -- whatever kind of
12   motor was there we took off and replaced it with a
13   replacement motor, but the replacement motor could
14   have been either one.  We used many, as I say, in
15   both GE and Westinghouse.  We used many of them.
16        Q.    And did you also replace with other
17   brands?
18        A.    We had a few oddballs, so, yes.
19        Q.    Okay.
20        A.    I -- obviously, if I remembered the name
21   of them, I could tell you.  I can't.
22        Q.    Let me ask you, sir, where did you obtain
23   your replacement motors?
24        A.    Just over a period of time, if a
0421
 1   compressor failed and we could not fix the compressor
 2   and the motor was fine, then that would become a
 3   replacement motor.  So in other words, if we could
 4   salvage anything from the unit -- so that's how we --
 5   and we purchased some.  You could -- he would --
 6   meaning, the person that repaired our motors, he had
 7   motors that he would sell us.
 8        Q.    So he would sell you reused -- rebuilt --
 9        A.    A rebuilt motor.  Exactly.
10        Q.    So -- so your stock of replacement motors
11   was comprised of motors that you had taken from other
12   units and what the fellow in Leominster might have
13   available that met the same specifications as what
14   you needed to replace, correct?
15        A.    Correct.
16        Q.    And did you also buy new motors at all or
17   not, if you recall?
18        A.    Very seldom.  We did buy a lot of the
19   smaller fan circulating motors.
20        Q.    New?  You bought those new?
21        A.    Those were new.  And most of those were --
22   it just so happened GE was a -- a big -- and our
23   suppliers usually carried the GE line.
24        Q.    Now, those smaller fan circulating motors,
0422
 1   how many horsepower were those?
 2        A.    Those went right down to a third
 3   horsepower.  One-sixteenth, you know.  All they had
 4   to do was turn a fan blade.
 5        Q.    Yeah.  I was going to ask you, sir.  Those
 6   are driving -- those are driving a fan blade,
 7   correct?
 8        A.    They're just circulating the air.
 9        Q.    And, for example, what's the dimensions
10   of, let's say, that one-third horsepower?
11        A.    (Witness indicating)
12        Q.    Okay.  Well, he's got that on camera.  So
13   for the record, you're talking about the size of a
14   baseball?  Softball?
15        A.    Yeah.  Yeah, usually --
16        Q.    Grapefruit?
17        A.    A good -- yeah.  A baseball.  Softball.
18   You know, as far as the diameter, I'm going to even
19   say probably a baseball in most cases.
20        Q.    Okay.
21        A.    Obviously, you got into some of the bigger
22   ones on some of the air-conditioning units.  They're
23   a little bigger.  They went up -- oh, horsepower --
24   you know, I really -- I'd have to look at the
0423
 1   nameplate.
 2        Q.    That's okay.
 3        A.    Nameplates.
 4        Q.    And the motors that were driving the
 5   compressors, could you give me your best estimate of
 6   the range of sizes -- physical sizes of those motors,
 7   sir, if you remember?
 8        A.    Well, anywhere from eight inches in
 9   diameter to the bigger ones, two, two and a half
10   feet.
11        Q.    And could you describe, sir, did the
12   motors have a casing?
13        A.    Did?
14        Q.    Did the motors have casings?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    And what material were the casings made
17   of?
18        A.    As far as I know, steel.  I'm sure some
19   were aluminum, but --
20        Q.    And was there any insulation -- thermal
21   insulation on the outside of those casings?
22        A.    Motors, I don't know, because we took
23   very, very few apart.
24        Q.    I'm not -- I'm talking about the outside
0424
 1   of the casing.  That's my question.
 2        A.    No, there was no -- not on the outside.
 3        Q.    And do you recall, as you sit here today,
 4   whether there was any thermal insulation on the
 5   inside of any of these casings?
 6        A.    No, because we didn't take them apart.
 7        Q.    So if they were taken apart, they'd be
 8   taken apart by the fellow in Leominster, correct?
 9        A.    Correct.
10              MR. MOCCIA:  Okay.  I think I'm almost
11   done.  If I could just check my notes for a moment?
12              MR. BECERRA:  Sure.
13              MR. MOCCIA:  Thank you.
14   BY MR. MOCCIA:
15        Q.    Mr. Morton, a question -- I'd like you, if
16   you could -- you told us that you used an
17   electric-powered air hose to blow the units out of
18   dust, and I'd like you to, if you could, tell me --
19   first of all, these are electric -- this air blower
20   was something that had to be plugged into a circuit?
21        A.    Correct.
22        Q.    Okay.  And was it handheld?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    And what did it look like?  A hairdryer?
0425
 1        A.    A giant hairdryer.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And with respect to the
 3   refrigeration unit itself, you told us that you would
 4   use these blowers --
 5        A.    Yeah.
 6        Q.    -- for the purpose of ridding the system
 7   or the unit of dust?
 8        A.    Correct.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And these units, let's take the
10   units that had -- the older units that had component
11   parts that were not integrated.
12        A.    Right.
13        Q.    These are the old system.  Were those
14   units, were they open units, or did they have covers?
15        A.    No.  They were totally open.
16        Q.    Okay.  So where was the dust coming from?
17        A.    It was airborne.
18        Q.    So it was ambient dust?
19              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
20        A.    I don't know what was in the dust.
21        Q.    Well, you say "airborne" dust.  What does
22   that mean?
23        A.    Whatever got disturbed and got into the
24   atmosphere.
0426
 1        Q.    Okay.  That was my question.  Thank you.
 2   So the -- the air supply, you would hold -- you would
 3   hold this tool, if you will, in your hand?
 4        A.    Yeah.  The blower.
 5        Q.    The blower.  Turn on the electrical
 6   supply.  You had a switch?
 7        A.    Yup.
 8        Q.    And blow -- and blow it out?
 9        A.    Correct.
10        Q.    And how long did it take to blow the dust
11   from the system?
12        A.    To do one system, you know, you're looking
13   five minutes maybe.
14        Q.    Now, did you open any of the pieces of
15   equipment to blow out the insides of the equipment --
16   of the component parts rather?
17        A.    Most of the equipment had air -- not
18   screens, but --
19        Q.    Louvers?
20        A.    Louvers, cutouts, so air could pass
21   through.
22        Q.    Got it.  Okay.
23        A.    And that's where the dust came in.
24        Q.    Okay.  So this would be -- so your use of
0427
 1   this blower would be held in your hand over all the
 2   component -- over and around all the component parts
 3   that you've described this morning and this
 4   afternoon?
 5        A.    That is correct.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Did your dad hold any licenses in
 7   -- from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in
 8   refrigeration repair or maintenance, do you know?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Did you?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    Did your dad, to your knowledge, ever
13   apply for or obtain any permits to perform any work
14   from any municipality in which he was performing
15   work?
16        A.    Well, there's a reason, but, anyway, no to
17   your question.
18              MR. MOCCIA:  Okay.  Well, subject to the
19   others, I'm finished for now, and thank you for your
20   patience.  I appreciate it.  I know I took longer
21   than I expected, and thank you for hanging with me.
22              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  Thanks.
23              MR. BECERRA:  Let's take a quick break.
24              MR. HOOVER:  Yup.
0428
 1              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
 2   approximately 2:51, and this is the end of media
 3   number three.
 4              (A break was taken from 2:51 to 3:01 p.m.)
 5              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on the
 6   record.  The time is approximately 3:01, and this is
 7   the start of media number four.  Counsel, you may
 8   proceed.

10   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. SHANNON:
11        Q.    Hi, Mr. Morton.  My name is Anne Shannon.
12        A.    It's nice to meet you.
13        Q.    It's nice to meet you.  I represent
14   General Electric.  I have just a few questions for
15   you today.   Regarding your testimony that you worked
16   with GE motors, why do you think the motors were GE
17   motors?
18        A.    Because the motors had a steel plate on
19   them, and that had critical information.  The
20   horsepower, the speed of the motor, also the amperage
21   of the motor, the voltage.  So information that I
22   could match up another motor.  Plus, it also said
23   right on it "GE" motor.
24        Q.    Where was the plaque located on the motor
0429
 1   or the name?
 2        A.    Okay.  It was basically on the side
 3   towards the either right or left.  I don't remember.
 4   So you could visually see it.  Some of them were on
 5   the endplate.  So the different locations, I could
 6   not say exactly, you know, where it was located.  It
 7   was either on the ends or you could see it or on the
 8   sides.  I can't say whether it was left or right.
 9        Q.    Was "General Electric" written out, or was
10   it just their initials?
11        A.    Can you speak up just a little?  I'm
12   sorry.  I'm --
13        Q.    Was "General Electric," the word written
14   out, or was it just their initials?
15        A.    I don't remember.  Obviously, if I seen
16   the initials "GE," I mean, I know it was a General
17   Electric motor.  It might not have said "General
18   Electric."  It may have said "GE."  I don't know.
19        Q.    And what was the size of the information
20   that you just described that was on these -- on the
21   motors?
22        A.    Usually about a little bigger than a
23   business card that carry all the information about
24   that motor.
0430
 1        Q.    Did you ever see a General Electric manual
 2   related to the motors?
 3        A.    No.
 4        Q.    Did you ever speak to a General Electric
 5   representative?
 6        A.    No.
 7        Q.    Do you remember the color of the motors
 8   you worked on?  Were they all generally the same
 9   color?
10        A.    No.  I do not remember a specific color.
11              MS. SHANHON:  I think that's all the
12   questions I have for you.
13              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
14              MS. SHANNON:  Thank you.
15   
16   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. DOUCETT:
17        Q.    Good afternoon, Mr. Morton.
18        A.    Good afternoon.
19        Q.    My name is Sarah Doucett, and I want to
20   start off by asking you some questions about American
21   Standard, which you talked about this morning.
22       You had testified that you worked with American
23   Standard compressors at Fort Devens, and was that at
24   the mess halls, the NCO Club, and the Officers Club?
0431
 1        A.    Both the NCO Club and the Officers Club,
 2   yes.
 3        Q.    So not in the mess hall?
 4        A.    Not in the mess halls.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And these were all sealed units
 6   that you worked on?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    So you would take out an old sealed unit
 9   and put in a new sealed unit?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    And so you had no reason to do any work
12   with gaskets while you were doing that?
13        A.    Not on those.
14        Q.    Not on --
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Not on the American Standard compressors?
17        A.    Right.  On the air-conditioning, no.
18        Q.    And was all of this work done on weekends?
19        A.    Most -- 80 percent of it was weekends.
20   Twenty percent in evenings.
21        Q.    Okay.  And do you know how much of your
22   time -- of your work at Fort Devens was working in
23   the NCO Club and the Officers Club?
24        A.    Three to four hours at least one day a
0432
 1   month at each site.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And how long would it take for you
 3   to remove the seal -- the old sealed compressor and
 4   then put a new one in?
 5        A.    Two hours.
 6        Q.    For each time?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Do you recall how many American Standard
 9   compressors you worked on in those locations?
10        A.    Those two, probably a half a dozen times.
11        Q.    And how did you know that they were
12   American Standard compressors?
13        A.    There again, they had a nameplate on them.
14   The reason -- other than saying their name, it gave
15   the information that a technician would need to know
16   if he wanted to replace it.  It gave all that
17   information on the nameplate.  So it was just more
18   than a nameplate.
19        Q.    And it included the "American Standard"
20   name?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    Do you recall working with any other
23   American Standard compressors during your time at
24   Fort Devens?
0433
 1        A.    No.
 2        Q.    Okay.  I would now like to ask you a few
 3   questions about when -- also this morning you were
 4   talking about your work at the Park Street Diner.  Do
 5   you recall that testimony?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    While you were working at the Park Street
 8   Diner, you testified that you worked with an
 9   Ingersoll Rand pump; is that correct?
10        A.    That's correct.
11        Q.    Do you recall working with Ingersoll Rand
12   pumps specifically at any of those other jobsites or
13   only specifically at the Park Street Diner?
14        A.    There were others at different jobsites.
15   Mostly those were air where you needed an air
16   situation.  Air pressure of some type.
17        Q.    So all the Ingersoll Rand pumps you worked
18   on were -- you needed air pressure?
19        A.    Mostly air on Ingersoll Rand.
20        Q.    Do you recall the number of Ingersoll Rand
21   pumps that you worked on?
22        A.    No.  There was many over the years.
23        Q.    But you only specifically have
24   recollection at the Park Street Diner?
0434
 1        A.    No.
 2        Q.    So where else do you recall working on
 3   them?
 4        A.    Ayer Meat Market.  There was some air
 5   valves that needed air pressure, and there happened
 6   to be an Ingersoll Rand there at --
 7        Q.    So also at the meat -- at the Ayer Meat
 8   Market?
 9        A.    That was one site.
10        Q.    And how did you know the pumps that you
11   were working on were Ingersoll Rand pumps?
12        A.    How did I -- well, there again, name tags.
13        Q.    So you identified them by the nameplate?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Do you recall the size of the pumps that
16   you worked on?
17        A.    I'm going to say a half horsepower air
18   pump.
19        Q.    And you testified earlier that the work
20   that you did at the Park Street Diner was all new
21   insulation; is that correct?
22        A.    That's correct.
23        Q.    So you were physically attaching the new
24   pump to where they needed to go?
0435
 1        A.    Right.
 2        Q.    And is that all the work that you did on
 3   the Ingersoll Rand pumps?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    Was all of that work done on the jobsite
 6   at the Park Street Diner?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    So nothing was taken off-site to your
 9   house?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    Was this all weekend work as well or also
12   at night?
13        A.    Both.  Meaning, mostly weekends, but
14   emergency repair was done mostly at nights.
15        Q.    And do you recall how many weekends you
16   worked on the Ingersoll Rand pumps?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Is that everything that you recall about
19   working on Ingersoll Rand pumps?
20              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
21        A.    Yes.
22              MS. DOUCETT:  I have no further questions.
23   Thank you.
24              THE WITNESS:  Okay.

 2              MR. HOOVER:  Jose, I've got a little bit I
 3   just want to do before the medicals.
 4              MR. BECERRA:  Folks on the phone, the mic
 5   is here.  Whoever is ready to ask Mr. Morton
 6   questions.
 7              MR. SIMONS:  Hey, this is Mike Simons.  I
 8   can go.  Can you hear me all right, sir?
 9              MR. BECERRA:  Try again, Mike.
10              MR. SIMONS:  Sure.  I'm sorry.

12   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SIMONS:
13        Q.    Sir, can you hear me okay?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Great.  First of all, I want to apologize.
16   I had automobile trouble, which is why I'm not there
17   in person today.  I was there, and I met you on
18   Tuesday.  So I'm glad I got to do that at least, but
19   let's get going, and I'll do this as efficiently as I
20   can.  Okay?
21        A.    All right.
22        Q.    All right.  The first thing I want to ask
23   you is, you mentioned earlier today that you tied in
24   a series of valves in your home between the -- in the
0437
 1   time period when you had the oil and the wood boiler.
 2   Do you recall the brand name, trade name, or
 3   manufacturer's name of any of those valves?
 4        A.    Do you want to repeat that?  I didn't hear
 5   the end of it.
 6        Q.    Absolutely.  So you had tied in, you said,
 7   a series of valves between your oil and your wood
 8   boiler in your home when you had both of those
 9   boilers.  Do you recall the brand name, trade name,
10   or manufacturer's name of those valves?
11        A.    They were a Crane valve.
12        Q.    Okay.  How many valves are we talking
13   about?
14        A.    A series of four.
15        Q.    Four valves.  Okay.  What type of valves
16   were they?
17        A.    Gate valves.
18        Q.    Gate valves.  Okay.  Where did you
19   purchase those valves?
20        A.    Groton Refrigeration.
21        Q.    Okay.  So they came from your dad's
22   company?
23        A.    Yeah.  They were sort of left over.
24        Q.    Okay.  Well, all right.  So let me ask you
0438
 1   this then.  Do you know where -- were they new when
 2   you installed them in your home, or were they
 3   repurposed from prior use?
 4        A.    They were new.
 5        Q.    They were new.  Okay.  Do you know where
 6   your dad obtained those valves from?
 7        A.    No, I don't.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall when you did this
 9   work that you tied in these valves?
10        A.    In the early '80s.
11        Q.    Okay.  Can you walk me through -- well,
12   strike that.
13       What -- I always say this is a dumb question.
14   How did you know they were Crane valves?
15        A.    Because right on the pad, the "Crane" name
16   right on the stem of the valve.
17        Q.    Okay.  Was that embossed into the valve
18   itself?
19        A.    Yeah.  They were, like, embossed.
20   Embossed I'm going to say.
21        Q.    Okay.  Gotcha.  Okay.  Can you tell me
22   what style of writing the name --
23        A.    No, I couldn't.
24        Q.    Okay.  Can you tell me what those valves
0439
 1   were made out of?  What material?
 2        A.    I'm going to say either copper or brass.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Were they -- how were they
 4   installed into the system?  Were they soldered or
 5   threaded or brazed?
 6        A.    They were a soldered valve, so they were
 7   soldered in.
 8        Q.    Gotcha.  So there were no flanged gaskets
 9   involved --
10        A.    Right.
11        Q.    -- in the installation of those valves?
12   Sure.  Could you tell me the size of the valves in
13   terms of, like, an inlet and the outlet?
14        A.    Yeah.  Basically, there were two
15   inch-and-a-half and two-inch-and-a-quarter.
16        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have to do any kind of
17   repair or maintenance on those valves?
18        A.    Not on the valves.
19        Q.    Okay.  Are those valves still in place in
20   your house?
21        A.    Two out of four.
22        Q.    Okay.  Well, the two that the -- what
23   happened to them?  What caused you to get rid of
24   those valves?
0440
 1        A.    I got rid of the wood furnace or boiler.
 2        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  Let me ask you.  With
 3   regard to the installation of those valves, do you
 4   believe that the installation of those valves caused
 5   you to come into contact with asbestos?
 6              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.  You can
 7   answer, sir.
 8        A.    I'm going to say no.  Meaning -- well, I
 9   guess -- could you answer -- ask the question again?
10   I just want to make sure I answer it right.
11        Q.    Certainly.  Do you believe that installing
12   those new Crane valves in your home caused you to
13   come into contact with any asbestos-containing
14   materials?
15              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
16        A.    No, because I don't know if there was any
17   asbestos involved in the valves.
18        Q.    Okay.  And you said you never did any
19   maintenance of them, correct?
20        A.    Correct.
21        Q.    Okay.  With regard to the removal of the
22   two out of the four valves, do you believe that that
23   work caused you to come into contact with any
24   asbestos-containing materials?
0441
 1              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.  Lack of
 2   foundation.  It calls for speculation.  You can
 3   answer, sir.
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.  I want to move on.  I'm
 6   going to come back to Crane in a little bit, but I
 7   want to ask you about several different companies and
 8   ask you if you recall working with or around any
 9   products or equipment or with employees from these
10   companies in your lifetime.
11              MR. SIMONS:  And, Jose, do you want a
12   continuing objection?
13              MR. BECERRA:  Yes.  I was going to suggest
14   the same.  I appreciate that.  Thanks.
15              MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  No
16   problem.

12        Q.    Okay.  What kind of tile?
13              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
14   answered.  Mike, we went over this in detail
15   yesterday.  Go ahead, Mr. Morton.
16        A.    Asphalt.
17        Q.    Okay.  Is that a product that you
18   personally installed or removed?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall the years or the
21   decade in which you removed that product?
22              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
23   Mr. Morton, are you referring to the Armstrong tiles
24   that we discussed on Tuesday which you installed at
0443
 1   your family home?
 2              THE WITNESS:  Yes.
 3              MR. BECERRA:  Okay.  Mike, I don't know if
 4   that helps you out at all, but we did go over that in
 5   detail.
 6              MR. SIMONS:  That does help.  Thank you.

20        Q.    Rock Wool Manufacturing?
21        A.    Basically, you're asking me if I've heard
22   of these companies?
23        Q.    Well, if you heard of them, and if you
24   have, if you believe that you worked with or around
0446
 1   any products or equipment from them?
 2        A.    All I know is they make insulation.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Do you believe you ever worked with
 4   or around any insulation made by Rock Wool
 5   Manufacturing?
 6        A.    No.
 7        Q.    Okay.  How is it that you know they make
 8   insulation?
 9        A.    What's that?

11   make insulation?
12        A.    The name refers to it, as that's what they

15   Manufacturing, and then you said that you associate
16   them with insulation.
17        A.    Right.
18        Q.    So I wanted to know how it is that you
19   associate Rock Wool Manufacturing with insulation?

 6        Q.    Okay.  Georgia-Pacific?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Actually, we are through with that
 9   part.  I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
10       Can you tell me the first time that licensing of
11   refrigeration and air-conditioner technicians was
12   required in Massachusetts?
13        A.    I can't give you the exact date.  I can
14   give you approximate dates.
15        Q.    I'll take it.
16        A.    It was basically in the early -- between
17   '70 and '75, would be my guess.
18              MR. BECERRA:  And, again, Mr. Morton, we
19   don't want you to guess.
20              THE WITNESS:  You don't want me to guess.
21              MR. BECERRA:  But if it's an estimation
22   based on your personal knowledge, then that's a
23   little bit different.  Okay.
24        A.    That's what it is.  My personal knowledge.
0449
 1   If I stayed in it, I'd have to, yeah, put in for the
 2   license.  So I was out of it in '72.
 3        Q.    Okay.  That's your best estimate.  Okay.
 4   Are you familiar with the Massachusetts refrigeration
 5   and air-conditioning code?
 6        A.    No.
 7        Q.    Okay.  So you wouldn't be able -- am I
 8   correct that you wouldn't be able to tell me when
 9   that code first went into effect?
10        A.    All I could do is give you the estimate,
11   which was in the '70s.  Early '70s.
12        Q.    Okay.  Would you agree that if the code
13   was in effect at the time your father was working in
14   the industry, he would have complied with any
15   regulations set forth by that code?
16              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  It assumes
17   facts.  It calls for speculation.  It's completely
18   improper.  You can answer, Mr. Morton.
19        A.    It's -- I would be speculating.  I don't
20   know what my father would have done.
21        Q.    Okay.  Did your father subscribe to or
22   receive any refrigeration trade periodicals or
23   publications?
24        A.    Not that I'm aware of.
0450
 1        Q.    Okay.  So it is fair to say you're not
 2   aware as to whether he subscribed to or received Ice
 3   & Refrigeration Journal?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever receive any
 6   refrigeration or trade publications?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Was your father a member of the
 9   American Society of Refrigeration Engineers?
10        A.    I do not know.
11        Q.    Okay.  Were you ever a member of that?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Was your dad, to your knowledge, ever a
14   member of any professional societies?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Were you ever a member of any of
17   professional societies?
18        A.    No.
19        Q.    Okay.  I want to ask you very briefly
20   about something else.  A different topic.  Your -- I
21   did review -- was able to locate your father's
22   obituary notice, and I know you don't have it in
23   front of you, and I apologize.  I'm going to read you
24   a very brief section of it, and let me ask you, first
0451
 1   of all, if this seems correct to you.  "He had been
 2   employed as a refrigeration engineer with a post
 3   engineer at Fort Devens for over 29 years until his
 4   retirement in 1969."  Does that sound correct?
 5        A.    I don't have any of that information, so I
 6   really cannot answer it.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Well, you testified that he was a
 8   refrigeration engineer with -- at Fort Devens?
 9        A.    That's correct.
10        Q.    Okay.  I'll represent that the obituary
11   goes on to say he had previously worked for the JP
12   Sullivan Packing Company in Ayer for many years.  Do
13   you know what the JP Sullivan Packing Company was or
14   did?
15        A.    Yes.  It was a cold storage where they
16   stored apples.
17        Q.    Okay.  And do you know what your father
18   did for JP Sullivan?
19        A.    Maintained the cold storage.
20        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever work with him at JP
21   Sullivan?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Okay.  The last thing I'm going to
24   represent to you is that that's the entirety
0452
 1   contained in this obituary about your father's work
 2   history.  I'll represent that there is no reference
 3   to Groton Refrigeration, and so my question is, if
 4   you know, do you know why there was no mention of his
 5   company?
 6              MR. BECERRA:  Mike, are you serious?  That
 7   question is completely improper.  It calls for
 8   speculation.  You're asking him to go into the mind
 9   of whoever published this obituary, which we don't
10   have, which you didn't produce because you're not
11   here today, and you're asking him to speculate.  This
12   type of question would never, never be allowed at
13   trial.  It's completely improper, and I see no
14   point --
15              MR. SIMONS:  Can he answer that?
16              MR. BECERRA:  And I see no point in it
17   whatsoever, but I'll allow Mr. Morton to answer a
18   question that has no relevance in this case
19   whatsoever.  Go ahead, Mr. Morton.  Do you know why
20   the obituary doesn't reference --
21              MR. SIMONS:  Hold on.  Before you answer,
22   sir -- before you answer, sir, I just want to explain
23   to you, Jose, the reason why I'm asking the question
24   -- I'm actually not asking him to speculate.  I'm
0453
 1   asking if he knows, and if his answer is "I don't
 2   know," then his answer is "I don't know."  I don't
 3   want him to speculate.  Quite the contrary.
 4              MR. BECERRA:  Go ahead, Mr. Morton, so we
 5   can move on.
 6        A.    Because Groton Refrigeration was basically
 7   a part-time side job, and how he took care of the
 8   books and whether he did it as a cash business, I
 9   don't know.
10        Q.    Fair enough.  Hold on one second, please.
11   Okay.  Okay.  Let me ask you.  When was the first
12   time you personally learned about the potential
13   health hazards of asbestos?
14        A.    1985.
15        Q.    Okay.  And what happened?  What occurred
16   in 1985 that caused you to learn about the potential
17   hazards of asbestos?
18        A.    I had a close neighbor that was diagnosed
19   with asbestos cancer in 1985.  He worked at H & V,
20   which was Hollingsworth & Vose in West Groton, and he
21   came down with a disease in '85 and died shortly
22   after.
23        Q.    Okay.  Do you -- could you tell me -- and
24   I'm sorry to hear that.  Could you tell me your
0454
 1   neighbor's name?
 2        A.    Joe Jacobs.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever work with Mr. Jacobs?
 4        A.    No, I did not.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Let me ask you this.  Do you
 6   believe you came into contact with asbestos after
 7   1985?
 8              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.  You can
 9   answer, sir.
10        A.    I do not know.
11        Q.    Okay.  How, if at all, did you change your
12   work practices after 19 -- after learning about the
13   potential health hazards of asbestos in 1985?
14              MR. BECERRA:  The same objection.
15        A.    Basically, none at that point.
16        Q.    Okay.  All right.  I'd like to talk with
17   you now a little bit more about the client I'm here
18   for today, which is a company called Crane Co.  We
19   talked about the Crane Co. valves you installed in
20   your home when we first started our discussion.  I'm
21   going to talk with you about Crane Co. a little bit
22   more now.  Okay?
23        A.    Yup.
24        Q.    Okay.  Are you good to continue, or do you
0455
 1   need to take a break?
 2        A.    No.  I'm fine.  Continue.
 3        Q.    All right.  Well, if you do need to take a
 4   break, you just let me know.
 5       I understand that from your earlier testimony you
 6   installed a Crane Co. circulating pump in your
 7   present home at 180 Gay Road; is that correct?
 8              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
 9   answered.
10        A.    A circulating --
11              THE WITNESS:  Can I answer that?
12              MR. BECERRA:  Yeah.
13        A.    A circulating pump, yes.
14        Q.    Okay.  Let's start with that specific
15   pump.  Do you recall where you purchased that pump?
16        A.    No, I do not.
17        Q.    Was it a new pump when you purchased it?
18        A.    It was one of the old pumps I took off of
19   one of the boilers that I had taken out.
20        Q.    Okay.  So it was -- it was a pump that you
21   removed from -- that had already been in your home on
22   one boiler and you that reinstalled with the new
23   boiler?
24        A.    Correct.
0456
 1        Q.    Okay.  So it wasn't new then?
 2        A.    It was not new.
 3        Q.    Okay.  How long had that pump been in
 4   place, if you know, prior to the time you purchased
 5   the home?
 6        A.    I do not know.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Did you know the maintenance
 8   history on that pump prior to your purchase of the
 9   home?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    Okay.  Could you walk me through the
12   process of removing that pump from the boiler it was
13   originally associated with?
14        A.    Well, you had two bolts that you had to
15   remove.  Then you had two gaskets that you had to
16   clean the flanges, and before you installed -- in
17   this case, it was a used pump, and then you could
18   install the used pump with the new gaskets.
19        Q.    Okay.  You talked earlier about the
20   process of removing gaskets from flanges.  Would it
21   be the same process that you did for removing the
22   flanges from this particular pump?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    Okay.  Did you use any kind of solvent
0457
 1   when you removed the gaskets from this particular
 2   pump?
 3        A.    No.  You scraped it.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  Let me ask you.  The gaskets
 5   you removed were in place when you first purchased
 6   the home, correct?
 7        A.    Correct.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So you don't know if these gaskets
 9   -- those flanged gaskets were original to the pump or
10   not; is that correct?
11        A.    That's correct.
12        Q.    Okay.  Do you know the chemical
13   composition of those gaskets that were originally on
14   the pump?  Flanged gaskets?
15        A.    Yeah.  They were a rubber material.
16        Q.    Okay.  Could you describe the color of
17   those original flange gaskets?
18        A.    Yeah.  They were sort of a reddish color,
19   but -- a reddish rubber color.  Meaning, nothing
20   bright, but a reddish color.
21        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  How long did it take to
22   physically remove those two flanged gaskets?
23        A.    Fifteen minutes.
24        Q.    Okay.  Fifteen minutes in total?
0458
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    Okay.  When you -- after you had unbolted
 3   the pump and removed the gaskets, how did you go
 4   about installing the -- this pump into the new system
 5   with the new boiler?
 6        A.    You just replace the existing pump.  So it
 7   went in the very same way that the old one came out,
 8   with a gasket on the bottom and a gasket on the top,
 9   and then you put your two nuts and bolts back
10   together and tightened them up.
11        Q.    Okay.  Were the new gaskets that you used,
12   were they precut to size, or did you have to --
13        A.    They were precut.
14        Q.    Okay.  And where did you obtain the new
15   precut gaskets from?
16        A.    Those happened to be obtained to Fitchburg
17   Plumbing.
18        Q.    Okay.  And do you recall the brand name,
19   trade name, or manufacturer's name --
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    -- of the new flanged gasket?
22        A.    They were just a standard precut gasket to
23   replace on the circulating pumps.
24        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever do any -- have you
0459
 1   ever done any other maintenance or repair work to
 2   that pump?
 3        A.    No.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Have you -- so you've never had to
 5   open up the pump to work with any internal
 6   components; is that correct?
 7        A.    That's correct.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Is that pump still in place in your
 9   home?
10        A.    Yes, it is.
11        Q.    Okay.  Has it been in place since the day
12   you installed it in the new system?
13        A.    Do you want to repeat that question,
14   please?
15        Q.    Sure.  And I'm not sure that was such a
16   good question now that I'm thinking about it.
17       Since you installed that pump to work with the
18   new boiler, have you ever had to take that pump out
19   of line, or has it just been in service since then?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Okay.  No, you haven't had to take it out
22   of line?  Is that --
23        A.    I haven't touched it since I put it on.
24        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.
0460
 1   Can you tell me the physical dimensions of that pump?
 2   The size?  The weight?
 3        A.    Basically, an inch and a half.  Meaning,
 4   pump.  The weight would be approximate.  Three
 5   pounds.  It would be probably five inches in total
 6   length.  Three inches in diameter.
 7        Q.    Thank you.  And when you said an inch and
 8   a half before, were you referring to, like, the inlet
 9   or the outlet on that pump?
10        A.    Yes.  Yup.  That pump is installed on the
11   return line, which is an inch-and-a-half copper.
12        Q.    Gotcha.  And just so I'm clear, what kind
13   of material is flowing through that pump?  You said
14   it's on a return line.
15        A.    Hot water.
16        Q.    Hot water.  Okay.  Do you know the
17   temperature of the water that's flowing through that?
18        A.    That's the return line, so 160 to 180.
19        Q.    Okay.  Can you tell me the color of this
20   pump?
21        A.    I'm not going to guess on the color.
22        Q.    Okay.  One second here.  I don't think I
23   asked this.  If I did, I apologize.  Can you tell me
24   when you took this pump, you know, out of its
0461
 1   original line and then put it in the new line?
 2        A.    In order words, when I took it off the
 3   original --
 4        Q.    Yes.
 5        A.    Basically, it came off the original
 6   boiler, which would have been somewhere in the early
 7   '80s.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.  And just so I'm clear,
 9   given that you used precut flanged gaskets on this
10   pump when you reinstalled it, am I correct that you
11   didn't have to cut or manipulate or otherwise, you
12   know, do anything to the precut gaskets?
13        A.    That's correct.
14        Q.    Okay.  All right.  I understand that you
15   weren't there when this pump was originally installed
16   in your home.  So am I correct that you don't know
17   what packaging it came in?
18        A.    Correct.
19        Q.    Okay.  Had the -- was there -- strike
20   that.
21       Did you ever possess any, like, operation manual
22   or instruction manual for this pump?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    Okay.  To your knowledge, have you ever
0462
 1   talked with any Crane Co. representative about this
 2   pump?
 3        A.    No.
 4        Q.    To your knowledge, have you ever talked
 5   with any Crane Co. representative about any of the
 6   company's products?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Is there any other work that you
 9   have done with this pump that we have not yet
10   discussed?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    Okay.  All right.  So let's move on from
13   -- from the pump in your home.
14       You testified that you encountered Crane Co.
15   pumps during your work with your father; is that
16   correct?
17        A.    That's correct.
18        Q.    Okay.  Are you able to identify any
19   specific jobsite, or is it just a general memory that
20   Crane Co. is one of the brands of pumps that you
21   encountered throughout your career with your father?
22        A.    Basically -- I guess you're going to have
23   to repeat that question just so I want to make sure I
24   answer it the proper way.
0463
 1        Q.    Absolutely.  Do you recall working with or
 2   around a Crane Co. pump at any specific jobsites with
 3   your father, or do you -- rather, do you just have a
 4   memory that this was a brand of pump which you
 5   encountered generally over your career working with
 6   your father?
 7        A.    Just -- I have -- yes, generally.  Not one
 8   particular jobsite.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.  As I understood it, one
10   of the types of work that you did with Crane Co.
11   pumps was you would install new ones, correct, with
12   your father?
13        A.    Correct.
14        Q.    Okay.  You described for me the process of
15   installing a pump in your home -- a Crane Co. pump in
16   your own home.  Would the process be the same with
17   regard to the installation of any Crane Co. pump at
18   any of the jobsites you may have encountered one?
19              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  Anything different about the
22   installation process between what you testified about
23   in terms of installing one in your home versus
24   installing one at a jobsite with your dad?
0464
 1        A.    Basically, no.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Could you tell me the size ranges
 3   of the Crane Co. pumps that you encountered in the
 4   field with your father?
 5        A.    I really can't you give the exact
 6   horsepower because we changed -- did not change a
 7   lot.  We changed a few.
 8        Q.    When you say "a few," are you able to give
 9   me a good faith estimate, without guessing, as to
10   what you mean by "a few"?
11        A.    Without guessing, no.  That was not a
12   large situation.  In other words, they were
13   unfortunately very dependable.  So I was not changing
14   them on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.
15        Q.    Okay.  Why do you say "unfortunately" that
16   they were dependable?
17        A.    Well, because when they're working, I
18   didn't make any money.
19        Q.    Fair enough.  Okay.  With regard to any of
20   the Crane Co. pumps that you encountered in the field
21   with your father, could you tell me where was the
22   name located?  For example, was it on the pump
23   itself?  Was it on a separate nameplate?  Was it on a
24   tag?
0465
 1        A.    It was on the pump itself.
 2        Q.    Would this be the same situation as the
 3   pump in your home where it was embossed into the
 4   valve?
 5        A.    No.  It was a nameplate.
 6        Q.    Gotcha.  Do you recall what color the
 7   nameplate itself was?
 8        A.    No.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Do you know if it was a plastic
10   nameplate or a steel nameplate or something else?
11        A.    Yeah.  It was a metal nameplate.
12        Q.    Okay.  What information do you recall
13   being contained on that nameplate?
14        A.    What was the name on that nameplate?
15        Q.    No.  And I apologize if my question wasn't
16   clear.  What information do you recall seeing on that
17   nameplate?
18        A.    What is the name?  Is that what you're --
19        Q.    No.  What information do you recall
20   seeing --
21        A.    Oh, information.  Sorry.  My hearing --
22        Q.    That's okay.
23        A.    My hearing is not that good.
24        Q.    No worries.
0466
 1        A.    Basically, it gave the horsepower and the
 2   electrical information.  The amperage that the motor
 3   drew and technical information other than the size of
 4   the pump.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Were these pumps horizontal or
 6   vertically oriented pumps?
 7        A.    Horizontal.
 8        Q.    And do you know, were they single-stage or
 9   multistage pumps?
10        A.    They were single-phase.
11        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever install a new Crane
12   Co. pump out in the field with your father?  And by
13   "new," I mean straight out of the box basically.
14   Straight out of the packaging.
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  I understand that you've already
17   told me about the frequency with which you did that.
18   Can you tell me -- describe the packaging that any of
19   those pumps came in?
20        A.    No.  Except they were a cardboard material
21   that the box was made out of.  I cannot tell you the
22   color or anything like that.
23        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall if the pumps came
24   with any -- the new pumps came with any written
0467
 1   materials?
 2        A.    Yes, it did.
 3        Q.    Do you recall what types of written
 4   materials those pumps came with?
 5        A.    What type of written material?
 6        Q.    Yes, sir.
 7        A.    Basically, it told you about the pump, how
 8   much water it would circulate, and all that kind of
 9   stuff.  I mean, it was basically technical
10   information.
11        Q.    Would -- I understand you started with
12   your father at a fairly young age.  Would you
13   personally review those manuals, or would your father
14   review those manuals?
15        A.    Basically, my father would in many cases.
16        Q.    And then would he convey to you whatever
17   information he felt needed to be conveyed to you?
18        A.    Right.
19        Q.    Okay.  Would these pumps -- how were they
20   -- how did they fit into the various systems?  Were
21   they flanged?  Were they soldered?  Were they brazed?
22   Were they threaded?  Was it some kind of combination?
23        A.    Usually it was a soldered flange.
24        Q.    Okay.  Do you know the brand name, trade
0468
 1   name, or manufacturer's name of the -- strike that.
 2       Am I correct that you used a gasket on this -- on
 3   the flanges?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Were those gaskets precut?
 6        A.    Yes, they were.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Do you know the brand name, trade
 8   name, or manufacturer's name of the gaskets?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Okay.  Could you describe the color of the
11   gaskets?
12        A.    A dull, reddish color.
13        Q.    Were they the same kind of rubber-type
14   material that you talked about earlier when we talked
15   about the pump in your own home?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Okay.  And where did you obtain those new
18   gaskets from?
19        A.    Basically, they came with the pump.
20        Q.    They came in the box with --
21        A.    You know, I say that, but now that I think
22   about it, I am not sure if they came with the pump or
23   not.  They are a standard-size gasket on a
24   circulating pump for a heater.
0469
 1        Q.    Okay.  As far as I know, you said you
 2   couldn't give me, like, the ranges of the horsepower
 3   on these pumps.  Are you able to tell me, like, the
 4   range of the inlets -- the inlets and outlets on
 5   these pumps that you encountered out in the field
 6   with your dad?
 7        A.    I think what you're asking me, most of
 8   them were the inch-and-a-half flange to the pump.
 9        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  Thank you.  That's
10   helpful.  How long would it take to install the new
11   flanged gasket on one of these pumps?
12        A.    It was not a long process.  Twenty minutes
13   maybe.
14        Q.    And did you need to cut or slice or grind
15   or any -- manipulate in any other way these precut
16   flanged gaskets?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Do you recall the first
19   time you encountered a Crane Co. pump out in the
20   field?
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    Do you recall the last time you
23   encountered one out in the field?
24        A.    No.
0470
 1        Q.    Okay.  Let's move on to another part of
 2   this.  Did you ever have to do any maintenance work
 3   on any previously installed Crane Co. pump that you
 4   encountered in the field?
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever do any removal of any
 7   Crane Co. pump that was previously installed that you
 8   encountered out in the field?
 9        A.    I did not do a lot, but we did a few.  We
10   did not have a lot of those pumps out there.
11        Q.    Okay.  You talked earlier about the
12   process of removing the Crane Co. pump from your
13   home.  Would that be the same process that you
14   followed to remove one from the field?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  Anything different about the way
17   you removed that pump from your home versus the way
18   you'd remove them -- one you encountered in the
19   field?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Okay.  And if you did encounter a Crane
22   Co. pump that you had to remove out in the field, am
23   I correct that you wouldn't know the maintenance
24   history of that pump?
0471
 1        A.    Right.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And am I correct that given that
 3   you didn't know the maintenance history of those
 4   pumps, you wouldn't know whether -- or which
 5   components were original to the pumps or not; is that
 6   correct?
 7        A.    That's correct.
 8        Q.    Okay.  Sir, is there any other work that
 9   you recall doing -- personally doing with or being
10   around others when you were working on a Crane Co.
11   pump which we haven't discussed?
12        A.    I did not understand the question.
13        Q.    Okay.  Let's try that again then, and I
14   apologize.  Is there any other work on a Crane Co.
15   pump that you personally did which we haven't
16   discussed?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Okay.  Is there any other work that you
19   recall observing other people doing in your presence
20   on a Crane Co. pump that we haven't already
21   discussed?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Okay.  I'm going to move on to another
24   product line.  Are you able to keep going for a
0472
 1   little bit, or do you want to take a break?
 2              THE WITNESS:  I'd like to take a break.
 3              MR. SIMONS:  Absolutely, sir.  I'll be
 4   here, and you just let me know when you're ready to
 5   continue.
 6              THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Thank you.
 7              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
 8   approximately 4:07, and we are off the record.
 9              (A break was taken from 4:07 to 4:16 p.m.)
10              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
11   approximately 4:16, and we are back on the record.
12   Counsel, you may proceed.
13              MR. SIMONS:  Thank you very much.
14   BY MR. SIMONS:
15        Q.    All right, sir.  We are back.  I have -- I
16   always say that just taking breaks, it gives me a
17   chance to think about things I might have neglected
18   to ask that I realize I need to ask.  So I'm going to
19   clean up a couple of things first, and then we'll
20   move on to a different product.
21       You mentioned that your neighbor came down with
22   an asbestos-related disease in 1985.  What did your
23   neighbor do for work at H & V?
24        A.    He -- I don't know his actual job.  I do
0473
 1   know that they had a lot of corrugated boxes that
 2   different material came in, and I know on weekends he
 3   would load up his trailer and take that cardboard to
 4   a recycling place and make a few extra dollars.  What
 5   his actual job at H & V was, I do not know.
 6        Q.    Fair enough.  Did he ever discuss with you
 7   how he felt he contracted an asbestos-related
 8   disease?
 9        A.    You've got to know more of the -- well,
10   they were sure he came down with it because of
11   exposure at H & V, which they made filters and paper.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    What type of filters?  I'm not sure, but
14   it was shortly after that -- well, I say "shortly" --
15   about 10 years later, his wife came down with the
16   same disease, asbestos-related cancer, and she died
17   very shortly after that.  Then one of his daughters
18   -- well, not -- his daughter came down with it eight
19   years later with the same disease, and she died of
20   it.  So it was quite a tragedy for the neighborhood,
21   but all three were asbestos-related cancer.
22        Q.    Okay.
23        A.    That's --
24        Q.    Do you recall -- I'm so sorry.  I didn't
0474
 1   mean to interrupt.  Please finish.
 2        A.    Do I recall what?
 3        Q.    Oh, okay, sir.  I'm sorry.  I thought I --
 4   I apologize.  I thought I interrupted you.  Do you
 5   recall his wife's name?
 6        A.    Alice.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And do you recall their daughter's
 8   name?
 9        A.    Well, unfortunately, I think I have mixed
10   those up.  I think Alice was the daughter.  I'm not
11   sure of his wife's first name.
12        Q.    Okay.  And when you say "asbestos cancer,"
13   do you know if it was lung cancer or colon cancer or
14   if it was mesothelioma?
15        A.    Ethelioma (sic).
16        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  I asked you
17   a question regarding Crane Co., but did you ever
18   speak with any manufacturer representatives for any
19   of the products or equipment you worked with while
20   you were assisting your dad?
21        A.    No.  Well --
22        Q.    Okay.
23        A.    All right.
24        Q.    No.  I don't want to cut you off.  You
0475
 1   said "no."  Then you said "well."  Do you have
 2   something else to add?  If you do, now is the time.
 3        A.    I'm not sure if they were taking the
 4   engineer that used to work with us and advise us on
 5   different projects.
 6        Q.    Gotcha.  That was the engineer from the
 7   supply company, right?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Okay.  But to your knowledge, did he work
10   for any of the products or equipment manufacturers
11   or --
12        A.    I do not know that answer.
13        Q.    Okay.  Fair enough.  Thank you.  I also
14   want to ask you very, very briefly, sir, are you
15   familiar with OSHA?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Okay.  And what is your understanding of
18   OSHA?
19        A.    They're a safety organization.
20        Q.    Okay.  To your knowledge -- well, strike
21   that because I think it's --
22       Am I correct that you stopped assisting your dad
23   on jobsites prior to 1972?
24        A.    Not prior to 1972.
0476
 1        Q.    Okay.  So you were still going out on
 2   jobsites as of '72?
 3        A.    No.  He basically closed Groton
 4   Refrigeration in 1972.
 5        Q.    Okay.  All right.  I'll move on.  Thank
 6   you.  I appreciate it.  The last thing I want to talk
 7   to you about is you mentioned valves, and we've
 8   talked about the Crane Co. valves that you installed
 9   and removed in your home earlier today.  I now want
10   to talk to you -- you said that the circulating pumps
11   that you encountered in the field typically came with
12   an expansion valve which you believe was from the
13   same manufacturer.  Is that a correct summary of your
14   testimony?
15        A.    That's correct.
16        Q.    Okay.  I know you said you only worked
17   with or around a few Crane Co. pumps.  Would it be
18   fair to say, then, that you also only worked with or
19   around a few Crane Co. expansion valves out in the
20   field while assisting your dad?
21        A.    We worked with many different ones.  So I
22   would say it was more than a few, but I could not say
23   how many.
24        Q.    Okay.  When you say "many different ones,"
0477
 1   what --
 2        A.    Because every valve I put on, I didn't pay
 3   attention to the manufacturer.
 4        Q.    Fair enough.  Okay.  Let me ask you.  With
 5   regard to the Crane Co. pumps that you worked with,
 6   are you able to give me a good faith estimate without
 7   guessing of how many pumps that you encountered were
 8   Crane Co. pumps versus the other brand of pumps that
 9   you encountered?
10        A.    No, I cannot.
11        Q.    Okay.  Are you able to -- the same
12   question for valves.  Are you able to tell me the
13   percentage of Crane Co. valves you encountered in the
14   field while assisting your dad as opposed to other
15   brands of valves which you worked with and around?
16        A.    No, I cannot.
17        Q.    Okay.  Am I correct that you were never in
18   charge of ordering products for your father's
19   company?
20        A.    You're correct.
21        Q.    Okay.  And would he have been the person
22   in charge?
23        A.    I was not in charge.
24        Q.    Right.  I understand you weren't.  Am I
0478
 1   correct that your father was the one who was in
 2   charge of ordering products and supplies --
 3        A.    Yes.
 4        Q.    -- for the company?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Did he have accounts with any
 7   particular supply houses?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Could you tell me which one or ones you
10   believe he had accounts with?
11        A.    Standard Supply in Worcester.
12        Q.    Okay.  Did your father ever purchase
13   expansion valves for use in his business
14   independently of his purchase of an accompanying pump
15   or if -- do you understand my question?
16        A.    Not really.  I think what your question
17   is, is did he purchase these things from different
18   supply companies, and the answer is no.
19        Q.    No.  The answer is no.  Okay.  Well, and I
20   appreciate that, and my question was bad, so I'm
21   going to try it again.
22       You testified that the expansion -- I'm sorry --
23   that the pumps came with a -- typically came with an
24   expansion valve, right?
0479
 1        A.    The pumps had nothing to do with the
 2   expansion valve.
 3        Q.    Okay.  I'm a little confused then.  I --
 4   maybe I misunderstood your testimony.  I thought that
 5   the -- you indicated that the pumps were typically
 6   the same manufacturer as the expansion -- as the
 7   associated expansion valve?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Is that correct?
10        A.    That's correct.
11        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  But they weren't -- they
12   didn't come in the same package?
13        A.    Right.
14        Q.    Okay.  So they -- gotcha.  All right.  So
15   if you were -- if your dad was purchasing a brand X
16   pump, he would typically then go ahead and purchase a
17   brand X expansion valve; is that correct?
18        A.    He didn't have to purchase the same type.
19   Put it that way, if that makes sense.
20        Q.    It does.  Let me try and clarify that a
21   little bit for my own sake.  So you didn't have to
22   use, for example, a Crane Co. expansion valve with a
23   Crane Co. pump?
24        A.    Correct.
0480
 1        Q.    That's correct.  Okay.  Was there any
 2   rationale or formula or some reasoning why you --
 3   when you would use a Crane Co. expansion valve with a
 4   Crane Co. pump?
 5        A.    No.  The two were different functions.
 6   Put it that way.
 7        Q.    Okay.
 8        A.    So you could use -- you did not have to
 9   use the same.
10        Q.    Okay.  So if they did happen to be the
11   same, it was just luck of the draw; it wasn't by
12   design?  Is that fair to say?
13        A.    That's correct to say.
14        Q.    Gotcha.  Thank you.  All right.  So let's
15   talk about those valves.  Did your dad purchase Crane
16   Co. expansion valves for use in his business?
17        A.    All I can say is he did purchase them, and
18   they -- all I can tell you is where they came from.
19        Q.    Okay.  All right.  So he did purchase
20   them, and you already told me where he purchased,
21   correct?
22        A.    Yeah.
23        Q.    We talked about that.  Okay.  Can you tell
24   me the physical dimensions of those expansion valves?
0481
 1        A.    No, I really can't.  I can tell you one
 2   took in a half-inch to five-eighths flare nut, and
 3   the other connection was anywhere from a quarter- to
 4   three-quarter-inch flare nut.
 5        Q.    Okay.  So were these valves -- they were
 6   connected in the system by -- well, strike that.
 7       How were they connected to the systems?  Were
 8   they soldered?  Were they brazed?  Were they
 9   threaded?  Were they flanged?  Were they some
10   combination?
11        A.    They were flanged.
12        Q.    Okay.  And --
13        A.    Well --
14        Q.    Did you -- sorry.  Go ahead.
15        A.    They were connected by flare nuts.  So,
16   yes, a flange.
17        Q.    Okay.  Gotcha.  Did you ever install or
18   assist your father in installing a new Crane Co.
19   expansion valve?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  Much like the pumps, is it fair to
22   say that you don't recall a specific location where
23   you installed a new Crane Co. expansion valve, but
24   rather you have a general memory of installing them
0482
 1   over the course of the time you assisted your father?
 2        A.    All I can say is installed many of them
 3   over a period of time.
 4        Q.    Okay.  But you can't give me any specific
 5   locations; is that correct?
 6        A.    That's correct.
 7        Q.    Okay.  What type of material flowed
 8   through the Crane Co. expansion valves?
 9        A.    Basically, brass and copper.
10        Q.    Okay.  So they were made of brass and
11   copper.  Can you tell me what type of material flowed
12   through the valves?
13        A.    Freon gas.
14        Q.    Freon gas.  Okay.  And what was the
15   temperature of that freon gas?
16        A.    Without referring to a manual, I -- I
17   can't give you the actual temperatures.
18        Q.    Understood.  Are you able to give, without
19   guessing, a good faith estimate of the temperature of
20   that freon gas?
21        A.    No.  I'm not even going to try.
22        Q.    Fair enough.  All right.  When a new --
23   when you purchased a new Crane Co. expansion valve,
24   what kind of packaging did it come in?
0483
 1        A.    They came in a fairly light cardboard box.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember what, if anything,
 3   was written on the box itself?
 4        A.    No, I don't remember that.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall what, if anything,
 6   was -- identified the valve as a Crane Co. valve?
 7        A.    No, I don't for the simple fact I paid
 8   attention to the size of the inlet and the outlet of
 9   the valve.  Not so much the name or anything else.
10        Q.    Okay.  Let me ask you this.  You talked
11   about the process of installing valves in your
12   home -- Crane Co. valves.  Would it be the same
13   process for installing one of these Crane Co.
14   expansion valves out in the field when you were
15   assisting your father?
16        A.    Out in the field, you would use these.  In
17   the home, no.
18        Q.    Correct.  And that's a good clarification.
19   The -- but the installation process itself, I
20   understand that you would not use these valves in a
21   home, but the process of installing a new valve, was
22   it the same process that you went through to install
23   a Crane Co. expansion valve in the field as you used
24   to install, you know, one of the gate valves in your
0484
 1   home?
 2        A.    No, because basically you didn't use an
 3   expansion valve in the house.
 4        Q.    Okay.  So I guess in that case can you
 5   describe for me how you would install a new Crane Co.
 6   expansion valve out in the field?
 7        A.    I just described that.  You -- you pumped
 8   down a system --
 9        Q.    Well, okay --
10        A.    -- and you had two flare nuts, and that's
11   what held the valve in there, and, obviously, you'd
12   loosen them up and take the valve out, and then
13   replace it with a new one.
14        Q.    Okay.  The -- where did you obtain the new
15   -- well, strike that.
16       Where did you obtain the new gasket material that
17   you would use when you were installing a new Crane
18   expansion valve?
19        A.    There was no packing material on the
20   expansion valve.  That was put --
21              MR. BECERRA:  Mr. Morton, listen to his
22   questions carefully.  Okay?  I know it's getting late
23   in the day, but just listen as carefully as you can.
24   He's asking about gaskets, not packing.
0485
 1   BY MR. SIMONS:
 2        Q.    Okay.  Let me -- let me -- let me do a few
 3   things here.
 4       First, I just want to clarify that there was no
 5   packing in the expansion valves; is that correct?
 6        A.    That's correct.
 7        Q.    Okay.  With regard to the flange gaskets
 8   that you used when installing a new Crane Co.
 9   expansion valve, where did you get those new flange
10   gaskets from?
11        A.    Are you talking about the circulating
12   Crane pump?
13        Q.    No, sir.
14              MR. SIMONS:  Jose, do you want to talk for
15   a second?
16              MR. BECERRA:  Yeah.  Why don't we take a
17   -- why don't we take a quick little break.
18              MR. SIMONS:  Okay.  That's fine.
19              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
20   approximately 4:37, and we are off the record.
21              (A break was taken from 4:37 to 4:49 p.m.)
22              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
23   approximately 4:49.  We are back on the record.  This
24   is still media number four.  Counsel, you may
0486
 1   proceed.
 2              MR. BECERRA:  And, Mike, Mr. Morton just
 3   wants to clarify something that he may have been
 4   mixed up with, which was part of the reason why we --
 5   he was a little confused right now just before the
 6   break.
 7              MR. SIMONS:  I think I know what it might
 8   be, but, yeah.
 9   BY MR. SIMONS:
10        Q.    Sir, go ahead, please.
11        A.    Well, basically, for some reason I think
12   when you're saying "expansion valve," I might have
13   made the mistake.  Maybe Crane did not make the
14   expansion valve because I'm listening to your
15   questions, and I don't think you're talking about the
16   same type of expansion valve that I am.  I've got the
17   stem valves.  I've got the gate valves, and
18   circulating pump.  Stuff like that.
19       So, anyway, if you want to keep going on the
20   expansion valves, we can hopefully straighten it out,
21   and maybe I've made a mistake, and maybe they were
22   not Crane expansion valves.  So I'm just not sure
23   now.
24        Q.    Okay.  Let's try this, then.  I believe
0487
 1   you had previously testified that Crane Co.
 2   manufactured an expansion valve which you encountered
 3   in the field while assisting your father.  Am I
 4   correct that your present memory is that that may
 5   have been an error, and, in fact, you do not believe
 6   Crane Co. manufactured expansion valves?
 7        A.    The way your questions are coming, it
 8   raises questions in my mind whether, in fact, I've
 9   made a mistake when I said that.  If that makes
10   sense.
11        Q.    It does.  I don't want to not do my job
12   and basically, you know, not follow up thoroughly
13   with you.
14       As you sit here today right now, do you believe
15   that you encountered expansion valves which were
16   manufactured by Crane Co.?
17        A.    That was my belief, but I may have made a
18   mistake, and maybe they were not.  Maybe -- maybe you
19   don't make expansion valves, because the expansion
20   valves, they do not take a packing or anything like
21   that.
22        Q.    Okay.  Let me ask you generally.  Do
23   expansion valves, you said they were connected by a
24   flare nut?
0488
 1        A.    A flare nut is correct.
 2        Q.    A flare nut.  Correct.  Am I correct,
 3   then, that that does not -- that those expansion
 4   valves, then, do not use flanged gaskets?
 5        A.    Could you repeat that?
 6        Q.    Sure.  If the connection is to a flare
 7   nut, am I -- is it also correct that there is no
 8   flanged gasket used --
 9        A.    That's correct.
10        Q.    -- to connect the expansion valve?
11        A.    That's correct.
12        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Then let's move on from
13   those for now.
14       You just mentioned a couple other different types
15   of Crane Co. valves that you said -- gate valve and
16   globe valves; that is correct?
17        A.    The stem valve and the gate valve, yes.
18        Q.    Okay.  Stem valve and gate valves.  Okay.
19   Let's talk about those, and I'll try to see if we can
20   do it wrapped up together to save some time.
21       Do you recall encountering those types of Crane
22   Co. valves out in the field while assisting your
23   father?
24        A.    Yes.
0489
 1        Q.    Okay.  Can you tell me what those valves
 2   were made out of?
 3        A.    They were copper.  Copper and brass, and,
 4   yes, you did have stem packing that you could repair
 5   the leak on the valve with.
 6        Q.    Okay.  You've gone way beyond my question,
 7   but let's -- we'll get into all that later.  It might
 8   be a little while later, but we'll get to it.
 9       What were the size range in terms of inlet and
10   outlet of these valves?
11        A.    Well, there again, there were many
12   different sizes going from a half-inch on up to
13   two-inch and even -- they made bigger ones, but
14   those --
15        Q.    What size did you, in particular,
16   encounter out in the field while assisting your dad?
17        A.    Anywhere from a half an inch to an inch
18   and a half.
19        Q.    Thank you.  Okay.  Did you install new
20   Crane Co. stem and gate valves?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  Where did your dad obtain those
23   valves from?
24        A.    Standard Supply in Worcester.
0490
 1        Q.    Okay.  What was the packaging like that
 2   those valves came in?
 3        A.    Other than a cardboard box, that was
 4   basically it, and other than the --
 5        Q.    Do you recall --
 6        A.    -- size and the information -- the
 7   technical information about the valve was on the box.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So the technical information,
 9   that's what you recall as being written on the --
10   printed on the box was technical information about
11   the valves themselves?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    What kind of technical information?
14        A.    The size of the valve.  The stem size of
15   the valve.
16        Q.    Okay.  Anything else?
17        A.    That was the main thing, and the flow of
18   the valve.
19        Q.    Okay.  Did the packaging include any other
20   written material apart from what was printed on the
21   package itself?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Okay.  You said these ranged in size from
24   approximately a half inch to an inch and a half.  Can
0491
 1   you tell me how were these connected into the system?
 2   Were they brazed?  Were they soldered?  Something
 3   else?
 4        A.    Most of them were soldered, and then the
 5   others had a flange with a gasket.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Can you tell me what percentage
 7   were soldered versus flanged of the ones you
 8   installed?
 9        A.    Usually on up to one-inch was soldered.
10   Then you got into the larger ones.  They were flanged
11   with a flange -- soldered flange.
12        Q.    Okay.  Can you -- are you able to -- you
13   said most of them were soldered.  Are you able to
14   give me a good faith estimate without guessing of the
15   percentage of the new Crane Co. valves which you
16   installed which were soldered versus a percentage
17   which were flanged?
18        A.    No, I cannot give you a percentage.
19        Q.    Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Okay.  Are you
20   able to tell me what percentage of the stem and gate
21   valves that you worked with out in the field were
22   manufactured by Crane Co. versus other manufacturers'
23   brands of those same types of valves?
24        A.    It just so happened Standard Supply
0492
 1   carried a lot of the Crane Co. valves.  So that's the
 2   reason we used their valves.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Are you able -- again, I'll go back
 4   to my question, and if it wasn't clear, I apologize.
 5   Are you able to give me a good faith estimate without
 6   guessing of what percentage of the valves that you
 7   installed were Crane Co. versus other brands?
 8        A.    Without guessing, no.
 9        Q.    Fair enough.  Okay.  The gaskets which you
10   would use to install on the new Crane Co. valves
11   which were flanged, where did you obtain those
12   gaskets?
13        A.    That would have been Standard Supplies.
14        Q.    Okay.  Were those gaskets precut to size?
15        A.    They were precut gaskets, yes.
16        Q.    So as before, am I correct you would not
17   have to cut, drill, sand, or otherwise manipulate
18   those gaskets to install the new valves; is that
19   correct?
20        A.    When you remove the old valve, you had to
21   scrape the flanges.
22        Q.    Okay.  Sir, that wasn't my question.
23              MR. BECERRA:  Let him finish.  Even if --
24   whether you think it's responsive or not, he's still
0493
 1   allowed an opportunity to answer the question.
 2              MR. SIMONS:  He did answer it, and it's
 3   not responsive, and I'm going to re-ask the question.
 4              MR. BECERRA:  Yeah, but you're cutting him
 5   off, though.
 6              MR. SIMONS:  I didn't think I was.
 7   BY MR. SIMONS:
 8        Q.    Sir, let me ask you again.  When you
 9   installed those new gaskets on the new valves that
10   were precut gaskets, am I correct that you did not
11   have to cut, scrape, sand, or otherwise manipulate
12   those new gaskets?
13        A.    Just on the valve, no, you didn't have to
14   manipulate it.
15        Q.    Okay.  You testified earlier that the
16   gaskets -- the precut flanged gaskets which you used
17   had been reddish in color.  Was that the same type of
18   gasket that you would use when installing a new Crane
19   Co. valve?
20        A.    I'm not sure.
21        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall what color the new
22   flanged gaskets which were precut, what color they
23   were?
24        A.    They were either black or a very dull
0494
 1   reddish color.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Are you able to -- do you know the
 3   composition of either the black gaskets or the
 4   reddish-colored gaskets?
 5        A.    The reddish-colored gaskets were some type
 6   of a rubberlike material.
 7        Q.    Okay.
 8        A.    The black gaskets, no, I have no idea what
 9   the composition was of the black gasket, except they
10   were --
11        Q.    How -- sorry, sir.  Go ahead.
12        A.    Except they were a very hard material.
13        Q.    Okay.  How thick were the black and the
14   red gaskets?
15        A.    The red gaskets could have been as much as
16   an eighth of an inch thick.  The black gaskets were
17   thinner.  Sixteenth of an inch.
18        Q.    Okay.  Did those gaskets -- you said they
19   were obtained from the supply house.  Were they
20   obtained independently of the valves themselves?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  How long would it take to install
23   one of these precut gaskets onto the flange?
24        A.    Well, on the flange that's soldered to the
0495
 1   pipe, you would have to clean that gasket.
 2   Obviously, you wouldn't have to clean the old pump
 3   because you weren't putting the old pump back on.  So
 4   you had to clean two areas.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Was there ever a situation where
 6   you were installing a new Crane Co. valve for the
 7   first time in the system?  In other words, where you
 8   didn't have to remove a preexisting valve or where
 9   the one you were installing was the very first one to
10   be installed in the system?
11        A.    Right.
12        Q.    Did that situation ever occur?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    Okay.  So am I correct, then, that there
15   wouldn't -- you wouldn't have to do any scraping if
16   you were installing the valves -- the first valve
17   into that system?
18        A.    A new valve, a new flange, no.
19        Q.    Okay.  How often did you have to do --
20   encounter that situation with a Crane Co. valve while
21   assisting your father?
22        A.    Probably 20 times.
23        Q.    Okay.  And in that situation, how long
24   would it take to install the new precut gasket onto
0496
 1   the new flange?
 2        A.    Fifteen minutes.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Was that just a matter of putting
 4   it on and turning it a little bit so it was in the
 5   right place and then bolting it together?
 6        A.    That's correct.
 7        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Any other work involved
 8   in installing -- just the installing portion -- of a
 9   new Crane Co. stem or gate valve which we haven't
10   discussed yet?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    Okay.  Let's move on.  Did you ever do any
13   maintenance or repair work on a Crane Co. stem or
14   gate valve which was already in line?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  Am I correct that in such a
17   situation you would not know the prior maintenance
18   history for that particular valve?
19        A.    Correct.
20        Q.    And am I correct that, as you would not
21   know the prior maintenance history for that valve,
22   you would not know whether any of the flanged gaskets
23   were the original gaskets that were installed when
24   that valve first went into place?
0497
 1        A.    That's correct.
 2        Q.    And I am correct that you wouldn't know if
 3   there was -- if the valve contained packing, whether
 4   that packing was original to the valve or had been
 5   replaced prior to the time you had to do your work on
 6   it?
 7        A.    I have no idea.
 8        Q.    Okay.  What type of maintenance or repair
 9   work would you have to do on these valves that were
10   sealed while assisting your father?
11        A.    If they were leaking, you would loosen up
12   the flange nut on the stem, and we would have broke
13   gasket material, and you would wrap that several
14   times and then tighten up the stem nut to tighten
15   that up against the shaft of the valve.
16        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have to remove the old
17   packing?  The preexisting packing --
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    -- from those valves?  Okay.  How would
20   you go about that?
21        A.    With a sharp object that you could dig
22   into it without gouging the shaft or the body of the
23   valve.
24        Q.    Okay.  How long would that take on
0498
 1   average?
 2        A.    Twenty minutes.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Would you need to remove all of the
 4   packing at that time or just some of it?
 5        A.    You tried to remove it all.
 6        Q.    Let me ask you.  If a valve were leaking,
 7   as you described, would the first step that you would
 8   take be to tighten the packing nut to see if that
 9   stopped the leak?
10        A.    Yes, that would be the first step.
11        Q.    Okay.  And how often did doing that,
12   tightening the packing nut, correct the leakage
13   problem?
14        A.    If the valve was leaking, that's the first
15   step you would do is trying to tighten up the flange,
16   and sometimes that's all it took, and you didn't have
17   to remove the packing or anything.
18        Q.    Sure.  And I guess my question to follow
19   up is, are you able to tell me a good faith estimate
20   without guessing how often doing that, tightening
21   that nut, would resolve the leaking problem?
22        A.    No, I cannot.
23        Q.    Okay.  For example, can you say that did
24   it, you know, 75 percent of the time or 50 percent or
0499
 1   something like that?
 2              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
 3   answered.  We don't want you to guess, Mr. Morton.
 4        A.    I think your question --
 5        Q.    My question was -- let me rephrase it.
 6       Are you able to give me a good faith estimate,
 7   without guessing, of the percentage of times when
 8   tightening the packing nut would resolve the leaking
 9   problem?
10              MR. BECERRA:  The same objection.
11        A.    The percentage of time?  Once or twice, if
12   that answers your question.  In other words, it would
13   work one or two times, and then you would have to
14   replace the packing.
15        Q.    Okay.  That does answer my question.  So
16   if I understand you correctly, the first time and
17   maybe a second time that you would encounter leaking
18   on a particular valve, tightening the nut would
19   correct the leak, but after the second time, you
20   would typically have to change the packing?
21              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
22   BY MR. SIMONS:
23        Q.    Is that a fair way to say it?
24        A.    That's a fair way to say it.
0500
 1        Q.    Okay.  Thank you.
 2              MR. BECERRA:  Hey, Mike, this is Jose.
 3              MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.  Yes.
 4              MR. BECERRA:  We're -- just let's see if
 5   maybe talk off the record just timing-wise.  I just
 6   wanted to see how much longer you had to see if maybe
 7   there was a good juncture just to suspend and
 8   continue another day, but if you feel like you're
 9   going to be done, you know, within a reasonable time,
10   maybe we can just power along.  I just wanted to see
11   what your thoughts were on that.
12              MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.  Sure.  I mean, I would
13   -- I'm thinking there's another 10, 15 minutes, and
14   then I know Mark has got his medical stuff and other
15   follow-up.  That's kind of where I'm at right now.
16   That's my best estimate, without guessing.
17              MR. BECERRA:  All right.  If you only
18   have, like, maybe 15 minutes tops, why don't we just
19   -- just finish up your questions, and then we'll
20   reevaluate where we're at at that point.
21              MR. SIMONS:  Okay.  Okay.  Thanks.
22              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  And, Counsel -- Sorry.
23   Counsel, this is the videographer.  I have 10 minutes
24   before I need to switch my media.  Do you want to
0501
 1   take a quick break, and I can get that done in a
 2   minute or two?
 3              MR. SIMONS:  Sure.
 4              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Thank you.  The time is
 5   approximately 5:14, and we are off the record.
 6              (A break was taken from 5:14 to 5:15 p.m.)
 7              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
 8   approximately 5:15, and we are back on the record.
 9   This is the beginning of media number five.  Counsel,
10   you may proceed.
11   BY MR. SIMONS:
12        Q.    Thank you, sir.  All right.  Mr. Morton,
13   we're back after we did that quick tape change.  We
14   were talking about your work doing maintenance or
15   repair work on valves.
16       I wanted to -- the next question I wanted to ask
17   you was, when you would obtain the replacement
18   packing material, where did you obtain that from, or
19   where did your father obtain it from?
20        A.    It came in a -- a spool.  I have no idea
21   where he obtained it.  I'm sure it was probably
22   Standard Supply in Fitchburg.  That's where we bought
23   just about all of the stuff that I'm aware of.
24        Q.    Okay.  Were there any markings or
0502
 1   indications about who manufactured that packing
 2   material?
 3        A.    No.
 4        Q.    Could you tell me the color of that
 5   packing material?
 6        A.    A black color.
 7        Q.    Okay.  What was the texture of it?
 8        A.    A rope texture with -- it looks like some
 9   type of tar substance.  I guess that was to make a
10   good seal when you put it back.
11        Q.    Okay.  Could you tell me the thickness in
12   terms of what the dimension --
13        A.    Yeah.  I'm going to say an eighth of an
14   inch to a quarter of an inch would be my guess on the
15   thickness.
16        Q.    Okay.  How would you get it off the roll?
17        A.    It was on a spool, and it was just winding
18   it.
19        Q.    Okay.  Just unwinding it, and then would
20   you have to make a cut to get it separated from the
21   rest of the material which was still on the spool?
22        A.    No, you did not have to cut it.  I mean,
23   as far as separating it.  It would roll right out.
24   So if you needed six inches, that's what you cut off.
0503
 1        Q.    Gotcha.  All right.  And that helps a bit.
 2   So when you would, for example, measure out six
 3   inches, cut the six-inch piece off of the spool, what
 4   would you use to cut it off the spool with?
 5        A.    A razor knife.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And how long did that take?
 7        A.    Five minutes.
 8        Q.    Did cutting that create any -- strike
 9   that.
10       What, if any, conditions did cutting that
11   material off the spool make?
12        A.    Any time you disturb a surface, you --
13   yeah.  There's a certain amount of fiber that gets
14   into the air.  How much, I don't know.
15        Q.    Okay.  After you had cut off the
16   appropriate size piece of the replacement packing
17   material, what would you do next?
18        A.    You'd wrap that around the shaft, and if
19   you felt it was a little too long, you'd cut off a
20   little more, and then you would tighten up the flange
21   nut around it.
22        Q.    Okay.  Did you have to make any more cuts
23   to that gasket material or packing material?
24        A.    Yeah, because you guess at the length, and
0504
 1   then, as I say, when you start wrapping the valve,
 2   whether you've got to go around one time or two
 3   times, that depended on the stem size of the valve to
 4   how many times you went around.  If you had
 5   sufficient room, you'd go around twice.
 6        Q.    Okay.
 7        A.    Then you would tighten up the flange and
 8   see if you were successful, and if it didn't leak,
 9   then you were good.
10        Q.    Okay.  And just so I'm clear, when you
11   would do that, if you had overestimated, let's say,
12   how much the replacement packing material, you had to
13   essentially cut off a little bit of the excess?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Is that -- okay.  And to physically, how
16   long did it time-wise take to make that cut?
17   Actually, I'm not talking about, like, the
18   measurement.  To physically make the cut, how long
19   did that take?
20        A.    You're talking minutes.
21        Q.    Okay.  And were you using the same razor?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    Okay.  Was that razor generally sharp?
24        A.    Yes.
0505
 1        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Are you -- strike that.
 2       Other than changing the packing on the Crane Co.
 3   stem and gate valves, is there any other type of
 4   maintenance on those valves which you would perform?
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    Okay.  I think we're getting close.  Did
 7   you ever have to remove a Crane Co. stem or gate
 8   valve that was already in service when you got there?
 9        A.    If the valve was functioning perfectly,
10   why would you remove it?  I guess you can't do a
11   question with a question.
12        Q.    I agree, but my question is, did you ever
13   get to a -- did you ever encounter a situation where
14   you did need to remove a Crane Co. stem or gate valve
15   which was in service?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Okay.  Are you able to estimate for me
18   without guessing how much of the time you had to
19   remove a Crane Co. stem or gate valve versus the
20   other brands of valves that you encountered?
21        A.    The same procedure.
22        Q.    Okay.  I understand it's the same
23   procedure, and I appreciate that.  Are you able to
24   give me a good faith estimate without guessing of the
0506
 1   percentage of time you removed Crane Co. stem and
 2   gate valves as opposed to other manufacturers' brands
 3   of stem and gate valves?
 4        A.    No, because the procedure is the same.
 5        Q.    Okay.  The procedure, as I -- at least as
 6   you previously explained it would be, and please
 7   correct me if I'm wrong, unbolt the valve, remove the
 8   flange gasket, and then you're done; is that correct?
 9        A.    That's correct.
10        Q.    Okay.  And would you remove the flange
11   gaskets which were there in the same manner as you
12   previously testified?
13        A.    That's correct.
14        Q.    Okay.  And I just want to be clear.  With
15   respect to the Crane Co. valves specifically, when
16   you would remove -- any time you would remove a
17   flange gasket, is it the same that you would have to
18   be careful not to actually damage the flange itself?
19        A.    That's correct.
20        Q.    Okay.  And I think you said that the same
21   with regard when you remove packing, you had to be
22   careful not to damage the packing stem itself,
23   correct?
24        A.    Correct.
0507
 1        Q.    What would be -- what problems could you
 2   generate if you did damage the flange or the packing
 3   stem itself?
 4        A.    Basically, you would have to replace, not
 5   only the valve, but the flange, and that would --
 6        Q.    Is that because you -- sorry.  Go ahead.
 7        A.    And that's because you damaged both of
 8   them.
 9        Q.    Right.  And would the result of damaging
10   be that they could no longer form the tight seal that
11   was necessary?
12        A.    That's correct.
13        Q.    Okay.  All right.  All right.  With regard
14   to any Crane Co. stem or gate valves which you had to
15   remove from a -- from a system, is it -- am I correct
16   that you would not know the maintenance history of
17   any of those valves?
18        A.    Correct.
19        Q.    And am I correct that given that you did
20   not know the maintenance history of any of those
21   valves that you had to remove, you would not know
22   whether any of the components, the packing, flange
23   gaskets, et cetera, were original to the valve or
24   not?
0508
 1        A.    Fair to say, correct.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Is there other work, apart from the
 3   installation, the repair work, and the removal work,
 4   that you recall doing with any Crane Co. gate or
 5   valve -- gate or stem valve out in the field?
 6        A.    I think to answer that, as long -- not
 7   unless you -- you had leakage, whether -- the gate
 8   valve, sometimes they get corroded, so they were not
 9   making a seal, and whether it was water or what it
10   was would leak by, and you had a defective product
11   that you had to replace.
12        Q.    Okay.  So that would be a situation where
13   you would need to remove the valve; is that correct?
14        A.    That's correct.
15        Q.    Okay.  And the process for removal would
16   be the one we talked about already, right?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    Okay.  Is there any -- apart from -- if
19   you saw -- strike that.
20       If you encountered such a corroded, you know,
21   gate or stem valve out in the field, would you do --
22   was there anything you would need to do to try to
23   repair it, or you just know, no, that's just got to
24   come out?
0509
 1        A.    You basically knew it had to come out.
 2        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Are there any other
 3   products or equipment you associate with Crane Co.
 4   which you believe you worked with or around which we
 5   haven't discussed yet?
 6        A.    I do not quite understand the question.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Let me retry that.  We talked about
 8   Crane Co. valves and pumps, correct?
 9        A.    Correct.
10        Q.    Okay.  Are there any other products which
11   you worked with or around which you believe were
12   manufactured by Crane Co. which we haven't discussed?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    Okay.  At this time, have we discussed all
15   of the types of work you recall doing with Crane Co.
16   valves and pumps?
17        A.    Yes.
18              MR. SIMONS:  Okay.  Sir, I believe those
19   are all my questions.  I appreciate your time.  I am
20   going to pass you.  I'm going to look over my notes,
21   but I'm going to pass you over to the next attorney
22   if you're ready to keep going.  Okay?
23              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
24              MR. SIMONS:  Thank you, sir.
0510
 1              MR. BECERRA:  How do you feel, Mr. Morton?
 2              THE WITNESS:  I'm getting close.
 3              MR. BECERRA:  A few more minutes?
 4              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
 5              MR. BECERRA:  I think there's one attorney
 6   on the phone that has 10 or 15 minutes of questions.
 7              THE WITNESS:  Go for it.
 8   
 9   CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. WASIL:
10        Q.    Mr. Morton, can you hear me?
11        A.    Yes, I can.
12        Q.    Hi.  I'm hoping I'll be even less than
13   that.  My name is Chris Wasil.  I'm just going to ask
14   you just a few questions about Goulds pumps.  I
15   believe you said on a previous date that you remember
16   helping your father remove a Goulds well pump from
17   your home when you were about 13 years old.  Do you
18   recall that?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  And since this was a well pump, was
21   it submerged in water when you went to remove it?
22        A.    No.  It was a shallow well pump.
23        Q.    Okay.  Was any part of the pump wet?
24        A.    No.
0511
 1        Q.    Okay.  And can you tell me how you know
 2   this was a Goulds pump?
 3        A.    Because it was -- had a Goulds plate on
 4   it.  On the plate it had their name, it had their
 5   horsepower, and different technical information on
 6   that plate.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And about how long did this process
 8   take, to the best of your memory?
 9        A.    Basically what you're asking, how long to
10   take the old one out and how long to put a new one
11   in?
12        Q.    Sure.  Yeah.  The total project removal
13   and replacement, about how long was that process?
14        A.    That's about an hour's process with no
15   problems.
16        Q.    And the new pump you put in, was that also
17   a Goulds pump?
18        A.    Yes, it was.
19        Q.    Okay.  And was -- do you recall the model
20   or serial number of the pump you removed?
21        A.    That was a one horsepower, and we replaced
22   it with a one horsepower.  The model, I have no idea.
23        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  And I think you also
24   testified that you installed a water pump during the
0512
 1   construction of your current home.  Do you recall
 2   that?
 3        A.    Yes, I do.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Was it just one pump, or was it
 5   more than one?
 6        A.    Basically, one pump.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Did you just install this pump, or
 8   did you ever perform maintenance and repairs on the
 9   pump?
10        A.    I did both.  I installed it, and I rebuilt
11   it with a rebuilding kit.
12        Q.    And can you just very briefly describe to
13   me what it is -- when you say you rebuilt it, what
14   that involved?
15        A.    Yeah.  It involves taking the motor off
16   the pump, and then you have a rebuilding kit that
17   involves a propeller which you replace.  Some of the
18   other components that you replace, there's a jacket
19   that the impeller fits into and rides up against and
20   wears, so you replace that.  So it basically -- any
21   parts that came in that rebuilding kit, you would
22   replace.
23        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall how many times you
24   did this for the pump?
0513
 1        A.    Once.
 2        Q.    So you installed it, and then you did this
 3   rebuild with the rebuilding kit once, and that was
 4   the extent of the work you did?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Do you recall just approximately when you
 7   did that rebuild?
 8        A.    About 1980, '85.  Somewhere in that
 9   vicinity.
10        Q.    Can you tell me where you got this rebuild
11   kit -- rebuild kit?
12        A.    Fitchburg Plumbing on Main Street in
13   Fitchburg.
14        Q.    And was this rebuild kit something branded
15   by Goulds, or was this something generic that applied
16   to all pumps?
17        A.    Goulds.  It was a Gould rebuilding kit.
18              MR. WASIL:  Okay.  Sir, that is all the
19   questions I have for you.  Thank you very much.
20              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
21              MR. BECERRA:  Anybody else on the phone?
22   In the room?
23              MR. MOCCIA:  I have a couple.  This will
24   be very fast.  Sorry.
0514
 1   
 2   RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MOCCIA:
 3        Q.    Mr. Morton, real quickly, do you recall
 4   any model name or serial number of any Westinghouse
 5   motor that you encountered during the course of your
 6   assisting your father over the years?
 7        A.    No, I don't just for the simple fact we
 8   used both of them many, many times.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    And as I said, we didn't always replace a
11   certain motor with the same type of motor.  It could
12   have been, you know -- so, no, to answer your
13   question.
14        Q.    Okay.  And the replacement -- strike that.
15       The brushes that you told me about earlier that
16   you replaced, do you happen to know the brand name or
17   trade name of those brushes?
18        A.    No, I do not.
19        Q.    Okay.  Did they come in any packaging, if
20   you recall?
21        A.    I do not recall, but, obviously, there
22   were two of them.  Whether they were in a little
23   plastic bag or a little box, I don't know.  I mean,
24   they were not -- they're not huge.
0515
 1        Q.    No.  No.  I understand that.  And I think
 2   you told -- you told me that you replaced brushes
 3   occasionally.  Can you give me your best estimate
 4   over the course of your working with your dad how
 5   many times you would have replaced brushes in a motor
 6   regardless of the brand name of the motor?
 7        A.    Right.  No, I cannot tell you, or I can't
 8   even give you an estimate except many times.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    That's the closest -- yeah, I would be
11   guessing on anything else.
12              MR. MOCCIA:  Okay.  Okay.  Very well.
13   Thank you.
14              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
15   
16   RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LENKIEWICZ:
17        Q.    Hello again, Mr. Morton.  I just have a
18   couple of questions.  Going back to the Harris
19   printing press at Hale & Moore --
20        A.    Yeah.
21        Q.    -- did you ever have any contact with
22   anyone from the Harris Corporation?  Speak with any
23   representatives with regard to that press?
24        A.    No, not Harris.  I know we did have an
0516
 1   independent mechanic, I think, once.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Do you know who the name of the
 3   independent mechanic was?
 4        A.    No, I do not.
 5        Q.    Do you know what company he was affiliated
 6   with?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Did you ever read any manuals, materials,
 9   instructions from Harris Corporation with regard to
10   the cleaning of the Harris printing press or the
11   adjustment of the brake and clutches that you
12   described on Tuesday?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    Okay.
15        A.    You would -- yup.  That's the only way you
16   would find out how to adjust and to what clearance
17   you needed.
18        Q.    Okay.  Was there a Harris manual with the
19   printing press on-site?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.
22        A.    Yup.
23        Q.    Do you recall whether that Harris manual
24   provided any directions with regard to the use of
0517
 1   compressed air to clean the printing press?  Do you
 2   know if there were any instructions one way or
 3   another with regard to that?
 4        A.    No, I did not see anything like that.
 5              MR. LENKIEWICZ:  Okay.  Those are all --
 6   sorry.  Those are all the questions I have for you,
 7   sir.  Thanks.
 8              THE WITNESS:  Okay.
 9              MR. BECERRA:  Anybody else?
10              MR. HOOVER:  What does everybody want to
11   do about wrap-up for -- do you want to talk?
12              MR. BECERRA:  Let's go off the record for
13   a moment.
14              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
15   approximately 5:40, and we are off the record.
16              (A break was taken from 5:40 to 5:43 p.m.)
17              MR. BECERRA:  So we're just going to
18   temporarily suspend for now, and speaking with
19   Mr. Hoover, liaison counsel, our intention is to come
20   back at some point in the near future on a mutually
21   agreeable date for all parties so we can just wrap up
22   the discovery portion of the deposition, and then
23   we're going to take a one-day break after that and
24   then come back and do the trial preservation portion
0518
 1   of Mr. Morton's deposition.  Okay.  Thank you, folks.
 2              (Whereupon, the deposition suspended at
 3              5:44 p.m.)

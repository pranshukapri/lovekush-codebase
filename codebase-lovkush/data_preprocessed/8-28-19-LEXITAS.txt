         17    BY MR. GOODSTADT:

         18         Q.  Please state your full name for

         19    the record.

         20         A.  Wayne Elliot Oliver.

         21         Q.  Mr. Oliver, have you ever been

         22    deposed before?

         23         A.  No.

         24         Q.  Okay.  All right.  Let me give you

                                Wayne Oliver             5



          1    some instructions generally speaking.

          2    Today's deposition shouldn't take all that

          3    long.  I'll try to keep it under half an

          4    hour, if not less.  It goes easier if you

          5    just listen to the question, and wait until

          6    I'm done before you answer.  It's tougher

          7    if you interrupt me because then we've got

          8    a record that doesn't come out well.  Do

          9    you understand that?

         10         A.  I understand.

         11         Q.  Okay.  The court reporter, who's

         12    seated immediately to your left, is going

         13    to take down all of my questions and all of

         14    your answers, so it's important that you

         15    speak up, and I think you're already off to

         16    a good start, and make sure she understands

         17    what you say.  Okay?

         18         A.  I'm clear.

         19         Q.  We all do some things informally

         20    that don't come out on the record well, so

         21    using that expression -- awful expression

         22    "uh-huh" or nodding your head, or using

         23    your hands as a gesture, doesn't come out

         24    on the record because the court reporter

                                Wayne Oliver             6



          1    can't interpret that.  So try to keep all

          2    of your answers verbal.  Okay?

          3         A.  Okay.

          4         Q.  As I said, I'm going to ask you

          5    questions.  You're going to give answers.

          6    At the end of the deposition, the court

          7    reporter will prepare a deposition

          8    transcript that will contain all of the

          9    questions and all of the answers.  Do you

         10    understand that?

         11         A.  I understand that.

         12         Q.  And do you understand that that is

         13    a transcript that can be used at trial?

         14         A.  I understand that.

         15         Q.  If you don't understand a

         16    question, I ask that you just tell me, and

         17    I'll rephrase it to make it clear for you.

         18    Okay?

         19         A.  Okay.

         20         Q.  If your attorney should object for

         21    whatever reason, don't answer.  If you're

         22    in the middle of an answer, stop answering,

         23    and wait until she and I work out that

         24    objection.  Okay?

          8         A.  Myself.

          9         Q.  How long have you lived there?

         10         A.  It's been for about six years.

         11         Q.  Okay.  What do you do?

         13         Q.  And who do you work for?

         14         A.  LDS, Incorporated.

         15         Q.  What is LDS?

         16         A.  It's myself.

         17         Q.  Oh.  Okay.

         18         A.  Self-employed.

         19         Q.  Okay.  All right.  Got it.

         20             Have you looked at any documents,

         21    photographs, records, anything before your

         22    deposition today?

         23         A.  Photos.

         24         Q.  Okay.

          3    at?

          4         A.  Of my vehicle.

          5         Q.  Just photos of your vehicle?

          6         A.  And of the other vehicle involved

          7    in this accident.

          8         Q.  Both vehicles?

          9         A.  Yes.

         10         Q.  Okay.  Have you had an opportunity

         11    to meet with your attorney so she could

         12    explain how the deposition would be

         13    conducted?

         14         A.  No.  Other than today.

         15         Q.  In other words, are you okay

         16    proceeding?  Have you gotten sufficient

         17    instructions from your attorney so you can

         18    go forward?

          1    law?

          2         A.  I do.

          3         Q.  Okay.  And as a result of this

          4    collision with my client, was your vehicle

          5    damaged?

          1    collision with her?

          8         Q.  Tell me what happened.

          9         A.  What happened?  That day of the

         10    accident, I was traveling on Washington

         11    Lane and stopped at a red light, red

         12    traffic light.  She was -- your client was

         13    in front of me.  The light was red.  Once

         14    the light turned green during the stormy

         15    conditions of the -- stormy conditions; it

         16    was raining hard.  Her vehicle began

         17    pulling off, pulled to the right and pulled

         18    back to the left and just, like,

         19    immediately stopped -- slammed on her

         20    brakes.  And then the front of my vehicle

         21    hit her vehicle.

         22         Q.  How long had it been raining?

         23         A.  That entire morning.

         24         Q.  Okay.  And, so, did the collision

          1    occur before noon?

          9         Q.  Okay.  Did you ever find out why

         10    she applied her brakes?

         11         A.  Yes.

         12         Q.  And what did you find out?

         13         A.  From your client, after our

         14    conversation, she stated that she felt

         15    sorry for someone running for the bus on

         16    the very close corner, and she basically

         17    said she felt sorry for them and

         18    immediately stopped.

         19         Q.  Did you see that person before the

         20    impact occurred?

         21         A.  I did not.

         22         Q.  Did you see them after the impact

         23    occurred?

          1         Q.  Did you have any reason not to

          2    believe my client?

          3         A.  I held no judgement.

          4         Q.  Okay.  Now, you told me earlier

          5    that you stopped for a red light at

          6    Washington Lane.  Was there an intersecting

          7    street?

          8         A.  Yes, there was.

          9         Q.  And what was the intersecting

         10    street?

         11         A.  I believe it to be Stenton Avenue.

         12         Q.  Okay.  How many lanes on

         13    Washington Lane?

         14         A.  One in each direction.

         15         Q.  How about Stenton?

         16         A.  The same.

         17         Q.  Do you have any recollection as to

         18    how long you waited for the light to turn

         19    green?

         20         A.  I do not.

         21         Q.  One of the instructions I didn't

         22    give you was that if you're able to

         23    estimate, you can certainly give me an

         24    estimate.  If you can't estimate, it's an

                                Wayne Oliver            14



          1    acceptable answer for you to tell me you

          2    don't know.  Okay?

          3         A.  Yes.

          4         Q.  I'm not referring to the previous

          5    question.  It's just a general instruction.

          6         A.  Okay.

          7         Q.  Anytime I ask you something, if

          8    you can give me an estimate, great.  If you

          9    can't, just let me know.  Okay?

         10               THE WITNESS:  I can

         11         answer?

         12               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Yes.

         13    BY MR. GOODSTADT:

         14         Q.  Do you have any recollection as to

         15    how long you waited for the light to turn

         16    from red to green?

         17         A.  10, 15 seconds.

         18         Q.  Okay.  Now, you also testified

         19    that once the light turned green, you

         20    observed my client pull her vehicle to the

         21    right?

         22         A.  That's correct.

         23         Q.  And did you have any appreciation

         24    as to what she was doing or where she was

                                Wayne Oliver            15



          1    going?

          2         A.  Appreciation?  I'm not sure of

          3    your --

          4         Q.  Did you know why she did that?

          5         A.  I did not know.

          6         Q.  Did my client have a turn signal

          7    on?

          8         A.  No, she did not.

          9         Q.  When my client pulled to the

         10    right, did you try to pass her on the

         11    left?

         12         A.  It was my intention to go past

         13    her, and then -- yes, it was my intention.

         14         Q.  I understand it was your

         15    intention.  Did you try to pass her on the

         16    left?

         17         A.  I remained in my lane and

         18    continued forward.

         19         Q.  So you didn't try to pass her?

         20         A.  I remained in my lane and

         21    continued to proceed forward.

         22         Q.  Well, that's not an answer to my

         23    question, so let me ask it again.  Did you

         24    try to pass her on the left?

                                Wayne Oliver            16



          1         A.  It was my intention to pass her.

          2         Q.  I know what your intention was.

          3    I'm asking, did you try?

          4         A.  I couldn't.  Because of the

          5    actions of the vehicle in front of me, I

          6    could not pass her.

          7         Q.  Are you telling me you couldn't

          8    pass her because she pulled back into the

          9    lane?

         10         A.  That's exactly what I'm telling

         11    you.

         12         Q.  All right.  Can you give me an

         13    estimate as to the speed she was traveling

         14    when you observed her pull to the right?

         15         A.  Approximately 5 to 10 miles per

         16    hour --

         17         Q.  And how about when she pulled back

         18    to the left?

         19         A.  Accelerated out, probably 10 to

         20    15.

         21         Q.  So she was traveling about 5 to 10

         22    miles per hour when she pulled to the

         23    right, and about 10 to 15 miles per hour

         24    when she pulled back to the left, correct?

                                Wayne Oliver            17



          1         A.  About 10 to 15 when she pulled

          2    back out, accelerated out.

          3         Q.  To the left?

          4         A.  To the left.

          5         Q.  Where did the impact take place?

          6         A.  Location?

          7         Q.  Yes.

          8         A.  On Washington Lane.

          9         Q.  Well, did it take place in the

         10    intersection, at the beginning of the

         11    intersection, at the end of the

         12    intersection?

         13         A.  At the -- at the beginning of the

         14    intersection.

         15         Q.  So when the front of your vehicle

         16    struck the rear of her vehicle, how far was

         17    my client in the intersection?

         18         A.  About -- somewhere between a

         19    quarter of a car length to maybe,

         20    partially, half of a car length.

         21         Q.  Okay.  So tell me about your

         22    actions.  You told me about her actions.

         23    In other words, you told me that she moved

         24    to the right and then moved back to the

                                Wayne Oliver            18



          1    left.  When she moved to the right, did you

          2    move your vehicle?

          3         A.  My vehicle remained in the

          4    operating lane going forward.

          5         Q.  So you moved forward?

          6         A.  Yes.

          7         Q.  And when she moved back to the

          8    left, tell me, what did you do with your

          9    vehicle?

         10         A.  I braked hard.

         11         Q.  And that's because you were still

         12    moving forward?

         13         A.  I braked or attempted to brake

         14    hard once she moved back in the operating

         15    lane.

         16         Q.  Okay.  So if I understand what

         17    you're saying, when my client moved to the

         18    right, you began to move forward, correct?

         19         A.  Correct.

         20         Q.  And when she came back to the

         21    left, because you were already moving

         22    forward, you applied your brakes, correct?

         23         A.  That's correct.

         24         Q.  Okay.  What was the distance

                                Wayne Oliver            19



          1    between the front of your vehicle and the

          2    rear of her vehicle when my client moved to

          3    the right?

          4         A.  Approximately a half a car length.

          5         Q.  And what was the distance between

          6    the front of your vehicle and my client's

          7    vehicle when she moved back to the left?

          8         A.  About a quarter of a car length.

          9         Q.  And what was your speed when you

         10    observed my client move to the right?

         11         A.  About 5 to 10 miles per hour.

         12         Q.  And what was your speed when my

         13    client moved back to the left?

         14         A.  About 10 miles per hour.

         15         Q.  And what was your speed when you

         16    hit her?

         17         A.  About 10 miles per hour.

         18         Q.  And if I understand what you're

         19    telling me, the front of your Jeep struck

         20    the rear of my client's Chevy, correct?

         21         A.  That's correct.

         22         Q.  After the impact, did you get out

         23    of the vehicle?

         24         A.  At some point I did.

                                Wayne Oliver            20



          1         Q.  And did my client get out of the

          2    vehicle?

          3         A.  At some point she did.

          4         Q.  And did you have a conversation

          5    with her?

          6         A.  Yes.

          7         Q.  Tell me what she said to you, tell

          8    me what you said to her.

          9         A.  What she said to me was, "Are you

         10    okay?"  I asked the same of her, "Are you

         11    okay?"  She said to me that she was sorry;

         12    there was a man running for the bus.  She

         13    felt -- she just saw this man was running

         14    for a bus, and she just felt bad for him

         15    because of the rain.  She wanted him to get

         16    to his bus, some bus.

         17         Q.  She wanted him to get to the bus

         18    because it was pouring?

         19         A.  Something along that line.

         20         Q.  Okay.  And what did you say to

         21    her?

         22         A.  "Are you okay?"

         23         Q.  And what did she respond?

         24         A.  She said she was fine.

          1         Q.  Did either of you mention calling

          2    the police?

          3         A.  No.  There was further

          4    conversation.  She mentioned that she was

          5    driving her daughter's car, and she was

          6    from Florida.  This wasn't her car; this

          7    was her daughter's car is what she said.

          8         Q.  Okay.  Did you talk about calling

          9    the police?

         10         A.  My thoughts were to call the

         11    police.  Did we talk about it?  I don't

         12    recall.  It was more just, like, "Are you

         13    okay?"

         14         Q.  Did you exchange information?

         15         A.  We did.

         16         Q.  Was there a bus near the

         17    intersection?

         18         A.  I saw no bus.

         19         Q.  Not before the collision or after

         20    the collision?

         21         A.  I saw no bus.

         22         Q.  I'm going to hand you a

         23    photograph.  First show it to your

         24    attorney.

          1         A.  Mm-hmm.

          7         Q.  Mr. Oliver, have you seen that

          8    photograph before?

          9         A.  I have.

         10         Q.  And can you identify it for me?

         11         A.  It shows my vehicle, my 2017 Grand

         12    Jeep Cherokee front end damage.

         13         Q.  Do you know where the photo was

         14    taken?

         15         A.  That was taken in front of the --

         16    or along side of the body shop that

         17    repaired it.

         18         Q.  Okay.

         20         record a minute.

          1         Q.  All right.  A couple more.

          2             Can you give me an estimate as to

          3    how far you were behind my client's

          4    vehicle when you saw her come back to the

          5    left?

          6         A.  Can you rephrase your question?

          7         Q.  Sure.

          8             Your testimony was that my client

          9    moved to the right, and then she moved back

         10    to the left into the travel lane.  And my

         11    question is, how far was she in front of

         12    you when she moved back into the travel

         13    lane?

         14         A.  How far was I away from her?

         15         Q.  Yeah.  How far was the front of

         16    your vehicle from any part of her

         17    vehicle?

         18         A.  A quarter of a car length to a

         19    half of a car length.

         20         Q.  Was her vehicle angled at the time

         21    of impact?

         22         A.  It was.

         23         Q.  And at the time of impact, how

         24    much of her vehicle was in the travel lane,

                                Wayne Oliver            24



          1    and how much of her vehicle was still

          2    outside the lane on the right?

          3         A.  She accelerated into the travel

          4    lane at that point.

          5         Q.  Well, let me ask it different.  At

          6    the time of impact, was her entire vehicle

          7    in the travel lane?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  When your vehicle impacted the

         10    rear of the vehicle she was operating, did

         11    you impact one side of the rear or the

         12    other, or the entire rear?

         13         A.  I only know it as the rear.  I

         14    don't recall exactly.

         15         Q.  Okay.  So you do have any

         16    recollection if you hit the right rear or

         17    the left rear?

         18         A.  Currently, no.  I just know it was

         19    the rear.

         20         Q.  Okay.  Were your lights on?

         21         A.  They're automatic lights.  Yes.

         22         Q.  Were her lights on?

         23         A.  When you say "lights," can you be

         24    more specific?

          1         Q.  Could you see her brake lights

          2    come on?

          3         A.  I did.

          4         Q.  So when you saw her brake lights

          5    come on, you knew she was stopping,

          6    right?

          7         A.  That's correct.

          8         Q.  Okay.

          9               MR. GOODSTADT:  Mr.

         10         Oliver, that's it.  I don't have

         11         anything further unless your

         12         attorney has questions for you.

         13               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Just a

            5    BY MS. STURGES:

            6          Q.       Good afternoon, Doctor.  How are

            7    you?

            8          A.       Good.  Good afternoon.

            9          Q.       Could you please introduce

           10    yourself to the jury.

           11          A.       Good afternoon, ladies and

           12    gentlemen.  My name is Dr. Gene Levinstein.

           13          Q.       And what type of doctor are you?

           14          A.       I'm a specialist.  My specialty

           15    is physical medicine and rehabilitation and

           16    pain management.

           17          Q.       Now, in case the jury is

           18    unaware, could you explain a little bit more

           19    about what physical medicine and rehabilitation

           20    are.

           21          A.       Physical medicine and

           22    rehabilitation is the names, kind of, that

           23    basically deal with the physical capabilities

           24    and providing rehabilitative care to patients.

           25    Physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors,

                                                               7



            1    also known as physiatrists, typically provide

            2    care to patients who either have undergone

            3    surgery or suffer from musculoskeletal

            4    neurologic conditions.

            5                   This includes, traditionally,

            6    recovery after stroke, spinal cord injuries,

            7    cardiac rehabilitation after heart surgeries or

            8    transplants, and PT training for patients who

            9    were involved in neurologic conditions; the

           10    joint problems, total knee replacements, hip

           11    replacements.  Any other joint surgery such as

           12    arthroscopies, hips, knees, shoulders, or

           13    patients who suffer from neurologic conditions

           14    or spinal disorders; bulging, herniated discs,

           15    Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis.

           16                   Physiatrists also perform

           17    diagnostic studies, specifically EMG nerve

           18    conduction, and typically oversee physical

           19    therapy and occupational therapy departments.

           20          Q.       Now, Doctor, I know you just

           21    mentioned a large number of things that doctors

           22    such as yourself treat.  Do you treat people

           23    who have been involved in motor vehicle

           24    accidents?

           25          A.       Yes.  I treat patients who are

                                                               8



            1    involved in either motor vehicle accidents or

            2    any other type of injury be it a lifting

            3    injury, work injury, or athletic injury.

            4          Q.       Okay.  Do you happen to treat

            5    people with injuries to their neck, spine, and

            6    shoulders?

            7          A.       The nature of my practice, I

            8    treat approximately -- 70 percent of my

            9    practice involves treating patients who sustain

           10    spinal problems, be it either traumatic or

           11    chronic, be it degenerative with nature, just

           12    with age, or some type of trauma, fall, sports

           13    injury, just natural occurring discs, work

           14    related injuries, you name it.  Me being a

           15    subspecialist, such as pain management, that's

           16    what I primarily treat.

           17          Q.       And could you explain a little

           18    bit more about that specialty that you were

           19    just mentioning, pain management.

           20          A.       Pain management is a smaller

           21    subset where physicians only train in

           22    neurology, physiology, or physical medicine and

           23    rehab.  We are able to achieve this additional

           24    training.  It's typically an interventional

           25    specialty where you work with your hands and

                                                               9



            1    you preform primarily procedures such as

            2    injections.  But the nature of the disease or

            3    majority of the pain comes from the back, the

            4    spine, that's where the majority concentrates

            5    on.

            6                   As I said, about 70 percent of

            7    my practice involves treating spinal disorders

            8    and remaining 30 percent I treat between other

            9    joints, small joints, hips, knees, shoulders.

           10    I'm sorry -- bigger joints; hips, knees, or

           11    shoulders.  Smaller joints; hands, elbows,

           12    wrists, and as well as nerve and muscle

           13    problems.

           14                   I split my time between -- all

           15    pain management doctors typically perform a lot

           16    of procedures both using guidance such as

           17    x-ray, CAT Scan, ultrasound, but are also

           18    trained to perform injections just based on

           19    nerve stimulators or based on an anatomic

           20    location.

           21          Q.       And, Doctor, if you could look

           22    at what has been marked as Exhibit-1, could you

           23    please identify that.

           24          A.       It is my curriculum vitae.  It

           25    is my CV.  It's my resume.  It is current and

                                                               10



            1    up-to-date.

            2          Q.       Okay.  And could you tell the

            3    jury a little bit about how you became a

            4    doctor.

            5          A.       Following graduation from

            6    undergrad at Temple University, I completed

            7    medical school at Ross University.  Followed

            8    that with residency in the field of special --

            9    internship the first year in the field of

           10    internal medicine at Graduate Hospital.  I

           11    followed that with additional training

           12    residency at Temple University Hospital where I

           13    served as a chief resident during my senior

           14    year, followed with additional fellowship

           15    training in my subspecialty of pain management.

           16          Q.       And could you let the jury know

           17    about your current practice and what you do on

           18    a daily basis.

           19          A.       On a daily basis I split my time

           20    between seeing patients in the office,

           21    performing procedures, as well as working in

           22    the hospital doing hospital consults as well as

           23    performing procedures in the hospital.  The

           24    hospital work is reserved for patients who are

           25    really debilitated or have significant medical

                                                               11



            1    comorbidities or significant medical problems.

            2    They cannot be safe to do procedures in the

            3    office.  They have to be observed in the

            4    hospital for patients who require really

            5    complex procedures for which they have to be

            6    sedated, put to sleep.  Either myself providing

            7    sedation or working in conjunction with an

            8    anesthesiologist to put those patients to

            9    sleep.

           10                   I work in the office long hours

           11    starting about 7:30, 8:00 in the morning and

           12    typically about 6:30, 7:00 at night.  I preform

           13    office consultations as well as in office

           14    injections.  And about a day and a half, two

           15    days a week I have dedicated time performing

           16    injections either under ultrasound or x-ray

           17    guidance primarily to the spine as the rest of

           18    the procedures I could do in the office.

           19                   When I evaluate patients in the

           20    office, I perform what we call a full

           21    consultation where patients come to me, I

           22    review their diagnostic studies, I review their

           23    history, I discuss the condition that they are

           24    suffering from, what caused their condition,

           25    what can happen in the future.  It's really

                                                               12



            1    called a prognosis.  What's going to happen to

            2    them 5, 10, 20 years from now.  What's going to

            3    happen if they take option A, B, or C.  They

            4    can do nothing, they can do this, they can do

            5    that, and what's going to happen to them when

            6    they get older.  I give them their options and

            7    chances of one or another making them better or

            8    not and always you give the patient a chance of

            9    something making them worse or making them no

           10    different.

           11          Q.       And I believe you touched upon

           12    this earlier, but as part of your practice do

           13    you routinely review medical records and

           14    diagnostic studies and images?

           15          A.       Yes.  Well, it's a two-part

           16    question.  First, regarding medical records, as

           17    a specialist I have no personal knowledge of a

           18    patient until they walk through my door at a

           19    specific point in time.  I don't know their

           20    history.  So it is customary medicine to rely

           21    on their physicians' medical records to help us

           22    formulate an opinion.  Meaning, other doctors'

           23    notes, ER records, therapy notes, diagnotic

           24    studies, reports.  It helps come up with a

           25    causation and come up with at least a chain of

                                                               13



            1    events or sequence of events to help me

            2    formulate my opinion and my diagnosis.  But as

            3    everything in medicine, it's a puzzle.  I have

            4    to put all the pieces together.  So history is

            5    one.  Diagnostics is two.  My own exam is

            6    three.  I guess records from other doctors is

            7    four.  So you put everything together, you come

            8    up with a diagnosis and prognosis and treatment

            9    plans.  This is regarding the medical records.

           10                   In regards to the diagnostic

           11    studies, I am not a radiologist, but the nature

           12    of my specialty, I read MRIs, CAT Scans, and

           13    x-rays.  I limit myself to reading only the

           14    body parts where I'm going to perform

           15    procedures.  So either the joints or spine.

           16    I'm not good at reading soft tissue ultrasounds

           17    aside from me just doing the injection, which

           18    we call function ultrasounds.  So I don't fancy

           19    myself a radiologist nor do I bill for those

           20    readings.

           21                   But if I'm the one sticking a

           22    needle a long in somebody's back, I need to

           23    make sure I know what I'm talking about.  I

           24    don't want my patients to be backseat

           25    passengers basically where a doctor just says

                                                               14



            1    it's a one-way street where everybody explains

            2    it.  I love to get their brain -- to bring the

            3    images.  In the old days we used to put them up

            4    in the viewing box.  Now I put them on my

            5    computer and I flip my laptop and I show it to

            6    the patient and discuss everything with them to

            7    make sure they understand the condition they

            8    are suffering.

            9          Q.       And, Doctor, you're currently

           10    licensed to practice medicine here in the

           11    Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; is that right?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       Okay.  And have you ever

           14    qualified to testify as an expert witness in

           15    the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas

           16    before?

           17          A.       Yes, ma'am.

           18          Q.       Okay.  And you were paid --

           19    you're being paid to testify here today; is

           20    that right?

           21          A.       Correct.

           22          Q.       Okay.  What is your fee for

           23    today?

           24          A.       $2,000.  And we agreed that this

           25    would be a mutual convenient time to testify

                                                               15



            1    and place rather than my office where we are

            2    not setup.  As I was working in Philadelphia

            3    today, but we don't have such a nice conference

            4    room.  It's a pure clinical space.

            5          Q.       If you weren't here testifying

            6    today, what would you be doing?

            7          A.       I would still be seeing patients

            8    for a little bit over two hours, probably.  I

            9    usually get out about 7:00ish.

           10          Q.       Okay.  So the fee that you

           11    charged, the $2,000 that you mentioned,

           12    compensates you for the money that you're

           13    missing by not treating patients?

           14          A.       It's for the time to be away

           15    from my practice, to prepare for today's

           16    testimony, and not being able to provide care

           17    for my patients.

           18                   MS. STURGES:  At this time I

           19          offer Dr. Gene Levinstein as an expert

           20          witness in the fields of physical

           21          medicine and rehabilitation and pain

           22          management.  Counsel?

           23    BY MR. SHUEY:

           24          Q.       Doctor, I just have a few

           25    questions for you.  First, I would like to go

                                                               16



            1    back and discuss a little bit about your

            2    education.  You went to Temple University for

            3    undergraduate education; is that --

            4          A.       Correct.

            5          Q.       And then you went to Ross

            6    University School of Medicine in the West

            7    Indies?

            8          A.       Correct.

            9          Q.       And then you came back to

           10    Philadelphia to do your internship and your

           11    residency?

           12          A.       Correct.

           13          Q.       And then your fellowship out in

           14    Pottstown; is that right?

           15          A.       Correct.

           16          Q.       And the fellowship was with a

           17    place called Interventional Spine and Pain

           18    Management; is that right?

           19          A.       Correct.

           20          Q.       Okay.  Currently, you work at

           21    several different offices; is that right?

           22          A.       Well, I have my own practice,

           23    Pennsylvania Pain Specialists, which is

           24    primarily located in Lehigh Valley.  I live in

           25    Bucks County so I live sort of centrally.  I

                                                               17



            1    love Philly.  I came here when I was a teenager

            2    and I grew up in Philly.  That's why I practice

            3    in Philadelphia about once every other week.

            4    Sometimes more frequently, sometimes maybe a

            5    little less depending on the volume of the

            6    patients.  I rent space from a place called

            7    Spinal Care in Philadelphia.  Otherwise, I have

            8    my offices in Lehigh Valley.

            9          Q.       And is Spinal Care of

           10    Philadelphia, is that office location listed on

           11    your CV?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       Can you point it to me.  I'm

           14    sorry.

           15          A.       Sure.  I guess -- I apologize.

           16    You're right.  It's not listed.  It's not my

           17    primary office, not the office that I own.

           18    It's one of the places where I rent space.  I

           19    apologize it is not listed as one of the

           20    primary locations.

           21          Q.       That's no problem.  So just to

           22    be clear, you have the office that you rent in

           23    Philadelphia and then another one in Allentown,

           24    another one in Bethlehem --

           25          A.       That's it.

                                                               18



            1          Q.       Just those three?

            2          A.       Correct.

            3          Q.       Okay.  You also list VitamedIV

            4    or is that Vitamed Four?

            5          A.       No.  VitamedIV.

            6          Q.       Okay.  And what is that?

            7          A.       I'm no longer working there.

            8    It's a facility, medical IV infusion, where I

            9    was a medical director until May of this year.

           10          Q.       Oh, I'm sorry.  I do see that it

           11    says until May of this year.  I misunderstood.

           12    Thank you.  Doctor, you've mentioned that you

           13    you've testified in the past in cases like

           14    this; is that right?

           15          A.       Correct.

           16          Q.       Okay.  How many times have you

           17    testified in an injury case similar to what

           18    we're here for today?

           19          A.       I can't say the total how many

           20    times I've testified or, I guess, whatever

           21    specific time period.  But I would say on the

           22    average for a personal injury case where I have

           23    to testify on video or live in court, probably

           24    about once a month or so.

           25          Q.       How long have you been

                                                               19



            1    testifying about once a month or so?

            2          A.       It really fluctuates.  I can go

            3    for some months where I don't testify.  Then

            4    the next month I'm testifying two times.  But

            5    at most, I would say it's probably about once a

            6    month for, maybe, five, six years.

            7          Q.       Now, could you give us a

            8    percentage breakdown.  How many times do you

            9    testify on behalf of plaintiffs or plaintiffs'

           10    offices and how many times you testify on

           11    behalf of defendants or defense offices?

           12          A.       I would say 99 percent of the

           13    time, 99 percent plus, I am the treating doctor

           14    or I perform an Independent Medical Evaluation.

           15          Q.       And I understand -- so when

           16    you're the treating doctor, you've given some

           17    kind of treatment to the plaintiff in the case

           18    that you're talking about, right?

           19          A.       I refer to them as patients,

           20    yes.  I testify on behalf of my patients.

           21          Q.       Okay.  However, when you give an

           22    Independent Medical Evaluation, that's when

           23    you're not testifying on behalf of a patient,

           24    but rather someone that's been referred to you

           25    and somebody has asked for your opinion; is

                                                               20



            1    that correct?

            2          A.       Correct.  Independent Medical

            3    Evaluation is the name -- stands as

            4    independent.  You have no doctor-patient

            5    relationship.  So you see the patient once, you

            6    review medical records, a little or a lot, and

            7    you issue your opinion and you provide the

            8    report to the requesting party.  Usually an

            9    attorney or a case manager.

           10          Q.       How often do you do Independent

           11    Medical Evaluations?

           12          A.       Probably a few.  Two, three

           13    times a month.  It really depends.  Again,

           14    everything fluctuates.  I think this week I

           15    have two of them.  Last two weeks I had none.

           16          Q.       Okay.  When you do Independent

           17    Medical Evaluations, so you're not working with

           18    a patient of your's, do you ever do them for

           19    defense attorneys or defendants?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       What percentage do you do for --

           22    of Independent Medical Evaluations, what

           23    percentage do you do for defense attorneys or

           24    defendants and what percentage do you do for

           25    plaintiffs or plaintiff attorneys?

                                                               21



            1          A.       Very small for defense.

            2    Primarily patients who either seek a second

            3    opinion or somebody who was injured in some

            4    type of an accident, whether it's work related

            5    or personal injury.

            6          Q.       So would you agree the great

            7    majority are for the plaintiffs?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       In this case, you provided a

           10    report to the plaintiff's attorney, correct?

           11          A.       That is correct.

           12          Q.       And that report is dated July

           13    25, 2019, correct?

           14          A.       Correct.

           15          Q.       Was there a fee related to that

           16    report?

           17          A.       Yes.  Certainly.

           18          Q.       What was that?

           19          A.       $500.

           20          Q.       And that's in addition to the

           21    $2,000 that you spoke about earlier, correct?

           22          A.       Correct.  The fee for the report

           23    is for me to review medical records and to

           24    generate my report.  Patient was referred to me

           25    by the treating doctors and those bills have

                                                               22



            1    nothing to do with the report and the fee for

            2    today's testimony to be away from my practice

            3    and be here.

            4          Q.       Doctor, earlier you talked about

            5    the procedures that you do and you mentioned

            6    injections.

            7          A.       Correct.

            8          Q.       What other procedures do you do?

            9          A.       Primarily injections, whether

           10    it's some, I guess, more common such as

           11    epidural injections, facet blocks, medial

           12    branch blocks.  Two more involved procedures

           13    such as rhizotomies.  Two more involved

           14    procedures such as percutaneous

           15    disc-decompressions, implantation of spinal

           16    cord stimulators, even percutaneous

           17    laminotomies, stem cell injections.  You can go

           18    on.

           19          Q.       Okay.  Well, let me ask you

           20    this, do ever do arthroscopic surgery?

           21          A.       No.  I'm not an orthopedic

           22    surgeon.  Although, a few of the procedures

           23    that I do perform carry orthopedic codes such

           24    as putting cement inside the vertebral bones

           25    for fractures, called vertebroplasty or

                                                               23



            1    kyphoplasty or percutaneous disc-decompression

            2    or even I can do the decompression of the

            3    carpel tunnel.

            4                   I am not qualified to do an

            5    arthroscopic surgery, such as hips, knees, or

            6    shoulders.  If I felt one of those would be

            7    necessary, I would refer them to my orthopedic

            8    colleagues.  But that wouldn't be applicable to

            9    Ms. Gebeyaw in this case as she has no joint

           10    damage.

           11          Q.       Okay.  How about open surgery,

           12    something, like, as I understand, a cervical

           13    fusion for example?

           14          A.       No.  I think the answer would be

           15    the same.  If the patient needs a fusion or

           16    even a more advanced laminectomy, whatever --

           17    I'm going to go on surgeries -- or

           18    microdiscectomy, I would certainly refer to my

           19    orthopedic spine and neurosurgeon colleagues.

           20                   MR. SHUEY:  Those are all the

           21          questions I have.  Thank you, Doctor.

           22                   THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

           23    BY MS. STURGES:

           24          Q.       Doctor, I just have one brief

           25    follow-up about that.  Counsel was asking you

                                                               24



            1    about the number of times you've testified or

            2    write reports on behalf of plaintiffs versus

            3    defendants.  In those situations, regardless of

            4    whether or not you're doing so for a plaintiff

            5    or a defendant in a legal matter, would that

            6    have any impact on the outcome of your report

            7    and testimony?

            8          A.       No.  You evaluate the patient.

            9    And frankly when I write the report, I don't

           10    really know who is requesting it.  If it's

           11    requested by an attorney, it's just a name with

           12    esquire after it.  When you issue a prognosis

           13    or a causation, it's based on the patient's

           14    evaluation, based on the review of records,

           15    based on the diagnosis.  Treatment

           16    recommendations would be essentially the same

           17    whether it's a plaintiff or a defendant because

           18    it's based on diagnosis sustained.

           19                   MS. STURGES:  Thank you, Doctor.

           20          Again, at this time I offer Dr. Gene

           21          Levinstein as an expert witness in the

           22          fields of physical medicine and

           23          rehabilitation and pain management.

            2    BY MS. STURGES:

            3          Q.       So, Doctor, we're here to take

            4    your testimony today on behalf of Mehret

            5    Gebeyaw related to her treatment following a

            6    motor vehicle accident that she was involved in

            7    on November 9, 2017.  During the course of your

            8    testimony here today, I'm going to ask you for

            9    some opinions, but I don't want you to give any

           10    unless you can do so to a reasonable degree of

           11    medical certainty; is that fair?

           12          A.       Yes, ma'am.

           13          Q.       So you treated Ms. Gebeyaw; is

           14    that correct?

           15          A.       That is correct.

           16          Q.       Okay.  And you also did review

           17    some records at the request of my office; is

           18    that right?

           19          A.       In addition to the records

           20    available to me during her evaluation, yes.

           21    Your office provided some records when I was

           22    preparing the report.

           23          Q.       Okay.  And you did prepare a

           24    comprehensive report that you have in front of

           25    you marked as Levinstein-2; is that right?

                                                               26



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       I'm going to ask that you refer

            3    to that as needed during the course of your

            4    testimony.  Could you explain a little bit

            5    about your treatment of Ms. Gebeyaw in regards

            6    to her injuries from this accident.

            7          A.       When I saw Ms. Gebeyaw on April

            8    2nd of 2018, she presented to me with

            9    complaints of right neck pain going to the

           10    right shoulder and upper arm.  I reviewed the

           11    records from both Dr. Rosin with the EMG nerve

           12    conduction study, which showed radiculopathy or

           13    nerve damage on the right side.  I also

           14    reviewed and discussed the MRI results, which

           15    showed cervical disc herniations as well as

           16    some preexisting changes.

           17                   I discussed with the patient how

           18    the accident happened and the prior treatment

           19    that she received.  I examined her and we

           20    agreed that the best course of care at this

           21    point, as she failed to progress beyond a

           22    certain point and certain time -- I think it

           23    was about six months at that point -- after

           24    accident she continued to be in pain.  So I

           25    felt it was reasonable, appropriate, and

                                                               27



            1    necessary to proceed to the next step in

            2    intervention such as injections, which I did on

            3    April 2nd of 2018.

            4          Q.       And what type of injection was

            5    that?

            6          A.       I performed a cervical epidural

            7    steroid injection.  This is a procedure where a

            8    physician puts a needle in the back of the

            9    spine.  Would preform this -- usually go from

           10    the back.  There is two ways of doing this.

           11    You can go from the side next to the nerve or

           12    you can go from the back of the spine.

           13                   Neck injections are

           14    traditionally considered the most dangerous

           15    types of procedures because of the amount of

           16    skill level needed as well as really no margin

           17    for error.  You are literally sitting within

           18    half a millimeter or a millimeter away from the

           19    spinal cord in the neck so you don't want to

           20    spear it going from the back.  If you go from

           21    the side, you're away from the spinal cord, but

           22    you have to follow certain protocol of

           23    injection because you don't want to cause a

           24    blood clot, which can make the patient

           25    paralyzed.

                                                               28



            1                   So different types of -- I'm

            2    sorry.  Similar injection, different type of

            3    risks.  And the goal of the injection is to

            4    take away inflammation, take away pain, help

            5    the body's natural healing process.

            6          Q.       Now, one of the keywords that

            7    you mentioned as you were explaining was the

            8    term cervical.  What does that mean?

            9          A.       Neck.

           10          Q.       Okay.  And I have a very

           11    important question for you.  After your

           12    treatment of her with that injection in April

           13    of 2018, as well as the records that you

           14    reviewed both at the time of the treatment as

           15    well as after, did you find that she suffered

           16    any injuries as a result of the motor vehicle

           17    accident?

           18          A.       I did.

           19          Q.       Okay.  Could you explain to the

           20    jury what injuries you found.

           21          A.       I felt that based on records

           22    reviewed, signs, symptoms, my own exam, as well

           23    as imaging, diagnostic studies such as the MRI

           24    and EMG which are objective findings, I felt

           25    that Ms. Gebeyaw sustained specifically five

                                                               29



            1    injuries that continue to bother her and one

            2    that I felt was resolved.

            3                   I felt that the shoulder sprain

            4    and strain and the mid and low back sprain and

            5    strain, thoracic lumbar sprain and strain, has

            6    resolved and certainly did not bother her at

            7    the time of my evaluation and did not continue

            8    to present any issues.

            9                   However, more importantly and

           10    more seriously, the injuries that continued to

           11    bother her was the right sided disc herniation

           12    as C3/4 with an EMG confirmed right C4

           13    radiculopathy.  The occipital neurology or the

           14    pain in the back of the head.  Cervicalgia,

           15    also known as neck pain, cervical whiplash, and

           16    aggravation of preexisting cervical

           17    degenerative disc disease.

           18          Q.       Now, what exactly is a

           19    herniation?

           20          A.       I really wish I had my model

           21    here so I'm going to subject the jury and his

           22    or her honor to my drawings.  This is the cross

           23    section of the disc.  I guess it's, like, a

           24    jelly or a Boston cream donut.  This is the

           25    jelly, this is the center of the disc, this is

                                                               30



            1    the ring (indicating).

            2                   When the patient is healthy, the

            3    disc is fine.  When we're young, discs are nice

            4    and plump.  They are tall.  There is nothing

            5    bothering them.  However, when you get -- as

            6    you can see when you get in a car accident,

            7    such as this, you get hit and the spine

            8    suffers.  So disc can herniate out.  As you can

            9    see here, the disc herniates out and it's

           10    pressing on the nerve.  This is what is called

           11    herniation or radiculopathy.  When we typically

           12    describe the discs, we can say there is

           13    different degrees of bulging, protrusion, or

           14    herniation, and it gets progressively worse.

           15                   Bulging can be signs of normal

           16    aging.  Three out of ten people in the room

           17    will have some bulges they may not even know

           18    about.  So if we have 12 jurors, you know,

           19    three, four of them may have disc bulges

           20    depending on their age, also depending what

           21    type of activity you do.  As you get older, you

           22    develop some arthritis and they can develop

           23    into protrusion.

           24                   But herniations are not normal.

           25    It's never a sign of normal aging.  It just

                                                               31



            1    doesn't sit there where bulges can be there and

            2    what I described as asymptomatic.  Meaning,

            3    it's there.  You don't know how about it.  It's

            4    just there.  If you get an x-ray or MRI, you

            5    found the bulge so it doesn't bother you.

            6    Herniations are symptomatic.  They are painful.

            7    So that's the big difference.

            8          Q.       And one of the other terms that

            9    I wanted to ask you about was radiculopathy.

           10    Can you explain to the jury what exactly you

           11    mean by that.

           12          A.       Radiculopathy is a fancy term

           13    for nerve damage.  We diagnosis radiculopathy

           14    based on the EMG.  So you really need both.

           15    When you do an MRI, MRI is an awesome test, but

           16    at the end of the day it's a snapshot in time.

           17    It's a picture.  That's all it tells you.  You

           18    can look at the MRI, you can try to put a

           19    timestamp on it.  You can say, well, there is

           20    some arthritis so that was there for a while.

           21    There is no arthritis surrounding disc

           22    herniation so it's newer.  It's fresher than

           23    the other stuff before.  But you can't put a

           24    specific timestamp.  You can't say that the

           25    herniation occurred on April 2nd.  You just

                                                               32



            1    can't do that.  Or whatever the date of the

            2    accident is.

            3                   But you could say, it's acute,

            4    subacute, or chronic.  So that's where the EMG

            5    comes in.  Because what an MRI shows you, there

            6    is some pressure on the nerve root.  It doesn't

            7    tell you how much nerve damage is there.  EMG

            8    or nerve conduction study gives you a

            9    quantitative analysis of how much nerve damage

           10    is there without getting specific terms, like,

           11    all this fancy stuff.  You can call it mild,

           12    moderate, or severe amount of nerve damage.

           13    And you can give it, again, more, much closer

           14    timeframe, six weeks, three months, six months.

           15    So you can try to correlate it together.  You

           16    should probably never perform EMG when patient

           17    doesn't have pain down the arm or the MRI is

           18    negative.

           19          Q.       Okay.  And, Doctor, out of all

           20    the injuries you listed, what are the most

           21    serious in your opinion?

           22          A.       The C3/4 herniation with the C4

           23    radiculopathy.

           24          Q.       And why is that?

           25          A.       Well, that's permanent in

                                                               33



            1    nature.  Radiculopathy means it's permanent

            2    because there is permanent nerve damage and a

            3    herniation that size just physiologically it's

            4    not going to resolve.

            5          Q.       Now, do you have an opinion to a

            6    reasonable degree of medical certainty as to

            7    the extent or seriousness of any of the other

            8    injuries that you just described for the jury?

            9          A.       They are serious and they are

           10    related to this.  Aside from the sprain and

           11    strain in the low back and the shoulder, which

           12    has resolved, I would say they are a little bit

           13    less serious than the herniation.  I'm not sure

           14    I understood the question correctly.

           15          Q.       I think you answered, Doctor.  I

           16    know you talked about permanency just a minute

           17    ago.  Could you just clarify for the jury what

           18    injuries, if any, are permanent as a result of

           19    this accident.

           20          A.       C3/4 herniation with a C4

           21    radiculopathy is permanent.

           22          Q.       And do you have any opinion as

           23    to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as

           24    to the cause of the injuries that you have

           25    described?

                                                               34



            1          A.       Yes.  Based on timing, based on

            2    records reviewed, based on the fact the patient

            3    did not have any significant preexisting

            4    medical history aside from one car accident a

            5    few years -- four or five years ago, she

            6    specifically denied any neck pain or any issues

            7    predating the car accident in question in 2017.

            8                   We know that there was nothing

            9    else causing this.  So we have this one

           10    specific event, the car accident.  Then we have

           11    this pain going down the arm.  Get the MRI,

           12    which shows some preexisting arthritis, which

           13    was no doubt there before.  But the 3/4

           14    herniation, which is large in size and does not

           15    have any disc osteophyte complex, meaning it

           16    doesn't have any arthritis surrounding that

           17    disc making it acute more than chronic, which

           18    means it's more likely to be correlated with

           19    the accident and then it correlates with the

           20    EMG, which again doesn't show that the nerve

           21    damage hasn't been there for years and years.

           22          Q.       Now, Doctor, I know you've

           23    already touched upon this a little bit, but

           24    could you explain for the jury just a review of

           25    the records that you reviewed pertaining to Ms.

                                                               35



            1    Gebeyaw.

            2          A.       Aside from my own discussion of

            3    the car accident with the patient, how she was

            4    sideswiped, I reviewed the records from PennDel

            5    Rehab, from the therapy as well as a short

            6    summary from Dr. Whalen.  I reviewed the EMG

            7    nerve conduction study, both the raw data and

            8    the report from Dr. Rosin.  I do agree with his

            9    findings.  As well as the MRI where I reviewed

           10    the actual images of the study in addition to

           11    the radiology report.

           12          Q.       And in terms of reviewing -- for

           13    the EMG, I know you mentioned you reviewed the

           14    actual raw data, if you will.  Why is it

           15    important to review that?

           16          A.       Well, from me being a

           17    physiatrist because I do EMGs in my office, I

           18    am able to review the data and see if I agree

           19    with the other doctor or not, see if anything

           20    was missed.  If any other doctor reviewed it

           21    who doesn't know how to do EMGs, they probably

           22    just look at the report.

           23          Q.       And in terms of an EMG, I know

           24    you were talking about radiculopathy earlier,

           25    can you explain a little bit more in terms of

                                                               36



            1    radicular complaints.  Are they constant a

            2    occurrence or can they come and go?

            3          A.       Radicular complaints wax and

            4    wane depending on the amount of nerve

            5    irritation, depending on position.  For

            6    example, this patient had a positive Spurling's

            7    test.  Spurling's test is when you put a

            8    patient's head back and twist it and tilt it

            9    and you press on top of the head.  When you do

           10    that you compress spaces where nerves come out.

           11                   If you do it on a healthy

           12    patient, you have enough space for the nerve to

           13    flow.  When you compress it, nothing is going

           14    to happen.  Maybe some, whatever, neck

           15    discomfort, but nothing shooting down.  A

           16    positive Spurling's test, when you compress it

           17    and the area is already compromised from the

           18    herniated disc, now you're really squashing

           19    that nerve.  So you will get the shooting pain

           20    down the arm.  And in this case, it went into

           21    the upper arm and the shoulder, which is the C4

           22    nerve distrubution.

           23          Q.       And in reference to the

           24    diagnostic testing that you've been speaking

           25    about, particularly the MRI and the EMG, are

                                                               37



            1    they objective tests?

            2          A.       As I testified earlier,

            3    objective tests.  Patient cannot fake those

            4    tests.  In medicine we have something called

            5    Waddell's testing.  Waddell's testing is the

            6    constellation of five tests that we use to see

            7    if the patient is faking, symptom magnifying,

            8    or exaggerating like they are trying to pull a

            9    fast one on you.

           10                   At least in my practice I try to

           11    perform the same test twice.  Once when the

           12    patient knows it and another time when I'm

           13    pretending to examine something else and I'm

           14    still performing the same test.  And in this

           15    case, I didn't find negative Waddell signs.

           16    Meaning, patient's physical exam was consistent

           17    with the findings.  I try to objectify physical

           18    exam findings.

           19                   And in contrast, the MRI and

           20    EMG, patient cannot fake.  MRI is an MRI.

           21    Patient as no effect on the discs.  EMG

           22    patients are asked to squeeze the arm or make

           23    and do biceps.  But if the patient is going

           24    like this and nothing is happening, you can

           25    actually see the lack of effort in the study.

                                                               38



            1    So you can call the patient out for faking that

            2    on there.

            3          Q.       And, Doctor, when she visited

            4    you in April of 2018, was Ms. Gebeyaw still

            5    having complaints of pain from this accident?

            6          A.       Yes.  In regards to her neck

            7    going to the shoulder.

            8          Q.       Okay.  And did you make any

            9    recommendations for any future medical

           10    treatment?

           11          A.       Yes.  We discussed a need for

           12    future care.  Specifically starting with a

           13    cervical epidural because that would be the

           14    next appropriate step.  You never start with an

           15    epidural on day one.  You follow the treatment

           16    protocol, you go to the ER, you see a doctor,

           17    you get medications, antiinflammatories, muscle

           18    relaxers, you do some therapy, you do some

           19    studies.  And finally when nothing gets better

           20    about four, five, six months, that's when you

           21    should go for the injection.

           22                   In this case, for future care, I

           23    described in my report that future care for

           24    this diagnosis specifically includes further

           25    diagnostic studies.  Meaning, depending on the

                                                               39



            1    progression of the disease, patient would be a

            2    candidate for an MRI and an EMG of the neck

            3    within three to five years.  Patient would be a

            4    candidate for repeat course of therapy, as well

            5    as a repeat course of epidural injections.

            6          Q.       And why is it important that in

            7    instances like this you would recommend for

            8    repeat testing?

            9          A.       Well, to see how much the

           10    condition progressed, how much has it changed.

           11    You don't expect it to get better, but you can

           12    expect it to get worse with age.  And to see if

           13    patient becomes a surgical candidate.  God

           14    forbid it starts pressing the spinal canal or

           15    disc herniation continues and goes further out,

           16    becomes a neurologic emergency or surgical

           17    emergency or emergency where you need to get a

           18    surgeon or perform an injection.  Maybe not a

           19    surgery, but an injection at least and it's not

           20    an option.  It's not, well, I'll think about

           21    it, but, hey, we need to do this or you're

           22    going to risk losing something.

           23          Q.       And, Doctor, did you come up

           24    with a prognosis for Ms. Gebeyaw?

           25          A.       I did as I do for all my

                                                               40



            1    patients.  As I testified earlier on direct,

            2    when patients come to me as a specialist, they

            3    come to me for prognosis.

            4          Q.       And what exactly was your

            5    prognosis here?

            6          A.       I felt my prognosis was guarded

            7    to poor as this condition is permanent and I

            8    don't expect it to get better.  Given her age,

            9    I actually expect it to get worse, impacting

           10    her further functional ability.

           11          Q.       And, Doctor, do you have an

           12    opinion to a reasonable degree of medical

           13    certainty, as to the reasonableness and

           14    necessity of all the treatment that Ms. Gebeyaw

           15    received following this incident?

           16          A.       Yes.  I felt it was reasonable

           17    and necessary.  As we didn't jump to injections

           18    on day one.  We followed the treatment protocol

           19    from the least invasive to most invasive.

           20          Q.       Okay.  And one last question

           21    here, Doctor.  Have you given all of your

           22    opinions today to a reasonable degree of

           23    medical certainty?

           24          A.       Yes, ma'am.

           25          Q.       Thank you, Doctor.

            3                    CROSS EXAMINATION

            4                         - - -

            5    BY MR. SHUEY:

            6          Q.       Doctor, how many times did you

            7    see the plaintiff?

            8          A.       Once, sir.

            9          Q.       And that was on April 2, 2018?

           10          A.       Correct.

           11          Q.       And you haven't seen the

           12    plaintiff since then?

           13          A.       I have not seen Ms. Gebeyaw

           14    since then.

           15          Q.       Have you spoken with the

           16    plaintiff since then?

           17          A.       No.

           18          Q.       Okay.  So that was a year and

           19    five months ago, the only time that you saw the

           20    plaintiff.  Is that about right?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       And at the time we previously

           23    discussed you wrote your report -- I'm sorry.

           24    July 25, 2019, so that would be about a year

           25    and four months between the time you saw the

                                                               42



            1    plaintiff and wrote your report?

            2          A.       Correct.  I was trying to do the

            3    math on my fingers.

            4          Q.       Now, when you saw the plaintiff,

            5    how did you communicate with her?

            6          A.       I don't recall.  I'm sure if

            7    patients don't speak English, we have a

            8    translator.  At this point, I honestly don't

            9    recall.

           10          Q.       Okay.  Do you know, is that

           11    translator normally a family member or somebody

           12    else or in this case you just simply can't

           13    recall?

           14          A.       I don't recall, but we have an

           15    office translator 99 percent of the time.

           16          Q.       In this case, Ms. Gebeyaw speaks

           17    a language from Ethiopia or Eritrea.  Would you

           18    have a language translator in your office for

           19    that?

           20          A.       No, we don't.  It's funny you

           21    say -- actually, in Allentown I do.  But here,

           22    someone from the hospital -- we also utilize

           23    translation machines or hospital translators,

           24    but those are notoriously difficult in a

           25    situation like this.  Frankly, I don't recall

                                                               43



            1    which translator was utilized.  I guarantee it

            2    was family member.  Sometimes we even utilize a

            3    phone.  Like I said, I don't recall what we did

            4    in this instance.

            5          Q.       Okay.  Now, from your review of

            6    the records in this case, would you agree with

            7    me that her last physical therapy was in March

            8    of 2018?

            9          A.       Correct.  March 27th.

           10          Q.       And then she had her EMG test,

           11    which you discussed, in March of 2018?

           12          A.       Correct.

           13          Q.       And the treatment she got from

           14    you, the injection the one time you saw her,

           15    was in early April of 2018?

           16          A.       Correct.

           17          Q.       And since then she's had no

           18    treatment related to this accident?

           19          A.       I am not personally aware of any

           20    treatment that she had or she did not have.  I

           21    had no personal direction with this patient

           22    beyond my report and no additional records were

           23    provided to me regarding any additional care

           24    when I authored this report this summer.

           25          Q.       So to your knowledge, all of her

                                                               44



            1    treatment ended with your treatment in April of

            2    2018?

            3          A.       To the best of my knowledge.

            4          Q.       Now, the injection that you gave

            5    her, you gave her the injection the first and

            6    only time you saw Ms. Gebeyaw, right?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       And that was done under local

            9    anesthesia?

           10          A.       Correct.

           11          Q.       Can you just explain for the

           12    jury the difference between local and general

           13    anesthesia.

           14          A.       Absolutely.  Actually, the

           15    Medicaid, Medicare guidelines recently strongly

           16    suggest that based on evidence that we don't

           17    utilize sedation such as anesthesia sedation,

           18    MAC, monitored anesthesia care, for this type

           19    of procedure.  As when you put a patient to

           20    sleep you have to intubate them or least put an

           21    airway because you're significantly increasing

           22    risk of aspiration.  So risks outweigh the

           23    benefits despite significant fear of needles,

           24    pain with the procedure.  At the end of the

           25    day, it's still an injection.  It's still a

                                                               45



            1    needle.  So you can try to numb the patient up.

            2                   So the difference between both,

            3    when we do local sedation, we can either give a

            4    patient a Valium to make them feel more relaxed

            5    and we use a smaller gauged needle to numb up

            6    the skin and then put the needle deeper to numb

            7    up as much as possible before you put a thick

            8    spinal needle in there.  So you at least numb

            9    up the track.

           10                   So when you say, numb the

           11    patient up, it's not painless by any means.

           12    You still feel the needle going in because you

           13    have to go in with a needle to put the local

           14    anesthetic deep in.  You feel the burn of the

           15    local anesthetic, but you decrease the

           16    discomfort versus sedation or anesthesia.  You

           17    can either knock the patient out fully flaccid.

           18    That's when you have to intubate them.  They

           19    can't breathe on their own or can you do

           20    something I do in the hospital when I do my own

           21    sedition, conscious sedation.  Where we put in

           22    the IV and we put the patient in twilight

           23    state.

           24          Q.       Doctor, I think my question --

           25    I'm sorry.  That was a very thorough

                                                               46



            1    explanation.  I appreciate that.

            2          A.       At least it was educational.

            3          Q.       Yeah.  And I appreciate that.

            4    My questions was simpler.  So local anesthesia

            5    would be numbing the area, general anesthesia

            6    would be putting the patient to some sort of

            7    sleep; is that fair?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Here you numbed the area?

           10          A.       Correct.

           11          Q.       And you mentioned something

           12    about Valium.  In your operative report you

           13    don't mention using any Valium on this

           14    particular patient.

           15          A.       Correct.

           16          Q.       And that injection was done in

           17    your office, correct?

           18          A.       Correct.

           19          Q.       Now, you mentioned that you

           20    reviewed the MRI film from Advanced

           21    Diagnostics, correct?

           22          A.       Correct.

           23          Q.       And did you also look at the

           24    report of the MRI film?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               47



            1          Q.       Do you disagree with the report?

            2          A.       No.  I agree with the report

            3    that there was a herniation at C3/4, that there

            4    were preexisting degenerative changes and some

            5    osteophytes around the boney spurs.  I

            6    certainly don't disagree with the radiologist.

            7          Q.       Okay.  In your report, you list

            8    your diagnoses and one of those diagnoses is

            9    DDD, which I believe is degenerative disc

           10    disease.  Am I right about that?

           11          A.       That's correct.

           12          Q.       Can you tell the jury what

           13    degenerative disc disease is.

           14          A.       Degenerative disc diease means

           15    when the disc loses their height and discs lose

           16    their water content and get some arthritis

           17    surrounding the discs means they become weak.

           18    A situation such as this, such as the car

           19    accident, when you get hit makes them unstable

           20    or makes them hurt where they were, like,

           21    teeter tattering on the edge before and

           22    something pushed them over that edge.

           23          Q.       Is degenerative disc disease a

           24    normal part of aging?

           25          A.       Yes.  100 percent.

                                                               48



            1          Q.       You also mentioned spondylosis.

            2    Can you tell the jury what that is.

            3          A.       Spondylosis is also part of

            4    degeneration, part of aging.  It refers

            5    traditionally to other parts of the spine, the

            6    facet joints or the little joints in the back

            7    of the spine where you develop some osteophilic

            8    spurs or boney spurs and some overgrowth.  It's

            9    another part of arthritis.

           10          Q.       Can you explain for the jury

           11    what osteophytes are.

           12          A.       Osteophytes are boney spurs

           13    which grow as a result of just age, friction,

           14    friction where there is not supposed to be, and

           15    traditionally known as arthritic changes.  Just

           16    boney spurs, boney hooks, boney projections.

           17          Q.       Is it fair to say those boney

           18    spurs aren't as a result of any car accident?

           19          A.       No, no, no.  Not at all.  And

           20    that's why I specifically diagnosed this

           21    patient as number five under my diagnosis,

           22    aggravation of cervical degenerative disc

           23    disease and spondylosis.  I separated disc

           24    herniation and C3/4 and C4 radiculopathy

           25    because that did not have any osteophytes with

                                                               49



            1    degenerative changes associated with that

            2    specific disc herniation.

            3          Q.       Okay.  I have a few more

            4    questions about degeneration in the spine, but

            5    I just want to be clear or if you could help me

            6    be clear about this.  Degeneration is different

            7    from trauma, correct?

            8          A.       100 percent.

            9          Q.       So trauma would be from a car

           10    accident or something like that, degeneration

           11    would be just from the aging process?

           12          A.       Correct.  And to have

           13    aggravation of degenerative changes, you don't

           14    have to have any structural abnormality.

           15    Aggravation just means something that wasn't

           16    symptomatic before becomes symptomatic now.

           17    Wasn't hurting before, hurting now.

           18          Q.       I would like to refer to that

           19    MRI report.  If you need a copy of it I can

           20    give a copy.

           21          A.       Got it.

           22          Q.       It looks like you have a copy

           23    there.  On this report it says, all of the

           24    intervertebral discs demonstrate loss of signal

           25    in the T2 wave series indicating some disc

                                                               50



            1    desiccation.  Did I read that right?

            2          A.       That is correct.

            3          Q.       Desiccation, is that a

            4    degenerative condition?

            5          A.       Yes and no.  Disc desiccation

            6    corresponds only to the loss of disc normal

            7    water content.  Means, as we age, discs start

            8    losing their water and will look less bright.

            9    In a 61 -- I think she was at the time of the

           10    accident -- old female, you would expect a loss

           11    of disc water content.  It only becomes

           12    degenerative changes when you start losing disc

           13    height or you start developing osteophytes or

           14    boney spurs at the end plates of the bones.

           15          Q.       Let's talk specifically about

           16    the C3/4 disc.  That's the one that you said

           17    was impacted in this accident, correct?

           18          A.       Correct.

           19          Q.       First of all, the report says

           20    that there is loss of height at C3/4 indicating

           21    further degeneration.  Did I read that

           22    correctly?

           23          A.       I don't see that.

           24          Q.       It's right above where it starts

           25    listing the individual levels.  The sentence

                                                               51



            1    right above that.  So right above C2/3 it says

            2    -- it starts with additionally.  Do you see

            3    that on this page?

            4          A.       Correct.

            5          Q.       Did I read that correctly?

            6          A.       100 percent correct.

            7          Q.       And when specifically discussing

            8    C3/4, which is the disc at issue here, the

            9    first words here are degenerative end plate

           10    changes.  Can you explain what that means.

           11          A.       Yes.  Degenerative end pate

           12    changes refers not to the disc itself, but to

           13    the bones that it sits on.  I'm going to try to

           14    draw this.  Just bear with me for one second.

           15    And, again, in advance, I'm going to apologize

           16    for the quality of my drawing.  All right.

           17                   On this side, I guess it's the

           18    jury's -- I can't figure out the reverse with

           19    the camera.  On this one over here you have a

           20    normal disc height.  The disc sits nice in the

           21    center.  Here you have the degenerated disc.

           22    So the disc, as you can see, the height is

           23    significantly less for the degenerated disc

           24    over here.  So bones are becoming a little too

           25    close to each other.

                                                               52



            1                   So what happens, you may develop

            2    these little guys.  They are osteophytes

            3    because bone doesn't like to be too close to

            4    bone.  So that's what that means.

            5          Q.       Now, Doctor, I believe you

            6    testified earlier that the plaintiff had no

            7    prior injuries before this accident; is that

            8    right?

            9          A.       I testified that she had a prior

           10    accident before, five years before this one.

           11    But she denied any neck pain prior to the

           12    accident.

           13          Q.       Would it surprise you then that

           14    at her deposition she testified she had had

           15    neck pain in the past?

           16          A.       Yes.  In the past it wouldn't

           17    surprise me because she did have a prior

           18    accident about four or five years ago.  But

           19    what I testified is that she did not have any

           20    issues ongoing immediately prior to this

           21    accident.

           22          Q.       Okay.  So when you were writing

           23    your report, however, you were not aware that

           24    she had ever had neck pain before; is that

           25    correct?

                                                               53



            1          A.       If I remember correctly, yeah, I

            2    did not remember she had any significant issues

            3    that required or necessitated such evasive

            4    treatment.

            5          Q.       Well, I just asked about any

            6    neck pain, Doctor.

            7          A.       Understood.

            8          Q.       Is your answer still the same?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       Okay.  Now that you're aware

           11    today sitting here that she had had neck pain

           12    in the past, that's not changing your opinion,

           13    correct?

           14          A.       No, sir.  Because we have

           15    preexisting degenerative changes.  You have a

           16    car accident, what, five years ago.  I would

           17    understand why she would have some occasional

           18    neck pain.  Doesn't change the opinion.

           19          Q.       Doctor, earlier you testified,

           20    did I understand you correctly that you

           21    testified that herniations cannot resolve?

           22          A.       Majority of the herniations do

           23    not resolve completely.  If you have an

           24    extrusion, some of it can shrink or herniations

           25    can change in size, but herniations do not

                                                               54



            1    resolve.

            2          Q.       Now, I'm a little confused by

            3    that answer.  So can a person who is

            4    symptomatic because of herniation, can they

            5    ever feel better, can they ever be not

            6    symptomatic?

            7          A.       Yes.  And pain can fluctuate,

            8    pain can wax and wane as we were discussing on

            9    direct.  Depending on the amount of pressure on

           10    the nerve, depending on the type of herniation,

           11    the symptoms may change.  Sometimes you have a

           12    disc extrusion where there is a sequestered

           13    fragment.  There is an outside fragment of the

           14    disc not connected to the main disc portion and

           15    that can actually resolve.  But herniation such

           16    as this where it just protrudes back, that is

           17    unlikely to resolve.

           18          Q.       Okay.  Was your injection, the

           19    injection you gave her, was that meant to help

           20    her?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       Did it?

           23          A.       Since she did not come back for

           24    the follow-up, I could not tell you how much it

           25    helped.  But what I remember specifically is

                                                               55



            1    she was incredibly fearful of the needles,

            2    incredibly needle phobic.

            3          Q.       That brings me to a different

            4    issue, Doctor.  In your operative report, you

            5    actually write that a follow-up has actually

            6    been scheduled for patient in our office in ten

            7    days, correct?

            8          A.       That's correct.

            9          Q.       And she never came back?

           10          A.       Correct.

           11          Q.       Doctor, earlier you described

           12    how a motor vehicle accident can cause injury.

           13    Do you remember testifying about that?

           14          A.       I don't think I went into great

           15    detail, typical motor vehicle accident.  Every

           16    accident is different depending on the type of

           17    collision, the angulation of the collision,

           18    whether the patient was restrained or not,

           19    degree of speed obviously.  But traditionally

           20    it's a hyperflexion, hyperextension type of

           21    injury with a sudden acceleration, a sudden

           22    deceleration.  Basic laws of physics.

           23                   If you're traveling at a certain

           24    speed and you come to a sudden stop, bodies in

           25    motion tend to stay in motion.  Just because

                                                               56



            1    the car came to a stop, you continue to move,

            2    you get thrown against the seatbelt.  You stop,

            3    your organs continue to move and they get

            4    thrown inside and that's what causes disc

            5    herniations.  That's a general mechanism of a

            6    car accident.  I didn't -- I don't think I went

            7    in such great detail, but that's the gist.

            8          Q.       When you say hyper -- I believe

            9    you said hyperflexion or hyperextension, what

           10    do you mean?

           11          A.       Neck is supposed to move at a

           12    certain pace, a certain motion.  Typically,

           13    when you get in a car accident you develop

           14    forceful, sudden extension beyond normal where

           15    your neck gets pushed down and then flipped

           16    back beyond a certain angle at a very fast

           17    pace, like a whiplash.  Which, I think, is

           18    typically described as a car accident.

           19          Q.       Now, the reason that people get

           20    hurt in car accidents, if I'm understanding you

           21    correctly, is because there is force applied to

           22    the car and force applied to the body of the

           23    patient; is that right?

           24          A.       Traditionally, yes.

           25          Q.       And that moves them around?

                                                               57



            1          A.       Well, yes.  You might not move

            2    around if you're fully restrained in a five

            3    foot harness such as the race car drivers.  We

            4    don't have that in our everyday vehicles.

            5          Q.       Well, let's talk about Ms.

            6    Gebeyaw specifically.  Your testimony to the

            7    jury is that she was injured in this accident

            8    and that in fact a herniation was caused by

            9    this accident.  Am I understanding that right?

           10          A.       Correct.

           11          Q.       Okay.  So that would require

           12    force to her neck specifically, correct?

           13          A.       That is correct.

           14          Q.       Okay.  Doctor, in this case she

           15    testified that she felt nothing at all during

           16    the accident.  Are you aware of that?

           17          A.       I'm not aware of her specific

           18    testimony that she felt nothing at all.

           19    Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised by it.  But

           20    depending on the type of collision the disc was

           21    already, as we read through the report, was

           22    desiccated.  Means it was weak.  So if the disc

           23    is already weak, you may not feel any immediate

           24    pain.  It's actually very common for motor

           25    vehicle accidents for patients to be in a state

                                                               58



            1    of shock or don't feel much.  Then as the time

            2    progresses they feel significant pain or pain

            3    increases.

            4          Q.       Well, Doctor, certainly her body

            5    would have had to of moved for this accident to

            6    have caused a herniation, correct?

            7          A.       I cannot tell you how much her

            8    specific body has moved as a result of the

            9    accident, but it's apparent that she sustained

           10    some type of disc herniation and torsion type

           11    injury due to being sideswiped and her body did

           12    move a certain degree.  Because no matter how,

           13    if you collide at three miles per hour, you're

           14    still going to feel something.  You feel a

           15    jolt.  So frankly, I find it hard to believe

           16    that she didn't feel anything.

           17          Q.       Doctor, you disagree with her

           18    testimony?

           19          A.       Oh.  I'm nobody to disagree with

           20    the patient's own accord of what she's feeling.

           21    I'm just going by physics.

           22                   MR. SHUEY:  Thank you, Doctor.

           23                   THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

           24                   MS. STURGES:  I just have a few

           25          brief follow-up for you.

                                                               59

            3                         - - -

            4    BY MS. STURGES:

            5          Q.       You were mentioning a few terms.

            6    Particularly disc degeneration, osteophytes,

            7    arthritis, spondylosis, and you were explaining

            8    those terms to the jury when talking with

            9    counsel.  Could it be possible that somebody

           10    has those specific things, arthritis,

           11    spondylosis, and then become symptomatic after

           12    a trauma such as motor vehicle accident?

           13          A.       That's what's described as

           14    aggravation of degenerative changes and that's

           15    what I listed as number five on my list of

           16    diagnoses.  Means, something was there.  It was

           17    predating.  It was preexisting, but it was not

           18    hurting before and it started hurting after.

           19          Q.       Okay.  And in terms of

           20    injections, as I know that you were speaking

           21    about the injection that you provided to Ms.

           22    Gebeyaw back in April of 2018, are injections a

           23    permanent fix?

           24          A.       No.  Injections are not a

           25    permanent fix.  The medication that's injected

                                                               60



            1    is a combination of lidocaine and steroid.

            2    It's meant to take away inflammation, improve

            3    function, decrease pain.  Steroid is going to

            4    ware off.  The max shelf life of a steroid is

            5    about six months.

            6          Q.       And just so that I'm clear, in

            7    terms of your testimony earlier when speaking

            8    with counsel, is that one could become

            9    symptomatic after a trauma but not experience

           10    any pain at the time of the trauma; is that

           11    right?

           12          A.       Yes.  It is very common in motor

           13    vehicle accidents.  It has been very well

           14    reported in literature work that patients don't

           15    feel much pain or don't feel certain body parts

           16    hurt immediately after the accident.  And as

           17    the day or two days go by, they go to the ER

           18    because they feel severe pain.

           19          Q.       And I know that you were

           20    speaking a number about the MRIs and the

           21    osteophytes and spondylosis, did you review any

           22    records or did Ms. Gebeyaw make any complaints

           23    about prior radicular symptoms?

           24          A.       No, ma'am.

           25          Q.       Okay.  And, lastly, have any of

                                                               61



            1    counsel's questions changed your opinions in

            2    this matter?

            3          A.       No, ma'am.

            4          Q.       Okay.

            5                   MS. STURGES:  Thank you.  That's

            6          all I have.

           11    deposition is a true and correct record of the

           12    testimony given by the witness; and that I am

           13    neither of counsel nor kin to any party in said

           14    action, nor interested in the outcome thereof.

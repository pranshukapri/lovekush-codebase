        2                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Good morning,

        3         everyone.

        4                      Just before we get to the witness

        5         testimony this morning, we had an off-the-record

        6         conversation during which the respondent had renewed

        7         an application to have Mr. Dealy or a representative

        8         from Pillsbury present.

        9                      That application was denied.  No new

       10         arguments were raised, and so the prior ruling

       11         stands.

       12                      We can now proceed to hear Mr. Ausaf

       13         Qureshi, who is at the witness table.

       14                      Mr. Qureshi, good morning.

       15                      THE WITNESS:  Good morning to you.

       16                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Your testimony this

       17         morning is going to be recorded by a Court Reporter,

       18         so if she can't hear you, she's going to ask you to

       19         speak up, but it's important that you respond

       20         verbally, rather than nodding when you're asked

       21         questions or making any other kind of gestures.

       22                      And if you don't understand a question,

       23         you can certainly ask for it to be repeated, or for

       24         it to be rephrased.  I'd like you to do your best to

       25         answer the questions that you're asked as directly


                                                                      5

        3                      THE WITNESS:  Okay.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Do you understand?

        5                      THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do.

        6                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.

        7                      Actually, I'll give the affirmation

        8         first.

        9                      MR. HELLER:  That's right.

       10                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Do you affirm that

       11         the testimony you're about to give shall be truthful

       12         and do you commit to testify truthfully?

       13                      THE WITNESS:  I affirm that.

       14         A U S A F   Q U R E S H I, being first duly affirmed by

       15         the Notary, testifies as follows:

       16                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you.

       15         BY MR. HARRISON:

       16                Q     Mr. Qureshi, good morning.

       17         A      Good morning.

       18                Q     You say in Paragraph 4 of your witness

       19         statement that you are the company secretary of

       20         Midwest Fertilizer Company, LLC --

       21         A      That's right.

       22                Q     -- and also, you lead the commercial

       23         financial areas of project development for MFC.

       24                      What does it mean to be MFC's company

       25         secretary?  Are you part, for example, of the


                                                                      8

        2         management team of MFC?

        3         A      I am, yes.

        4                      MR. HARRISON:  Madame Arbitrator, I

        5         would mark as Plaintiff's Demonstrative No. 2 a

        6         printout.

        7                (Exhibit marked as Claimant Demonstrative 2.)

        8         BY MR. HARRISON:

        9                Q     Do you recognize this as the logo for

       10         Midwest Fertilizer Company, MFC, the respondent in

       11         this case?

       12         A      I do.

       13                Q     And are you aware that on its web site

       14         it has the management team members listed, and they

       15         are Michael Chorlton and Les Wright and no one else?

       16         A      Yes.

       17                Q     You knew that.

       18                      Why aren't you listed as a member of

       19         the management team if, in fact, you are a member of

       20         the management team?

       21         A      The web site is incomplete.

       22                Q     When did you realize that the web site

       23         was incomplete?

       24         A      Until you showed this to me.

       25                Q     Do you plan to have the web site


                                                                      9
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         updated?

        3         A      I do, I do.

        4                Q     Who else will you add to the web site?

        5         A      At the moment, I will remove Michael

        6         Chorlton, because he's no more with the company.  It

        7         will be Les Wright and myself.  We are the only two

        8         management employees at the moment.

        9                Q     When is the last time that you looked

       10         at MFC's web site?

       11         A      I don't recall, a year, maybe two years ago.

       12                You know, but this one is -- includes Michael

       13         Chorlton, who has been -- who left quite a while

       14         ago.

       15                Q     Yes.

       16                      Now, in your role as company secretary

       17         at MFC, how is that distinct from your role as

       18         company secretary of the parent company, the Fatima

       19         Group?

       20         A      So I have responsibility for three fertilizer

       21         companies back home.  And each has its own board,

       22         but I am the common company secretary there.

       23                Here, although there is no board, it's not a

       24         requirement at an LLC, but I am the regulatory lead.

       25         I ensure compliance with the U.S. SEC and any other


                                                                     10
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         requirements related to Midwest Fertilizer.

        3                So they're distinct companies.  Because they

        4         are distinct companies, therefore, my role can be

        5         segregated according to the regulations governing

        6         the articles and the memorandum of each company.

        7                Q     In 2010 you joined the -- is it Fatima

        8         or Fatima?

        9         A      Fatima.

       10                Q     Thank you, sir.

       11                      In 2010 you joined the Fatima Group as

       12         company secretary and head of investor relations,

       13         and you still worked at the Fatima Group today, as

       14         you say in Paragraph 7 of your statement.

       15         A      Yes.

       16                Q     Is that correct, sir?

       17         A      That's correct.

       18                Q     Now, the Fatima Group has existed for

       19         some 83 years, and as you say in Paragraph 8, is one

       20         of the largest and most successful conglomerates in

       21         Pakistan, correct, sir?

       22         A      Correct.

       23                Q     It is, indeed, a

       24         multi-multi-billion-dollar enterprise, correct, sir?

       25         A      That's correct.

        2                      MR. HARRISON:  And, Madame Arbitrator,

        3         for housekeeping, I will provide you and opposing

        4         counsel with a copy of C. Dem. 2.

        5                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you.

        6                      I'll ask that you also provide

        7         electronic copies after?

        8                      MR. HARRISON:  Miss Santos will do so.

        9                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you,

       10         Miss Santos.

       11         BY MR. HARRISON:

       12                Q     Now, as you say in Paragraph 10 of your

       13         witness statement, the Fatima Group created MFC in

       14         September 2012 as a special purpose project company

       15         for the single and sole purpose of developing this

       16         U.S. fertilizer facility in Posey County, Indiana,

       17         correct, sir?

       18         A      That's right.

       19                Q     And that is what MFC, from 2012 through

       20         today, and through its negotiations with KBR and

       21         other vendors, has referred to as "The Project,"

       22         correct?

       23         A      That's correct.

       24                Q     MFC's only project was and still is

       25         this fertilizer plant in Posey County, Indiana?


                                                                     12
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      That's correct.

        3                Q     You say in Paragraph 8 that MFC is

        4         sponsored by various corporate members of the Fatima

        5         Group.

        6                      What does it mean?  Is it money,

        7         resources, support from the Fatima Group to be a

        8         sponsor of MFC?

        9         A      So sponsor group itself is not a legal

       10         entity.  It's a term that the family -- owning

       11         family uses for its interests in various companies

       12         in Pakistan, and in the future, MFC.

       13                The companies that were to invest have

       14         changed over time.  So the companies involved Fazal

       15         Cloth at one time.  It involved Fatima Fertilizer.

       16                So today, the way this works is that the

       17         sponsors themselves are currently funding the entire

       18         project development work, not any of the -- of the

       19         companies, because there are regulations back in

       20         Pakistan that require general body approvals for

       21         which we are not prepared right now.

       22                Q     The sponsors within the Fatima Group

       23         who are providing the funds and money --

       24         A      Yes.

       25                Q     -- and support --


                                                                     13
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yes.

        3                Q     -- for MFC, are these companies of some

        4         substantial means, hundreds of millions of dollars,

        5         billions?  What?

        6         A      These are -- at the moment, these are

        7         individuals.

        8                Q     Do these individuals have tens of

        9         millions of dollars --

       10         A      Yes, they do.

       11                Q     -- available?

       12         A      I mean, their assets are sizeable over the

       13         years.  They own several companies, including

       14         textile, sugar, energy.  They're into mining, so

       15         they get dividends, plus the fertilizer companies

       16         that I mentioned provide them substantial dividends.

       17         And they have the wherewithal to fund the

       18         development work.

       19                Q     Thank you, sir.

       20                      And you understand and these sponsors

       21         understand that funding the development work at MFC

       22         is a multi ten, perhaps even over a

       23         hundred-million-dollar enterprise before financial

       24         close, correct?

       25         A      That's correct.


                                                                     14
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     In Paragraphs 13 to 15 of your witness

        3         statement, you have a section that you've titled,

        4         "MFC's efforts to coax KBR to be the project's EPC

        5         contractor."

        6                      And you begin this section by saying,

        7         "Based on my conversation with the group's

        8         personnel, and with MFC's technical and commercial

        9         teams."

       10                      Did you have those conversations to

       11         assist you in preparing the witness statement?

       12         A      So I think this needs a little bit of

       13         explanation to the structure of the project.

       14                Q     Well, if we could, just on this

       15         discreet question, did you have conversations --

       16         A      No.

       17                Q     -- with the group's person?

       18         A      I did not.

       19                Q     You did not?

       20         A      No.

       21                Q     All right.  Did you speak with Syed

       22         Ahsen Uddin in connection with preparing your

       23         witness statement?

       24         A      So there was discussion because there was a

       25         whole discovery process ongoing, and so on.  Yes,


                                                                     15
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         there was discussion.

        3                Q     Did you speak with Arif Dar, who no

        4         longer is at the company but who was deeply involved

        5         in the negotiations and the events at issue in this

        6         case?

        7         A      So before he left, many times, we are part of

        8         the same team, and I was involved in everything.

        9                After he left, twice.

       10                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Just make sure that

       11         we finish a question before we answer and vice

       12         versa, because it gets a little bit hard for the

       13         Court Reporter and what gets recorded afterwards to

       14         read it.

       15                      THE WITNESS:  Sorry.

       16         BY MR. HARRISON:

       17                Q     Not at all, sir.

       18                      Your two discussions that you had with

       19         Arif Dar --

       20         A      Yes.

       21                Q     -- that you recall having after he left

       22         the company's employment --

       23         A      Right, right.

       24                Q     -- which was in late 2018, was it?

       25         A      No, it was in February 2018.


                                                                     16
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     All right.  Did you all discuss some of

        3         the events and issues that have come up in this

        4         arbitration dispute?

        5         A      Only briefly over lunch, because I do meet

        6         him.  He's still a friend and a colleague.

        7                Q     And is there some other current or

        8         former employee or manager or executive at the

        9         Fatima Group or MFC with whom you have spoken to

       10         refresh your recollection about what you could

       11         include in your testimony?

       12         A      I've spoken to my chairman, who also had

       13         separate meetings.  I've spoken to Ahsen's team

       14         members, who were in and out of the discussions and

       15         were very knowledgeable.  I've spoken to all of

       16         them.

       17                Q     Can you identify those people?

       18         A      I've spoken to Salman Binaslam, who was --

       19         I've spoken to the lawyers, Khalid Ibrahim --

       20         Khalid, K-H-A-L-I-D, Ibrahim, I-B-R-A-H-I-M -- and

       21         Shazil Ibrahim, S-H-A-Z-I-L, and Ibrahim,

       22         I-B-R-A-H-I-M.

       23                Q     All right, sir, so I think that's about

       24         six people, including the CEO, Fawad Mukhtar --

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                     17
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     -- that you've just identified.

        3         A      Right.

        4                (Mr. Fahd Mukhtar enters the proceedings at

        5                this time.)

        6                Q     And I asked in part because --

        7                      MR. HARRISON:  Pardon me for a moment.

        8                      Fahd Mukhtar, good morning, sir.

        9                      MR. MUKHTAR:  Good morning.

       10                Q     I guess I should ask, 'cause he just

       11         walked in.

       12                      Have you spoken with Fahd, the son,

       13         Mukhtar, the director of the Fatima Group in

       14         connection with any of the testimony or subjects in

       15         this case?

       16         A      We've discussed it, but I -- I didn't need to

       17         get further information from him.

       18                Q     All right, sir.  Because if you look,

       19         for example, at page 4 of your witness statement, we

       20         can see that there are quite a number of times, but

       21         to your credit, you're not trying to obscure it.

       22         You're up front.

       23                      But time after time throughout your

       24         witness statement, just looking at this page as an

       25         example, you base your testimony on discussions with


                                                                     18
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         other people.  Sometimes you identify them, like

        3         Mr. Uddin or Mr. Dar, and sometimes, as you did

        4         here, you're consistent, you refer to technical and

        5         commercial teams.

        6                      But you were aware of that when you

        7         prepared your testimony, that much of what you've

        8         come to tell us is, indeed, based on your

        9         discussions with these others?

       10         A      I am.  Yes.

       11                Q     All right.  And you, of course, are

       12         aware of what hearsay is, which is -- there are a

       13         lot of definitions, but colloquially, you hear what

       14         someone else says to you outside of this proceeding,

       15         and then come and tell us what you heard someone say

       16         as part of your testimony, that's kind of what

       17         hearsay is.

       18                      You understand that concept?

       19         A      I am part of the strategy team of the MFC

       20         project, and I'm in all the meetings, including

       21         technical meetings, three times a week.

       22                So while the material that I've discussed

       23         here includes discussions with these people, and the

       24         joint exhibits would refer to them, but I would like

       25         to just clarify, put on the table, that I and the


                                                                     19
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         chief executive and his advisor, Abad Khan, and

        3         where technical matters are concerned, S. Uddin and

        4         Arif Dar were -- actually, not -- are part of the

        5         strategy team that meets three times a week, and Les

        6         is included in the -- in one of those three

        7         meetings.

        8                Q     Thank you.

        9                      But the question was:  Are you familiar

       10         with the concept of hearsay, as I have identified

       11         it?

       12         A      I have never been in a legal witness

       13         situation before, but "hearsay" is a word that I'm

       14         familiar with.

       15                Q     All right, sir.  How many in-person

       16         meetings did you have during the course of

       17         negotiations and dealings with KBR?

       18         A      I was -- I don't recall being in any of the

       19         meetings directly.

       20                I did meet Farhan Mujib, who is Mr. Haresh

       21         Divanji's boss, when he was in the hall.  And I have

       22         been part of the senior-level meetings, but that's

       23         about it.

       24                Q     Okay.  Your meeting with Mr. Farhan

       25         Mujib of KBR is what you've described.  It wasn't a


                                                                     20
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         meeting.  It was you met, sort of said, Hello,

        3         correct, sir?

        4         A      No.  He was in our office.

        5                Q     I know he was in your office.

        6         A      He was in the office.  He had a lunch meeting

        7         with us.

        8                Q     Okay.

        9         A      I was there with him.

       10                Q     All right.  Did you have -- maybe you

       11         did have one.

       12                      How many in-person meetings did you

       13         have with KBR during the course of negotiations

       14         about this project?

       15         A      Other than that, I don't recall another

       16         meeting.

       17                Q     All right.  And at this one lunch

       18         meeting --

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     -- did you all negotiate any terms of

       21         any agreements?

       22         A      We negotiated and considered how we could

       23         move forward with the project together.  That's

       24         about it.

       25                Q     When was that lunch?


                                                                     21
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      It wasn't -- I wasn't prepared to give you a

        3         date of that.  I don't recall.

        4                Q     Well, can you put it in some sequence

        5         of events for us?  For example, was it before or

        6         after early January 2016 when MFC and TKIS signed

        7         their EPC agreement?

        8         A      It was, I think, during 2016.

        9                Q     All right.  So on January 16th of 2016,

       10         MFC and TKIS signed their 100-page EPC agreement

       11         plus exhibits.

       12                      You're aware of that?

       13         A      I am, I am.

       14                Q     You're at lunch with Mr. Farhan Mujib

       15         of KBR was after that, correct?

       16         A      Yes, yes.

       17                Q     And, in fact, it was after KBR had sent

       18         a letter noting that MFC by signing the EPC contract

       19         with TKIS had terminated for convenience under

       20         Section 11.4 and sent an invoice for $2.85 million,

       21         correct?

       22         A      Correct.

       23                Q     And, indeed, the subject of your lunch

       24         was to discuss a possible resolution of that dispute

       25         over the $2.85 million?


                                                                     22
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      No, no, not specifically that dispute.

        3                Q     Did that come up?

        4         A      Briefly.

        5                Q     All right, sir.  Now, do you believe,

        6         based on, I understand, no in-person contact with

        7         KBR but from what you were being told in your

        8         management meetings internally, that KBR was or was

        9         not interested in being the full project EPC

       10         contractor for the Indiana project?

       11         A      So KBR was initially reluctant and unwilling

       12         and unable to support the project in its entirety.

       13         And the project's one single important guideline is

       14         that there has to be a single source LSTK wrap, and

       15         that's an essential requirement to be able to market

       16         the bonds.  That's the way municipal bonds of this

       17         nature are marketed.

       18                And KBR was not willing to do that.  It was

       19         well after the TKIS sighting and sworn that KBR

       20         showed interest in the property.

       21                Q     Well, in fact, that's not quite right.

       22         Because MFC and KBR in 2015 -- August, to be

       23         precise -- signed a $5 million technical services

       24         agreement --

       25         A      Which I -- which I signed.


                                                                     23
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     Well, you've stolen my thunder.

        3         A      Yes.  Yes, I did.

        4                Q     That you signed --

        5         A      Yes.

        6                Q     -- the purpose of which was for KBR to

        7         do the work necessary --

        8         A      Yes, so I -- I -- I correct myself.

        9                Q     All right.  Now, in Paragraph 17 of

       10         your witness statement, you say that KBR's

       11         obligations to perform, as well as MFC's obligations

       12         to pay, were not triggered until the project

       13         achieved financial close, at which time funding

       14         becomes available to MFC to finance the full

       15         project, end quote.

       16                      Do you see that?

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     Now, you do not mention in Paragraph 17

       19         termination or the termination clauses or

       20         termination fees by any name, you were talking about

       21         performance, obligation to perform under the license

       22         agreement, and obligation to pay the license

       23         agreement fee of 9.5 million, correct, sir?

       24         A      Yeah.

       25                Q     All right.  Now, in Paragraph 18, you


                                                                     24
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         say that under this 2013 license agreement with

        3         KBR -- we're still talking about that --

        4         A      Yes.

        5                Q     -- that if KBR contracted with a

        6         third-party vendor that KBR did not approve to use

        7         KBR's technology, then, of course, MFC could not and

        8         would not use KBR's technology, right?

        9         A      That's right.

       10                Q     You all knew, of course, when you

       11         signed the January 2016 EPC contract with TKIS, that

       12         TKIS was a direct competitor in ammonia with KBR,

       13         true?

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     That TKIS and its subsidiary Uhde,

       16         U-H-D-E, had its own ammonia technology, true?

       17         A      That's true.

       18                Q     And that by signing with TKIS, you all

       19         intended to use TKIS/Uhde's ammonia technology, not

       20         KBR's, true?

       21         A      If the conditions in the EPC contract were

       22         met, yes.

       23                Q     Well, of course.

       24                      Your intention, KBR's technology would

       25         not be used under a TKIS EPC contract, like what


                                                                     25
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         your company signed in January 2016?

        3         A      If we went with TKIS, yes.

        4                Q     And your intention, announced to the

        5         world in a press release with a happy picture

        6         featuring you, and others, was to use TKIS, right?

        7         A      So I would have been happier if it was KBR.

        8         I'll be honest with you --

        9                Q     Well --

       10         A      -- that was our intention.  We had some

       11         issues to deal with being an international company

       12         in the U.S.  Our primary intention was to go with

       13         KBR, and we made every possible effort that you can

       14         imagine.

       15                Q     Even though we are in this arbitration

       16         dispute --

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     -- you still acknowledge and respect --

       19         and I respect you for it -- that KBR is a reputable

       20         company with an excellent track record, and

       21         customers, like your own --

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     -- group, want to use them and do use

       24         KBR for projects like this?

       25         A      Absolutely.  I have no -- I do not deny that.


                                                                     26
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     But you all did not reach an agreement

        3         with KBR.

        4                      You did reach a comprehensive EPC

        5         agreement in mid January 2016 with TKIS, correct?

        6         A      We reached an agreement with TKIS, which --

        7         which had a price continual for the -- where is the

        8         other price.

        9                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, they had

       10         a --

       11                      THE WITNESS:  Had a continual for the

       12         price validity, and also had several CPs, conditions

       13         present, to achieve, which did not happen,

       14         unfortunately.

       15                Q     If you would please look at

       16         Paragraph 19 of your statement.

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     You note, I will quote:

       19                      "Ahsen and Arif have also told me that

       20         the termination clauses in the license agreement are

       21         typically included, however, Sections 11.3 and 11.5

       22         were intended to address what happens if the project

       23         is never funded and notice to proceed is never

       24         issued and the project winds up being canceled."

       25                      Correct, sir?


                                                                     27
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Right.

        3                Q     What project are you talking about?

        4         A      So, sir, the projects are defined in 11.3 and

        5         11.5.

        6                11.3 defines that as the project for which

        7         the license agreement was being entered, and at that

        8         time there was no -- there was no bigger project

        9         discussion.  So this was the project.  11.3 was the

       10         project we entered into with KBR, which was

       11         primarily the only.

       12                The 11.5 was the total project.  That is why

       13         they're two distinct definitions.

       14                Q     When was 11.5, this notion of the total

       15         project, introduced into the negotiations?

       16         A      Right at the end.

       17                Q     In fact, on November 4 --

       18         A      Yes.

       19                Q     -- 2013?

       20         A      Absolutely.

       21                Q     All right.  So your testimony is that

       22         all throughout this months-long negotiation, the

       23         reference to the project being canceled did not

       24         actually refer to the Indiana Posey County project,

       25         it referred to the license agreement?


                                                                     28
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      That -- that project 11.5 talked about the

        3         larger project, and we were talking about the

        4         project we were discussing with -- with KBR --

        5                Q     Well, the project --

        6         A      -- 'til that time.

        7                Q     Sure.

        8                      The project you were discussing with

        9         KBR --

       10         A      Yes.

       11                Q     -- was the Indiana Posey County

       12         project, right?

       13         A      The portion that -- you see, until KBR or

       14         TKIS took on the entire project, there could have

       15         been multiple solutions.  There could have been a

       16         urea solution, a nitric acid solution, a UN, there

       17         could have been multiple solutions.

       18                This is the way projects develop.  This is

       19         the way they work.  You can get multiple

       20         contractors -- and this is the way the Orascon

       21         project worked out -- you get multiple parties, and

       22         then have one party do the wrap, which is an

       23         essential requirement for the bonds to take the LSTK

       24         wrap.

       25                So at that time, because of KBR's reluctance


                                                                     29
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         to do the full project, we had to find multiple

        3         solutions.  It could have been one of the other, you

        4         know, TCI, Toyo, Kawasaki, one of the others

        5         partnering jointly with -- with KBR.

        6                Q     Respectfully, what question were you

        7         answering?

        8         A      Sir, I think you asked me to -- to tell you

        9         what was the definition of the project during the

       10         time of the negotiations.

       11                And I'm explaining to you about projects are

       12         developed due to get you some perspective on what

       13         pieces of the project there were.

       14                Q     During the months of negotiations

       15         between MFC and KBR that led to the signing of the

       16         November 2013 license agreement --

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     -- negotiations in which you were not

       19         involved --

       20         A      No.

       21                Q     -- are you telling us that the Indiana

       22         Posey County fertilizer project was not the project

       23         being discussed?

       24         A      I'm not saying that.  I'm saying they were --

       25         there was a part of that project that was being


                                                                     30
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         discussed, in my opinion.

        3                Q     When did you form this opinion on these

        4         negotiations that you didn't participate in?

        5         A      I mean, I just queried the use of the two

        6         terms, and it's obvious to me.

        7                Q     When was that, sir?

        8         A      I mean, since I read them.  I mean, it's

        9         been --

       10                Q     When was that, sir?

       11         A      -- it was my question to Arif when we met.

       12         That was my fundamental reason for meeting him.

       13                Q     When was that, sir?

       14         A      Sometime last year -- sometime earlier this

       15         year.

       16                Q     In 2019?

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     I see.  Was that after you had had

       19         discussions with your lawyers in this dispute?

       20         A      No, certainly not.  Lawyers discussions have

       21         been recent.

       22                Q     Was that after you had had discussions

       23         with your former lawyers from the Pillsbury firm

       24         about this dispute?

       25         A      No, not with Pillsbury.  This was -- this was


                                                                     31
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         with Arif, and that's about it.

        3                Q     Well, I'm sorry, but when did you first

        4         talk with your lawyers in this arbitration dispute

        5         about this dispute that was filed years ago?

        6         A      We discussed this all the time.  I'm talking

        7         about that particular clause.  I think that's your

        8         question.

        9                That particular term, I discussed with --

       10         with this set of lawyers, with Pillsbury, with the

       11         Ibrahim law firm.  I've discussed everything with

       12         them.

       13                Q     Yes, including this notion of what

       14         "project" means in the termination provisions --

       15         A      I think there is --

       16                Q     -- is that -- sir, please let me finish

       17         the question.

       18                      The truth is that since 2016, you have

       19         discussed on multiple occasions with your in-house

       20         lawyers, with lawyers at Pillsbury, and with lawyers

       21         at your current litigation firm in this dispute, the

       22         meaning of "project" and the termination provisions

       23         of the license agreement, true?

       24         A      I -- I have discussed this, yes.

       25                Q     And the first time that you apparently


                                                                     32
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         yourself formed any opinion about it, you say, was

        3         earlier this year in 2019, if I heard you right,

        4         true?

        5         A      That's true.

        6                Q     Now, let me hand you, if I could -- I

        7         tried to make it easy on you.  This is a notebook

        8         that contains more exhibits than we'll discuss, but

        9         I think you should have all the exhibits we'll

       10         discuss.

       11         A      Okay.

       12                Q     And if you'll turn to the tab that says

       13         JX-16, which happens to be the final signed ammonia

       14         license agreement of November 2013, between MFC and

       15         KBR, would you kindly just confirm for us that it

       16         is, indeed, signed and that you recognize the

       17         signature of your co-executive Syed Ahsen Uddin

       18         alongside that of KBR's Aman Ahmad.

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     And the view that you came to form in

       21         2019 was that Section 11.3's use of the term

       22         "project" referred to something much more discreet

       23         than the whole project.  It referred to this license

       24         agreement project with KBR.

       25                      Is that correct?


                                                                     33
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      That's -- that's my view, because there are

        3         two different terms used.  It makes a lot of sense.

        4                Q     Sure.

        5                      So let's take a look, if we could, at

        6         page 19 where you'll find Sections 11.3, .4, and .5.

        7                      And you can see that in 11.3, the

        8         second sentence, In the event that owners financial

        9         close does not occur prior to April 30, 2014,

       10         despite its best efforts, and that this project is

       11         therefore canceled, owner may terminate this

       12         agreement without penalty or fee, period, end quote.

       13                      Do you see that?

       14         A      That's right.

       15                Q     All right.  Now, focus with me on "and

       16         that this project is therefore canceled."  I'll put

       17         it up on the screen, but you've got a hard copy you

       18         can look at, too.  Look wherever you'd like, all

       19         right, sir?

       20                      So you can see in 11.3, "and this

       21         project is therefore canceled," and then the very

       22         next phrase, "owner may terminate this agreement."

       23                      Do you see that?

       24         A      Yes.

       25                Q     The same sentence and phrases one after


                                                                     34
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         the other refer to "this project," and then "this

        3         agreement."

        4                      Do you see that?

        5         A      I see it.

        6                Q     All right.  And maybe you know this

        7         from having reviewed this agreement so recently, but

        8         there are over 36 times where this license agreement

        9         refers to itself as the "license agreement" or the

       10         "agreement."

       11                      Did you know that?

       12         A      Yes.  I didn't count, no.

       13                Q     It's a lot.

       14                      So you want us to believe that "and

       15         this project" refers to this project with the KBR

       16         license agreement?

       17                      That's what you just told me.

       18         A      Yes.  I'm going to the definitions to what

       19         the license agreement was about in 1.6, and other

       20         clauses, that tell you what the license agreement

       21         was about.

       22                Q     You can point me to anything you want.

       23         Go ahead.

       24         A      So there are -- this license agreement

       25         specifies exactly what it's about, and it's about


                                                                     35
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         the ammonia synthesis, compression, refrigeration,

        3         and all that.

        4                Q     I'm going to put it on the screen.

        5                      Where are you?

        6         A      1.6.

        7                I'm just giving you one example of what we --

        8         we understand was covered in this project.

        9                Q     Sure.

       10                      Now that -- that doesn't say "project"

       11         or "project with KBR," that's just the term "KBR

       12         purifier process," right?

       13         A      Right.  I'm just defining what we -- what we

       14         were considering as the scope of KBR's engagement

       15         with us, and --

       16                Q     But point me to something else, too, if

       17         you'd like.

       18         A      Sorry?

       19                Q     Anything else you want to point us to

       20         in the contract?

       21         A      No.  I'm just giving you one example.  Ask

       22         me.  That's enough.

       23                Q     All right.

       24         A      I would -- going back to that slide, it's a

       25         rational question for somebody who wasn't actually


                                                                     36
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         there to ask why is -- why is there a North America

        3         project in 11.5 and why is there The Project in

        4         11.3.  That was my question to my team.

        5                Q     Who is the best -- well, don't give us

        6         more hearsay.

        7                      Let me ask you this:  Who is the best

        8         person to testify from your team about what the

        9         negotiators --

       10         A      Right.

       11                Q     -- meant with 11.3 and 11.5, in terms

       12         of project and anything else about the application's

       13         provisions?

       14                      Who is the best person from the

       15         MFC/Fatima Group side to ask?

       16         A      So I asked the lawyer who was there, and I

       17         asked Arif Dar, who was there.  Those two people

       18         specifically.

       19                Q     Did you ask the person who signed this

       20         and who was the lead negotiator, Mr. --

       21         A      S. Uddin.

       22                Q     Did you ask Uddin?

       23         A      S. Uddin had authority to sign, but I was

       24         more comfortable asking Arif Dar, and I was more

       25         comfortable asking Khalid Ibrahim and Shazil.


                                                                     37
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     But you're --

        3         A      That's my view of where I would get the best

        4         answers.

        5                Q     Your comfort to one side --

        6         A      Yes.

        7                Q     -- did you know that Mr. Uddin was the

        8         lead negotiator opposite Mr. Aman Ahmad of KBR in

        9         negotiating the entire agreement, and in particular,

       10         these termination provisions, did you know that?

       11         A      I think this was joint leadership.

       12                Q     Was he a part of the joint leadership?

       13         A      Yes, he was.  It was joint leadership with

       14         Arif.

       15                This is a legal document, and Ahsen is a

       16         technical person.  He does not have the ability

       17         to -- to negotiate final points like these in an

       18         agreement.  He is not -- he is an EPC.  He is a

       19         technology person.

       20                He did have the authority to sign from us,

       21         after we had gone through it, after the leadership

       22         had agreed to the terms of this agreement, but he --

       23         in my opinion, there was joint leadership of the

       24         arbitration.

       25                Q     Very well.  And as one of your joint


                                                                     38
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         leaders, the EPC technology person --

        3         A      Yes.

        4                Q     -- Mr. Uddin --

        5         A      Yes.

        6                Q     -- understand what a project is?

        7         A      Yes, I should think so.  I haven't discussed

        8         it, but I think so.

        9                Q     And is it just your lack of comfort

       10         that led you not to talk to Mr. Uddin about this

       11         question of what "project" --

       12         A      Sir, I --

       13                Q     -- means in the termination provisions?

       14         A      Sir, I went to the people I would get the

       15         right answer from.

       16                Q     Okay.  That sounds all right.

       17                      Why is it, by the way, that MFC did not

       18         provide any testimony from leadership team member

       19         and contract signer Mr. Uddin about anything in this

       20         case, and in particular, about the meaning of the

       21         termination provisions?

       22         A      All right.  So from the -- from the outset

       23         this has been a legal and commercial question.  This

       24         arbitration is about the terms of this contract, not

       25         about technical matters.


                                                                     39
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                He is a technical expert.  We had a number of

        3         witnesses to decide on.  I was part of the strategy

        4         team, the senior leadership team, and that's why I'm

        5         here.  And he is a technical person.  And,

        6         therefore, this being a legal and commercial

        7         question didn't require, in our opinion, in the four

        8         people that we thought were ideally fit for this.

        9                Q     It would be useful to know the facts so

       10         that the person making decisions can assess the

       11         facts, apply the law, and reach a decision.

       12                      You agree with that, don't you?

       13         A      Sir, but the -- the understanding is there,

       14         is on that document.

       15                Q     All right.  Once again --

       16         A      Yes.

       17                Q     -- do you agree that presenting the

       18         facts, whether they come from a lawyer, a commercial

       19         person, or the person most involved in the

       20         underlying events, is a valid presentation and

       21         inquiry to make in a dispute?

       22         A      Sir, I think the best people to discuss this

       23         are the people who knew this contract, and his

       24         presence could have been the fifth or sixth witness,

       25         but we decided to go with four.


                                                                     40
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     His presence could have been the first,

        3         but in whatever order he's presented or not

        4         presented in, the question is:  Do you, sir, agree

        5         that presenting the facts, whether they are

        6         wordsmith by lawyers or commercial people, the

        7         facts, from whoever knows them, whatever their title

        8         is, the facts are important in a dispute?

        9                      Do you agree with that concept?

       10         A      The facts are important in a dispute.

       11                Q     Now, you say you were comfortable

       12         talking with Arif Dar, a former co-executive of

       13         yours --

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     -- who is no longer with the company.

       16         A      Yes.

       17                Q     Did he leave under bad terms?

       18         A      No, he did not.

       19                Q     Why didn't MFC provide any testimony

       20         from Arif Dar, another member of the negotiating

       21         team that led to this license agreement?

       22         A      He needed his chairman's approval.

       23                He's the chief executive officer of a cement

       24         company.  They're expanding that cement company

       25         quite dramatically.  He needed very senior-level


                                                                     41
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         board approvals to do this, and we were -- number

        3         one, he didn't seem comfortable; number two, we were

        4         not comfortable either going to his boss and asking

        5         for this -- his participation.

        6                Q     Did MFC ask Arif Dar to be a witness in

        7         the dispute, and he declined?

        8         A      Not formally.

        9                Q     I'm sorry?

       10         A      Not formally.

       11                Q     Well, Did MFC informally -- I'm not

       12         sure what that means, but I'll ask you if the answer

       13         is yes -- ask Arif Dar to be a witness in this

       14         dispute?

       15         A      As a colleague and friend, I --

       16                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, as a

       17         colleague?

       18                      THE WITNESS:  As a colleague and

       19         friend, I tested the waters.

       20         BY MR. HARRISON:

       21                Q     Okay.  Now, I will ask:  What exactly

       22         did you -- what question did you put to Mr. Dar?

       23         A      Will your company be willing to do this?

       24                Q     And he said?

       25         A      So he laughed.


                                                                     42
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     And then he said?

        3         A      Then we closed the subject.  We didn't go

        4         back.

        5                He -- I gave him the view.  If he wanted, if

        6         he was even slightly willing, he would have

        7         responded positively, which he did not.

        8                Q     He laughed?

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     Was it a -- I mean, what kind of laugh

       11         are we talking about?

       12         A      Yeah, why should I?

       13                Q     So he actually did say words?

       14         A      No, that was -- that was what he indicated.

       15                Q     Oh, it was a laugh as if to say why

       16         should I?

       17         A      Why should I?

       18                Q     What does that sound like?

       19         A      Sounds like he's got -- he's --

       20                Q     No, he said, Ha, ha, ha, or --

       21         A      Well, I mean --

       22                Q     Like that.  All right.

       23                      And you say there was also a lawyer who

       24         was involved on the MFC side --

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                     43
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     -- the third member of the lead

        3         negotiating team.

        4         A      Outside counsel.

        5                Q     And his name was?

        6         A      Khalid Ibrahim, and Shazil Ibrahim works with

        7         him.

        8                Q     Two lawyers.

        9                      Are they related?

       10         A      No, they are not, just last names.

       11                Q     Fine.

       12                      Did MFC ask either of those two lawyers

       13         who rounded out the negotiating team for the license

       14         agreement to provide any testimony in this dispute?

       15         A      No.

       16                Q     Whose decision was it, yours, someone

       17         else's, not to provide testimony from Mr. Uddin,

       18         Mr. Dar, or either of the two lawyers who were on

       19         the negotiating team for MFC?

       20         A      Sir, in the very initial stages of this

       21         arbitration, we had said this was going to be a

       22         legal and commercial question, and in our opinion,

       23         that is where this arbitration should focus --

       24                Q     All right, sir.

       25         A      -- in our opinion.


                                                                     44
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     But my question:  Who?

        3         A      So he was -- he -- what was a technical

        4         person.  He can give you -- he can give you some of

        5         the discussions that may have gone on before that,

        6         but that's -- that's all we're talking about.  We're

        7         talking about the agreement here in front of.

        8                Q     Yes, sir.

        9                      Please, sir --

       10         A      Yes.

       11                Q     -- who at MFC made the decision not to

       12         provide testimony from any of the four members of

       13         MFC's negotiating team opposite KBR?

       14                      What person at MFC or what lawyer at

       15         MFC made that decision?

       16         A      I would say it was a decision made by me and

       17         by -- in consultation with our chairman.

       18                Q     That's a very high-level decision

       19         within the company?

       20         A      That's right.  That's right.

       21                Q     Okay.  It wasn't an oversight, it was

       22         an intentional decision, correct?

       23         A      It was -- it was an intentional decision, put

       24         it that way.

       25                Q     All right.  Now, let me ask you, in


                                                                     45
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         your discussion in your witness statement in

        3         paragraphs 17 all the way through 21, you repeatedly

        4         talk about what Arif Dar and Ahsen Uddin told you.

        5                      In Paragraph 21 you talk about

        6         subsequent conversation with Ahsen, that's Uddin,

        7         and Arif, that's Dar, "I learnt," and then you say,

        8         what you learnt, and then you say, "They also told

        9         me that."

       10                      Do you see these references?

       11         A      Yes.

       12                Q     Why did you not include in your

       13         multi-paragraph discussion about the negotiations

       14         that led to the November 2013 agreement with KBR at

       15         issue in this case that Misters Uddin and Dar knew

       16         and intended that Section 11.4's termination clause

       17         to compensate KBR, if MFC exercised willful

       18         termination and pursued the project before, not

       19         after, before notice to proceed and financial close

       20         would apply?

       21                      Why did you omit that?

       22         A      I don't understand.  I -- the question

       23         really.  I said what I -- what I thought was needed

       24         for this witness statement, and that -- that

       25         question seemed -- I'm not sure why you want -- what


                                                                     46
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         exact answer do you want me to give you?

        3                Q     Typically, we believe the truth is

        4         okay.  But let's look at -- just look at JX-6.

        5         A      If you rephrase, I'll maybe give you a better

        6         answer.

        7                Q     Well, let's take a look at Exhibit 6,

        8         and like so many other documents in this case,

        9         Mr. Uddin and Mr. Dar, and to his credit, Mr. Fahd

       10         Mukhtar, who is here with us today, are on this

       11         document about a KBR meeting update.

       12                      Now, this is June 20, 2013.  This is,

       13         as you can see, a few months before.  This is part

       14         of the negotiation --

       15         A      Yes.

       16                Q     -- that led to the license agreement.

       17                      And you have the whole document.  I'm

       18         going to put this on the screen here.  You can see

       19         under "Issues," the second issue identified

       20         internally is:

       21                      "A new clause of termination has been

       22         introduced by KBR where they demand 50 percent of

       23         license fee if willful termination is exercised by

       24         MFC before notice to proceed/financial close."

       25                      Do you see that?


                                                                     47
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yup.

        3                Q     Now, let me just stop there.  Because

        4         when you spoke with Mr. Dar or with the lawyers, did

        5         you ask them what the term "willful termination"

        6         means?

        7         A      No.

        8                Q     I'm sorry?

        9         A      No, I did not.

       10                Q     Do you know what it means?

       11         A      Yes.

       12                Q     You do.

       13                      How did you come to this information?

       14         A      With -- the term "willful termination"?

       15                Q     Yeah.

       16         A      Something that is deliberately done.

       17                Q     Fine.

       18         A      I mean, I'm just --

       19                Q     You're just -- that's just --

       20         A      Lived and worked in an English environment,

       21         so...

       22                Q     Okay.  You're defining what you think

       23         "willful" means.

       24         A      Yes.

       25                Q     Have you heard this term, though, doing


                                                                     48
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         "willful termination" before?

        3         A      With reference to this project or -- or just

        4         generally?

        5                Q     Have you heard the term "willful

        6         termination" with reference to this project?

        7         A      Willful -- willful -- this willful act, yes.

        8                Q     An intentional act?

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     All right.  A deliberate act?

       11         A      Yes.

       12                Q     Okay.  Now, they say, "Notice to

       13         proceed/financial close."

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     And I believe in your witness

       16         statement, by the way --

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     -- you acknowledge that for all

       19         practical purposes, this project, notice to proceed

       20         and financial close are same-day events?

       21         A      Could be the same-day events, yes.

       22                Q     That was the expectation?

       23         A      But generally, one precedes the other.  They

       24         should not be able to proceed without the financial

       25         close.


                                                                     49
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     Right.  And in your witness statement

        3         you note here that was anticipated as a same-day

        4         occurrence, remember that?

        5         A      Could be a same-day occurrence, yes.

        6                Q     Okay.  So did anyone come to you either

        7         in June 2013, or before November 5, 2013 --

        8         A      Yes.

        9                Q     -- and tell you, KBR has asked to add

       10         this new termination clause --

       11         A      Yeah.

       12                Q     -- which became 11.4, you understand?

       13         A      Yes.

       14                Q     Did they come to you?

       15         A      They came to the team.  It was discussed in

       16         our meetings.

       17                Q     And did you approve inclusion of 11.4?

       18         A      With -- with the subsequent amendments, 11.3,

       19         which came subsequently, it's -- the wording of 11.3

       20         was fine tuned afterwards.

       21                Q     Well, the wording of 11.3 was fine

       22         tuned in the next two days --

       23         A      Yes.

       24                Q     -- here in June of 2013 --

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                     50
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     -- you understand?

        3         A      So them together were approved.

        4                Q     Well, just a minute, as we've already

        5         discussed --

        6         A      Yes.

        7                Q     -- let's just focus on this piece,

        8         because I really want to understand it --

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     -- did you as a member of this group

       11         approve including 11.4's termination provision and

       12         fee in the license agreement or did you oppose it

       13         but it was done anyway?

       14         A      It was a very uncomfortable debate.  We --

       15         when we originally received the draft from KBR,

       16         there was no -- there were no such provisions in it.

       17         There was 11.1, 2, and 3.  There was no termination

       18         or penalty provisions.

       19                The fact that they arose and they got

       20         developed and got inserted was uncomfortable for us.

       21         We were unhappy.  I was unhappy with that provision,

       22         as was Arif, I believe.

       23                So --

       24                Q     So you were unhappy?

       25         A      -- I would say I personally approved it, but


                                                                     51
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         we -- we, our project developers, we wanted this

        3         project, and there were decisions that were taken in

        4         the interest of closing out this agreement.

        5                Q     You reluctantly approved including 11.4

        6         in the contract?

        7         A      It -- yeah.

        8                Q     And why were you reluctant?  What was

        9         the problem with 11.4?

       10         A      It wasn't there in the beginning.  It just

       11         creeped in.  I mean, I -- I don't think it was a --

       12         I don't think it's a standard provision in licensing

       13         agreements.

       14                Q     Well, I'm sorry, but I just -- it

       15         didn't creep in.  I mean, KBR asked for it.  It was

       16         negotiated.  There was e-mail exchanged about it.

       17         Internal discussion had about it.  This didn't creep

       18         in, did it?

       19         A      Well, okay, so I -- I'll give you my

       20         perspective.  I wasn't quite comfortable with this

       21         provision.

       22                Q     And once again, why were you unhappy?

       23         Why were you reluctant?  Why were you uncomfortable

       24         about including Section 11.4's termination provision

       25         and fee in the contract?


                                                                     52
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Because it's not a standard clause, and --

        3         number one.  Number two, what is it for?  What is

        4         the intent of that clause?

        5                Q     Well, what did you think?

        6         A      I thought it was a penalty.

        7                Q     You thought it was a penalty of what?

        8         A      Penalty of not -- if we have to go with

        9         someone else, this is the penalty.

       10                Q     Perfect.

       11                      Now, take a look at Exhibit 9.

       12                      Exhibit 9 is another e-mail, this one

       13         between your colleague Mr. Uddin and KBR's Aman

       14         Ahmad.

       15                      Here, it's the same issue, right?  Now,

       16         it's items on watch.  And one of them:

       17                      "The new clause of termination that has

       18         been introduced where the demand is 50 percent of

       19         license fee (if willful termination is exercised by

       20         MFC before NTP) we are contesting the percentage."

       21                      Okay?

       22                      Now, just so you have it, this is the

       23         very next day.  We went from June 20 to June 21,

       24         2013.

       25                      Had your management team, your team on


                                                                     53
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         which you sit, already met in this less than 24-hour

        3         period, talked about 11.4, and decided, okay, but

        4         we've got to discuss the percentage and reducing it

        5         from 50 percent to something lower?

        6                      Did you all meet in this 24-hour --

        7         A      No, we didn't meet on this particular

        8         question.  This was a telephone conversation.

        9                Q     Did you all have a telephone

       10         conversation?

       11         A      No, I wasn't on that.  Sorry.

       12                Q     This is Exhibit No. 8.

       13                      Here, same day, June 21, 2013 -- and

       14         you can look with me, but I want you to know you

       15         have all these documents there.

       16                      Again, Arif Dar, Mr. Uddin are on this

       17         e-mail about KBR meeting update:

       18                      "On the clause of willful termination

       19         of contracts by MFC before NPT, KBR had demanded 50

       20         percent of license fee yesterday.  Today, we have

       21         negotiated and reduced that value to 30 percent."

       22                      Were you aware of this event, this

       23         negotiation, happening --

       24         A      Yes.

       25                Q     -- within the 24-hour period?


                                                                     54
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yes --

        3                Q     All right.

        4         A      -- I'm aware.

        5                Q     And did that make you happier or more

        6         comfortable with Section 11.4 to have the fee

        7         reduced from 50 to 30 percent?

        8         A      It's better than the 50 percent.

        9                Q     And then Mr. Uddin, one of the members

       10         of the lead negotiating team for MFC, says:

       11                      "We think this is fair value and should

       12         be accepted by us.  I'm sending this e-mail so that

       13         if you have any comments, then please let me know.

       14         Otherwise, we'll proceed with the license agreement

       15         finalization."

       16         A      Yes.

       17                Q     Now, as we know, I'm telling you,

       18         within a day and a half --

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     -- 11.4 goes final and its words never

       21         change.

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     All right.  So did you have an

       24         opportunity to put the kibosh, to put the stop, on

       25         including 11.4 before it became final?


                                                                     55
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      No.

        3                Q     You did not have the opportunity?

        4         A      No.

        5                Q     This was done without your knowledge?

        6         A      I knew it was ongoing.  This was something

        7         that I allowed the chairman and -- and the

        8         negotiating team to decide.

        9                Q     All right.  Do you think that your

       10         colleagues at MFC should have included you more

       11         directly, either on the e-mails, the phone calls,

       12         the meetings, so your MFC colleagues should have

       13         given you more involvement?

       14         A      My -- my comfort with my chairman being

       15         involved and his take of this is such that if he

       16         says this is acceptable, it's acceptable to me as

       17         well.

       18                Q     Your chairman approved, obviously?

       19         A      I would say he did.

       20                Q     Sure.

       21         A      I wouldn't have gone in without his approval.

       22                Q     And, of course, the truth is you did

       23         have an opportunity to put a stop to this --

       24         A      I could have stood in the way.  I did not.

       25                Q     Now, Mr. Uddin writes about this new


                                                                     56
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         11.4 and the new 30 percent fee as opposed to

        3         50 percent.  It says, "We think this is fair value."

        4                      Do you know what "fair value" means?

        5         A      Yes.  He says, "Reduce that value to

        6         30 percent."

        7                Q     Yes.  "We think this is fair value,"

        8         referring to the 30 percent fee?

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     What does "fair value" mean?

       11         A      Sir, that is -- is my objection to this.

       12         There is no value.  It's referring to the 50 and 30.

       13         He -- his English, or whatever, I cannot understand

       14         what value.

       15                There is no value to this license agreement

       16         until notice to proceed.  That's when this agreement

       17         becomes valuable.  They're not doing any work under

       18         this agreement in that entire period.  So there is

       19         no value.

       20                The value is the 50 to the 30.  That is the

       21         value he's talking about.

       22                Q     Did you ask Mr. Uddin, what do you mean

       23         we think this is fair value?

       24         A      I asked him.

       25                Q     You did?


                                                                     57
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yeah.  I asked him during the course of these

        3         discussions --

        4                Q     And --

        5         A      -- What do you mean by fair value?

        6                Q     And --

        7         A      And he just -- he just --

        8                Q     I'm sorry, the question first:  And

        9         you're telling us here today what he told you this

       10         year, last year, years ago, when?

       11         A      This year.

       12                Q     This year?

       13         A      Yes.

       14                Q     After the arbitration was well under

       15         way?

       16         A      Yes, yes.

       17                Q     All right.  Now, you say --

       18         A      I saw this during the discovery process, this

       19         e-mail.

       20                Q     Did you see this during the discovery

       21         process before you submitted your witness statement?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     Why didn't you say anything in your

       24         witness statement about it?

       25         A      Sir, you can't make everything here.  I mean,


                                                                     58
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         you can -- there are many things that I probably

        3         missed out in my witness statement, but all that I

        4         thought was necessary to clarify the situation is in

        5         here.

        6                Q     Why didn't you ask Mr. Uddin to submit

        7         a statement on this point, what he meant by "fair

        8         value"?

        9         A      Because I -- that's not -- that's not

       10         something that is the way I would describe the

       11         clause.

       12                The clause is the 50 decreased to 30.  That's

       13         how I understood.  That was his mandate.

       14                Q     Oh, I'm sorry, so now Mr. Uddin had a

       15         mandate to reduce 50 percent to 30 percent?

       16         A      No, he asked for -- he -- KBR agreed to a

       17         reduction.  His mandate was to agree to the reduced

       18         value and proceed with the contract.

       19                Q     It's a negotiation.

       20         A      That's right.

       21                So that's the value I think he's talking

       22         about, sir.

       23                Q     That's what you think he's talking

       24         about.  All right.

       25                      And is that a useful position for you


                                                                     59
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         to take in this case?

        3         A      That he's talking about the 50 being reduced

        4         to 30 as value?

        5                Q     All right.

        6         A      Yes.

        7                Q     Now, you say, by the way, that KBR

        8         wasn't doing any work under the license agreement

        9         and it wouldn't get paid until notice to proceed --

       10         A      That's right.

       11                Q     -- had been issued.

       12         A      That's right.

       13                Q     Well, of course, once notice to proceed

       14         is issued, then KBR starts doing the work called for

       15         under the license agreement, under the engineering

       16         agreement --

       17         A      PEQ.

       18                Q     -- and under the PEQ agreement,

       19         correct?

       20         A      Right.

       21                Q     Did you know that the cumulative value

       22         of those three agreements, which were tied together,

       23         was some $43 million?

       24         A      Yeah, I did -- I know.  I've seen the

       25         numbers.


                                                                     60
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     Sure.

        3                      Obviously, KBR would much rather

        4         receive the $43 million and proceed with the project

        5         than receive this consolation prize of

        6         $2.85 million, right?

        7         A      That's right.

        8                Q     KBR, like MFC, had every incentive to

        9         see the project move forward, correct?

       10         A      I -- I would hope so.

       11                Q     And not just from an economic and

       12         financial perspective, these companies are in the

       13         business of creating projects, not moving money

       14         around like some of the investment bankers who

       15         surround where we sit right now, but actually

       16         creating facilities and plants and product.

       17                      KBR is in that business, you understand

       18         that?

       19         A      I do.

       20                Q     Like MFC, KBR had economic,

       21         professional, and other reasons to greatly prefer

       22         the project proceeding forward, as opposed to simply

       23         getting $2.85 million termination fee, true?

       24         A      I can speak for myself, sir.  We wanted this

       25         project to go forward.


                                                                     61
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                I will not speak for KBR in this matter,

        3         please.

        4                Q     You think KBR wanted the project to

        5         proceed?

        6         A      I can't say.  Sorry.

        7                Q     All right.  Now, the contract in the

        8         termination provisions, to which you have pointed

        9         us, Section 11.3 in particular, says, "In the event

       10         that owners financial close does not occur prior to

       11         April 30, 2014," right?

       12         A      Right.

       13                Q     Did financial close occur prior to

       14         April 30, 2014?

       15         A      It did not.

       16                Q     And in 11.5, the language is different.

       17         It's says, "In the event that owner's financial

       18         close does not occur by 30 April 2014."

       19                      Do you see that?

       20         A      Yes.

       21                Q     Does the use of "prior to" in 11.3

       22         versus "by" in 11.5, different words --

       23         A      Yes.

       24                Q     -- make any difference or does it mean

       25         the same thing?


                                                                     62
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      I -- I thought meant the same thing.

        3                Q     And does the use of "April 30, 2014" in

        4         11.3 versus "30 April 2014" in 11.5, different

        5         words, different configuration, mean the same thing?

        6         A      It means the same thing.

        7                Q     And then 11.3 has this other word, "If

        8         financial close is not obtained" --

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     -- "prior to April 30, 2014," which we

       11         know it was not --

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     -- "and that this project is therefore

       14         canceled."

       15                      What does "therefore" mean?

       16         A      The financial close hasn't occurred by that

       17         date, and despite our best efforts, the project did

       18         not go forward.

       19                Q     No, sir, different question:  What does

       20         "therefore" mean?  I'm asking about "therefore."

       21                      Do you know what "therefore" means?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     What?

       24         A      Because of the preceding words --

       25                Q     Yes --


                                                                     63
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      -- move forward.

        3                Q     -- that's right, because of.  All

        4         right?

        5                      So April 30, 2014, comes and goes,

        6         financial close is not reached, MFC doesn't cancel

        7         the project, whether you call it "The Project,"

        8         "writ large," or the so-called "project with KBR,"

        9         or "project using KBR's license agreement," MFC

       10         doesn't cancel anything in May 2014, June, July,

       11         August, 2015, over a year and a half goes by without

       12         any cancellation of any kind of any project or any

       13         thing, true?

       14         A      That's true.

       15                Q     It is only on March 28, 2016, when you

       16         sign a letter --

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     -- that MFC in writing terminates the

       19         license agreement and claims it's doing so under

       20         11.3, correct?

       21         A      That's not true.

       22                Q     That's not true?

       23         A      No.  Because I am responding to your

       24         cancellation of the license agreement.  A letter was

       25         written by KBR to us saying that their license


                                                                     64
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         agreement may not be available to us.  That's how I

        3         understood the wording of that letter.

        4                And in return my letter went out saying,

        5         because of that letter, we -- we think that you have

        6         terminated the project, and therefore, we will

        7         cancel the license agreement.

        8                Q     All right.  Let's just take it in baby

        9         steps.

       10         A      Yes.

       11                Q     On March 28, 2016, you do send a letter

       12         in which you say that MFC is terminating the license

       13         agreement.

       14         A      Canceling the license agreement.

       15                Q     Canceling the license agreement.

       16                      And that's what you say this project

       17         means, right?

       18         A      That's right, that's right.

       19                Q     All right.  So even though MFC fails to

       20         reach financial close prior to April 30, 2014 --

       21         A      Yes.

       22                Q     -- MFC does not invoke 11.3, does not

       23         terminate the project, does not cancel the project,

       24         does not terminate or cancel the project using KBR

       25         technology or project with KBR --


                                                                     65
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yes.

        3                Q     -- until all the way until March 27,

        4         2018, when you send your letter.

        5                      Do I have your testimony correct?

        6                      Do I have it correct?

        7         A      No, sir.

        8                Q     I don't?

        9         A      No.

       10                Q     Okay.  Now, let me ask -- wait a

       11         minute, you can answer the question.

       12                      Is there a time that you think before

       13         late March 2016 that MFC canceled or terminated the

       14         project with KBR or the license agreement?

       15         A      No.

       16                We did not cancel.

       17                Q     This is Exhibit 101.

       18                      MR. HARRISON:  Can I have exhibit 101?

       19         Does anyone happen to have a nice copy of that for

       20         me?

       21                      We do.  And because it might not be in

       22         the folder, may I have two copies, please?

       23                Q     There you are, sir.

       24         A      Thank you.

       25                Q     Exhibit 101 is your March 28, 2016


                                                                     66
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         letter, correct, sir?

        3         A      That's correct.

        4                Q     I'm showing Exhibit 101, and that is

        5         indeed your signature, correct, sir?

        6         A      That's right.

        7                Q     All right.  And in this letter, on the

        8         second page, you write, "Based on that

        9         understanding, Midwest hereby cancels the license

       10         pursuant to Section 11.3 thereof," right?

       11         A      That's right.

       12                Q     You had your reasons --

       13         A      Yes.

       14                Q     -- but unequivocally, in writing, on

       15         March 28, 2016, you, with full authority on behalf

       16         of Midwest, cancel the license agreement.  You

       17         terminate the license agreement.  You cancel KBR on

       18         the project, whatever word you want to use, right?

       19         A      In response to KBR's letter, yes.

       20                Q     You had your reasons, but you cancel,

       21         right?

       22         A      Canceled.

       23                Q     You terminate the license agreement,

       24         right?

       25         A      Right.


                                                                     67
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     You terminate the project using KBR

        3         technology, to use another term you've used, right?

        4         A      Right.

        5                Q     Okay.  Before this date --

        6         A      Yes.

        7                Q     -- March 28, 2016, do you believe that

        8         your company canceled or terminated the KBR project,

        9         the KBR license agreement, the project using KBR

       10         technology, or was this the first time?

       11         A      This is the first time.

       12                Q     Thank you, sir.

       13                      Why did you wait so long?

       14                      You missed financial close 30

       15         April 2014.  You wait 23 months.  Why?

       16         A      Sir, in such projects, you work with multiple

       17         contractors, and it's -- it was very likely that we

       18         could still have gone with KBR.

       19                That agreement with TKIS had many conditions

       20         involved and included a deadline for price

       21         validation, therefore, in our opinion, there was no

       22         reason to just willy-nilly cancel the license

       23         agreement.

       24                Q     Missing financial close in April 2014

       25         wasn't enough, obviously, right?


                                                                     68
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Right.

        3                Q     Okay.  Thank you.

        4                      In paragraph 25 to 26 of your witness

        5         statement, you say that, "In or after March 2015,

        6         MFC and KBR began negotiating the terms of a

        7         technical services agreement entered into in

        8         August 2015."

        9                      Once again, you did not negotiate the

       10         TSA with KBR, true?

       11         A      Not directly, no.

       12                Q     The people who did were Mr. Uddin and

       13         Mr. Dar, correct?

       14         A      That's correct.

       15                Q     Now, what role did you have in

       16         reviewing MFC's public bond filings in connection

       17         with the $1.2859 billion public bond that MFC was

       18         trying to use in part to finance the Indiana

       19         project?

       20         A      A major role.

       21                Q     A major role?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     Okay.  Did you draft the public bond

       24         files?

       25         A      No, that's drafted by -- by bond lawyers.


                                                                     69
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     All right.  You certainly approved the

        3         content, correct?

        4         A      Yes, I did.

        5                Q     All right.  Now, Exhibit No. 50 is an

        6         e-mail within KBR that circulates around on

        7         April 28, 2015, Midwest bond detail, and that

        8         attaches, as you can see on the next page, as we'll

        9         see in a moment, the public bond filing, correct?

       10         A      That's right, that's right.

       11                Q     And you can see that Mr. Haresh Divanji

       12         is the one who circulates within KBR this public

       13         bond filing, and he notes:

       14                      "This public filing is at odds with

       15         what Fawad" -- that's your CEO, Fawad Mukhtar --

       16         "has told Dave, at KBR, and others, while Ahsen" --

       17         Ahsen Uddin -- "was discussing the previous options

       18         with us, they" -- you --

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     -- "had signed an agreement with TKIS

       21         on March 3, 2015, to obtain an EPC contract."

       22                      And that's the memorandum of

       23         understanding, right?

       24         A      That's right.

       25                Q     All right.  And then, as I said,


                                                                     70
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         attached is the lengthy -- I mean, this is almost 20

        3         pages long --

        4         A      Yes.

        5                Q     -- bond filing?

        6         A      Yes.

        7                Q     If you would please turn to page 5 of

        8         the bond filing -- which I think will be page 7 all

        9         the way in, because of the e-mail cover -- you can

       10         see that the project is defined, "The project is a

       11         fully integrated, state-of-the-art nitrogen

       12         fertilizer manufacturing facility located in Posey

       13         County, Indiana," correct?

       14         A      That's correct.

       15                Q     And you can see, if you'll turn with me

       16         to the next page of your document, on page 7, there

       17         is a discussion of engineering procurement and

       18         construction, a discussion of potential EPC

       19         contractors, and then you approved because it was

       20         true, the inclusion in this public bond filing --

       21         pretty bad to be false, right?

       22         A      Right.

       23                Q     "On March 3, 2015, the company executed

       24         a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with TKIS,

       25         which envisions the execution of a final EPC


                                                                     71
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         contract in April 2015."

        3                      Just the next month, right?

        4         A      That's right.

        5                Q     And then under "Technology Providers,"

        6         on the same page:

        7                      "If the company and TKIS enter into a

        8         final EPC contract, then TKIS will supply the

        9         ammonia and nitrate technology, basic engineering

       10         and design package, and proprietary equipment for

       11         the project."

       12                      And that was a true statement, right?

       13         A      That's right.

       14                Q     And, of course, as we now know, in

       15         January 2016, you did enter into such a contract

       16         with TKIS, right?

       17         A      That's right.

       18                Q     And, obviously -- but let's just

       19         confirm -- what your company wrote in this public

       20         bond filing was true and that is using TKIS as the

       21         EPC contractor, and as you write, using its

       22         technology means KBR is out, correct?

       23                      You're not going to pay $43 million or

       24         9-and-a-half million dollars for KBR's license

       25         agreement to use its technology.  You're not going


                                                                     72
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         to use it at all.  It's terminated, right?

        3         A      Sir, this, as I mentioned on previous

        4         occasions, was an agreement that did not in the

        5         final analysis go forward.

        6                Q     No, we got it.

        7         A      So KBR came back and was still in play.

        8                Q     We understand your view, but let's try

        9         my question though.  Okay?

       10         A      So, if the agreement had gone forward, yes.

       11                Q     Okay.  Let's try my question --

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     -- and that is:  If MFC uses TKIS as

       14         its EPC contractor, it's the TKIS technology for

       15         ammonia and the rest that gets used, not KBR's, you

       16         have no use for KBR's technology, and you terminate

       17         rather than having to pay the 9-and-a-half or

       18         $43 million, correct?

       19         A      Correct.

       20                Q     All right.  How many people at MFC were

       21         involved in approving, as were you, the public bond

       22         filing?

       23         A      So Mike Chorlton, Les Wright, while they were

       24         there, myself, and Arif Dar.

       25                Q     That's a good number.


                                                                     73
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yes.

        3                Q     Okay.  We're still in 2015 --

        4         A      Yes.

        5                Q     -- back to the negotiations, which you

        6         weren't involved in but were aware of --

        7         A      Yes.

        8                Q     -- between MFC and KBR for the TSA

        9         agreement.

       10         A      Yes.

       11                Q     Did you know that in negotiating the

       12         TSA agreement with KBR, your company asked KBR to

       13         waive the termination fee under 11.4 so it did not

       14         apply if you went with another contractor, TKIS or

       15         otherwise?

       16         A      We discussed that with KBR, yes.

       17                Q     Okay.  And KBR rejected that request,

       18         true?

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     Maybe we don't need the paper.  MFC

       21         didn't just ask, get told no, and then let it go.

       22         MFC was quite persistent for a period of months

       23         repeatedly asking KBR to waive, correct?

       24         A      Correct.

       25                May I just add that we were agreeing to pay


                                                                     74
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         $5 million for a TSA that TKIS only charged 400,000

        3         for, and we were -- we were unhappy with the

        4         termination clause, as I mentioned to you, at least

        5         I was, and I know Arif felt the same way.

        6                So it was only commercial.  That's for us to

        7         make that request, that, you know, we're moving

        8         forward in the agreement, let's get this out of the

        9         way.

       10                Q     Sure.

       11                      And KBR said, no --

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     -- and you also persisted and persisted

       14         with different people all the way up to CEO Fawad

       15         Mukhtar contacting at the highest levels of KBR,

       16         correct?

       17         A      Correct.

       18                Q     And I hear you about TKIS charging a

       19         lower price to develop the EPC than KBR did, but

       20         you're not trying to suggest that excuses a breach

       21         of contract in this case, if the arbitrator finds

       22         one, are you?

       23         A      Sorry, I didn't --

       24                Q     Were you trying to suggest that MFC's

       25         payment of $5 million under the TSA -- signed,


                                                                     75
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         agreed-to TSA -- somehow excuses a breach of

        3         contract under the license agreement at issue in

        4         this case?

        5         A      I haven't thought that through at all.  I

        6         mean, I don't think that's what I was saying.

        7                I was saying it was an irritant, and we were

        8         paying a large amount of money and we said, Fine,

        9         let's -- let's solve it while this discussion is

       10         ongoing.

       11                And they said, No.  That's it.

       12                Q     Okay.  Did you personally ever make a

       13         request?  Did you join the several people from MFC

       14         who made requests that KBR waive the termination

       15         fee?

       16         A      No, I didn't.

       17                Q     All right.  Did you negotiate the

       18         January 2016 TKIS EPC contract?

       19         A      I was part of the negotiating team, yes.

       20                Q     There, you were?

       21         A      That's right.

       22                Q     KBR you weren't, but for TKIS you were?

       23         A      Yes, I was.

       24                Q     Why?  Why the difference?

       25         A      I think if -- if in our EPC contract with KBR


                                                                     76
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         had -- had been -- had proceeded, I would have been

        3         there as well.

        4                This was a big deal, and if we were signing

        5         with KBR, I would have been there as well.

        6                Q     Was the license agreement, the

        7         engineering agreement, and the PEQ back in 2013,

        8         that $43 million set of contracts, a big deal or not

        9         so much?

       10         A      Sir, the team selected, carried out the

       11         negotiations.  I -- I cannot explain to you why one

       12         person is there and the other one wasn't.

       13                Q     Not the question I asked though.

       14                      The question was:  Was the set of three

       15         contracts, the November 2013 with KBR for a

       16         cumulative $43 million, a big deal or not so much?

       17         A      A very important deal, yes.

       18                Q     It was important?

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     But you chose not to be involved?

       21         A      Yeah, I wasn't there, no.

       22                Q     All right.  Now, about five or six

       23         weeks before MFC and TKIS signed their January 2016

       24         EPC contract, the one you were involved in

       25         negotiating --


                                                                     77
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yes.

        3                Q     -- did you know that your colleagues

        4         met with KBR, high level, Farhan Mujib, rejected

        5         KBR's 2.8 and reduced in the meeting $2.7 billion

        6         EPC proposal and said, We're going with someone

        7         else?

        8                      Did you know that happened?

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     All right.  And were you in that

       11         meeting?

       12         A      No.

       13                Q     What was reported back to you from

       14         Mr. Uddin and Mr. Dar, who I believe were in that

       15         meeting?

       16         A      Arif was in that meeting?  I'm not sure.

       17                Q     How about Uddin?

       18         A      He must have been in that meeting.

       19                Q     Well, I think so, but what was reported

       20         back to you is the question?

       21         A      So this -- this is not a sudden event.  It

       22         had been developing over a considerable amount of

       23         period.  We had been very unhappy with the way

       24         things had proceeded.

       25                I mean, you -- the two billion was agreed


                                                                     78
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         after some internal -- after mutual discussions.

        3         There was some value engineering carried out.  Two

        4         billion wasn't trust on KBR.

        5                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, was

        6         interest?

        7                      THE WITNESS:  Was not thrust.

        8         A      It was a number that both parties agreed, and

        9         it was the only number that would have been

       10         acceptable.

       11                Q     Once again, sir, respectfully, not the

       12         question.

       13         A      Yes.

       14                Q     The question is -- I'm talking about a

       15         November 30, 2015 meeting.  So five-and-a-half, six

       16         weeks before your company signs with TKIS.

       17         A      That's right.

       18                Q     You've been with me.  That's what we're

       19         talking about.

       20         A      Yes.

       21                Q     What did your colleagues who attended

       22         the meeting with KBR where KBR was told, we reject

       23         your 2.8, lower it to $2.7 billion proposal or we're

       24         going with someone else?

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                     79
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     What was told to you about that

        3         meeting?

        4         A      I mean, I was told just to the extent of what

        5         you're saying.  I wasn't told of anything further

        6         than what Farhan said.

        7                In my opinion, Farhan generally had a good

        8         relation with us, and I'm sure he was also

        9         disappointed.

       10                Q     All right.  Now, Exhibit 95 is KBR's

       11         January 27, 2016, letter sent just two days after

       12         the public press release that MFC issued

       13         announcing --

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     -- its EPC contract with TKIS in which

       16         KBR says, through its actions -- referring to the

       17         TKIS contract -- MFC has terminated the KBR license

       18         agreement.  And declaring under Section 11.4, that

       19         the termination fee, $2.85 million, is due and

       20         sending along with the letter an invoice, correct,

       21         sir?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     And you remember this occurring, of

       24         course?

       25         A      I remember, absolutely.


                                                                     80
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     All right.  Now, the reaction inside

        3         MFC and the Fatima Group --

        4         A      Yes.

        5                Q     -- was certainly to take this seriously

        6         and to look into it, right?

        7         A      Absolutely.

        8                Q     Sure.

        9         A      This is a legal notice.

       10                      MR. HARRISON:  Mr. Ahmad, Mr. Divanji,

       11         would you please leave the room for a moment,

       12         because I may have to show some outside counsel eyes

       13         only document.

       14                      I think KBR's counsel can stay for

       15         this?

       16                      MR. HELLER:  Yes -- well, it is outside

       17         counsel's eyes only, so if we can speak for a moment

       18         with our witness and see that they're comfortable

       19         keeping in-house counsel here, we will let you know

       20         if you give us two minutes to talk.

       21                      MR. HARRISON:  How about two minutes?

       22                      MR. HELLER:  I'm sorry?

       23                      MR. HARRISON:  Yes, please.

       24                      MR. HELLER:  Okay.  Thank you.

       25                      And can we know which document you're


                                                                     81
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         talking about?

        3                      MR. HARRISON:  Yes.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Just let -- just

        5         since we're taking a break and the witness is

        6         leaving, to the extent there's communications with

        7         the witness, it's about this specific issue, not

        8         about any testimony.

        9                      MR. HELLER:  Of course.

       10                      I think we've been at this for almost

       11         two hours, but if this is a good time just to take a

       12         break?  I understand there's a question pending.

       13                      MR. HARRISON:  It's okay.

       14                      MR. HELLER:  All right?

       15                      MR. HARRISON:  We're not going to talk

       16         to the witness about the testimony.

       17                      MR. HELLER:  Of course not.

       18                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  So why don't

       19         we just take our break now.

       20                      How much time do you think you might

       21         have left, Mr. Harrison?

       22                      MR. HARRISON:  Believe it or not --

       23                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I know you told me

       24         not to believe, but do you have an estimate?

       25                      MR. HARRISON:  Me and you believe, 15


                                                                     82
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         minutes.

        3                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Fifteen minutes.

        4         Okay.

        5                      (Recess taken at 10:16 a.m. and ended

        6                      at 10:31 a.m.)

        7                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay, Mr. Harrison.

        8                      MR. HARRISON:  Thank you.

        9         BY MR. HARRISON:

       10                Q     Exhibit 97 is an e-mail attaching a

       11         PowerPoint presentation about KBR agreements, and

       12         you are not shown on this e-mail, but I wonder

       13         whether you participated in the discussions within

       14         your company about KBR's invoice for the

       15         $2.85 million?

       16         A      Sir, this presentation was never shown to

       17         either me or our boss.

       18                Q     Really?

       19         A      Absolutely.

       20                Q     Have you seen it before?

       21         A      I just saw it.

       22                Q     Just this very moment?

       23         A      No, I -- I saw it yesterday, also.

       24                Q     In preparing for your testimony?

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                     83
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     That's the first time you've ever seen

        3         it.

        4         A      That's the first time I've seen it.

        5                Q     Okay.  Well, for some other people in

        6         this room it will be the first time, too.

        7                      You saw then that others within your

        8         company looked at a summary of the termination

        9         clauses.  This is referring to KBR's license

       10         engineering and PEQ agreements, correct, sir?

       11         A      Right.

       12                Q     Okay.  And it says in this internal MFC

       13         PowerPoint presentation, "The ammonia license does

       14         not state any exclusivity with respect to engaging

       15         only KBR."

       16                      You understood, of course, that that

       17         was true --

       18         A      That's true.

       19                Q     -- MFC could have but was not

       20         prohibited from by the license agreement --

       21         A      That's right.

       22                Q     -- engaging a different contractor

       23         instead of KBR?

       24         A      That's through.

       25                Q     Just that there might be consequences


                                                                     84
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         to that decision, such as the consequence that

        3         brings us here today, correct?

        4         A      Such as today's proceedings, yes.

        5                Q     Which is why it says, "However,

        6         requires 30 percent of KBR license fee, 2.85 million

        7         U.S. dollars, to be made payable in case of

        8         termination."

        9                      Do you see that?

       10         A      That's -- that's how we phrased it.

       11                Q     Sure.

       12                      And you were -- although you didn't see

       13         this presentation, you were familiar with that's

       14         sort of the issue that you're company was

       15         considering at this time, in early February, after

       16         receiving KBR's letter, correct?

       17                      How do we respond to KBR's invoice for

       18         $2.85 million?

       19         A      That's right.

       20                Q     And then, quote:

       21                      "The agreement can be terminated

       22         without penalty or fee in case financial close does

       23         not occur by 30 April 2015 and the" -- capital P --

       24         "Project is canceled."

       25                      Do you see that?


                                                                     85
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yes.

        3                Q     Do you know what that refers to?

        4                      What?

        5         A      The 11 point -- the project in 11.3.

        6                Q     And what is that?

        7         A      As we discussed, my understanding is the

        8         license agreement was for -- license agreement was

        9         for a project that KBR was engaged -- engaging in.

       10                Q     Okay.  So you think that in this

       11         PowerPoint presentation that you never saw until

       12         yesterday when you were preparing with your lawyers

       13         to testify here --

       14         A      Sir --

       15                Q     -- that the capital P Project does not

       16         refer to the Posey County project?

       17                      Is that your testimony?

       18         A      That's not my testimony.

       19                I'm saying, number one, this is a

       20         junior-level engineer presenting something to his

       21         boss, who's a middle-level executive, Salman.  It

       22         never went up.

       23                He doesn't know what he's talking about.

       24                Q     He doesn't know what he's talking?

       25         A      No, he doesn't.


                                                                     86
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     Did you talk to him?

        3         A      No.  He's left the company.

        4                Q     Who is this one?

        5         A      This is Zunair.  He left the company a long

        6         time ago.

        7                      COURT REPORTER:  Who was that, sir?

        8                      THE WITNESS:  Zunair, Z-U-N-A-I-R.  I

        9         think that's how he spells it.

       10         A      So I don't think he was differentiating.

       11                Q     Did the boss bring this to your

       12         attention?

       13         A      No.

       14                Q     What's the boss's title?

       15         A      Salman Aslam is process engineer, manager, or

       16         something.

       17                Q     Okay.  So did -- but nonetheless,

       18         you're telling us that capital P Project as used in

       19         this PowerPoint that you never saw until preparing

       20         with your lawyers yesterday --

       21         A      Yes.

       22                Q     -- does not refer to the Posey County

       23         project.

       24                      That's what you're telling us?

       25         A      No.  I'm saying I don't know whether we were


                                                                     87
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         making that distinction when we were -- when he was

        3         presenting this slide.

        4                Q     All right, sir.

        5         A      I can't say he had that much sense that he

        6         was making that distinction.

        7                Q     And then this person, however you

        8         described him within the organization, somehow knew

        9         that during negotiation of the TSA, the fee waiver

       10         of other agreements was negotiated, however, was put

       11         down by KBR?

       12         A      That's right.

       13                Q     Why do you think this -- you described

       14         as a low-level engineer, did you say?

       15         A      Yes.

       16                Q     How does he know that?

       17         A      Because he's in that technical meeting.  He

       18         must be -- he must be in those technical meetings.

       19                Q     Very good.

       20                      And then there are some countermeasures

       21         proposed, right?

       22         A      Yeah.

       23                Q     We got the invoice, 2.85 million, 11.4.

       24                      Option A, let's imply that you need to

       25         be reasonable or you won't get more business.  You


                                                                     88
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         all tried that, didn't you?

        3                      You tried a commercial -- hey, KBR,

        4         we've dealt with each other for a long time --

        5         A      Yes.

        6                Q     -- let's just have a commercial

        7         resolution withdrawing this, correct?

        8         A      That's right.

        9                Q     He says, "Option B, let's try using the

       10         term 'cancel' in 11.3 and 11.5 and delaying the

       11         payment."

       12                      You tried that, too, didn't you?

       13         A      That was -- are you referring to my letter

       14         of --

       15                Q     Yes.

       16         A      That particular letter did not talk about

       17         delay of payment.  There was no payment under 11.3.

       18                Q     You later talked about delaying payment

       19         by invoking 11.3, didn't you?

       20         A      The fact that it was not due?

       21                Q     No, delay, sir.  Delay until financial

       22         close, that's what you all went for as option B, and

       23         you tried that, didn't you?

       24         A      I don't recall.

       25                Q     All right.  And then option C, "Pay the


                                                                     89
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         $2.85 million and close the chapter."

        3                      That one you haven't tried, which is

        4         why we're here, correct?

        5         A      Right.

        6                Q     And then there's a suggested way

        7         forward:  "Meet, talk by phone, try to explain our

        8         point of view."

        9                      This is that commercial let's do

       10         something together business wise idea, correct?

       11         A      Right.

       12                Q     Next, "KBR would come up with the same

       13         position as per agreed terms of the agreement, and

       14         MFC should not back out.  Stick with the contract.

       15         Honor the agreement."

       16                      Do you see that?

       17                      "Don't back out of your contracts."

       18                      Do you agree with that principal, by

       19         the way?

       20         A      I do.

       21                Q     Next bullet point, "Try to convince KBR

       22         that maybe we don't like what they came up with

       23         because there was a $2 billion target price and they

       24         came in at 2.8 billion."

       25                      You alluded to this earlier, that you


                                                                     90
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         all were unhappy about that?

        3         A      Yes, yes.

        4                Q     And then if KBR is stubborn, right, if

        5         nothing comes up and KBR is stubborn, let's try to

        6         delay until financial close and they can claim their

        7         amount then, right?

        8                      Do you see that?

        9         A      Yes, I see that.

       10                Q     Now, you say that that was a sort of

       11         lower-level presentation.

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     I mean --

       14         A      I mean, it -- it never got escalated.  I --

       15                Q     Well, certainly not to you, because you

       16         saw it for the first time yesterday?

       17         A      Not --

       18                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, what was

       19         the answer?

       20                      THE WITNESS:  Not to our chairman also,

       21         I think.

       22                Q     Right.  Exhibit 106, this is in

       23         June 24, 2016.

       24                      By this time, there's been an exchange

       25         of correspondence --


                                                                     91
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Yes.

        3                Q     -- between KBR and MFC, right?

        4         A      Right.

        5                Q     Now, this one is from Waqar Ahmed to

        6         Syed Ahsen Uddin.

        7                      Tell us who Waqar Ahmed is, please.

        8         A      Waqar is Ahsen's direct report.  And broadly,

        9         you know, it's not -- he's not a specific area

       10         expert.  He is Waqar's go to, second, I'd say, in

       11         command.

       12                Q     All right.  You're starting to get high

       13         in the organization going to --

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     -- one of the members of the lead

       16         negotiating team, right?

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     What is the SCM?

       19         A      Steering committee.

       20                Q     I'm sorry?

       21         A      Steering committee.

       22                Q     Okay.  Steering committee presentation,

       23         starting to look a little more formal.

       24                      This is a high-level presentation?

       25         A      That's right.


                                                                     92
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                Q     Did you receive this presentation in

        3         June of 2016?

        4         A      I did see this, yes.

        5                Q     All right.  This one has plenty of

        6         redacted items, but Item 3 is KBR's claim for

        7         termination and MFC's response.

        8                      I'll flip through the redactions and

        9         get to the relevant part of the presentation titled,

       10         "KBR claim for termination and MFC response."

       11                      Here, there is an initial position

       12         proposed by PB.

       13                      What's "PB"?

       14         A      Pillsbury.

       15                Q     Pillsbury, the lawyers --

       16         A      Yes.

       17                Q     -- challenge KBR work along with a

       18         reiteration of the fact that claim of fee under the

       19         license is not correct.

       20         A      That's correct.

       21                Q     All right.  Tech team analysis -- who

       22         is the tech team?

       23         A      This is Ahsen's team.

       24                Q     All right.  Ahsen's?

       25                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, this is --


                                                                     93
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                      THE WITNESS:  A-H-S-E-N.

        3                Q     That's Ahsen Uddin's team.

        4                      All right.  So you got the position

        5         from the lawyers --

        6         A      Yes.

        7                Q     -- the suggestion.  Then you've got the

        8         internal tech team that was actually involved with

        9         KBR saying:

       10                      "Thorough checks performed.  Complete

       11         process followed by KBR and approved by MFC.  There

       12         are not enough grounds to substantiate any claims

       13         against KBR with respect to the TSA."

       14                      Correct?

       15         A      Correct.

       16                Q     And that's why you all have not tried

       17         to say that this $5 million payment under the TSA

       18         somehow means you're excused from the dispute that

       19         brings us here today, right?

       20         A      I'm honestly not sure why that comes up

       21         because -- I'm not taking that position, the one

       22         that you're saying.

       23                Q     Good.

       24                      "Current position, PB" -- Pillsbury --

       25         "has agreed to TD" --


                                                                     94
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         A      Technical division -- technology division.

        3                Q     -- "suggested position that MFC should

        4         avoid extensive legal and arbitration efforts and

        5         instead, should focus on commercial negotiations

        6         along with clarification that nothing is due under

        7         the agreement and that MFC is willing to consider a

        8         compromise payment for the settlement of the

        9         disputed termination fee, but only after our

       10         financial close and NTP."

       11         A      Yes.

       12                Q     Right?

       13                      You were involved in that discussion?

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     You did see this presentation?

       16         A      Yes, yes.

       17                Q     Did you agree with the content of the

       18         presentation and recommendations?

       19         A      Yes, we agreed to continue to discuss with

       20         KBR a resolution.

       21                Because as a principal, my boss was concerned

       22         about headline risk, which had -- which had, you

       23         know, dogged us in this project.

       24                Q     Sure.

       25                      For example, the TKIS kickback scheme


                                                                     95
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         that was all over the newspapers, right?

        3         A      Sir, I think that -- that is -- you want me

        4         to discuss that?  I mean --

        5                Q     No, I don't want to --

        6         A      It's going nothing to do with us.

        7                Q     Well, that's the headliners.

        8         A      Yeah.  So it's got nothing to do with us.

        9         It's got nothing to do with MFC --

       10                Q     No one here is making --

       11         A      -- and if it had -- if it had repeated

       12         organization, like KBR wouldn't continue, neither

       13         would TKIS.

       14                Everybody knows that it had nothing to do

       15         with us.  I -- I -- I can't emphasize that enough.

       16                Q     Mr. Aman said very nice things

       17         yesterday about Mr. Uddin.  You're not on trial for

       18         that.

       19                      But when you say, "Headline risk" --

       20         A      I'm talking about --

       21                Q     -- I'm curious about what you mean,

       22         because --

       23         A      So I was talking about statements --

       24         statements made about our fertilizer companies back

       25         home in the U.S.  That created a lot of difficulties


                                                                     96
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         for us.

        3                Q     You mean when then Governor Pence, now

        4         Vice President, talked about how your product from

        5         Pakistan had been used allegedly against U.S.

        6         soldiers in Afghanistan.

        7                      Is that what you're talking about as

        8         headline risk?

        9         A      Yes, that's one of the headline risks.

       10                Q     You're not talking about headline risk

       11         of this dispute, KBR's dispute with MFC, or you are

       12         talking about that?

       13         A      No, because back home, the idea was any

       14         litigation is bad.

       15                Q     Fine.

       16         A      So the fact that this is confidential,

       17         arbitration has certain parameters, was -- was not

       18         something we were debating back then.

       19                Q     Good.

       20                      Now, on April 13, 2017, in Exhibit 483,

       21         what's happening here is that KBR and MFC here in

       22         2017 are talking about the possibility of entering

       23         into a second TSA.

       24                      KBR agreements with MFC have all been

       25         terminated, but now at this point there's a


                                                                     97
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         possibility of reengaging, and you're talking about

        3         a second TSA for KBR to receive payment from MFC to

        4         develop hopefully a lower EPC price for the whole

        5         project, correct?

        6         A      That's correct, that's correct.

        7                Q     All right.  That agreement never takes

        8         place and never gets signed?

        9         A      No.

       10                Q     Okay.  But here, there's concern -- and

       11         you're on this e-mail from Arif Dar -- that if we

       12         sign the EPC contract with KBR and issue an NTP to

       13         another contractor not using KBR license, then KBR

       14         may ask for the license termination fee.  The

       15         question is:  Will we do this?

       16                      Do you see that?

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     Do you remember having a discussion in

       19         response to this scenario?

       20         A      Yes.

       21                Q     And?

       22                      Go ahead, tell us, what happened?

       23         A      And we -- we didn't think it was necessary to

       24         do any -- to carry out any termination.  It was not

       25         necessary.


                                                                     98
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2                There was already a discussion that had taken

        3         place immediately after the TKIS signing, and there

        4         was no need to further discuss this matter.

        5                Q     Very well.

        6                      But Arif Dar brought it up to you and

        7         Mr. Uddin anyway?

        8         A      Yes, yes.

        9                Q     And then in JX-117, just the next

       10         month, May 17, 2017, again, an e-mail gets forwarded

       11         to you.  Farhan Mujib of KBR writes to Fawad Sheikh

       12         of MFC.

       13                      Can you tell us who that is, please?

       14         A      So that's Fawad Mukhtar.  Fawad Mukhtar is

       15         MFC.  His full name is Fawad Mukhtar and then

       16         Sheikh.

       17                Q     I didn't know that.

       18         A      Yes.

       19                Q     So this is a very high-level e-mail?

       20         A      This our chairman.

       21                Q     Yes.

       22                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, this is

       23         a --

       24                      THE WITNESS:  This is our chairman.

       25                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I'm sorry, what is


                                                                     99
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         the JX number?

        3                      MR. HARRISON:  117.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  117.

        5         BY MR. HARRISON:

        6                Q     And so here, on May 17, 2017, KBR's

        7         Farhan Mujib sends this e-mail to the chairman, the

        8         highest executive at the company -- at MFC --

        9         A      That's right.

       10                Q     -- yes?

       11                      And they're still talking about the

       12         possibility of a new second TSA with a lower -- with

       13         a lower target price than what KBR had proposed

       14         before but a higher target price, this time $2.25

       15         billion --

       16         A      Yes, sir.

       17                Q     -- they're talking about it?

       18         A      That's right.

       19                Q     And Mr. Mujib of KBR writes, The waiver

       20         on the license termination fee still, even years

       21         later, a topic that MFC continues to bring up, will

       22         only occur if all of the following conditions are

       23         met.

       24                      And he says:  Pay our new TSA payment

       25         in full.  Pay it timely.  Award KBR the full EPC


                                                                    100
        1                         A. Qureshi - Harrison

        2         contract on the multi-billion-dollar project, and we

        3         got to come up with a price that's not higher than

        4         $2.35 billion.

        5                      Do you see that?

        6         A      Yes.

        7                Q     And do you remember hearing about that

        8         proposal?

        9         A      That's right.

       10                Q     Okay.  But none of this ever came to

       11         pass because the companies do not enter into a

       12         second TSA?

       13         A      That's correct.

       14                Q     All right.  Let me ask you something,

       15         because I really do care:  Have I treated you

       16         fairly?  Have you been able to answer honestly?

       17         A      I have tried my best, sir.  You've treated me

       18         fairly.

       19                      MR. HARRISON:  All right.  Thank you.

       20                      That's all the questions I have.

       21                      THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

       22                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I'm going to ask you

       23         to stay put there because I think your counsel has a

       24         few questions.

       25                      MR. HELLER:  You can stay there.


                                                                    101
        1                          A. Qureshi - Heller

        2                      I don't want to encroach on your

        3         territory.

        4                      MR. HARRISON:  Please, take it.

        5                      MR. HELLER:  Okay.

        6         EXAMINATION

        7         BY MR. HELLER:

        8                Q     Mr. Qureshi, Mr. Harrison asked you a

        9         question the answer to which almost caused him to

       10         leave his shoes, so I'm going to ask you to clarify.

       11                      You were unhappy with the termination

       12         clause, that was your testimony?

       13         A      I was unhappy, and others had concerns as

       14         well.

       15                Q     Okay.  And why were you unhappy?

       16         A      Sir, as I mentioned, number one, this is not

       17         a standard clause that we were used to in a license

       18         agreement where there is nothing that is going to

       19         be -- there's no expense that is going to be

       20         incurred.  There's going to be no useful add license

       21         until the notice to proceed.

       22                Putting that in there seemed odd to me, and

       23         is relevant.

       24                Q     And then you also said, and I'll quote,

       25         "If we had to go with someone else, this is a


                                                                    102
        1                          A. Qureshi - Heller

        2         penalty."

        3                      Do you recall that answer?

        4         A      Yes.

        5                Q     Okay.  Please explain what you meant by

        6         "if we have to go with someone else"?

        7         A      Sir, we've -- so we tried our utmost to

        8         utilize KBR's license by approaching not just KBR

        9         but others' subcontractors who can use our

       10         contractors who we're entitled to use their license.

       11                So if we were forced and the situation had

       12         reached a situation where there is no other

       13         option -- we are project developers.  That was our

       14         goal.  If there was no other option, we would have

       15         to maybe go with the person who had the full EPC

       16         wrap option before us and it was giving us a

       17         bankable price.

       18                And that is what I was referring to when I

       19         said that.  And the penalty, in my opinion, goes

       20         back to the original view that I hold, which is that

       21         this is something that is not a normal practice or

       22         acceptable in agreements that have no value to add

       23         'til a certain date.

       24                To have this in there when you can -- when

       25         there is no exclusivity and you can go and negotiate


                                                                    103
        1                          A. Qureshi - Heller

        2         with multiple contractors and very multiple

        3         constructs of the project, for this to be in there

        4         in my personal opinion -- and I know that Arif

        5         shared my opinion, and others did as well -- was

        6         unfair.

        7                Q     So if you went with someone else, would

        8         you have to terminate the contract?

        9         A      Which, this license agreement?

       10                Q     The license agreement.

       11         A      I don't need the contract.

       12                Depending on -- depending on -- at financial

       13         close, if I don't issue an NTP to KBR, I will -- I

       14         will look at terminating.

       15                But all -- since we've already terminated in

       16         2016, I mean, that's a mute question.

       17                Q     Would any of those decisions happen

       18         before financial close?

       19         A      No, no.  How -- how can -- the TKIS contract

       20         was all subject to certain things happening and the

       21         NTP happening.  It was all -- it was a -- it was a

       22         contract full of conditions present.

       23                Q     Now, there was also a question raised

       24         that -- and I'll paraphrase the question because I

       25         don't remember the exact words to it -- that if TKIS


                                                                    104
        1                               A. Qureshi

        2         is the EPC contractor, would MFC then terminate the

        3         KBR license agreement?

        4                      Do you recall that question from

        5         Mr. Harrison?

        6                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I'm sorry.  Can you

        7         repeat that?

        8                Q     Yes.

        9                      If this is the EPC -- if TKIS is the

       10         EPC contractor, would MFC then terminate the license

       11         agreement?

       12                      Do you recall that question, something

       13         like that?

       14         A      Something like that, right.

       15                Q     Okay.  So if TKIS is the EPC

       16         contractor, when, in your mind, does TKIS become an

       17         EPC contractor?

       18         A      When it's issued a notice to proceed.

       19                      MR. HELLER:  No further questions.

       20         Thank you.

       21                      MR. HARRISON:  Nothing further.

       22                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Questions,

       23         Mr. Harrison?

       24                      MR. HARRISON:  Nothing here.

       25                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So you were just


                                                                    105
        1                               A. Qureshi

        2         asked a couple of questions by Mr. Heller about

        3         whether you would -- in your mind, whether you think

        4         you would terminate the license agreement by the

        5         time you got to financial close and issued a notice

        6         to proceed if you had contracted with another EPC

        7         contractor.

        8                      And I think you said something about --

        9         I just want to make sure I understand your testimony

       10         about how you understand the contract would work.

       11         You said something about it being a mute point

       12         because the contracts were already canceled.

       13                      So what I'd like to understand is, at

       14         what point, if you have engaged TKIS as an EPC

       15         contractor, if we get to notice to proceed and you

       16         issue a notice to proceed to TKIS, at that point do

       17         you believe that it is optional for MFC to terminate

       18         the license agreement or would you see that as being

       19         something that MFC was required to do at that point?

       20                      THE WITNESS:  So I would -- I would

       21         say, ma'am, that if the 2016 exchange had not

       22         happened, it would have been -- it would have been

       23         required of MFC to issue a termination notice to

       24         KBR.

       25                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  And in your


                                                                    106
        1                               A. Qureshi

        2         witness statement at paragraph 18, you talked about

        3         how it's common to negotiate with multiple

        4         technology providers and contractors, correct?

        5                      THE WITNESS:  Right.

        6                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Is it common in your

        7         experience to engage multiple contractors for the

        8         same service?

        9                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.  For the same

       10         service, number one, you -- you want competitive

       11         tension and competitive bidding.

       12                      Number two, things can go wrong in a

       13         $2.8 billion project at even the last minute, so you

       14         need to make sure that you've got multiple

       15         contractors who are prepared to step in if

       16         something -- if a condition precedent of one

       17         contractor is not met.

       18                      So we do negotiate with multiple

       19         contractors.  We do keep in mind that the financial

       20         close deadline -- at that stage, there's only one

       21         horse that reaches the closing, and there will not

       22         be others, but before that -- before that occurs,

       23         you can have discussions.  You can have meetings.

       24         You can have even license agreements, which it did

       25         not happen in this case because the license


                                                                    107
        1                               A. Qureshi

        2         agreement with TKIS was unsigned.

        3                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So what I'd like to

        4         understand from you is how far you think that

        5         process can go?

        6                      I understand having multiple bids.

        7                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

        8                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I understand having

        9         multiple technical service agreements to put

       10         together estimates for an EPC project.

       11                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

       12                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Could you -- do you

       13         think under the terms of the agreement as you -- the

       14         license agreement as you understood it that you

       15         could engage two -- two contractors for the ammonia

       16         technology fully signed agreements at the same time

       17         subject to saying, you'll get the notice to proceed

       18         in order to go forward?

       19                      I mean, how far does it go?  You can

       20         engage in the bids.  At what point do you think we

       21         have to stop here, we can't go along with two

       22         processes?

       23                      THE WITNESS:  So, ma'am, we would not

       24         have two EPC contractors sign at the same time.

       25                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  But would you


                                                                    108
        1                               A. Qureshi

        2         have two -- would you have two --

        3         A      I could have two --

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  -- license

        5         technology providers sign at the same time?

        6                      THE WITNESS:  Which is not the case.

        7         We didn't do that, but you could.

        8                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  That would be

        9         permitted by the license agreement?

       10                      THE WITNESS:  I don't know what the

       11         wording of the contracts would be, but we didn't

       12         sign, and we -- I -- I really am not in a position

       13         to give you an answer to whether I would have two

       14         license agreements or not.

       15                      I probably would --

       16                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Let me -- let me

       17         rephrase it.

       18                      Would you understand that to be common

       19         industry practice, to engage more than one

       20         technology provider to sort of, you know, hedge your

       21         bets lining up to the EPC date?

       22                      So not just getting a bid, but actually

       23         sign agreements saying you're going to be our

       24         ammonia technology provider, for example?

       25                      THE WITNESS:  And if -- within the


                                                                    109
        1                          A. Qureshi - Heller

        2         overall package doesn't fit, then yes, I will have

        3         two.  If I find one is faltering, I will go to

        4         another.

        5                      And that's what happened here.  I found

        6         one company faltering, and I could see that they

        7         will not go to the finish line with us.  So I will

        8         engage another contractor.

        9                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.

       10                      Any questions arising from those?

       11                      MR. HARRISON:  Yes, please, if I could.

       12         EXAMINATION

       13         BY MR. HARRISON:

       14                Q     Can you name another project for us in

       15         which your company has been involved where it has

       16         signed two or more technology license agreements

       17         with different vendors at the same time?

       18         A      No.

       19                      MR. HARRISON:  That's it.

                                                                    110

        2                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry.  What was

        3         the answer?

        4                      THE WITNESS:  No.

        5                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  Thank you

        6         very much, sir.

        7                      THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

        8                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So the agreement in

        9         this case is that before other witnesses testify

       10         that you can't testify about what's happened in the

       11         hearing -- or that you can't speak with them about

       12         what's happened in the hearing.

       13                      THE WITNESS:  I can stay here.

       14                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Sir, you can be

       15         present here, but then for the other witnesses who

       16         are going to come in today --

       17                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

       18                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  -- you cannot

       19         discuss what's transpired in the hearing.

       20                      THE WITNESS:  Understood.

       21                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So, Mr. Heller, you

       22         want to get another witness lined up?

       23                      MR. HELLER:  Yes.

       24                      (Pause.)

       25                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So, Ms. Hamid, good


                                                                    111
        1                              Proceedings

        2         morning.  How are you?

        3                      THE WITNESS:  Good morning.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So this morning,

        5         your testimony is going to be taken down by our

        6         court reporter, so it's very important that when

        7         you're asked questions that you respond verbally --

        8                      THE WITNESS:  Okay.

        9                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  -- because gestures

       10         are not going to be recorded on the transcript.

       11                      THE WITNESS:  All right.

       12                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  And that also, when

       13         there's questions back and forth, that you make

       14         every effort to let the person who's asking the

       15         question finish the question entirely before you

       16         respond, and they'll extend the same courtesy.

       17                      I know in a conversation sometimes it's

       18         easy to go back and forth.  That doesn't work so

       19         well when we're trying to follow it afterwards on

       20         the transcript.

       21                      THE WITNESS:  Sure.

       22                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  If you don't

       23         understand a question, you can ask for it to be

       24         repeated or rephrased, but what would be most

       25         helpful is if you try and answer the questions that


                                                                    112
        1                           Z. Hamid - Heller

        2         you're asked as directly as possible.

        3                      THE WITNESS:  Okay.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Do you understand?

        5                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

        6                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  Do you affirm

        7         that the testimony you're about to give shall be

        8         truthful and do you commit to testifying truthfully?

        9                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

       10         Z A I N A B    H A M I D, being first duly affirmed by

       11         the Notary, testifies as follows:

       24                      THE WITNESS:  Pakarab Fertilizer

                                                                    113

        2         for MFC.

        3                Q     All right.  And do you have a title

        4         with MFC?

        5         A      Oh, right.  It's executive finance,

        6         commercial contracts.

        7                Q     Okay.  And that's for MFC?

        8         A      Yes.

        9                Q     Okay.

       10                      Okay.  Now, you have in front of you a

       11         statement?

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     Is that your witness statement?

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     Okay.  Are the statements made therein

       16         true and correct?

       17         A      Yes.

       18                Q     And you're prepared to testify

       19         regarding those statements today, right?

       20         A      Yes.

       21                      MR. HELLER:  Okay.  Your witness.

       22         EXAMINATION

       23         BY MS. BARRON:

       24                Q     Good morning, Miss Hamid.

       25                      I think you just testified that you are


                                                                    114
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         executive finance, commercial contracts at MFC.

        3                      Is that correct?

        4         A      For MFC.

        5                Q     For MFC.  Okay.

        6                      In your statement you say that you're

        7         executive finance, commercial contracts at Pakarab

        8         Fertilizers Limited, and that you're a financial

        9         consultant for MFC.

       10                      Has that changed?

       11         A      No.  That's what it is, but what I'm --

       12         sorry.

       13                I think what I meant was that that's my

       14         designation, and I predominantly work on the MFC

       15         project for Fatima Group.  And so I work on the

       16         commercial contracts for MFC at Fatima Group --

       17                Q     Okay.

       18         A      -- as a consultant.

       19                Q     Okay.  Who pays your salary?

       20         A      Pakarab Fertilizers.

       21                Q     And is that a part of the Fatima Group?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     And they pay your salary for your work

       24         for MFC as well.

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                    115
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                Q     Can you explain what exactly your role

        3         is with respect to MFC?

        4         A      So I work on the commercial and finance team,

        5         supporting Mr. Ausaf, and previously Mr. Arif Dar,

        6         and my focus has been on the commercial contracts,

        7         so worked extensively on the EPC contracts that we

        8         negotiated for the project previously, and I've also

        9         worked on different other things, like the sale

       10         stacks, sort of exemptions, sort of exercise that we

       11         went through with a few other contracts with a few

       12         other contractors, so...

       13                Q     When did you first start doing work for

       14         MFC?

       15         A      2014, when I joined Fatima Group.

       16                Q     So immediately when you joined Fatima

       17         you started working on MFC?

       18         A      Yes.

       19                Q     And you said you primarily do work for

       20         MFC?

       21         A      Yes.

       22                Q     What --

       23         A      So -- sorry.

       24                Q     What percentage of your time would you

       25         say you devote to MFC versus other things?


                                                                    116
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         A      Mostly there have a few other projects that I

        3         recently provided some support to, but it's...

        4                Q     Can you give an estimate, 75 percent,

        5         90 percent?

        6         A      It just depends on the workload.

        7                Q     Okay.  A lot of time on MFC?

        8         A      Yes, yes.

        9                Q     Since 2014?

       10         A      Yes.

       11                Q     So did you participate in commercial

       12         contracts in discussions with TKIS for the EPC

       13         contract?

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     In your witness statement you say that

       16         you have no professional relationship with KBR, and

       17         you don't refer to any interaction that you have

       18         with KBR.

       19                      Is that fair to say?

       20         A      Yes, I haven't referenced any interaction

       21         with KBR in my statement.

       22                Q     In fact, were you involved in the

       23         conversations that KBR and MFC had around an EPC

       24         contract in 2015?

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                    117
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                Q     Did you ever personally speak with

        3         anyone at KBR?

        4         A      Yes.  I met Mr. Haresh and his team when they

        5         came to New York for meetings on the EPC contract.

        6         I was also on video conferences and conference calls

        7         with the team with regards to the TSA as well as the

        8         EPC term sheet.

        9                      COURT REPORTER:  EPC --

       10                      THE WITNESS:  Term sheet.

       11         A      And so I wasn't the main communicator.  The

       12         discussions were led by Arif Dar, but I was present.

       13                Q     Would you say you participated in the

       14         majority of the conference calls between MFC and

       15         EPC -- pardon me -- KBR at that time?

       16         A      In the commercial -- on the commercial calls

       17         and interactions, yes.

       18                Q     Were you on the phone call in May of

       19         2015 when MFC asked KBR to waive the termination fee

       20         under the license agreement if MFC decided to sign

       21         with a competitor?

       22         A      I was on conference calls with KBR.  I'm not

       23         sure that is how it was worded, but we -- there were

       24         discussions, yes.

       25                Q     You were on that -- the call that I'm


                                                                    118
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         referencing?

        3         A      I can't recall the exact call.  I'm just

        4         saying that there were calls that I was a part of.

        5                Q     Okay.

        6         A      Yeah.

        7                Q     Well, let's -- were you on the call

        8         where MFC asked to waive the termination fee under

        9         the KBR license agreement?

       10         A      Yes, I am familiar with those discussions,

       11         yes.

       12                Q     And when I asked you that question, you

       13         understood which phone call I was just talking

       14         about?  You remember a specific call where that

       15         happened?

       16         A      We had a lot of calls, and it was something

       17         that came up a few times.  There was sometimes

       18         detailed discussions and sometimes not, so I'm not

       19         sure which specific call you're talking about.

       20                Q     Okay.  So there were multiple calls

       21         where MFC requested waiver of the termination fee?

       22         A      So there were multiple calls in which we were

       23         discussing the potential TSA, and that was one of

       24         the topics of discussions.

       25                On quite a few of those calls, it was just


                                                                    119
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         referenced in passing to say that is an outstanding

        3         point and will be decided between management, and so

        4         we didn't necessarily have a discussion on it.

        5                Q     Do you remember the first call where

        6         MFC first raised this question?

        7         A      I'm not sure if I was part of that particular

        8         call.

        9                Q     Okay.  And you don't -- you don't talk

       10         about any of these calls in your witness statement?

       11         A      No.  My focus is -- yeah -- on TKIS

       12         discussions, yes.

       13                Q     Your focus is TKIS in this?

       14         A      In the witness statement.

       15                Q     But you know that this is, in fact, an

       16         arbitration between MFC and KBR, right?

       17         A      Yes, yes.

       18                Q     Were you not asked to provide testimony

       19         based on your personal knowledge about your

       20         participation in the conversations between KBR and

       21         MFC in 2015?

       22         A      They were part of the discussions, but as far

       23         as how we would proceed with, you know, the witness

       24         statements, et cetera, because I was involved

       25         directly and in detail on the TKIS EPC contract, I


                                                                    120
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         am going to be speaking to that.

        3                Q     Okay.

        4         A      Yeah.

        5                Q     But you, in fact, have participated in

        6         most of the teleconferences and meetings between KBR

        7         and MFC, but it was decided that that would not be

        8         part of your witness statement?

        9         A      I was part of those discussions, yes.

       10                Q     Okay.  Did you decide that you weren't

       11         putting that in your witness statement or who made

       12         that decision?

       13         A      It was a collective, yeah.

       14                Q     Okay.  Was it a strategy decision?

       15         A      I think the -- the idea was that Mr. Ausaf

       16         would sort of deal with the relationship and, you

       17         know, what happened with KBR.

       18                He has better knowledge of it, you know, on a

       19         strategic level as well, so I think that sort of got

       20         covered and, you know...

       21                Q     Was Mr. Qureshi on the call where MFC

       22         asked KBR to waive the ammonia license termination

       23         fee?

       24         A      He was on quite a few calls with the senior

       25         management, yes.


                                                                    121
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                I was sort of more involved with the working

        3         group level, yeah.

        4                Q     So the day-to-day would you say?

        5         A      Yes.

        6                Q     So -- understood.

        7                      My question was:  Was he on the call

        8         where MFC asked to waive the license termination

        9         fee?

       10         A      On the very first call?

       11                Again, because it was mentioned a few times,

       12         I -- you know, he wasn't on the day-to-day calls,

       13         perhaps, yeah.

       14                Q     So do you recall him ever being on any

       15         phone call where that was discussed?

       16         A      I know that he was on phone calls where it

       17         was discussed with the senior management of KBR,

       18         yes.

       19                Q     So -- sorry -- phone calls that you

       20         were on, was Mr. Qureshi on those phone calls where

       21         the termination fee was discussed where MFC asked to

       22         waive the termination fee?

       23         A      Not on all of them.

       24                Q     So you would have personal knowledge of

       25         those conversations, but Mr. Qureshi would not?


                                                                    122
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         A      No, he would.  I'm just saying that it was

        3         discussed in various forums.

        4                So on a working group level, because as we

        5         were discussing the TSA, that would be mentioned,

        6         but to be discussed by senior management, and so the

        7         discussions taking place between senior management,

        8         he would have personal knowledge of that, of course.

        9                Q     You weren't on those calls?

       10         A      No.

       11                Q     So you can only speak to the calls that

       12         you were on --

       13         A      Yes, exactly.

       14                Q     -- and on numerous of those calls, the

       15         topic of waiving the termination fee was raised?

       16         A      It was mentioned, yes.

       17                Q     Who from MFC mentioned it?

       18         A      Well, it was a commercial point, and so the

       19         discussion was basically led by Arif Dar on that.

       20                Q     Arif Dar?

       21         A      Yes.

       22                Q     Was Syed Ahsen Uddin on those calls?

       23         A      Yes, he was on some of those.

       24                Q     Did he ever raise that point in your

       25         recollection?


                                                                    123
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         A      It may have been mentioned by him as well,

        3         yeah.

        4                Q     You mentioned in several of your

        5         witness statements -- do you have your witness

        6         statement?

        7         A      Yes.

        8                Q     So I'm just putting this up, a couple

        9         of examples here.

       10         A      Sure.

       11                Q     A lot of your testimony in this

       12         statement is based on conversations and e-mails with

       13         Mr. Dar?

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     Paragraph 7, paragraph 8, paragraph 9,

       16         paragraph 11, and you also mention Mr. Qureshi in

       17         paragraph 11.

       18                      You signed your statement on

       19         August 22nd.

       20                      When did you have these conversations

       21         with -- well, let me start with Mr. Qureshi.

       22                      When did you have the conversations on

       23         which your statement is based with Mr. Qureshi?

       24         A      So these statements -- the reference to these

       25         discussions is basically over time while all of


                                                                    124
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         these activities were going on.

        3                Q     So your witness statement is based on

        4         conversations that happened at the time, not in

        5         preparation for this witness statement?

        6         A      Yes.  So these -- these discussions that I'm

        7         referencing are at that time.

        8                Q     Okay.  So you didn't have a

        9         conversation for the purpose of preparing this

       10         witness statement with Mr. Qureshi?

       11         A      Well, we -- we obviously had discussions, but

       12         all of the ones that I mentioned in here are with

       13         reference to what I know from discussions that

       14         happened at that time.

       15                Q     Okay.  So you did have conversations

       16         with Mr. Qureshi closer to the time of preparing

       17         your witness statement, but that's not what's in

       18         your witness statement?

       19         A      Right.  This is based on the discussions, et

       20         cetera, that were happening at that time.

       21                So, for example, because I worked on the

       22         commercial finance team with them, and Mr. Dar and

       23         Mr. Qureshi worked so closely together, we used to

       24         have internal sessions as well.  So, you know, there

       25         were a lot of things that were being discussed and


                                                                    125
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         raised about what was happening at that time, and so

        3         that is what I have also sort of started in here.

        4                Q     Were some of those internal discussions

        5         about MFC's requests to waive the termination fee

        6         under the license agreement with KBR?

        7         A      Yes, that was also internally discussed, of

        8         course.

        9                Q     And with whom did you make the decision

       10         that that should not be part of your witness

       11         statement?

       12         A      I -- I conferred with the lawyers.  That was

       13         just -- just the strategy not to have overlap, et

       14         cetera, so I was going to speak to, you know, the

       15         stream with TKIS, and so that was just the focus of

       16         my witness statement.

       17                Q     And so was your understanding that

       18         waiver was discussed in somebody else's witness

       19         statement?

       20         A      Well, I believe we -- that was something that

       21         was related to the interaction with KBR, so, you

       22         know, that was a commercial discussion that took

       23         place between the two parties.  So, yeah, so that

       24         wasn't relevant to the discussion of the TKIS EPC

       25         contract, and therefore, that's why it's not covered


                                                                    126
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         in there.

        3                Q     When was the last time you talked to

        4         Mr. Dar?

        5         A      I can't pinpoint exactly, but I think maybe

        6         over Eid that I sent him a message to say --

        7                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, maybe

        8         over --

        9                      THE WITNESS:  So over the last festive

       10         holiday, I may have sent him -- I did send him a

       11         message, and he responded on that, so that's --

       12         yeah.

       13                Q     When was the last time you had a

       14         conversation with him about either MFC's work with

       15         TKIS or KBR?

       16         A      I haven't had any official conversations with

       17         him since he's left.

       18                Q     Okay.  So all of this was based on your

       19         past recollection about interactions with TKIS?

       20         A      Yes.

       21                Q     Do you know Syed Ahsen Uddin?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     He is a current employee of Fatima,

       24         yes?

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                    127
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                Q     Do you ever work with him?

        3         A      Yes, I interact with him.

        4                Q     Were you -- he was on these phone calls

        5         that you participated on with KBR around EPC

        6         negotiations.

        7                      Is that correct?

        8         A      Yes.

        9                Q     Were you aware that he was also heavily

       10         involved in negotiating the earlier ammonia

       11         technology license agreement?

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     Your witness statement doesn't mention

       14         Mr. Ahsen Uddin, did you speak with him at all in

       15         preparing your witness statement?

       16         A      No.

       17                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I'm sorry, I didn't

       18         hear that.

       19         A      No.

       20                Q     Why -- so you knew that he was involved

       21         in the ammonia technology license agreement, right?

       22         A      Right.

       23                Q     And you knew that he was involved in

       24         the EPC negotiations as well?

       25         A      Right.


                                                                    128
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                Q     Why did you not speak with Mr. Ahsen

        3         Uddin?

        4         A      Because I'm not talking about the ammonia

        5         license agreement in my witness statement.

        6                Q     Okay.  When you were making the

        7         decision with counsel, and others, about what would

        8         be included in your witness statement, did you also

        9         make the decision not to talk to Mr. Ahsen Uddin?

       10         A      No.

       11                So because he heads the technology division,

       12         so my interaction with him is -- I don't speak to

       13         him on a daily basis or -- you know, it's not a

       14         regular interaction.  It's really just specifically

       15         as required for work.

       16                And so my interaction is predominantly with,

       17         you know, on the commercial finance team, and so

       18         with Mr. Ausaf and my team there and, you know,

       19         and -- yeah, and his -- maybe the technical team,

       20         but, you know, he was in meetings where there were

       21         discussions, et cetera, but, I mean, I didn't have a

       22         direct conversation with him as such, yeah.

       23                Q     You don't know why MFC did not arrange

       24         to have Mr. Uddin testify in this arbitration.

       25                      Is that right?


                                                                    129
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         A      I believe that it was a discussion on a

        3         commercial issue, et cetera, and Mr. Ausaf was going

        4         to represent the company in that capacity.  I

        5         believe that we didn't think it was a technical

        6         issue, which is why Mr. Uddin is not here.

        7                Q     Have you ever read the 2013 ammonia

        8         technology license agreement between MFC and KBR?

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     When did you read that?

       11         A      A while ago.

       12                Q     Okay.  Why did you read it?

       13         A      Well, my -- my initial reading was because --

       14         when I started working, that was one of the

       15         agreements that we had completed and we were working

       16         with TCM at that time, and they were going to

       17         implement the ammonia license agreement.

       18                So that was something that came in

       19         discussions.  It was part of the documents that I

       20         received, so I looked through it.  So yes, that's...

       21                Q     So you were speaking with TCM.  That's

       22         Tecnimont?

       23         A      Yes.

       24                Q     And that was a potential EPC

       25         contractor?


                                                                    130
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         A      Yes.

        3                Q     Why would you -- why were you reviewing

        4         the license agreements in connection with that

        5         conversation with Tecnimont?

        6         A      It was part of the documents that was given

        7         to me.  That was my job, to review the documents, et

        8         cetera.  There were discussions on alignment between

        9         KBR and TCM, and so, you know, I just happened to

       10         read through them.  I like to be thorough.

       11                Q     So the license agreements were relevant

       12         to your discussions -- MFC's discussions with TCM

       13         around an EPC contract --

       14         A      Yes.

       15                Q     -- correct?

       16         A      Yes.

       17                Q     And when you say, "align," are you

       18         talking about if you had moved forward with

       19         Tecnimont, those KBR license agreements would have

       20         been part of the EPC contract?

       21         A      Right.  Our TCM would have implemented the

       22         KBR technology, to the best of my knowledge, yes.

       23                Q     So I want to point you to paragraph 9

       24         of your statement.

       25         A      Uh-huh.


                                                                    131
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                Q     You say that this was based on your

        3         conversations with Mr. Dar and MFC's records?

        4         A      Uh-huh.

        5                Q     And you refer to Tecnimont, or TCM, as

        6         a KBR-approved contractor.

        7         A      Uh-huh; yes.

        8                Q     Where does the term "KBR-approved

        9         contractor" come from?

       10         A      Honestly, that's just the term that we've

       11         used internally as well.  I think that's the --

       12                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry.  You think

       13         that's the --

       14                      THE WITNESS:  In the licensing

       15         agreement as well.

       16                Q     Okay.  But it was a term that was used

       17         regularly in discussions at MFC?

       18         A      Yes, I've heard that in discussions, yes.

       19                Q     And you understood that Tecnimont was a

       20         KBR-approved contractor?

       21         A      Yes.

       22                Q     And you understood that TKIS was not a

       23         KBR-approved contractor?

       24         A      Yes.

       25                Q     In your statement, paragraph 9, you


                                                                    132
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         write, "I'm aware that in December 2013, a

        3         memorandum of understanding was signed between MFC

        4         and TKIS with respect nitric acid and UAN plants."

        5         A      Yes.

        6                Q     So that is just part of the Posey

        7         County, Indiana project, correct?

        8         A      Right.

        9                Q     A single part?

       10         A      Yes.

       11                Q     And then later in that paragraph, you

       12         say, "Understand these circumstances, MFC decided to

       13         give TKIS an opportunity to bid for the EPC contract

       14         for the project."

       15                      And project refers to the entire

       16         fertilizer plant, correct?

       17         A      In -- yes, that is what I'm referring to in

       18         my statement.

       19                Q     So you used nitric acid and UAN plants

       20         to refer to a specific part of the larger project?

       21         A      Right.  So what -- TKIS's technology --

       22                Q     Miss Hamid, I don't want to cut you

       23         off, and you'll have time to talk with your lawyer,

       24         but I'm just asking if nitric acid and UAN plants

       25         referred to a part of the larger fertilizer plant


                                                                    133
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         project?

        3         A      Yes.

        4                Q     So let me turn you to paragraph 16.

        5                      You say here that MFC -- I'm sorry.

        6                      "The TKIS EPC contract was signed to

        7         demonstrate to MFC's lenders and other potential

        8         contractors that MFC had reached an agreement on

        9         price and schedule on the basis of which it was

       10         going to proceed to achieve its other financial

       11         close conditions precedent."

       12                      Did I read that correctly?

       13         A      Yes.

       14                Q     So MFC signing the TKIS EPC contract

       15         signaled things to lenders and other potential

       16         contractors about what MFC intended to do going

       17         forward, correct?

       18         A      Right.  We -- we signed the EPC, so we had a

       19         price for our EPC on the basis of which we were

       20         going to move forward on arranging our debt and

       21         equity and financing, et cetera, and other CPs, yes.

       22                Q     And the specific terms of the TKIS EPC

       23         contract were important, right?

       24         A      The most critical was the price, and the

       25         schedule, yes.


                                                                    134
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                Q     It would be relevant to lenders and

        3         other potential contractors who TKIS was using as

        4         its ammonia licenser, right?

        5         A      That the price was critical for the lenders

        6         because they would need to know how much financing

        7         we needed to arrange, yes.

        8                Q     Right.  What about who was doing the

        9         licensing for the various parts of the project, that

       10         was also something that was important to lenders,

       11         right?

       12         A      They would -- I'd be interested in who was --

       13         I suppose, but the important thing was that we had a

       14         EPC contract.  So we had a party that was going to

       15         provide us with the EPC services at a fixed price

       16         and a schedule.

       17                Q     You state in paragraph 21 that MFC's

       18         lenders needed to ensure all the major critical

       19         terms have been agreed, and that is why MFC needed

       20         to finalize a form of the license agreement by the

       21         signing date, right?

       22         A      Our preference was to have it agreed -- the

       23         form agreed by signing it.

       24                Q     You don't say, "our preference" though,

       25         you say, "needed," right?


                                                                    135
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         A      I do use the word "needed," yes.

        3                Q     And that was because MFC's lenders

        4         needed to ensure that major critical terms had been

        5         agreed, right?

        6         A      Right, so they would understand what the risk

        7         in a contract is.

        8                Q     Right.  And one of those major critical

        9         terms, according to paragraph 21, is the ammonia

       10         technology license agreement?

       11         A      Right, because in the license agreement there

       12         are specific terms that are mentioned with respect

       13         to our right to use that license once we start

       14         operations, and the lenders would want to know that

       15         we have that right.

       16                Q     And TKIS wanted to leave the license

       17         negotiated at a later date, but MFC said, No, we

       18         need this now to -- we need to finalize a form,

       19         because MFC's lenders needed to ensure all major

       20         critical terms, that's what that statement says,

       21         right?

       22         A      Right.  They suggested that, because it

       23         wasn't price sensitive, so we could even negotiate

       24         the terms of that after signing.  We just wanted to

       25         get it done beforehand.  Because there were also so


                                                                    136
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         many other elements, we didn't want, you know, to be

        3         negotiating this post the signing of the contract.

        4                Q     Payment for the license was going to be

        5         part of the larger payment for the EPC contract,

        6         right?

        7         A      I mean, we were going to pay for the EPC

        8         work, and the licensing was a part of that, yes.

        9                Q     After MFC signed the TKIS EPC contract,

       10         it used that contract to tell third parties that its

       11         ammonia licensor was TKIS and not KBR, right?

       12         A      The focus was to tell the parties that we had

       13         signed an EPC and so we had a contract.

       14                Q     Are you familiar with Nexant?

       15         A      Yes.

       16                Q     Who is Nexant?

       17         A      They are the independent engineer that -- for

       18         the financiers.

       19                Q     Okay.  Can you explain what that means?

       20         A      So their responsibility, as I understand it,

       21         is to evaluate the project, and so when the

       22         tax-exempt bonds would be going to marketing, that

       23         report would be part of the information going to

       24         potential buyers of the bond to speak to the project

       25         and the technical aspects of it, and, you know, the


                                                                    137
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         risk allocation of it, and et cetera.

        3                Q     I'm going to hand you a binder which

        4         has quite a few exhibits in here --

        5         A      Sure.

        6                Q     -- and ask you about a couple of them.

        7         A      Sure.

        8                Q     So there's a tab in there JX-96.

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     Do you know who Alan Nizamon is?

       11         A      He was the primary contact at Nexant, I

       12         believe.

       13                Q     It says he's a project manager, energy

       14         and chemicals advisory.

       15                      He was NFC's primary contact for the

       16         Indiana project?

       17         A      Yes, to my understanding.

       18                Q     You are not on this e-mail?

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     It's dated January 28th, 2016 from

       21         Mr. Nizamon to Arif Dar?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     Copying John Beopple.

       24                      Do you know who that is?

       25         A      He was working with Alan.  I didn't interact


                                                                    138
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         with them, so I wouldn't know.

        3                Q     Mr. Nizamon attaches a spreadsheet --

        4         A      Uh-huh.

        5                Q     -- and he says, We would like to set up

        6         a conference call with you next week to discuss the

        7         timing of the commercial info, financial model, and

        8         other financial items, reattached a spreadsheet.

        9                      Would you have participated in those

       10         conference calls with Nexant?

       11         A      No.

       12                Q     Okay.  It would just be Mr. Dar?

       13         A      He would be on them.  I don't know if it

       14         would be just him, yeah.

       15                Q     If you turn to the spreadsheet, it's --

       16         this one is quite heavily redacted, but does this

       17         spreadsheet look familiar to you?  Have you seen

       18         spreadsheets like this from Nexant?

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     Have you ever seen this particular one?

       21         It's -- it was sent on January 28th, 2016.  I don't

       22         have more details than that.

       23         A      Yes, I have seen it.

       24                Q     Okay.  So I want to point you to the

       25         unredacted portion.


                                                                    139
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         A      Right.

        3                Q     The first column says, "Nexant

        4         requirement" --

        5         A      Right.

        6                Q     -- and under that is "licensor

        7         agreements"?

        8         A      Yes.

        9                Q     So was it a requirement for Nexant to

       10         have information about MFC's license agreements?

       11         A      Yes.

       12                Q     So the first column next to that is

       13         "Nexant's comment, if any."

       14                      This one says, "We assume that the KBR

       15         license, engineering, and proprietary supply

       16         equipment agreements, dated November 5th, 2013, are

       17         still applicable.  If not, we would need updates."

       18                      And then there are two columns next to

       19         that that say, "MFC remarks."  The first is from

       20         November 11, 2014?

       21         A      Uh-huh, yes.

       22                Q     It says, "Presently, this understanding

       23         is still correct."

       24                      Do you see that?

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                    140
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                Q     Do you know who filled in these columns

        3         for MFC?

        4         A      The technical team?

        5                Q     The technical team.

        6         A      Yeah.

        7                Q     So any particular individual?

        8         A      Honestly, I couldn't say.  They're a large

        9         team --

       10                Q     Okay.

       11         A      -- yeah, so they would have responsibilities,

       12         but I wouldn't know who wrote this particular

       13         warning.

       14                Q     Would you and Mr. Dar review documents

       15         like this?

       16         A      Yes, I believe they were -- excuse me --

       17         shared.

       18                Q     So if there was something wrong and

       19         this was being sent to Nexant, you would say, That's

       20         not correct, right?

       21         A      If we received them before they were sent to

       22         Nexant, yes.

       23                Q     Okay.  And that was from November 11th,

       24         2014, so this is now in January of 2016.

       25                      At no point, to your knowledge, was a


                                                                    141
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         correction made that in November of 2014 the KBR

        3         license agreements were still applicable, right?

        4         A      Say that again?

        5                Q     No -- you never made any correction to

        6         that statement, did you?

        7         A      No, I --

        8                Q     And to your knowledge, Mr. Dar also

        9         didn't make a correction?

       10         A      On November 11, 2014?

       11                Q     Right.

       12         A      No.

       13                Q     Okay.  Moving over to the next column,

       14         sort of highlighted.

       15                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Sorry.  I don't --

       16         I'm not -- November 11, 2014?

       17                      I'm not understanding --

       18                      MS. BARRON:  Sure.

       19                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  -- what's going on

       20         here.

       21                      MS. BARRON:  Would you like me to ask

       22         the witness to clarify?  I'm happy --

       23                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Yeah, I don't see --

       24         I don't understand where -- where is that and why

       25         are you using the date November 11 --

        2                      MS. BARRON:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Its right

        3         here?

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So up there, okay,

        5         on the comments.

        6                      MS. BARRON:  That's an easier

        7         clarification.

        8                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you.

        9         BY MS. BARRON:

       10                Q     So moving over to the next date, which

       11         is MFC's remarks on January 21st, 2016 --

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     -- that's five days after TKIS and MFC

       14         signed an EPC contract, right?

       15         A      More than five days.  We signed it on the

       16         16th of January, 2016.

       17                Q     Okay.  I think January 21st is five

       18         days after.  But I -- don't --

       19         A      I'm sorry, sorry.

       20                Q     Its okay.

       21         A      I'm so sorry.

       22                Q     No, it's okay.  If the date is --

       23         there's a lot going on.  I just wanted to make sure

       24         I wasn't --

       25         A      Yes, yes, yes, 21st.


                                                                    143
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                Q     -- misspeaking.

        3                      So five days after, there's an update

        4         from MFC, right?

        5         A      Yes.

        6                Q     It says:

        7                      "Finalized license agreement with EPC

        8         contractor is available at Exhibit C of the EPC

        9         contract, which shall be effective on financial

       10         close date."

       11                      That's the full update, right?

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     So it doesn't say KBR license

       14         agreements are still applicable there, does it?

       15         A      No.  It's only updating with respect to the

       16         TKIS EPC.

       17                Q     Right.  And it's in response to a

       18         question assuming that the KBR license engineering

       19         and proprietary supply agreements are still

       20         applicable.

       21                      So now there's an update.  There's a

       22         finalized agreement with an EPC contractor.

       23                      That's a change, right?

       24         A      It is in response to the Nexant requirement,

       25         and then --


                                                                    144
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2                      COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, in response

        3         to the Nexant requirement?

        4                      THE WITNESS:  Nexant requirement

        5         licensor agreements.

        6                Q     Okay.  And you're telling them, Hey,

        7         now we've got a finalized license agreement with an

        8         EPC contractor?

        9         A      So the context for this e-mail was that we

       10         already had a sheet that we were following for

       11         Nexant, so there were various different requirements

       12         they had in there, and every so often, whenever we

       13         communicated with them, simply added a column and

       14         put in what the update was.

       15                And I believe, to the best of my

       16         recollection, this sheet was updated when we signed

       17         the EPC contract to say, you know, we now have a --

       18         we've also finalized this EPC contract, and this is

       19         what is in the TKIS EPC contract with respect to the

       20         Nexant requirements.

       21                Q     The Nexant requirements of licensor

       22         agreements, right?

       23         A      Right.

       24                Q     Okay.  So if you could turn to JX-88 in

       25         your binder.

        2                      You are on this e-mail.  You're copied.

        3         It's an e-mail from Arif Dar --

        4         A      Yes.

        5                Q     -- on November 16th, 2015.

        6                      The primary recipient is Syed Ahsen

        7         Uddin.

        8                      Do you see that?

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     And it's also copying Alfred Hoffman, a

       11         number of other people, Mr. Qureshi, and also you,

       12         correct?

       13         A      Yes.

       14                Q     But Arif Dar sends this to Mr. Ahsen

       15         Uddin first, right?

       16         A      Right.

       17                Q     It's next steps MFC.

       18                      So Mr. Ahsen Uddin was a pretty

       19         important part of this -- these final days of

       20         negotiations with the TKIS EPC contract, right?

       21         A      He was, of course, part of the team.  I

       22         believe Mr. Ahsen is writing to Mr. Dar, and he is

       23         suggesting -- or discussing the possible call, and

       24         so Mr. Dar is just responding to Mr. Ahsen.

       25                Q     So Mr. Ahsen Uddin is looping in


                                                                    146
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         Mr. Dar about a conversation with TKIS?

        3         A      Yes.

        4                Q     So if you look down at Mr. -- at the

        5         e-mail that Mr. Ahsen Uddin is forwarding, it's from

        6         Alfred Hoffman at TKIS.

        7                      Did you ever interact with Mr. Hoffman?

        8         A      Yes.

        9                Q     Do you know what his role was?

       10         A      He was -- I don't know what his official

       11         title was, to be very honest, but he was the lead

       12         gentleman on the TKIS EPC effort, he was, yes.

       13                Q     And he's telling Mr. Ahsen Uddin, in

       14         the first point, "The license agreement needs to be

       15         finalized," right?

       16         A      Right.

       17                Q     The plan was to finalize the license

       18         agreement?

       19         A      Agree on the form which was attached to the

       20         EPC.

       21                Q     And the form is all of the terms that

       22         would govern the license agreement when it took

       23         effect, right?

       24         A      Yes.

       25                Q     In your role as financial consultant


                                                                    147
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         for these various EPC negotiations -- well, let me

        3         take one step back.

        4                      MFC was negotiating with TKIS and also

        5         with KBR at the same time in 2015 for EPC?

        6         A      That's right.

        7                Q     Did you do any comparisons of the two

        8         competing contracts to help MFC decide which company

        9         to choose?

       10         A      Yes.

       11                Q     Did you factor the ammonia license

       12         termination fee under the KBR license agreement into

       13         your consideration of which company to choose?

       14         A      The comparisons that I did were basically off

       15         the terms of the EPC contract themselves.  So it

       16         would be, you know, what are the liquidated damages,

       17         what are the limits of liability, et cetera, so they

       18         were specific to the terms of the EPC contracts

       19         under negotiation.

       20                Q     Okay.  You said you were thorough and

       21         you reviewed the license agreement?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     So it's -- was that ever something that

       24         you considered the termination fee in part of your

       25         calculus overall?


                                                                    148
        1                           Z. Hamid - Barron

        2         A      My analysis was more qualitative.  I wasn't

        3         crunching numbers.  Yeah.

        4                Q     Who would have been crunching numbers?

        5         A      Mr. Dar and Mr. Ausaf had other members on

        6         the team that were, you know, responsible for the

        7         state of the financial modeling, or something that

        8         they would be responsible for the number crunching.

        9                Q     You said that Fatima paid your

       10         salary --

       11         A      Yes.

       12                Q     -- for your work as a financial

       13         consultant.

       14                      MFC expended a lot of money for various

       15         services leading up -- in pursuit of the fertilizer

       16         plant project, right?

       17                      So MFC paid Nexant, did it not?

       18         A      Yes.

       19                Q     Do you know how much it paid Nexant?

       20         A      I am not -- no.

       21                Q     I mean, millions of dollars presumably?

       22         A      I couldn't give you an exact number.

       23                Q     You don't know?

       24         A      I don't know that, yeah.

       25                Q     You know that MFC paid KBR $5 million


                                                                    149
        1                              Proceedings

        2         under the TSA?

        3         A      Yes.

        4                Q     So MFC -- do you know how much money

        5         MFC has spent to date in furtherance of the Posey

        6         County fertilizer plant?

        7         A      I don't have the exact number, no.

        8                Q     Would upwards of 85 million sound

        9         plausible to you?

       10         A      I honestly wouldn't know the exact number.

       11                Q     Okay.  You don't even -- you don't have

       12         a guess.

       13         A      No.

       14                Q     But you know that it's been a lot of

       15         money?

       16         A      Yes, in the project development side, yes.

       17                      MS. BARRON:  Thank you, Miss Hamid.  I

       18         don't have anymore questions.

       19                      THE WITNESS:  Okay.

       20                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  We're going to see

       21         if Mr. Heller has any questions.

       22                      MR. HELLER:  I'm just going to confer

       23         for one moment.

       24                      We have no questions.

       25                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I have no questions


                                                                    150

        2         either.  Thank you very much.

        3                      THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  We're at 11:49.  We

        5         have two more witnesses.

        6                      Do we want to -- how long do we think

        7         we have with the next witness?  Best guess.

        8                      MR. HARRISON:  An hour or less.

        9                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  So if it's an

       10         hour or less, would you -- your preference be to

       11         take lunch now and take the witness after or to see

       12         if we can get this witness in before lunch?

       13                      MR. HARRISON:  I'm hungry, so I'd love

       14         to take, you know, a little break now, plus I think

       15         we're going to be okay on time given opposing

       16         counsel's and your accommodation of the 8:30 and how

       17         we do with Qureshi.

       18                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  And Mr. Heller?

       19                      MR. HELLER:  Yeah, I certainly have no

       20         objection to taking lunch now, if it's here.

       21                      MS. BARRON:  Let me just check on the

       22         status of the food.

       23                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  We can go off the

       24         record.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So if we can go --

        5         if everybody is all set, we'll go back on the

        6         record.

        7                      Good afternoon, Mr. Wright.

        8                      THE WITNESS:  Good afternoon to you.

        9                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Just before your

       10         counsel formally introduces you, when you're

       11         testifying today, we have a court reporter who is

       12         going to be taking down everything that you say, so

       13         it's very important that you respond verbally, not

       14         use gestures when your responding because that won't

       15         be recorded.

       16                      THE WITNESS:  Okay.

       17                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  If you don't

       18         understand a question, you can ask for it to be

       19         repeated or rephrased.  It will be most helpful if

       20         you try and answer questions as directly as possible

       21         when they're asked.

       22                      Do you understand that?

       23                      THE WITNESS:  Uh-huh.  I do.

       24                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Do you affirm that

       25         the testimony you're about to give shall be truthful


                                                                    152
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         and do you commit to testify truthfully?

        3                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you.

        5         J A M E S    L E S L I E    W R I G H T, being first

        6         duly affirmed by the Notary, testifies as follows:

        7         EXAMINATION

        8         BY MR. HELLER:

        9                Q     Okay.  Good afternoon.

       10                      Can you state your full name for the

       11         record?

       12         A      My name is James Leslie Wright.

       13                Q     And are you known by any other names?

       14         A      I just typically go by my middle name, but

       15         shorten it to "Les."

       16                Q     Okay.  So what is your present

       17         occupation?

       18         A      So I'm the interim president and CEO and the

       19         chief financial officer of Midwest Fertilizer

       20         Company, LLC.

       21                Q     And where do you live?

       22         A      So I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota, my

       23         residence, but I'm actually assigned to this project

       24         now, so I'm actually more resident in Indianapolis,

       25         Indiana.  So I have places of residence in both


                                                                    153

        2         places.

        3                Q     Okay.  And do you have a business

        4         address as well?

        5         A      I do.

        6                Q     Where is that?

        7         A      So it's Suite 1010, 101 West Ohio,

        8         Indianapolis, Indiana, 46204.

        9                Q     Okay.  Now, do you have in front of you

       10         a copy of your witness statement?

       11         A      I do.

       12                Q     Okay.  Is that a true and correct copy

       13         of your witness statement?

       14         A      It sure looks like it.

       15                Q     Okay.  And is that -- are the

       16         statements made therein true and correct to the best

       17         of your knowledge?

       18         A      True and correct to the best of my knowledge.

       19                      MR. HELLER:  Okay.  Thank you.

       21         EXAMINATION

       22         BY MR. HARRISON:

       23                Q     Mr. Wright, I came straight here after

       24         having a bite of lunch and didn't have an

       25         opportunity to say hello.


                                                                    154
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         A      Hello to you.

        3                Q     Hello.

        4         A      Hello.

        5                Q     According to paragraph 3 of your

        6         witness statement, you have been MFC's interim

        7         president and CEO since 2016.

        8                      That is your position today?

        9         A      That's correct.

       10                Q     When in 2016 did you assume that

       11         position?

       12         A      July the 1st.

       13                Q     You started working at MFC as its CFO

       14         in 2013?

       15         A      Correct.

       16                Q     When was that?

       17         A      That was November the 18th, 2013.

       18                Q     Before that date, did you have any

       19         employment, consulting or otherwise, with MFC or the

       20         Fatima Group?

       21         A      I did not.

       22                Q     All right.  So you understand that you

       23         joined MFC nearly eight days after MFC had signed

       24         the license agreement with KBR at issue in this

       25         case?


                                                                    155
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         A      That's correct.

        3                Q     It must be obvious, but if you don't

        4         mind confirming for us, you did not have any role

        5         whatsoever in the negotiation of the license

        6         agreement at issue in this case, the termination

        7         provisions, or anything else in that regard, true?

        8         A      That's correct.

        9                Q     Do you work full-time for MFC now?

       10         A      I do.

       11                Q     What company pays your salary?

       12         A      Midwest Fertilizer Company, LLC.

       13                Q     And from where does Midwest get the

       14         money to pay your salary?

       15         A      So expenses related to my salary and other

       16         expenses and that are funded by advances from the

       17         sponsor.

       18                Q     And the sponsor is?

       19         A      The sponsor is Fatima Group.

       20                Q     What role did you have in either

       21         preparing or approving or both the public bond

       22         filings made in connection with MFC's roughly

       23         $1.28 billion bonds through Indiana?

       24         A      I was directly involved in that with a team

       25         of people.  Obviously, it's a compilation that's put


                                                                    156
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         together by many different people, but I was

        3         directly involved with them as a team in that and

        4         preparing this offering memoranda.

        5                Q     All right.  You are familiar then with

        6         the public bond.  We've seen an image of a few

        7         sections, but you're familiar with the public bond

        8         filings?

        9         A      I am, yes.

       10                Q     You had a role in them, along with

       11         others --

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     -- and you can confirm the information

       14         in there is accurate to the best of your knowledge?

       15         A      I can.

       16                Q     And you do?

       17         A      Thank you.

       18                Q     During your, I think, six-year now

       19         tenure -- not quite six years --

       20         A      Closer.

       21                Q     Closer.

       22                      During your nearly six-year tenure at

       23         MFC from 2013, mid November, through today, how many

       24         times have you met in person with people from KBR?

       25         A      I don't think I've met with anybody from KBR


                                                                    157
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         directly.

        3                Q     How many phone calls directly or by

        4         participating in a teleconference have you had with

        5         KBR?

        6         A      I would say probably a handful to like maybe,

        7         I don't know, 10, 12 times, and that related to

        8         various matters and that's between KBR and MFC.

        9                Q     Did you have any phone calls that were

       10         directly you as the only person from the MFC side

       11         with KBR?

       12         A      Yeah, those would have all been to KBR.

       13                Q     Okay.  You had phone calls where you

       14         were the only person on the phone --

       15         A      Correct.

       16                Q     -- for the MFC side?

       17         A      Correct.

       18                Q     And with whom did you speak?

       19         A      I spoke to -- I was talking a couple -- one

       20         or two times a month with Haresh Divanji, and also

       21         with a lady Heather Meidiger.

       22                      COURT REPORTER:  Heather --

       23                      THE WITNESS:  Meidiger,

       24         M-E-I-D-I-G-E-R.

       25                Q     In what time period did these phone


                                                                    158
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         calls take place?

        3         A      It was in 2015.  I can't exactly recall if it

        4         was from 2016, but somewhere in 2015.

        5                Q     My understanding is that those phone

        6         calls in which you participated were in connection

        7         with the negotiation of what became the August 2015

        8         technical services agreement between KBR and MFC.

        9                      Is that also your understanding?

       10         A      That would be correct.

       11                Q     Okay.  Were you on any of the phone

       12         calls I believe in late April and mid May, and at

       13         other times, where the MFC side asked KBR to waive

       14         its entitlement to the $2.85 million termination fee

       15         under the license agreement in connection with these

       16         TSA negotiations?

       17         A      No, I was not.

       18                Q     Are you aware as you sit here today

       19         that some of your colleagues at MFC asked KBR to

       20         waive its entitlement to the $2.85 million

       21         termination fee?

       22         A      My understanding is from the documents that's

       23         occurred.

       24                Q     Okay.  Back at the time, let's call it

       25         in the year of 2015, were you aware of that, or have


                                                                    159
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         you become subsequently aware in reviewing documents

        3         for this testimony?

        4         A      I was subsequently aware.

        5                Q     In witness statement paragraph 5, you

        6         say that you are a chartered accountant --

        7         A      Yes.

        8                Q     -- and have been since 1982?

        9         A      Uh-huh.

       10                Q     That is a Canadian designation?

       11         A      Yes, it is.

       12                Q     It is the analog, I believe, to the

       13         certified public accountant, the CPA designation, in

       14         the United States?

       15         A      Yes, that would be an equivalent.

       16                Q     Have you ever taken or passed the

       17         uniform CPA exam in the U.S.?

       18         A      I have not.

       19                Q     Are you a CPA?

       20         A      I am not.

       21                Q     Do you have any accounting

       22         certification or license recognized in the United

       23         States?

       24         A      Not like as a certified -- as a certified

       25         public accountant.  I do -- I do use my chartered


                                                                    160
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         accountant designation in the United States.

        3                Q     In February 2017, just -- I want to

        4         make sure we're together, that's why I speak so

        5         slowly.

        6                      I'm skipping ahead two years to 2017.

        7         A      Okay.

        8                Q     So in February 2017 -- and this is

        9         after TKIS had just two months earlier terminated

       10         its EPC contract with your company.

       11                      Are you with me?

       12         A      Yes.

       13                Q     Was MFC, in fact, again working

       14         collaboratively with TKIS on a new EPC contract?

       15         A      I do not know.  I'm not aware of that; not at

       16         the time.

       17                Q     Well, let me, if I could, show you what

       18         I'm going to mark as Claimants demonstrative Exhibit

       19         No. 3.

       20                      And I'll put it on the screen for all

       21         of us to see.

       22                      This is a news article, or press

       23         release -- or I think actually, more accurately,

       24         it's a news article based on a press release from

       25         the Courier & Press.


                                                                    161
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2                      Are you familiar with the Courier &

        3         Press?

        4         A      I am.

        5                Q     Can you tell us what that is?

        6         A      It's Evansville Courier & Press.  It's the

        7         local newspaper in Evansville, Indiana.

        8                Q     Is that in Posey County?

        9         A      Yeah, I'm not -- not in Posey County, no.

       10                Q     Nearby?

       11         A      Nearby.

       12                Q     And I'm curious, because it quotes you

       13         here in an article published at 3:39 p.m.,

       14         February 15, 2017, just two months after TKIS had

       15         terminated the EPC contract, updated a year later,

       16         okay?

       17         A      Right.

       18                Q     And it quotes you as saying, quote:

       19                      "'We are working collaboratively with

       20         TKIS on a new EPC contract and continue to develop

       21         other aspects of the project concurrently so that it

       22         can close quickly when the EPC contract is

       23         finalized,' said Les Wright, interim president and

       24         CEO of Midwest Fertilizer, in an emailed statement."

       25                      Do you see that?


                                                                    162
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         A      Right.

        3                Q     Do you remember this?

        4         A      I do, actually.  And I think I misspoke.  I

        5         do remember the article now.

        6                I just -- in terms of the timing, I'm just a

        7         little fuzzy on the timing.

        8                Q     Now, I've seen a lot of documents in

        9         this case, and God bless her, Elisha Barron has seen

       10         more than I have, but I get into the documents, too.

       11         I haven't seen this e-mail from you about this

       12         project and about the TKIS.

       13                      Do you remember giving that to your

       14         lawyers to produce in this case, or at least to

       15         review?

       16         A      I don't recall.  I just don't recall.

       17                Q     Okay.  Well, is this -- and you

       18         remember the e-mail, you're fuzzy on the timing --

       19         A      Yes.

       20                Q     -- but you did, in fact, send an

       21         e-mail.  This is an accurate quote from your e-mail,

       22         as best you understand it?

       23         A      You know, I'm sorry, I truly don't recall.  I

       24         don't.

       25                Q     Okay.  Well, let me just ask it this


                                                                    163
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         way:  Did you read your quote in the paper when it

        3         came out.

        4         A      I would have read that, I guaranty you, yes.

        5                Q     And did you call them and say, You got

        6         this wrong?

        7         A      No.

        8                Q     Do you think they got it wrong or you

        9         just don't remember the timing?

       10         A      I just don't remember the timely of that, if

       11         it's...

       12                Q     All right.  Now here again, as of mid

       13         February 2017, your e-mailed quote, as quoted in the

       14         paper, continues, quote:

       15                      "'Midwest Fertilizer Co. remains

       16         confident the Indiana fertilizer manufacturing plant

       17         will be successful and we are very appreciative this

       18         of the strong support we have received from the

       19         Posey County community,'" end quote.

       20                      Is this your writing, does this sound

       21         like your writing or did somebody write this for

       22         you?

       23         A      It would be my writing in conjunction

       24         probably with our public affairs person.

       25                Q     Okay.  Do you now remember that we had


                                                                    164
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         this helpful document to center us in time frame

        3         that just a matter of weeks, really, after TKIS

        4         terminated the January 16, 2016 EPC contract with

        5         MFC, you all were, as you wrote, collaboratively

        6         working with TKIS on a new EPC contract.

        7                      Do you remember that?

        8         A      Yes.

        9                Q     And what became of that negotiation?

       10         A      So -- I mean, the negotiations continued, and

       11         I'm just -- I am somewhat fuzzy on that in terms

       12         of -- I just -- I'm sorry, I just don't recall on

       13         that what -- what transpired after.

       14                Q     All right, sir.

       15                      Now, in paragraph 9 of your witness

       16         statement, you mention that KBR -- we're not talking

       17         about TKIS now -- KBR and MFC discussed the 2013

       18         license agreement where they negotiated their 2015

       19         TSA agreement.

       20                      Did you review in preparing for your

       21         testimony in this dispute or did you otherwise

       22         review the internal documents at MFC showing and

       23         discussing MFC's effort to get KBR to waive

       24         Section 11.4's termination for convenience fee?

       25         A      You're asking -- I'm sorry.  Can you just


                                                                    165
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         repeat that?

        3                Q     Yeah.

        4                      I'd like to know whether you have taken

        5         it upon yourself or if anyone has shown you, really,

        6         at any time, including today, the e-mails within MFC

        7         or the e-mails exchanged with KBR discussing MFC's

        8         repeated request that KBR waive the termination fee?

        9         A      Yeah, I've seen documents.  I've seen

       10         documents in the review in preparation for this.

       11                Q     All right.  Now, have you asked any of

       12         the MFC or Fatima Group people who were involved in

       13         the discussions about that waiver with KBR what they

       14         said or what was said in response?

       15         A      Not to a great detail.  No.

       16                Q     You are aware that KBR refused MFC's

       17         request to waive Section 11.4's termination fee?

       18         A      I have seen that in the documents.

       19                Q     Did you know that after KBR sent an

       20         invoice and a letter in late January 2016 for this

       21         $2.85 million termination fee that there were

       22         discussions, meetings, and presentations within MFC

       23         and the Fatima Group about how to respond to that

       24         invoice?

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                    166
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2                Q     Were you a party to those discussions?

        3         A      To some of them, yes.

        4                Q     Well --

        5         A      It's -- I certainly was aware of it.

        6                Q     Okay.  Did you actually attend any

        7         in-person meetings with anyone else from MFC or the

        8         Fatima Group to discuss the response to KBR's

        9         $2.85 million invoice or letters?

       10         A      Not -- not in person, no.

       11                Q     Did you participate -- did you

       12         participate on any video conferences on that topic?

       13         A      No.

       14                Q     Did you participate in any telephone

       15         calls on that topic?

       16         A      There may have been.  There may have been

       17         some.

       18                Q     Do you have a specific recollection?

       19         A      I don't have -- no.  I have -- it's a -- I

       20         don't have a specific recollection.  It sounds very

       21         familiar though.  I mean...

       22                Q     Do you remember on these phone calls

       23         that you may or may not have participated in -- and

       24         I don't mean that in a derogatory way.  I just mean

       25         you don't have a specific recollection, and I'm


                                                                    167
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         recognizing that.

        3         A      Uh-huh.

        4                Q     Do you remember offering your own

        5         opinion about how MFC should respond?

        6         A      No, no.

        7                Q     All right.  Have you ever met Mr. Syed

        8         Ahsen Uddin?

        9         A      Yes.

       10                Q     Where have you met him?

       11         A      I've met him in many -- at many points in the

       12         project, and that's when he has traveled here to the

       13         United States.

       14                Q     Have you traveled to Lahore or anywhere

       15         else in Pakistan?

       16         A      I have not.

       17                Q     Have you ever had any discussion with

       18         Mr. Uddin about his understanding of the meaning of

       19         the termination provisions in the license agreement?

       20         A      I have not.

       21                Q     What about with Mr. Arif Dar?

       22         A      I have not.

       23                Q     Have you had any discussions with

       24         anyone who was involved in the negotiation of the

       25         termination provisions in the license agreement?


                                                                    168
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2         A      Some conversations with counsel.

        3                Q     Just lawyers?

        4         A      Yes.

        5                Q     Which lawyers?

        6         A      Would have been with Pillsbury.

        7                Q     Pillsbury.  Pillsbury wasn't involved,

        8         were they, in -- or were they?  You tell me.

        9                      Was Pillsbury involved in advising MFC

       10         in the termination provisions in the November 2013

       11         license agreement.

       12         A      In the writing of some of the material, yes.

       13                Q     Well, I'm sorry, just what does that

       14         mean?

       15         A      In the writing of the letters, the responses.

       16                Q     Oh, okay.  I'm earlier in time.

       17                      In negotiating the November 2013

       18         license agreement and its termination provisions,

       19         are you saying that --

       20         A      No.  I thought you were talking about these

       21         letters related to this more recent date.

       22                Q     Okay.  Just to finish, so it's clear,

       23         you're not saying Pillsbury was involved in the 2013

       24         negotiations?

       25         A      I am not.


                                                                    169
        1                           J. Wright - Heller

        2                Q     So you have not discussed with anyone

        3         who was involved in negotiating the 2013 license

        4         agreement or its termination provisions their

        5         purpose, intent, or meaning, true?

        6         A      Yes.

        7                Q     In MFC's, I think, March 2019

        8         bond-related filing, MFC publicly reports that the

        9         IRS audit issue, which you mentioned in your witness

       10         statement --

       11         A      Yes.

       12                Q     -- has been resolved.

       13                      Is it true that the IRS audit issue,

       14         which had been something of an external bump in the

       15         road along completion of this project, that has been

       16         resolved?

       17         A      That's correct, it has been resolved.

       18                Q     Were you a participant in the -- some

       19         of the negotiations that led to the resolution?

       20         A      I was.

       21                Q     Is MFC satisfied with the resolution of

       22         this IRS audit issue?

       23         A      Yes, we are satisfied.

       24                Q     Do you have faith that the project in

       25         Posey County will reach financial close and commence


                                                                    170
        1                              Proceedings

        2         at some point in the hopefully near future?

        3         A      I'm optimistic that it will close.  I can't

        4         predict with certainty that it will close.

        5                Q     It's true, of course, that MFC has not

        6         canceled the project, right?

        7         A      Correct.

        8                Q     MFC did not cancel the project in 2014,

        9         '15, '16, '17, and '18, or even as we sit here today

       10         in September 2019, true?

       11         A      True.

       12                Q     MFC is still pursuing the project,

       13         true?

       14         A      True.

       15                      MR. HARRISON:  Thanks for your time.

       16                      THE WITNESS:  Okay.

       17                      MR. HELLER:  We have no questions, and

       18         the only problem we have is that Mr. Kulakowski

       19         isn't due here until 2 o'clock.

       20                      I can try calling him and see if he can

       21         get here earlier.

       22                      MR. HARRISON:  I can weigh in on this.

       23         That's okay.  He's not going to cause us to be late,

       24         and I'm happy to use the time to prepare closing, as

       25         I suggest counsel opposite is.


                                                                    171
        1                              Proceedings

        2                      We don't object to that, I guess, is my

        3         point.

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Yeah, I mean, I --

        5         it's unfortunate.  I would have expected all the

        6         witnesses to be lined up.

        7                      So we're going to have to take a break

        8         until -- until he's ready, and let's use the time to

        9         prepare for the closing and take that into account

       10         when we take a break after the next witness.

       11                      So we can go off the record.

       12                      MR. HARRISON:  One more thing on the

       13         record, if I could.

       14                      I wanted to tender Claimant

       15         Demonstrative No. 3 as soon as I have a stapler to

       16         staple the two-page document.

       17                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So, Mr. Heller, if

       18         we all retire to our respective camps, can you let

       19         us know when he gets here?

       20                      MR. HELLER:  Of course, and I suspect

       21         he'll be here before 2 o'clock.

       22                      (Recess taken at 1:20 p.m. and ended.

       23                      at 1:29 p.m.)

       24                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  We are back on the

       25         record.


                                                                    172
        1                              Proceedings

        2                      So let's go back on the record, please.

        3                      Good afternoon, Mr. Kulakowski.

        4                      THE WITNESS:  Okay.

        5                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So your testimony

        6         this afternoon is going to be transcribed by our

        7         court reporter, and that means that you have to

        8         answer verbally in response to questions, not just

        9         gesture, because it has to be recorded.

       10                      Do you understand that?

       11                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

       12                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  If you're asked a

       13         question by one of the attorneys and you don't

       14         understand, you can ask for it to be -- to be

       15         rephrased, or asked -- have the question asked

       16         again.  What would be most helpful is if you can try

       17         and answer the questions you're asked as directly as

       18         possible.

       19                      Do you understand that?

       20                      THE WITNESS:  Yes.

       21                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  Do you affirm

       22         that the testimony you're about to give shall be

       23         truthful and do you commit to testify truthfully?

       24                      THE WITNESS:  I do.  Thank you.

       25         W A L T E R    J.    K U L A K O W S K I, being first


                                                                    173

        4         EXAMINATION

       21         and correct as you sit here today?

       22         A      Yes.

       23                Q     And it is your complete witness

        3         EXAMINATION

        4         BY MS. BARRON:

        5                Q     Good afternoon, Mr. Kulakowski.

        6                      You have no professional relationship

        7         with KBR, correct?

        8         A      That's correct.

        9                Q     Your witness statement doesn't

       10         reference a single interaction with KBR, correct?

       11         A      That's correct.

       12                Q     Have you ever had any interactions with

       13         KBR?

       14         A      I may have.

       15                Q     You don't remember?

       16         A      I don't remember specifically.

       17                Q     Did you have any role in negotiating

       18         the November 5th, 2013 ammonia technology license

       19         agreement between MFC and KBR?

       20         A      No.

       21                Q     You say that MFC hired Guggenheim

       22         Securities, your former -- I believe it's your

       23         former employer?

       24         A      Yes.

       25                Q     You left Guggenheim when?


                                                                    175
        1                         W. Kulakowski - Barron

        2         A      2015.

        3                Q     Okay.  So MFC hired Guggenheim as its

        4         underwriter in connection with the proposed

        5         fertilizer production facility in Posey County,

        6         Indiana.

        7                      When did MFC hire Guggenheim?

        8         A      Late 2012, we had met with the company -- in

        9         the middle of Hurricane Sandy.  We talked about a

       10         variety of things.  We were engaged shortly

       11         thereafter.

       12                Q     Late 2012, so shortly after MFC, the

       13         entity, came into existence, they hired Guggenheim?

       14         A      I don't know when MFC was formed, but yes,

       15         they hired us at that time.

       16                Q     Is Guggenheim still employed by MFC?

       17         A      No.

       18                Q     When did that end?

       19         A      As I understand, our role, when I left

       20         Guggenheim, we no longer -- Guggenheim was no longer

       21         working with MFC.

       22                Q     So you -- the entire time the companies

       23         had a relationship you were still employed at

       24         Guggenheim?

       25         A      Yes.


                                                                    176
        1                              Proceedings

        2                Q     Did MFC pay Guggenheim for its

        3         services?

        4         A      Yes.

        5                Q     How much?

        6         A      It varied every single deal.  All those were

        7         disclosed publicly.  Every time we remarketed the

        8         transaction, we were paid a fee.  It was essentially

        9         a nominal fee, probably five figures, each time we

       10         rolled the deal, which was every six months,

       11         roughly.

       12                Q     Okay.  And for how many of those six

       13         months?

       14         A      I think we rolled six times.

       15                Q     So six times some five figure --

       16         A      $50,000, say, 200, $300,000-ish, over that

       17         time frame.

       18                      MS. BARRON:  Okay.  Thank you.  I have

       19         no further questions.

       20                      MR. HELLER:  We, of course, have no

       21         questions.

       22                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you for your

       23         time, Mr. Kulakowski.

       24                      THE WITNESS:  Is that it?  Am I done?

       25                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Have a cookie.


                                                                    177
        1                              Proceedings

        2                      THE WITNESS:  That's a great reward.

        3         That's it.  I'm done?

        4                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  That's it.  Thank

        5         you very much.  We appreciate your time.

        6                      MR. HARRISON:  We want litigation to be

        7         a positive experience.

        8                      THE WITNESS:  Perfect.  Perfect.  You

        9         guys are great fun.  Let's do this again.

       10                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So let's -- let's

       11         just go off the record for a second?  Can we get the

       12         timekeepers to tally the totals, and then we'll go

       13         back on the record and you can report that for the

       14         reporter, and then we'll take our break.

       15                      (Recess taken at 1:34 p.m. and ended

       16                      at 1:35 p.m.)

       17                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Let's go back on the

       18         record, please, Terry.

       19                      Do we have a report on how much time

       20         has been spent by each side?

       21                      And what is that?

       22                      MS. ZHOU:  The Claimant has spent 3

       23         hours and 29 minutes, and the Respondent has spent 6

       24         hours and 20 minutes.

       25                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you.  Okay.


                                                                    178
        1                              Proceedings

        2         Let's take a break until 2:35, and then we'll come

        3         back for closing.

        4                      Thank you.

        5                      MR. HARRISON:  Thank you.

        6                (Recess taken at 1:35 p.m. and ended at 2:39

        7                p.m.)

        8                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  I think we're

        9         ready to go back on.  So we're ready to proceed with

       10         closing arguments.  I think by agreement of the

       11         parties there are seven hours, 7.25 hours per party.

       12         Claimant was at six hours -- sorry, respondent was

       13         at six hours and 20 minutes, so 55 minutes for

       14         your -- up to 55 minutes for your presentation.

       15                      MR. HELLER:  Sixty-five minutes.

       16                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Is that --

       17                      MS. ZHOU:  Six hours and 20 minutes

       18         that's seven hours.

       19                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  .25?  So I think

       20         it's 55 minutes.

       21                      MR. HELLER:  That's fine.

       22                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I'm pretty sure I

       23         was going to be wrong there, but up to 55 minutes,

       24         and, well, since you're at three hours and 25

       25         minutes to the claimant, there's more than --


                                                                    179
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2                      MR. HARRISON:  Get comfortable.

        3                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  All right.  With

        4         that the floor is yours, Mr. Harrison.

        5                      MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Madame

        6         Arbitrator, and thank you to everyone for

        7         participating in this process.  I do mean it.  I try

        8         a lot of cases and this was pleasant, and it was

        9         nice to see the witnesses and the lawyers being so

       10         pleasant to each other.  So to the other side our

       11         adversaries, thank you.

       12                      The parties have agreed and so

       13         represented to you that this is a straightforward,

       14         breach of contract case, and it has been something

       15         of a curiosity to us, as I suspect the questioning

       16         has been clear, the other side's choices of the

       17         witnesses to present as their testimonial evidence

       18         in this case.  Pleasant people to be sure, but not

       19         people who were involved in the matters that seem

       20         most germane to a breach of a contract case where

       21         the parties are attempting to put forward different

       22         interpretations of the contract.

       23                      KBR, of course, believes that the plain

       24         language of the contract, the unambiguous language

       25         indicates that MFC under Section 11.4 of the license


                                                                    180
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         agreement owes $2.85 million, has not paid it, and,

        3         therefore, is in breach.

        4                      MFC, for its part, appears to have

        5         developed over time and with assistance of counsel,

        6         some creative arguments to try to argue that Section

        7         11.4's termination fee does not apply.  And so if

        8         the Arbitrator is persuaded that there are two

        9         reasonable interpretations here, we think plain

       10         language does not allow that and it's plain that

       11         11.4 applies, but if there is a perceived ambiguity,

       12         then under New York law, extrinsic evidence comes to

       13         bear, and it's in that regard that the quality of

       14         the evidence, not just the quantity, though the

       15         quantity to be sure, but the quality of the evidence

       16         makes a difference and that difference is a

       17         difference in helping to determine what the contract

       18         means, what the parties intended, how they acted,

       19         what their conduct was under the contract, what

       20         their conduct and e-mail traffic indicates once this

       21         issue was raised, but before the actual dispute, the

       22         2015 waiver episode that we'll talk about, and then

       23         what the parties conduct was once there was a

       24         termination either in January 2016 or in March 2016

       25         of the license agreement.


                                                                    181
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2                      The extrinsic evidence demonstrates not

        3         just powerfully, but we think unequivocally that MFC

        4         breached the license agreement, not by contracting

        5         with someone else or deciding to go with another

        6         bidder, but breached the license agreement by

        7         failing and refusing to this day to pay the fee that

        8         is owed under Section 11.4.  What I thought we might

        9         do is explore some of the contract language and some

       10         of the evidence that bears on this question.

       11                      In a contract case, it's useful to

       12         begin with the contract much like Miss Barron did in

       13         the opening statement.  Here, we have a signed

       14         contract signed by Aman Ahmad of KBR who testified

       15         at some length in his witness statement and

       16         yesterday live and in person, and signed on the MFC

       17         side by Syed Ahsen Uddin, who did not testify by

       18         witness statement, did not come live, and yet is on

       19         nearly, perhaps, more documents than any other name

       20         in this case.  Certainly that's true on the MFC

       21         side.  One of the lead negotiators and he is not

       22         here to support MFC's story or to otherwise provide

       23         any testimony.  That is a curiosity.

       24                      In this breach of contract case, it is,

       25         I think, undisputed.  I know it's undisputed, we've


                                                                    182
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         had admissions on this point from MFC, that the

        3         November 2013 license agreement did not allow, it

        4         prohibited MFC from using KBR's ammonia technology

        5         with a non-KBR-approved contractor.  Including,

        6         among others, TKIS, ThyssenKrupp folks, we find that

        7         prohibition in the language of 2.1.  We find that

        8         prohibition in the language of 9.1, the assignment

        9         provision, which also, quite clearly, provides that

       10         the license agreement shall not be assigned to a

       11         competitor of KBR in the field of ammonia process

       12         technology licensing.  And the Arbitrator was able

       13         to ask the witnesses some questions about ammonia

       14         versus nitrates versus urea and different technology

       15         that can apply to different parts of the project.  I

       16         thought those questions were useful.

       17                      Here, the parties both acknowledge,

       18         more importantly, MFC acknowledges that ThyssenKrupp

       19         was a competitor, a direct competitor, not an

       20         authorized user of KBR's ammonia technology, and

       21         hence could not use KBR's technology if ThyssenKrupp

       22         is the EPC contractor.

       23                      So let's look at the plain language.

       24         There are multiple termination provisions in Section

       25         11 of the license agreement.  The three that have


                                                                    183
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         been identified here are those on the screen, 11.3,

        3         11.4, and 11.5.  We believe that 11.4, which

        4         provides owner may terminate this agreement and the

        5         engineering agreement for convenience upon payment

        6         of the 30 -- upon payment of 30 percent of the KBR

        7         license fee.  We saw in MFC's prehearing brief and

        8         we heard in MFC's opening statement this idea that

        9         MFC has the right to pick and choose which

       10         termination provision it wants to exercise.  And the

       11         notion that if MFC chooses not to pay the

       12         30 percent, the 2.85 million, then that somehow

       13         means circularly that 11.4 has not been triggered.

       14         That is not a fair reading of this agreement.  It is

       15         circular nonsense.  The notion that an obligation to

       16         pay only accrues if the party that owes it decides

       17         to pay it, that is a pure circle and it doesn't make

       18         sense and it's not the way the agreement reads.

       19                      So what MFC tries to do is shoehorn the

       20         facts of this case into either 11.3 or 11.5, and at

       21         different times MFC has promoted different

       22         provisions.  And for a period of time before MFC's

       23         lawyers got actively involved, MFC equated 11.3 and

       24         11.5 until it decided to try to draw some

       25         distinctions between the two.  Well, there are


                                                                    184
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         important distinctions.  We've explored some of that

        3         in cross examination.  One is this question of

        4         timing.  In MFC's prehearing brief, and we heard

        5         again in opening statement, and we heard a little

        6         bit with Mr. Qureshi, this notion of ripeness by

        7         that or another name, and that is it is still

        8         possible, we're told by MFC, that sometime in the

        9         future the project may be cancelled.  And if it is

       10         cancelled in the future, then MFC argues it ought to

       11         be able to escape its payment obligations.  The

       12         language of the contract doesn't allow that.  11.3

       13         speaks in terms of this project is therefore

       14         cancelled.  More on "therefore" in a moment.  11.5,

       15         the language is, and its North American project is

       16         cancelled.  So we need to look at the timing of the

       17         events at issue, at what point did MFC terminate the

       18         license agreement, so that we can look at the

       19         termination provisions and see which applies.

       20                      There's a two-month disagreement on the

       21         question of when MFC terminated the license

       22         agreement.  KBR believes that MFC terminated the

       23         license agreement on January 16, 2016, when MFC

       24         entered into its signed 100 page EPC contract with

       25         TKIS.  MFC, for its part, has taken the view that


                                                                    185
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         MFC terminated the license agreement with KBR, not

        3         in January 2016, but rather by MFC letter of

        4         March 28, 2016.  That's Exhibit 101.  There's a

        5         two-month spread there, two-and-a-half month spread.

        6         But either way, MFC had not cancelled the project at

        7         the time it terminated the license agreement.  MFC

        8         still has not cancelled the project.  And one of the

        9         germane items that MFC's current interim president

       10         and CEO and CFO offers to it, Mr. Les Wright, is

       11         that the project is continuing, even as we sit here

       12         today.  It has not been cancelled.  And, as MFC's

       13         public statements support, MFC's acting chief

       14         executive and president continue to believe in the

       15         prospects of the project.

       16                      And so looking at 11.3 and 11.5 which

       17         require at the time of termination, these are

       18         termination provisions, that the project is

       19         cancelled.  The project isn't, wasn't cancelled at

       20         the time of termination.  It's still not cancelled.

       21         11.3 and 11.5 don't apply.

       22                      We're going to talk a little bit about

       23         MFC's lawyer-driven notion of trying to distinguish

       24         between project in 11.3 and project in 11.5, but

       25         before we do that, I want to look at this language


                                                                    186
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         here, because the argument that 11.3's project

        3         doesn't actually mean The Project the way the

        4         parties in all their communications and negotiations

        5         regarded it, but rather means, as I've discussed

        6         with Mr. Qureshi, the KBR license agreement, that is

        7         empirically impossible given what the parties used

        8         for language in this agreement.

        9                      There are three dozen plus times in the

       10         KBR MFC license agreement where the license

       11         agreement is referred to as the license agreement or

       12         the agreement.  And 11.3 itself talks about and this

       13         project is therefore cancelled.  Owner may terminate

       14         this agreement without penalty or fee.  MFC's

       15         reading that this project with KBR technology which

       16         Mr. Qureshi equated with this agreement, and this

       17         agreement is therefore cancelled, owner may

       18         terminate this agreement.  It doesn't make sense and

       19         it's inconsistent with the way that the parties

       20         referred both to the agreement and to the project.

       21         It is not a reasonable reading.  And it's not one

       22         that any witness involved in the negotiations

       23         supports.

       24                      But let's talk about "therefore."

       25         Because in section 11.3, there are some important


                                                                    187
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         differences between 11.3 and 11.5 and I think the

        3         Arbitrator will remember the cross examination of

        4         Mr. Ahmad on this point where MFC's lawyer tried to

        5         suggest that the only distinction between 11.3 and

        6         11.5 was the requirement of best efforts.  11.3

        7         required MFC to use best efforts to achieve

        8         financial close by the deadline.  11.5 does not have

        9         a best efforts provision.

       10                      Well, cross examination cannot make

       11         contract language go away, it can shed light, for

       12         sure, but it doesn't make the language go away, and

       13         so here we have different language.  We have a

       14         causal element, as I discussed with Mr. Qureshi this

       15         morning, and that is for 11.3 to apply, it's not

       16         just the financial close doesn't occur prior to or

       17         by April 30, 2014.  It has to be that's the reason,

       18         because of that the project is cancelled.

       19                      Well, MFC did not cancel the project

       20         however it's defined.  The project with KBR, the

       21         project using KBR's technology, the license

       22         agreement, the overall Posey County project.

       23         However it's defined, even accepted MFC's new notion

       24         of what project means in 11.3.  The project was not

       25         cancelled because MFC didn't achieve financial close


                                                                    188
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         by April 30, 2014.  MFC didn't cancel the project or

        3         terminate the license agreement or cancel any

        4         project in any way related to this on May 1, 2014,

        5         or any time in 2014, or any time in 2015.  It only

        6         did so after and in reaction to KBR declaring that

        7         MFC had terminated the project under 11.4 by virtue

        8         of contracting with TKIS in January 2016.  It was

        9         only in reaction to that that MFC purported to

       10         cancel the project, terminate the license agreement,

       11         cancel the agreement, however you want to call it.

       12         There was no causal relationship between not getting

       13         financial close by April 30, 2004, and project

       14         cancellation, project termination, however project

       15         is defined.  11.3 does not apply.  Indeed,

       16         Mr. Qureshi testified consistently on this point

       17         with the testimony of Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Divanji and

       18         the documents, which show that after April 30, 2014,

       19         the parties continued to work together to push out

       20         the notice to proceed date, continued to deal with

       21         each other, entered into a TSA, the purpose of which

       22         was for KBR to develop an EPC binding proposal, all

       23         through the rest of 2014 and 2015.  11.3 doesn't

       24         apply by its plain language and can't because of

       25         this important difference between 11.3 and 11.5, and


                                                                    189
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         that is "and this project is therefore cancelled."

        3                      Now, 11.5 doesn't apply, plainly.  11.5

        4         unequivocally, even MFC doesn't contest it, the

        5         North American project, that's the Posey County,

        6         Indiana, project, they admit that one, and it hasn't

        7         been cancelled.  It wasn't cancelled in 2014.  It's

        8         not cancelled today.  MFC is still going after it

        9         three-and-a-half years after they admit they

       10         terminated the license agreement.  Sections 11.3 and

       11         11.5 are not available to MFC.

       12                      Mr. Qureshi and I talked about some

       13         other differences in language, for example, how 11.3

       14         uses the term "prior to April 30, 2014," and 11.5

       15         uses the term "by 30 April 2014."  Different

       16         configurations and different terms, even when right

       17         here within a couple of inches of text in a contract

       18         can still mean the same thing, different

       19         terminology, just as with project, by the way.

       20                      What's the testimony on this point?

       21         Mr. Ahmad who negotiated the contract, he tells us

       22         "project" means and always meant and was always

       23         discussed in his negotiations of the license

       24         agreement and the termination provisions in

       25         particular, the whole project, the Posey County $2

        2         billion plus project.

        3                      Mr. Qureshi tells us this morning that

        4         he formed his opinion that "project" means project

        5         using KBR's technology earlier this year in 2019

        6         with the assistance of three groups of lawyers from

        7         MFC's corporate counsel and prior counsel in this

        8         case at the Pillsbury firm, from MFC's current

        9         lawyers in this case at the Garvey firm, and from

       10         MFC's in-house lawyers all getting together and

       11         coming up with this interpretation that he's come to

       12         offer here despite his lack of involvement.  All

       13         this without talking, admits Mr. Qureshi, about the

       14         meaning of the language, without talking to the lead

       15         negotiators for MFC, Mr. Uddin and Mr. Dar.

       16                      It's a -- we shouldn't get to a

       17         credibility determination on this point under the

       18         plain language of the contract, but if we do, we're

       19         comfortable with that.  We're also comfortable

       20         because before Mr. Qureshi himself got together with

       21         the lawyers quickly and responded to KBR's

       22         January 27, 2016, letter and invoice, and KBR's

       23         February follow-up because a month had gone by,

       24         silence from MFC.  Mr. Uddin of MFC sent this

       25         March 2, 2016 e-mail, JX-593, and copies Ausaf,


                                                                    191

        2         that's Ausaf Qureshi, sends this e-mail to KBR, does

        3         not draw any distinction on project.  Mr. Uddin

        4         writes, "Without covering all of them, we note that

        5         under the license agreement, Midwest Fertilizer has

        6         no obligation to make payments associated with the

        7         license in the event our project does not proceed.

        8         At this point, we have not yet closed the financing

        9         for our project."  No distinction is made here.  No

       10         notion the project means anything other than the

       11         Posey County project.  That's what Mr. Uddin wrote.

       12                      So what is the attempted rewrite?  The

       13         attempted rewrite that we've seen in this case from

       14         MFC is to take 11.3's "this project," and to say

       15         this project isn't really this project, it's the

       16         project incorporating the KBR technology.  That's

       17         the formulation that we see in Mr. Qureshi's Exhibit

       18         101, the March 28, 2016, letter in which they

       19         purport to terminate under 11.3, this provision.

       20                      Well, that's, of course, not what the

       21         language says.  That's a lot of language to read

       22         into this.  Here is the letter from which the

       23         language comes.  This is Mr. Qureshi's writing,

       24         Exhibit 101 that I just mentioned.  New York law

       25         really doesn't tolerate, I mean, this is black

        2         letter law nationwide, but New York law in

        3         particular does not allow parties to rewrite the

        4         plain language of the contract.  You can't ignore

        5         the language of the contract.  You can't try to look

        6         to extrinsic evidence first and then try to back in

        7         to some rewritten contract language.  Extrinsic

        8         evidence has a role after looking at the plain

        9         language of the contract to help with the

       10         interpretation, if necessary.  That's not what MFC's

       11         doing.  We love the extrinsic language, the

       12         extrinsic evidence here to the extent there is any

       13         need to interpret the contract or the decide between

       14         competing interpretations.  But what MFC is trying

       15         to do, and expressly so, I mean, in writing, is

       16         rewrite the language of the contract.  That is

       17         impermissible.  So why then do we have some

       18         different language?  Why do we have "prior to"

       19         versus "by"?  Why do we have "April 30, 2014,"

       20         versus "30 April 2014?"  Why do we have "project"

       21         versus "North American project?"  What we do know is

       22         these are different provisions, negotiated and

       23         written at different times.  Section 11.3 and 11.4

       24         were negotiated months, half a year before Section

       25         11.5 is proposed one day before the November 5,


                                                                    193

        2         2013, contract is signed in this three-day

        3         negotiating session.  Mr. Ahmad testifies without

        4         contradiction, that it was the day before, on

        5         November 4, 2015 [sic], that MFC proposes the

        6         language and KBR accepted it.  But that's an

        7         explanation for having these three differences in

        8         the language, they are not duplicative, they are not

        9         superfluous.  There are meaningful differences in

       10         the language, the best efforts, and the causal

       11         because "therefore" language.

       12                      So having looked at the key contract

       13         language itself, let's do explore the extrinsic

       14         evidence.

       15                First, how did Section 11.4 come to pass?

       16         Well, we have testimony in this case from Mr. Aman

       17         Ahmad who lived and breathed this negotiation and

       18         who was involved in the proposing of the language.

       19         There is this three-day time period in June 21, 22,

       20         23, 2013, months before the final agreement is

       21         signed where KBR proposes this language.  And Syed

       22         Ahsen Uddin on June 21, 2013, in Exhibit 8

       23         acknowledges this.  He writes, this is an excerpt,

       24         "a new clause of termination has been introduced by

       25         KBR where they demand 50 percent of license fee, if


                                                                    194
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         willful termination is exercised by MFC before

        3         notice to proceed/financial close.  And that notice

        4         to proceed/financial close we heard from Mr. Qureshi

        5         as a practical matter, these are same-day events.

        6         The same day Mr. Uddin writes to others, including

        7         Mr. Dar, and says:  On the clause of willful

        8         termination of contracts by MFC before notice to

        9         proceed, NTP, KBR has demanded 50 percent of the

       10         license fee yesterday.  Today we have negotiated and

       11         reduced that value to 30 percent.  This happened in

       12         a matter of three days from request to final

       13         language.  We think this is fair value and should be

       14         accepted by us.  Mr. Uddin did not come here or

       15         provide testimony telling us what he meant by that,

       16         though we do have a mathematically accurate

       17         suggestion from Mr. Qureshi that all Mr. Uddin was

       18         saying was that 30 percent is less than 50 percent.

       19         That is hearsay.  That is incompetent evidence.  It

       20         is not consistent with the writing or the

       21         negotiation.  It is not consistent with the idea of

       22         making a recommendation.  We think this is fair

       23         value and should be accepted by us.  That's not:

       24         This is lower than 50 percent so let's do it.

       25         That's fair value.  That's fair.  This is a


                                                                    195

        2         negotiation.  It was a bargain for exchange.  The

        3         way this came about was MFC kept pushing out further

        4         into time the notice to proceed day.  So if the

        5         contract signed in November 2013 and the notice to

        6         proceed date is what MFC had originally represented

        7         in January of 2014, that's one thing.  But going out

        8         months farther to March and then to April 30, 2014,

        9         which we find in the actual contract, you're now

       10         talking about several month's worth of substantial

       11         work before the expected notice to proceed day.  In

       12         fact, of course, notice to proceed kept getting

       13         pushed out and KBR did the better part of three

       14         years of work without compensation as testified at

       15         length by Mr. Ahmad.

       16                What does our negotiator say about the

       17         negotiations?  He says:  Look, MFC's negotiator

       18         Uddin agreed that the termination fee would apply in

       19         the precise situation that we have here.  The

       20         license agreement was terminated by MFC while --

       21         with KBR while the project was still alive.  No

       22         pushback from MFC.  The Arbitrator asked a few

       23         questions about this.  No pushback from MFC about

       24         11.4 beyond the percentage.  And that, of course, is

       25         borne out again in a June 21, 2013, writing from


                                                                    196

        2         Mr. Uddin who writes to Aman Ahmad of KBR.  He's

        3         listing items on the watch.  There are a number of

        4         negotiating items, obviously, in this license

        5         agreement, and one is the new clause of termination

        6         has been introduced where the demand is 50 percent

        7         of license fee, if willful termination is exercised

        8         by MFC before notice to proceed.  We're contesting

        9         the percentage.  Mr. Ahmad testified Mr. Uddin got

       10         it, said he understood, expected the request, and

       11         agreed to it, just negotiated the percentage.

       12         Today, same day.  And so what do we have?  I think

       13         this is actually attached to a June 21 e-mail.  We

       14         have:  Owner may terminate this agreement and the

       15         engineering agreement for convenience upon payment

       16         of 50 percent, and the 50 percent has a little

       17         comment bubble that says "for commercial

       18         discussion."  So they discuss, negotiate same day

       19         just as Mr. Uddin said they would, just as Mr. Ahmad

       20         testified happened, come to 30 percent.  The parties

       21         agree.  It's fair value.  Now, when MFC's lawyer

       22         questioned Mr. Ahmad about the writings from MFC

       23         acknowledging that Section 11.4 applies if MFC

       24         contracts, said where is it in writing that you told

       25         MFC if MFC contracts to use a competitor's


                                                                    197
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         technology in Section 11.4's termination, fee kicks

        3         in?  Where is that exact language?  Mr. Ahmad

        4         testified without contradiction because we have no

        5         witness who is involved from the MFC side, that

        6         Mr. Uddin and Mr. Dar discussed and agreed this was

        7         precisely the purpose of Section 11.4.  But in

        8         asking and cross examining Mr. Ahmad, I mean, it's

        9         one thing when you on the spot under oath come up

       10         with some document that reflects this, of course the

       11         lawyer didn't show JX-5, which is a same day,

       12         admittedly internal KBR e-mail about this

       13         discussion.  So June 20, 2013, remember, these folks

       14         are a world apart, so there's sort of these

       15         June 20/21 could be the same day over the time

       16         horizon.  We have this e-mail from Bryan Blades at

       17         KBR who Mr. Ahmad testified was on the phone call --

       18         excuse me, in the meeting where this was first

       19         raised.  And he explains why.  The notice to proceed

       20         had hard stop sunset date, which KBR had initially

       21         proposed to be January 31, 2014.  It was extended to

       22         March 31, 2014, at the client's, at MFC's

       23         insistence.  We know that by the time November

       24         rolled around, another month had been tacked onto

       25         the that.  So what's the bargain for exchange?  In


                                                                    198
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         exchange for this extension, the client committed to

        3         paying a convenience termination fee payable for any

        4         reason other than failure of financing of some

        5         percentage of the license fee.  The current KBR

        6         proposal is that the client pay 50 percent of the

        7         license fee for such termination.  We insisted upon

        8         this provision to penalize the client should it

        9         attempt to work with a competitor to KBR.  We'll

       10         talk about penalty shortly.  Right now we're talking

       11         about intent, purpose, meaning, and shared

       12         understanding.  And this is a contemporaneous

       13         writing about the bargained-for exchange that

       14         resulted in 11.4.  JX-5.

       15                But MFC's lawyer persisted on cross

       16         examination.  You don't have any confirmation, the

       17         question goes, that MFC shared your understanding.

       18         Well, Mr. Ahmad testifies, except for I was there.

       19         He lived and breathed this.  He negotiated with

       20         Misters Uddin and Dar, who, for strategic reasons,

       21         MFC chose not to bring, and except for the

       22         contemporaneous writings within MFC that support and

       23         in no way contradict or even cast doubt on

       24         Mr. Ahmad's testimony.  These are they.  Mr. Uddin

       25         is still at MFC, an executive.  Mr. Dar is still on

        2         friendly relations, left on good terms with the

        3         folks at MFC, Mr. Qureshi concluded.  We hear

        4         nothing from them.  It's crickets.  Why was this a

        5         mistake?  This was a strategic decision, stunning

        6         testimony from Mr. Qureshi.  This was a strategic,

        7         high level, all the way up to the chairman of the

        8         organization, decision by MFC not to bring you any

        9         testimony from the four human beings on MFC's side

       10         who were involved in negotiating the license

       11         agreement at large and the termination provisions,

       12         and 11.4 in particular.  They know who they are over

       13         at MFC and they chose to bring you nothing from

       14         them.

       15                May 16, 2015, we're leaping ahead in time to

       16         a time period when MFC and KBR were negotiating the

       17         2015 TSA for KBR to come up with a firm, fixed

       18         proposal to do all the EPC work.  I'm going to talk

       19         a little more about the waiver episode, but this is

       20         in the middle of the waiver episode where MFC asked

       21         KBR to waive Section 11.4's termination fee.  And

       22         David Zelinski of KBR asked Farhan Mujib of KBR:

       23         What are they asking for?  What in particular is MFC

       24         asking?  And in this contemporaneous writing,

       25         Mr. Farhan Mujib says they, MFC, wanted T & C,


                                                                    200
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         that's Haresh Divanji's group at KBR.  They wanted

        3         KBR T & C to withdraw there's entitlement of

        4         termination payment signed under license agreement

        5         should they, MFC, decide to select another ammonia

        6         licensor for the project.  That's the

        7         contemporaneous what MFC just asked KBR to do.  It's

        8         not a writing with MFC, I'll give you that, but it's

        9         contemporaneous writing about what MFC is asking for

       10         and one party at KBR who heard the request is

       11         contemporaneously explaining what the request just

       12         was.  That's good evidence.  And there isn't any

       13         contrary evidence from MFC.  I want to look at

       14         another point in time on this same concept, and that

       15         is MFC's lawyer asking Mr. Ahmad to identify some

       16         writing with or at MFC that indicates MFC understood

       17         using another ammonia contractor instead of KBR

       18         would trigger 11.4's termination.

       19                So let's leap ahead to February 5, 2016.

       20         This is a matter of days.  One week after KBR sent

       21         its invoice for the $2.85 million in and the

       22         accompanying letter.  Now, in questioning Mr. Ahmad,

       23         MFC's lawyer makes no mention of a document that up

       24         until about an hour ago they said he could never be

       25         shown, an outside counsel's eyes only confidential


                                                                    201
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         designation, one we couldn't tell Mr. Ahmad about or

        3         show to him in the course of this case, and one that

        4         Mr. Ahmad, of course, couldn't identify when

        5         examined and one that MFC's lawyer didn't bother to

        6         show.  Well, that document powerfully confirms what

        7         Ahmad testified, he lived and breathed and knew and

        8         agreed with MFC's lead negotiators.

        9                Exhibit 97 is this February 5, 2016,

       10         document, the attached presentation about the KBR

       11         agreements summarizing the termination clause, and

       12         it says:  The ammonia license agreement does not

       13         state any exclusivity with respect to engaging only

       14         KBR for the project, however requires 30 percent of

       15         KBR license fee, 2.85 million U.S. dollars to be

       16         made payable in case of termination.  That is

       17         powerful evidence inside of MFC that is fully

       18         consistent with Ahmad's testimony.  And, of course,

       19         again, no distinction about what "project" means

       20         between 11.3 and 11.5, and further confirmation that

       21         under either, project must be cancelled, otherwise

       22         no availability of 11.3 and 11.5.  Same document

       23         internal at MFC, now talking about the 2015 waiver

       24         request.  During negotiation of TSA, the fee waiver

       25         of other agreements was negotiated, however, was put


                                                                    202

        2         down by KBR stating those are separate agreements

        3         already signed and agreed by the parties.  KBR will

        4         not change position.  And, of course, calling this

        5         $5 million under the TSA irrelevant to this dispute.

        6         So that's pretty powerful evidence internal at KBR.

        7         But I think I was accused of coming out of my

        8         slip-on Helmet Langs earlier today when I heard an

        9         admission on my examination from Mr. Qureshi, I

       10         tried to hide my elation.  I may have uttered

       11         "perfect" or something like that.  Sometimes these

       12         excited utterances just get the better of you.  But

       13         Mr. Qureshi admitted he was not happy and was

       14         uncomfortable with Section 11.4, this termination

       15         for convenience when KBR proposed it, and he told us

       16         why.  Mr. Qureshi from the witness stand told us the

       17         reason he was not happy and uncomfortable with KBR's

       18         proposal of 11.4 and the termination fee was because

       19         it was a penalty if MFC went with another technology

       20         contractor instead of KBR.  Exactly the intention

       21         behind 11.4 that Mr. Ahmad said he shared,

       22         discussed, and got agreement on from the actual

       23         people at MFC who negotiated the termination

       24         provisions.  Yes, that was good testimony for us.

       25         And yes, I included the word "penalty" because we're


                                                                    203

        2         going to talk about words.

        3                Now, financial close.  Unclear to me whether

        4         this is still some sort of issue or position that

        5         MFC is taking.  It was a pretty big deal in MFC's

        6         prehearing brief, not so much here at the hearing,

        7         but let's talk about it.  This idea of after or

        8         before financial close, something that I'm not sure

        9         really tracks to the language of the termination

       10         provisions anyway, but let's just talk about it,

       11         because MFC's wrong.  Mr. Ahmad testified that MFC's

       12         lawyer on questioning him was ignoring that 11.3 and

       13         11.5 don't only ask about financial close or timing

       14         of financial close, but there is a further condition

       15         in both of those, and that is that the project is

       16         also cancelled.  I remember that testimony, because

       17         it drew this response from MFC's lawyer.  No

       18         engagement, just blowing it off.  Whatever.  No

       19         response on that.  MFC's lawyer said in opening that

       20         if MFC had reached financial close, MFC "Probably

       21         would have terminated for a convenience under 11.4."

       22         He said, "That's probably what MFC would have done,"

       23         and he said MFC "Very well might have done that."

       24         Well, I mean, a few things about that.  I'm not sure

       25         how germane that is to the question with which


                                                                    204
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         you're presented on about under the facts of this

        3         case, the application of the right termination fee,

        4         but it is interesting, I think, because it's an

        5         admission from MFC that they probably would have,

        6         very well might have, certainly aren't taking some

        7         fundamentally different contract interpretation or a

        8         reading from paying the $2.85 million termination

        9         fee if they had reached financial close and gone

       10         with another contractor.  So it's only this question

       11         of timing of financial close that seems to be the

       12         hangup here, which doesn't make much sense to me,

       13         but I like these admissions, because it really

       14         undermines this notion of penalty or

       15         unconscionability, but there's nothing about 11.4's

       16         termination fee that is so penalizing that under no

       17         circumstances would MFC pay it.  The distinction

       18         here is important.  MFC's lawyer is all but

       19         admitted, probably would have, very well might have,

       20         that's probably what MFC would have done, is pay the

       21         termination fee to KBR, if MFC had just achieved

       22         financial close.  Well, MFC's got the money.  We

       23         heard that testimony six ways to Sunday.  They've

       24         spent $84 million.  They're being funded by Fatima

       25         Group related individual sponsors who have tens and


                                                                    205
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         tens of millions of dollars.  Money's not an issue,

        3         Mr. Qureshi confirms.  So these admissions are

        4         interesting for us, and they really do cast real

        5         doubt on the arguments, which I'll address, about

        6         this being some unenforceable penalty.

        7                So back to the February 5, 2016, internal

        8         presentation, and that is this idea of ripeness.

        9         Because here again, at least this writer, who Mr.

       10         Qureshi says, notwithstanding the remarkable detail

       11         with which this presentation is written, is some

       12         lower level functionary.  Well, almost everybody is

       13         lower level to Mr. Qureshi, but what he writes on

       14         the suggested way forward is essentially delay,

       15         let's try to push this out to after financial close,

       16         KBR can claim their amount then.

       17                The waiver episode.  I've just -- this

       18         evidence is so powerful, I think, and compelling.  I

       19         mean, there's so much of that, that it's a little

       20         hard to get excited and rank what's most powerful

       21         and compelling, but, I mean, this really is because

       22         how parties act, not when there's a dispute and the

       23         lawyers get involved because lawyers can be clever,

       24         and we've got some clever lawyers on the other side.

       25         God bless them, I mean, that's an accomplishment,


                                                                    206

        2         you're supposed to be creative, but, I mean, really,

        3         this episode is about as close to a smoking gun as

        4         you can get, and that is MFC sees this opportunity

        5         at the time, remember, they had an undisclosed

        6         memorandum of understanding, March 3, 2015, later

        7         disclosed, but not disclosed at the time.  MFC has

        8         this early March 2015 memorandum of understanding

        9         that is signed with TKIS for TKIS to have a full EPC

       10         contract.  That memorandum of understanding

       11         envisages a next month, April 2015 final EPC

       12         contract.  And so here we are, MFC engages with KBR

       13         on some TSA negotiations and asks as part of that:

       14         We'd like you to waive your entitlement under 11.4

       15         to a termination fee in the event that we proceed

       16         with a different ammonia licensor.  MFC has got the

       17         knowledge of what it's up to and it asks for this

       18         waiver.  The documents bear it out.  Haresh Divanji

       19         testifies that he was asked to waive this fee during

       20         these TSA negotiations.  I wrote down the time of

       21         his testimony.  Mr. Ahmad says he was living and

       22         breathing MFC's request.  Remember, there was this

       23         episode on cross examination where there was some

       24         suggestion that perhaps Mr. Ahmad was offering

       25         hearsay?  He said absolutely not.  He lived and


                                                                    207
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         breathed these events and was deeply involved.  And

        3         he told us exactly, as the documents confirm, that

        4         MFC's request for a waiver was precisely in the

        5         event MFC pursued the project with a competitor.

        6         That's what MFC asked for, which further reveals the

        7         meaning, purpose, and intent of 11.4.  Haresh

        8         Divanji was specific in his testimony.  He

        9         identifies the teleconference, may 13, 2015.  He

       10         identifies who at MFC made the request for a waiver.

       11         No surprise here, the empty chairs Uddin and Dar,

       12         and that they asked Haresh and Mr. Wilburn of KBR to

       13         waive 11.4's termination fee and acknowledged

       14         payment was due if MFC terminated to use another

       15         bidder on the project.  This is in Mr. Divanji's

       16         witness statement at Paragraph 23 and he gave live

       17         testimony on cross examination about it.  Exhibit 59

       18         is one of the many e-mails that supports that story,

       19         which we'll look at in a moment.  Miss Zainab Hamid

       20         comes to offer some testimony, and we've all read

       21         her witness statement.  Again, it was an odd

       22         strategic choice by MFC, unless, of course, that

       23         strategy it was informed by knowing what Mr. Uddin

       24         and Mr. Dar would say and not wanting them to

       25         present any testimony, which is absolutely what we


                                                                    208

        2         believe, in their strategy about handpicking what to

        3         bring and what's germane and what isn't, but she

        4         testifies, it was interesting, she was on many calls

        5         with KBR including the negotiations and the waiver

        6         request, negotiations of the TSA in 2015, and the

        7         waiver request, but she only quibbled with the

        8         characterization of the request was made precisely

        9         to address MFC proceeding with the project with a

       10         different competitive ammonia technology provider.

       11         She said she's not sure of the exact conversation.

       12         That's quibbling.  She did not fundamentally

       13         disagree, she really didn't even disagree, with the

       14         testimony of Haresh Divanji, Aman Ahmad, and the

       15         documents that show exactly what the request was

       16         made.  No redirect examination on this or any other

       17         point from MFC's lawyer.

       18                Exhibit 59, the May 13, 2015 contemporaneous

       19         writing.  How do I know it's contemporaneous.  Today

       20         MFC requested waiver of the penalty payment due

       21         under the 2013 license agreement attached, if MFC

       22         cancels the license agreement due to going forward

       23         with the project with another bidder.  We're not in

       24         litigation making up some story.  This is an ongoing

       25         same-day negotiation and a contemporaneous note of


                                                                    209
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         what the request was from MFC.  Exhibit 59.  Another

        3         e-mail in this, from Haresh who testifies about

        4         this, May 14, 2015.  In our TSA negotiations today,

        5         MFC told us they believe they should be free to

        6         pursue the project with the other bidder without

        7         having to honor the penalty clause in the licensing

        8         agreement.  Look, you talk about credibility.  These

        9         same-day contemporaneous e-mails about what the

       10         request was from MFC, use the word "penalty."  If we

       11         were crafting this to try to create evidence years

       12         before this arbitration dispute or even the dispute

       13         arose, you'd probably wouldn't use the word, but

       14         they do.  That is credible testimony in addition to,

       15         of course, you being able to observe the witness'

       16         demeanor at length.  That's what MFC asked for.

       17                And a couple of things about that.  MFC

       18         asking for precisely this waiver for this reason

       19         shows MFC knew full well that 11.4's termination

       20         clause and fee applied in exactly the situation that

       21         confronts us here.  And it also fundamentally

       22         undermines MFC's argument that this should be viewed

       23         as an unenforceable penalty under New York law.  MFC

       24         didn't say, "Hey, we think that this

       25         $2.85 million 30 percent termination fee under these


                                                                    210
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         circumstances is or would be unenforceable."

        3         They're saying, "We want you to waive it.  We don't

        4         want to have to pay it.  We don't want to have to

        5         honor it."  That's very, very different.  And what

        6         does penalty mean when used in the vernacular like

        7         this anyway.  I mean, is it a penalty to pay money

        8         you don't want to pay?  Yeah.  Is it a penalty to

        9         pay even if you owe it but don't feel like it?

       10         Certainly could be viewed that way.  People refer to

       11         it in certain ways, that doesn't make it so and

       12         under New York laws as we'll see, it isn't so.  But

       13         this is credible testimony.  This is credible

       14         evidence.

       15                August 29, 2014, Aman Ahmad receives an

       16         e-mail from his colleague, Steve Pringle, to get us

       17         back in time, I think we need to keep the $2 million

       18         liability with MFC should the technology change from

       19         KBR.  This understanding was shared not just by

       20         Haresh and Aman, but others, and the documents

        2         it looks likes -- Steven Pringle says, "It looks

        3         like MFC is trying to shift out of their prior T & C

        4         agreements."  Well, that's exactly what's happening.

        5         That's the nature of a waiver request.  That allows

        6         Exhibit 52.  Back to exhibit 59, two weeks later,

        7         May 13.  Exhibit 59.  We saw Exhibit 59 in MFC's

        8         prehearing brief several times.  We heard a lot less

        9         about it from MFC here in this hearing.  We love

       10         Exhibit 59.  This is a multipage e-mail string all

       11         in this context of MFC's request that KBR waive

       12         11.4's termination fee if MFC proceed with a

       13         competitive contractor.  And Mr. Ahmad, who

       14         negotiated the fee, explains why KBR shouldn't waive

       15         the fee, why it was important, and what its intended

       16         purpose was.  There's a good reason why this clause

       17         is in the license agreement, i.e. MFC will need to

       18         compensate KBR for these costs and opportunity loss

       19         in case MFC decides to proceed with one of our

       20         competitors.  And up above he refers to the

       21         tremendous amount of time, money, and effort,

       22         uncompensated, that KBR has made, and there was

       23         hours worth of testimony about that effort and about

       24         the coding and time sheets and how many different

       25         people across how many different sections of KBR put

        2         in work at all different levels.  Undisputed.  And

        3         Mr. Ahmad testifies about the next sentence.

        4         However, if MFC can't reach financial close, then

        5         MFC doesn't incur any penalty.  And he explains, I

        6         didn't say doesn't or didn't.  I said they can't.

        7         So if you can't reach financial close, if you can't

        8         do it, you don't have the money, the project doesn't

        9         go forward.  It is cancelled.  He says that's his

       10         way of sweeping that in.  The words that he uses

       11         make sense, the testimony he offers make sense, and

       12         he's not trying to on a year and a half's

       13         recollection of the language of the agreement,

       14         summarize the agreement or change the agreement, and

       15         even if he did, he can't do that in some e-mail.

       16         The agreement, of course, has a merger clause.  He

       17         doesn't make the agreement go away, but he doesn't

       18         have to.  He explains exactly what it meant.  If MFC

       19         can't reach financial close, that means the project

       20         is cancelled.  Mr. Ahmad testified on this point.

       21         It is unrebutted.

       22                EXHIBIT 61, which is another piece of that

       23         same Exhibit 59 string, Mr. Ahmad writes the next

       24         day, May 14, 2015:  This is precisely why the

       25         penalty clause was inserted in the agreement.  So

        2         that MFC doesn't freely go to another competitor.

        3         And he puts quotes around "freely."  Mr. Ahmad

        4         testified, as we all know and is undisputed in the

        5         case, the license agreement did not bar MFC from

        6         choosing someone other than KBR for the ammonia

        7         licensing technology, but there are consequences to

        8         that choice.  It wasn't an exclusive agreement, but

        9         if MFC went with a competitor, not with KBR's

       10         technology, then there are consequences and that

       11         consequence is under 11.4 paying this fee.  And

       12         again, when we assess credibility of the

       13         contemporaneous documents, which are all one-sided

       14         in KBR's favor here, he's using the term penalty

       15         clause.  He also writes:  I also recall in that

       16         discussion that MFC said they were expecting us to

       17         raise this issue and they understood our rationale.

       18         That's Exhibit 61.  Also in Exhibit 61, Charles

        6         Fawad Mukhtar, when Fawad agreed to the $3 million

        9         in developing the project, and two, concessions on

       10         license and BED pricing he extracted through

       11         negotiations and other concessions we made at the

       12         time of the Fatima revamp.  A couple of things here:

       13         There are compensatory and nonpunitive purposes for

       14         Section 11.4, which are important when we think

       15         about this penalty argument that MFC has made.  But

       16         also, this e-mail is fully consistent with what

       17         little MFC's witness, Ausaf Qureshi, can offer us on

       18         this point.  He told us he didn't like, he was

       19         uncomfortable with, he was unhappy with Section 11.4

       20         when proposed and Mr. Qureshi told us:  But our

       21         chairman made the decision to accept it.  And that's

        3         while the video conference is still in progress, and

        4         he says in Item 4 MFC wants removal of the

        5         termination free, I think he means fee, wants

        6         removal the termination fee from the license

        7         agreement relevant to the penalty clause in the

        8         agreement and suggest that to be deleted (KBR don't

        9         agree.)  Exhibit 64, next day, may 16, 2015.  You've

       10         already seen this, but here it is in context and the

       11         sequence in the waiver episode.  What are they

       12         asking for?  They're asking for a waiver of the

       13         termination payment should MFC decide to select

       14         another ammonia licensor for the project.  There's

       15         no inconsistency in any of these documents on either

       16         side.  There may be a little more detail, but

       17         there's no inconsistency.  There's enormous

       18         consistency and no contrary testimony from MFC.

       20         Pleasant company to be sure, but when we're reading

       21         the witness statement and listening to their

       22         admittedly quite brief testimony, they acknowledge

       23         they have no insight to offer us about the meaning

       24         of the termination provisions in the license

       25         agreement.  They weren't involved in its

        2         negotiation.  They weren't involved in the

        3         termination provision negotiation.  They weren't

        4         even involved for Mr. Wright at the company until

        5         weeks after the license agreement was signed.  And

        6         Mr. Kulakowski, to this credit, acknowledges he has

        7         no insight, not even hearsay is offered.  He had no

        8         involvement in the negotiations of the license

        9         agreement or the termination provisions.  We don't

       10         get from MFC testimony from the people who were

       11         involved.  That was intentional and strategic and it

       12         raises real questions.  I think I've asked them.

       13                Let's talk about why Section 11.4 is not a

       14         penalty as that term is used in the law and in

       15         particular under New York law.  New York's highest

       16         court in the JMD Holding Corp decision in 2005 cited

       17         in our prehearing brief.  What happens in this case

       18         is that New York's highest court reverses a finding

       19         that a termination provision, a liquidated damages

       20         provision, was an unenforceable penalty clause.  The

       21         Court explains that the burden is on the party

       22         seeking to avoid liquidated damages to show that the

       23         stated liquidated damages are, in fact, a penalty.

       24         MFC has the burden of proof here and doesn't come

       25         close to meeting it.  In the same case, JMD Holding


                                                                    217

        2         out of New York's highest court, I've done here what

        3         I really don't like to do, which is have a lot of

        4         text on a slide, but the language of the Court is

        5         important for us and while we cite the case and cite

        6         language around this, this precise quote is not in

        7         our prehearing brief, and so I thought it's worth

        8         looking at.  Because one of the arguments that we

        9         heard from MFC in its opening statement was this

       10         notion that damages are hypothetical.  I mean, you

       11         only get the license fee if the license goes forward

       12         and notice to proceed is issued, 9.5 million.  They

       13         try to ignore all the work, resources, and expense

       14         KBR put in for years uncompensated, and they say:

       15         Look, this is disproportionate.  This $2.85 million

       16         is disproportionate, because really what KBR is out

       17         is zero dollars.  This was yesterday morning in the

       18         opening statement.  New York's highest court in a

       19         very similar context addresses and rejects that

       20         exact argument, and so I commend the slide and, of

       21         course, the case in its entirety to your reading.

       22         And the second paragraph that I've included, I

       23         think, is interesting, which is, of course, this

       24         argument begs the question of why JMD would have

       25         entered into a contract requiring it to pledge


                                                                    218

        2         virtually all its assets in order to obtain loans

        3         that it did not intend to request.  And that's

        4         interesting, too, because the only testimony we have

        5         about the intent and purpose is from Mr. Ahmad, and

        6         from contemporaneous writings, none of which

        7         supports MFC's story, and all of which supports KBR

        8         that there was a compensatory bargain for exchange

        9         here, an exchange to kick out the NTP date and a

       10         purpose to compensate KBR for the fully expected

       11         additional months of uncompensated work that it

       12         would do, months that turned into years.  What does

       13         New York law say about what we look at?  Do we look

       14         at form or substance?  Do we look at names, titles,

       15         labels?  In the CVS Pharmacy case, 2019 case from

       16         the Southern District of New York, high New York

       17         law.  "The Court must look to the substance of the

       18         provision, not its form, and consider whether the

       19         contract itself refers to the payment as a penalty."

       20         What we heard in opening statement, and the analysis

       21         really doesn't go beyond this, was a statement from

       22         MFC's attorney that 11.4 is a penalty, pure and

       23         simple.  Those were the words.  That's not analysis.

       24         That's not substance.  That doesn't engage on the

       25         testimony.  It ignores the contemporaneous writings.

        2         It ignores the multiple compensatory purposes.  It

        3         ignores the fact that MFC made a strategic decision

        4         not to bring the people here who actually could

        5         offer alternate punitive basis, if they believed it.

        6         MFC's got the burden of proof and it has none.

        7         Saying penalty, penalty, penalty appears in the

        8         documents doesn't make 11.4's termination a penalty

        9         clause and certainly not an unenforceable penalty

       10         clause.  To the contrary, the fact that there are

       11         multiple writings at KBR using the word "penalty,"

       12         heightens the credibility of those writings,

       13         including when those writings describe the actual

       14         intended compensatory purpose of the so referred to

       15         on occasion penalty clause.  MFC's lawyer told us in

       16         opening:  You make your bed, you sleep in it.  Words

       17         mean what they say.  You have to live with it.  At

       18         some level, I think that's exactly right, and at

       19         every level that really is unfortunate for MFC's

       20         position in this case, since it's trying to rewrite

       21         the contract and avoid the language.  The only

       22         contemporaneous evidence about the purpose and

       23         intent, not hearsay, not lawyer driven, not form in

       24         2019, deep in this dispute with a cadre of lawyers

       25         in-house and out-house around is that there was a

        2         compensatory purpose, that was the reason for

        3         including 11.4.  That is enforceable.  Mr. Ahmad's

        4         testimony goes unrebutted in Paragraphs 18 to 23 and

        5         30 to 34 of his witness statement and live here at

        7         testimony.  We have a transcript.  I think my

        8         transcript's going to be right on.  "The sole

        9         purpose was to compensate KBR for our efforts and

       10         this is something that was acknowledged by MFC."

       11         And he put a lot of meat on that bone with detail of

       14         Truck Rent-a-Center, 1977 case from New York's

       15         highest court.  "It is not material whether the

       16         parties themselves have chosen to call the provision

       17         one for liquidated damages as is in this case or

       18         have styled it as a penalty."  Not material under

       19         New York law, says New York's highest court.  MFC

       20         cannot just say as it has done:  Look, the word

       21         "penalty" appears in several e-mails.  E-mail after

       22         e-mail.  That doesn't make it so.  Substance

       23         matters.  Compensatory purpose matters.  Mr. Ahmad

        2         some of these terms in the documents.  There are

        3         lots of terms that are used to describe.  Thankfully

        4         we have a signed written contract and can look at

        5         the language itself, and the language does not say

        6         "penalty."

        7                The Bates Advertising case from New York's

        8         highest court in 2006.  Sort of what I said.  The

        9         prospect of damages may always be said to encourage

       10         parties not to comply with the contractual

       11         obligations.  Liquidated damages are not transformed

       12         into a penalty merely because they operate in this

       13         way as well, so long as they are not grossly out of

       14         scale with foreseeable losses.  Well, what's this

       15         way?  Encouraging parties to comply with their

       16         obligations.  Here, Mr. Uddin in Exhibit 8 writes on

       17         June 21, 2013, in this contemporaneous three-day

       18         period, internal writing at MFC:  We think this is

       19         fair value and should be accepted by us.  That's

       20         reasonable measure.  Mr. Qureshi put his own gloss

       21         on that.  The document speaks without Uddin

       22         embracing Mr. Qureshi's curious interpretation.

        2         difficult to ascertain, and under a provision fixing

        3         the damages in advance the amount is a reasonable

        4         measure of the anticipated probable harm."  There

        5         are some brackets there.  We had, I think it was, an

        6         hour and 45 minutes of repeated questioning from

        7         MFC's lawyer of Mr. Aman Ahmad about different

        8         billing codes and the inability to precisely track

        9         just how much to quantify the time value of KBR's

       10         enormous, tremendous was his word, expenditure,

       11         time, resources, and money to support this project

       12         for MFC without compensation.  That's precisely

       13         this, difficult to ascertain.  A situation that we

       14         can confront ourselves with here, falls squarely

       15         into a reason why liquidated damages provisions are

       16         enforced in New York and around the country.

       17                The Quaker Oats case, not the highest court,

       18         but you've got to respect the Appellate Division

       19         2000 decision.  The Court found fees were

       20         disproportionate where intended to secure payment by

       21         threat of a large payment.  There's no evidence that

       22         was the intent here and the evidence is to the

       23         contrary.  Aman Ahmad's contemporaneous May 14,

        2         of things the penalty of about $3 million is

        3         inconsequential and on its own will not prevent MFC

        4         from going to another EPC, and guess what, it

        5         didn't.  MFC, in fact, went to TKIS, knew it was

        6         going to confront this $2.85 million termination fee

        7         under 11.4, and it asked KBR to waive it.

        8                There's additional commentary, of course, at

        9         page 26 to 29 of our prehearing brief.  MFC

       10         terminated the license agreement.  Coming into this

       11         arbitration hearing, it seemed as though MFC was

       12         trying to hedge its bets about whether it did or

       13         didn't terminate the license agreement.  Happily,

       14         MFC's witnesses have confirmed the license agreement

       15         has been terminated, but because it was an issue in

       16         the prehearing briefs and before, it bears mention.

       17                In Exhibit 589, Haresh Divanji of KBR comes

       18         across a January 25, 2016, newspaper article, that

       19         says MFC has entered into an EPC contract with TKIS

       20         for the Posey County, Indiana, fertilizer project.

       21         Mr. Divanji sends that around with KBR.  Now, he

       22         didn't see -- you all close your eyes for a second

       23         because this was marked outside counsel's eyes only.

        3         license agreement, which is attached as Exhibit C,

        4         which is a license agreement that would supplant,

        5         replace, the KBR MFC November 2013 agreement.  Their

        6         witnesses admit that.  A condition of the contract

        7         in Section 2.1 (i) is that the license agreement

        8         shall be executed by the owner and contractor and be

        9         in full force and effect.  This is Exhibit C, the

       10         license agreement.  It's Exhibit 131.  It's 19 pages

       11         long.  There's only one blank in the document and

       12         that's in Paragraph 1 where it says blank day of

       13         blank, 2016, to be filled in when signed.  Every

       14         single page is counter initialed by both TKIS and

       15         MFC.  The contract itself, the license agreement, is

       16         not signed.  It is in final form to be signed, is

       17         the testimony.  And importantly, Miss Zainab Hamid

       18         confirmed for us here today that MFC's lenders

       19         required all the major critical terms be finalized,

       20         including the ammonia technology license agreement

       21         with TKIS.  She says that in her witness statement,

       22         Paragraph 21, she acknowledged it here today on the

       23         brief cross examination.  The terms of the TKIS MFC

       24         license agreement were final and were used to

       25         promote the project.  MFC updated its engineer

        2         consultant Nexant that TKIS, not KBR, was supplying

        3         ammonia technology, that's Exhibit 95, and I think

        4         the Arbitrator will recall the chart showing in the

        5         middle column what the prior information MFC had

        6         provided to Nexant was, which was that KBR would

        7         provide the license technology, and then the update

        8         just five days after, January 16, 2016, when MFC

        9         signs the TKIS contract, five days later on

       10         January 21, 2016, the last column provided that

       11         update, it's the EPC contractor, TKIS.  None of this

       12         should be any great shock, surprise, and it's really

       13         not contested, because MFC, in its public bond

       14         filings, for example, JX-50, this April 2, 2015,

       15         remarketing date document which all witnesses from

       16         MFC who were involved confirm is substantively

       17         accurate in what it reports, were told technology

       18         providers, if the company and TKIS enter into a

       19         final EPC contract, then TKIS will supply ammonia

       20         and nitrate technology, et cetera.  Well, they

       21         entered into a 100 page final EPC contract which had

       22         a final, every page initialed Exhibit C of the

       23         license agreement, that is mutually exclusive for

       24         the KBR 2013 agreement as they contest and as their

       25         writing acknowledges.  Mr. Qureshi admits, yes,


                                                                    226

        2         that's the case.  TKIS would use the TKIS and its

        3         affiliate Uhde's money in technology, not KBR's.  So

        4         two days after KBR sees the newspaper article from

        5         January 25, 2016, announcing that MFC has

        6         contracted, entered into an EPC contract with its

        7         direct competitor, TKIS.  KBR sends Exhibit 95,

        8         January 27 letter saying "Through its actions MFC

        9         has terminated the KBR license agreement, and

       10         seeking under Section 11.4 the $2.85 million 30

       11         percent termination fee," and attaching an invoice.

       12         MFC, for its part, has disputed that it terminated

       13         that day and that way, but it acknowledges that on

       14         March 26, 2016, and JX-101, MFC terminated and

       15         cancelled the license agreement.  Mr. Qureshi and I

       16         had that discussion earlier this morning.  Midwest

       17         hereby cancels the license.  Now, they purport to do

       18         so pursuant to 11.3.  We've already discussed the

       19         inapplicability of that language.  And so again,

       20         while I don't believe it has been disputed here in

       21         the live hearing, it was an issue before, MFC has

       22         terminated the 2013 license agreement.  At latest by

       23         the end of March 2016, MFC terminated, cancelled,

       24         put an end to the KBR MFC November 2013 license

       25         agreement that brings us here today.  We believe


                                                                    227

        2         that termination happened in January.  But either

        3         way, MFC terminated the license agreement by word or

        4         deed or both and they owe the termination fee and

        5         the termination fee that applies is 11.4.

        6                So what's MFC's conduct?  We've talked about

        7         the language, the intent, the waiver episode, the

        8         internal extrinsic writings on both sides.  On

        9         November 16, 2015, we get another one of these bond

       10         issuances.  This one is the November 2015 iteration

       11         of the bond issuance.  Sure enough, if the company

       12         and TKIS enter into a final EPC contract, then TKIS

       13         will supply the ammonia technology and other items

       14         for the project.  Same language as in the April 2015

       15         bond filing.  So that's mid-November 2015, which, of

       16         course, we find out about after that day.

       17                End of November 2015, Farhan Mujib of KBR

       18         writes to Stuart Bradie, that's our Farhan Mukhtar,

       19         that's our Farhan Mukhtar.  That's our CEO.  That's

       20         the big dog over at KBR.  And Farhan reports that

       21         they had a meeting today, contemporaneous writing,

       22         KBR and MFC met today, pretty short conversation.

       23         They, MFC, told us they believed their 2.15 billion

        2         and will not let the project proceed.  They appeared

        3         pretty confident they have an offer from someone

        4         else.  We wish them best of luck and concluded the

        5         meeting.  That's JX-585.  Well, in response, John

        6         Derbyshire says:  Aman, are we still owed the

        7         license fee?  Yes.  It's actually a cancellation fee

        8         or a fee if they choose a licensor other than KBR.

        9         Was the contract with Midwest?  Yes.  Is it

       10         enforceable in the U.S.?  Yes.  Thank you again for

       11         your all your efforts.  Aman's not going to get this

       12         commission that he was cross examined about, but he

       13         does get some thanks, and I'd like to think in this

       14         world that counts for something.

       15                So look, we have this meeting late November

       16         2015, MFC all but tells us, tell us, your number is

       17         too high, and we're not going with you.  Everyone

       18         shakes hands, good bye, good luck.

       19                And so here on January 25, 2016, it's no

       20         great shock that MFC has, in fact, done a deal, a

       21         comprehensive multi billion deal with TKIS.  KBR

       22         didn't send a termination letter and invoice until

       23         this was actually finalized and announced, but once

       24         it was, KBR acts two days later.  That same day that

       25         we see the article, John Derbyshire says:  Please


                                                                    229

        2         advise when we should bill Midwest for cancellation.

        3         Steve Pringle responds:  We're reviewing and

        4         investigating the agreements now.  Asks Aman Ahmad

        5         for his thoughts, says:  Rest assured we'll bill

        6         ASAP, two days.  KBR sends Exhibit 95, a January 27,

        7         2016, invoice and the letter.

        8                We're looking at conduct.  What happens at

        9         MFC?  Within a week there's this internal

       10         presentation about the summary clauses, about the

       11         summary of a termination clause at KBR, and you

       12         looked at this document.  The document fully

       13         supports KBR's and the plain -- KBR's interpretation

       14         and the plain language of the termination provisions

       15         that the 30 percent fee is required, and the

       16         unavailability of the other termination provisions,

       17         11.3, 11.5, and in the last bullet point, 11.1 and

       18         11.2.  And MFC recognizes the waiver episode.

       19         Tried, but couldn't get us to give up on the fee.

       20         MFC proposes some counter measures.  Communicate,

       21         try to persuade KBR to relent.  Talk about future

       22         business.  Use the term cancel in clauses 11.3 and

       23         11.5 and delay the payment.  Or pay and close the

       24         chapter.  They went with Options A and then B.  We

       25         need the Arbitrator to close the chapter.

        2                Suggested way forward.  Delay.  If nothing

        3         comes up and KBR is stubborn, tell them to put off

        4         till financial close and we'll -- KBR can claim the

        5         amount then.  A month goes by.  There's no response

        6         from MFC, KBR sends a follow-up later noting the

        7         invoice is overdue.  That's Exhibit 99.  And then we

        8         get the response from Mr. Uddin that we looked at

        9         earlier to confirm that this after-the-fact

       10         lawyer-driven project doesn't mean project idea, is

       11         inconsistent with the contemporaneous writings.

       12         This is when that writing is contemporaneous.

       13         March 2, 2016.  Does not distinguish the project,

       14         from project.  Talks about our project in the

       15         context of the supposedly otherwise available

       16         termination clauses, 11.3 and 11.5.

       17                Now, Mr. Qureshi told us, you know, that

       18         February 5, 2016, within a week presentation, that

       19         was so detailed and right on point, that was done by

       20         somebody lower than his management level, but this

       21         Exhibit 106, he acknowledges, is a high level

       22         presentation within MFC.  This is in June of 2016,

       23         this is after lots of involvement including from

       24         Pillsbury, their outside counsel.  We ran through

       25         this morning the initial position proposed by


                                                                    231
        1                           Closing - Harrison

        2         Pillsbury, their lawyers, which was challenge KBR's

        3         work, along with reiteration of the fact that the

        4         claim of fee under the license is not correct, but

        5         then MFC's tech team analyzes that question and

        6         finds KBR did no wrong.  KBR was thorough, it

        7         followed the processes, it was approved by MFC, and

        8         there are not enough grounds to substantiate any

        9         claims against KBR with respect to the TSA.  So

       10         what's the current position?  By Pillsbury.  Avoid

       11         extensive legal and arbitration efforts.  Be willing

       12         to consider a compromise payment.

       13                And the final episode in the party conduct

       14         story is perhaps this renewed discussion, this

       15         possibility of re-engagement that takes place in

       16         2017 where KBR and MFC discuss the possibility of a

       17         second technical services agreement for KBR to come

       18         up with a new lower all-in lump-sum turnkey EPC

       19         proposal.  That never gets signed, it never gets

       20         entered into, but this is still an important episode

       21         because internally Mr. Dar, Mr. Uddin, and this time

       22         even on the e-mail, Mr. Qureshi have this discussion

       23         about commercial points in this negotiation and the

       24         second point that they "need to think through this

       25         before even discussing with KBR" is "if we sign the


                                                                    232

        2         EPC contract with KBR and issue notice to proceed to

        3         another contractor not using KBR license, then KBR

        4         may ask for the license termination fee.  The

        5         question is will we do this?"  Now, Mr. Qureshi who

        6         tried to testify about what he heard and learnt from

        7         Mr. Uddin and Mr. Dar and others to come here and

        8         propose that hearsay as MFC's story is actually

        9         involved and on the e-mail here, but when I asked

       10         him about this, he dissembled.  He couldn't explain

       11         what was happening.  He said -- I'm glad we have the

       12         transcript, this one I'm afraid I didn't write down

       13         because I was at the lecturn, but he dissembled.  He

       14         didn't have an explanation.  He didn't explain away,

       15         he couldn't, the plain language here presenting the

       16         same situation that confronts us now, and this

       17         concern at this high level within MFC, the same

       18         situation they're contemplating that we have here

       19         today, and noting KBR may ask for this license

       20         termination fee under these exact circumstances.

       21         It's important for more than just the obvious

       22         reason.  It's important for the contract

       23         interpretation shared purpose intent and

       24         understanding reason.  This is expressed internal

       25         writing at MFC confirming what Mr. Aman Ahmad


                                                                    233

        2         testified, what the contemporaneous writings show,

        3         what Haresh Divanji testified what the

        4         contemporaneous writings show about the reason why

        5         Section 11.4's termination for convenience fee

        6         applies, and that reason is this compensatory reason

        7         in the event that another contractor, not using the

        8         KBR license, is the one that gets the project.

        9         Perfectly consistent with what Mr. Aman Ahmad

       10         testified contradicts the alternate story created

       11         for this arbitration by MFC.

       12                And that's the evidence.  The quantity of the

       13         evidence?  Great.  We like it.  But the quality of

       14         the evidence and the strategic decisions that MFC

       15         made to avoid bringing you the witnesses most

       16         involved, should be deeply troubling and extremely

       17         telling about MFC and its arguments here.  KBR is

       18         not looking for punitive damages.  KBR has

       19         contractual entitlement to a $2.85 million fair

       20         value compensatory negotiated-for fee agreed to by

       21         the parties for exactly the situation that the

       22         parties encountered.  It applies.  MFC should pay

       23         it.

       24                Thank you very much for your time and

       25         attention.

        2                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you, Mr.

        3         Harrison.  Just one quick question for you.  Before

        4         you began your argument, I was just looking at the

        5         request for relief at the end of your brief and I

        6         understand you're asking for the $2.85 million

        7         payment.  There's also a claim for interest and

        8         there's a reference to Section 6.4.  There is, I

        9         think, perhaps just a typo in the request for relief

       10         and I just wanted to confirm.  KBR seeks and asks

       11         the Arbitrator to find a breach of the license

       12         agreement or in the alternative a breach of good

       13         faith and fair dealing and order a payment of

       14         2.85 million in damages plus pre and post-award

       15         interest.  And then when you quote from Section 6.4,

       16         you've got a square bracket when you're talking

       17         about when payment is received at MFC's designated

       18         bank?

       19                      MR. HARRISON:  Correct.

       20                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  I'm assuming that

       21         should be KBR's designated bank?

       22                      MR. HARRISON:  It should be.

       23                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  It doesn't

       24         make a difference -- I understand the point here but

       25         wanted to confirm that.  Okay.  And the date of

        2         February 26, 2016, where you're asserting that that

        3         is the beginning date the payment is due, that is my

        4         understanding from the reference to this paragraph

        5         is that you're asserting February 26, 2016, that

        6         being 30 days later then the January notice.

        7                      MR. HARRISON:  That's correct.  The

        8         invoice was net 30 days.

        9                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay, thank you.

       10                      MR. HARRISON:  Thank you.

       11                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Why don't we take a

       12         very short break before we proceed with Mr. Heller's

       13         closing.

       14                      MR. HELLER:  Yeah, and we need to set

       15         up our laptop.

       16                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Why don't we make it

       17         ten minutes, so you can set up the laptop.

       18         Actually, when we go back on the record, could you

       19         mark the closing for us?

        3                      Mr. Heller, whenever you're set.

        4                      MR. HELLER:  All right.  Madame

        5         Arbitrator, friends and colleagues, everyone who

        6         we've been spending a lot of time with the last

        7         couple of days.  I would ask that you bear with me.

        8         My presentation cannot be as long as Mr. Harrison's,

        9         because I only have 55 minutes, but I think that

       10         I'll be able to squeeze everything within that time.

       11                      Mr. Harrison has just shown you why he

       12         is one of the greatest lawyers of his generation.

       13         Now, I know that because it says so on his web site.

       14         And I assume one of the ways that he got there is by

       15         taking a horse, painting stripes on it, and calling

       16         it a zebra, and convincing people that he actually

       17         has a zebra.  He's got a horse.  We've got a horse.

       18         But even though it's got stripes on it, it is not a

       19         zebra.

       20                      You heard about a little less than two

       21         hours of presentation today, and of that two hours

       22         exactly five seconds, I believe, and I didn't time

       23         it, but exactly five seconds was spent discussing

       24         the actual language of Section 11.4.  11.4 says, and

       25         I'll read it again just to make sure the record is


                                                                    237
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         clear:  The owner may terminate this agreement and

        3         the engineer agreement for convenience upon payment

        4         of 30 percent of the KBR license fee.  That is all

        5         it says.  It gives that discretion.  The word "may"

        6         gives the owner discretion.  It didn't say the owner

        7         "must."  It doesn't say that KBR may tell MFC to

        8         terminate.  It doesn't say that MFC can

        9         constructively terminate.  It doesn't say that

       10         circumstances can give rise to a termination for

       11         convenience.  It invests the entire, entire

       12         decision, bar nothing, in MFC to terminate this

       13         agreement for convenience.  Nothing more.  There's a

       14         lot of stuff going on, and Mr. Harrison will tell

       15         you and he showed you that, indeed, there was a lot

       16         of stuff going on, because this was a very, very

       17         important project to MFC.  MFC did not want to

       18         disappoint people.  MFC wanted to maintain its

       19         commercial relationships.  MFC did not want to send

       20         KBR off in a way that would put KBR in a position

       21         where it would not want to do business with MFC

       22         anymore.  So a lot of gyrations going on.

       23                      So what you heard, everything except

       24         the language of 11.4, two hours of everything except

       25         the language 11.4.  You heard about the language of

        2         11.3.  You heard about the language of 11.5.  You

        3         heard about lots of e-mails where all kinds of

        4         things were discussed.  By the way, not a single

        5         e-mail either to or from MFC saying that this clause

        6         gets terminated for reasons that it doesn't say.

        7         That it gets -- I'm sorry, this clause gets

        8         triggered for reasons that it doesn't say.  It

        9         doesn't say that it gets triggered automatically

       10         when MFC does business with a competitor, even

       11         though the contract allows that to happen.  It

       12         doesn't say that this clause gets triggered

       13         automatically even when, even when it goes to

       14         financial close with a competitor.  However, you

       15         heard Mr. Qureshi say today that if they went to

       16         financial close with TKIS, they would find it's

       17         mandatory, and Mr. Qureshi is not a lawyer so he can

       18         only speak from a commercial perspective.  They

       19         would find it mandatory that a company like KBR,

       20         that MFC had been doing business with many years and

       21         hopefully would do business with again in the

       22         future, they would find it mandatory that they would

       23         then terminate the license agreement at financial

       24         close, issue notice to proceed to TKIS and pay KBR

       25         their license, their termination fee under 11.4.

        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         That would assume, of course, that they went to

        3         financial close, but before financial close there's

        4         nothing mandatory, everything is may, everything is

        5         in the discretion of the owner and that's it.  Even

        6         at financial close, this clause does not say it must

        7         be done.  Mr. Qureshi recognized, though, that as a

        8         commercial responsibility, as a business matter,

        9         this is something that he felt as though he and his

       10         company must do.  And that's it.

       11                      Now, we heard about the language of

       12         11.3.  We heard about lots of e-mails.  We heard

       13         about Mr. Ahmad -- Mr. Ahsen, Ahsen Uddin, who was

       14         an employee of MFC, who's not here today.  All kinds

       15         of stuff about that he's not here, we must be hiding

       16         him, he's got all this stuff to say, he's got the

       17         key, he knows everything, et cetera.

       18                      Now, I have a question:  When you want

       19         to know what a contract says, do you call the guy

       20         who negotiated it or do you actually look at the

       21         contract?  And if you look at the contract and the

       22         wording is clear, as KBR says it is, that's where

       23         you got to go.  And that analysis ends right there.

       24         You can paint stripes on a horse.  It doesn't become

       25         a zebra.  This is still a horse.  11.4 is 11.4.  It


                                                                    240

        2         says what it says, no matter all of the fluff, all

        3         the gyrations, all the two-and-a-half hours, the two

        4         days that we've been here.  It says what it says.

        5         You can't get around it.

        6                      So one thing I ought to point out, and

        7         that is that MFC -- that KBR has a claim in this

        8         arbitration that MFC breached its obligation of good

        9         faith and fair dealing.  You heard not a word about

       10         that.  And the reason is, I'm sure there are many,

       11         but as far as I can see the reason is because you

       12         had a witness here, Mr. Divanji, who says that when

       13         MFC went to -- went to TKIS and signed an LSCK --

       14         I'm sorry an EPC agreement with TKIS, that they were

       15         acting in their commercial interest, and that it

       16         wasn't -- they weren't sticking it to KBR.  They

       17         were acting in their commercial interest, and that

       18         is not a breach of good faith and fair dealing.

       19         That is not anything close to a breach of good faith

       20         and fair dealing.  We need to bear in mind that KBR,

       21         as the claimant, has the burden of proof.  So it

       22         could draw all the inferences it wants from people

       23         who were here, people who aren't here, but those

       24         inferences have to weigh in favor of KBR's position,

       25         otherwise KBR doesn't prevail.  They have the burden


                                                                    241
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         of proof.  They're bringing the claim.

        3                      Mr. Kulakowski was here today.  His

        4         witness statement is quite detailed regarding the --

        5         his experiences in this matter, his experience in

        6         the project finance business, and project finance is

        7         a bit of a different animal than any of us who do

        8         not deal this world on a regular basis really can

        9         grasp or understand, but we've tried, to the extent

       10         that we can, to bring those issues forward so that

       11         we can all understand it and grasp it.  I confess

       12         that before I got into this, I was not a project

       13         finance expert.  I'm not one now, but I know a hell

       14         of a lot more about it now than I did when I

       15         started.  And the importance in project finance of

       16         the notice to proceed is paramount.  Nothing

       17         happens.  Nothing kicks in.  Nothing is triggered.

       18         Nothing -- since the money is not there, nothing

       19         happens until notice to proceed.  Once the month

       20         money is there, financial close, notice to proceed

       21         goes out to the contractors, not before.

       22                      Now, you heard some testimony about

       23         some deals where notice to proceed may have preceded

       24         the financial close.  That was not this deal and

       25         that is not most of the deals such as the stuff that


                                                                    242
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         Mr. Kulakowski does on a regular basis that are

        3         grouped under the rubric of project finance.

        4         Project finance is a very peculiar animal.  You sign

        5         contracts, you honor some, you take some to close,

        6         you notice -- you notice them to proceed.  Others

        7         you terminate.  And that's the way it works.

        8         Project finance happens in cases like this where

        9         there is large scale financing.  They usually

       10         involve tax exempt bonds.  The entity that is being

       11         financed is usually, as is MFC, a thinly-capitalized

       12         single-purpose entity.  Now, of course, MFC,

       13         admittedly, did have money to spend, but there were

       14         agreements.  There were agreements in place that

       15         recognized the unique position of MFC as a

       16         single-purpose entity, recognizing that, for

       17         example, with KBR nothing is paid until financial

       18         close and until notice to proceed goes out.  KBR is

       19         not entitled to a smidgen of money, nothing, until

       20         notice to proceed.  Financial close is critical.

       21         The project entity is going to go -- is going to go

       22         around and sign -- have contracts signed.  Signed

       23         contracts and have contracts signed by contractors

       24         who are going to help it ultimately in getting this

       25         project off the ground.  And as Mr. Kulakowski said


                                                                    243
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         in his statement, these contracts can come from a

        3         variety of different sources.  All kinds of

        4         different things can happen during this period of

        5         time.  These companies collect contracts like

        6         playing cards.  They must have these contracts in

        7         place to get financing.  They use it to show their

        8         lenders that they're serious, that they have serious

        9         people involved, such as KBR, such as TKIS, maybe

       10         potentially at some point TCM, Toyo, Kawasaki, these

       11         are all big names recognized by lenders.  It was in

       12         MFC's interest to get those contracts.  It was in --

       13         it was in the contractor's interest to sign those

       14         contracts.  They don't do this because it's great.

       15         They do it because they have a commercial interest

       16         in letting MFC, as Mr. Ahmad testified, letting MFC

       17         leverage these contracts to get the funding because,

       18         unless MFC gets the funding, these people are not in

       19         the picture, they're not going to get paid, and they

       20         know it.  There's not going to be a stitch of money

       21         coming to them until financial close.  Notice to

       22         proceed is critical.  They don't get paid until

       23         notice is proceed.  If you look at every contract in

       24         this case, every contract has been put before you,

       25         whether it be the license agreement, whether it be


                                                                    244
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         in the -- talking about the KBR license agreement,

        3         whether it be the BED, the PEQ, and then if you flip

        4         the side to TKIS, you've got the TKIS EPC contract,

        5         which, although it has an effective date of the date

        6         it was signed, it is clear that there are two

        7         effective dates there.  The first one, which is for

        8         the price quote, which as Miss Hamid had testified

        9         is an important thing for the project company to

       10         establish, and then even though they have the price

       11         quote, and even though things are moving along over

       12         a period of months, there are no obligations on

       13         either side to proceed and do anything until notice

       14         to proceed.  And you have those contracts before

       15         you.  It's very clear how they work.  And, of

       16         course, some of these contracts, when you get to

       17         notice to proceed, will be terminated.  And here

       18         we're not in a notice to proceed, we haven't

       19         achieved financial close.  This termination for

       20         convenience or whatever you want to call it has not

       21         happened.  And it has not been delivered, but, of

       22         course, as Mr. Qureshi said, if they proceed with

       23         TKIS or another contractor that's incompatible with

       24         KBR, and they wind up in financial close, this is

       25         assuming that we haven't gotten to the point where


                                                                    245
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         this contract was terminated and we'll get into that

        3         an in a minute.  If they go to financial close with

        4         another entity, they will, as a matter of

        5         obligation, deliver to KBR a notice of termination,

        6         and the money that's necessary to cover it under the

        7         termination for convenience clause.  Not now,

        8         because now we are well in advance of that.  We're

        9         not there.  It ain't going to happen, because we

       10         have not reached financial close and we're not even

       11         close.  You've heard testimony about where the

       12         project is today.  It's not there.  So it's a lot of

       13         hopes, a lot of expectations, and a lot of risk, but

       14         they're not there.  So MFC is a single-purpose

       15         entity, common in the finance, project finance world

       16         and, by the way, it was created solely for the

       17         purpose of the Posey County, Indiana, Fertilizer

       18         Complex.  It never existed before these discussions

       19         started.  It has no assets.  It has a thin staff.

       20         In fact, Mr. Wright, who is here today is very thin.

       21         Financial close, key.  Contractors expect to wait to

       22         work or to get paid, that is an expectation because

       23         the payoffs potentially are huge.  And, of course,

       24         as you heard Mr. Ahmad testify that KBR is willing

       25         to devote huge amounts of money, which they, of


                                                                    246

        2         course, call overhead.  It's a business development.

        3         It's money that they're willing to spend to get into

        4         a position where they can get into this type of a

        5         deal, because these deals are potentially rich.

        6         They don't happen all the time, there's no

        7         guarantee, but if you get there, the risk is a huge

        8         payoff.

        9                      Okay.  The KBR ammonia license

       10         agreement.  It was heavily negotiated, that is

       11         stipulated.  What we also stipulate, is that there

       12         are -- well, perhaps we don't, but it's clear there

       13         are benefits to both sides.  There's a benefit to

       14         MFC.  MFC gets to leverage this contract as MFC

       15         freely admits, and at the same time KBR has what it

       16         portrays, and we believe there's certainly something

       17         to the portrayal.  It has an ammonia technology that

       18         it allows MFC to use in this -- which this license

       19         agreement allows to happen.  And the ammonia

       20         technology apparently is very good.  KBR promotes

       21         it, MFC believes that it's something that needs to--

       22         that they would like to use or they would have liked

       23         to use had it happened, had it worked out.  So

       24         notice to proceed would have to go to KBR before any

       25         of the obligations kick in under the contract.  KBR


                                                                    247

        2         gets paid and, of course, that is the benefit to

        3         KBR, and it also, in addition to these three

        4         contracts out there, which are worth, to KBR, about

        5         $45 million, it's not -- it's not chicken feed, it's

        6         big money, but it also gets KBR's foot in the door

        7         for bigger money when you talk about construction

        8         potentially of the -- of parts of the facility, if

        9         not the whole thing.  You're talking about something

       10         in the neighborhood of 1.8 to $2.5 billion, it's a

       11         lot of money, and it's a big, big potential payoff.

       12         It's worth it to them to take the risk.

       13                      So the terms of the ammonia license

       14         agreement, what's important and what's to bear in

       15         mind here, and again, this is the horse, there's no

       16         exclusivity.  There is nothing, absolutely nothing

       17         in this contract that says MFC must use KBR's

       18         technology, and if they don't use KBR's technology

       19         there's consequences.  It doesn't say that.  It

       20         doesn't say it anywhere in the contract.  And

       21         there's no prohibition anywhere of KBR -- of MFC

       22         going to a KBR competitor and using the competitor's

       23         ammonia technology.  Now, you would think that given

       24         all this discussion on KBR's side, none of it, of

       25         course, is on MFC's side, but you've seen tons and


                                                                    248
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         tons of discussion internally on KBR's side, most of

        3         which comes after the license agreement was signed,

        4         sealed, and delivered, about there being something,

        5         something out there that ought to keep MFC within

        6         the fold so that it doesn't go to a competitor.

        7         Now, this is Monday morning quarterbacking, for the

        8         most part.  I mean, there is -- there is one e-mail

        9         back, I think it was JX-5, where there is a

       10         discussion, you know, you need this to keep MFC from

       11         going to a competitor.  Okay.  Maybe that was their

       12         intention.  Maybe that's something that they felt

       13         they needed because there was a negotiation that was

       14         moving pretty swiftly at this point.  But they

       15         didn't get it.  There's nothing in this contract

       16         that says MFC may not go to a competitor and there's

       17         nothing in this contract that says if MFC goes to a

       18         competitor that it must pay a termination fee.  It

       19         says, "MFC may, if it chooses," this is 11.4, and

       20         I'm going to talk a lot more been 11.4 than

       21         Mr. Harrison did.  It says, "MFC may, if it chooses,

       22         go to" -- I'm sorry, "terminate the contract, pay

       23         the termination fee," and then that's it.  It's

       24         over.  And, of course, at that point there is no

       25         further obligation to anyone, except on MFC to pay


                                                                    249
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         the termination fee.  So MFC is not required to use

        3         KBR ammonia, and, of course, what KBR gets

        4         ultimately under this contract, and we need to

        5         really understand and keep in mind, that this whole

        6         proceeding is not about anything but this contract.

        7         I mean, there are accompanying contracts together.

        8         There is no allegation here anywhere that MFC

        9         violated or breached the PEQ or the BED or any other

       10         contract, and you saw there were many.  We showed a

       11         number of those contracts to KBR witnesses.  There

       12         is no allegation anywhere that any of those

       13         contracts were breached, and in fact, we don't even

       14         have an allegation here that the license agreement

       15         was breached.  What we have is here is an allegation

       16         that 11.4 was breached, even though there wasn't

       17         much discussion about it.  And how is 11.4 breached?

       18         Because KBR says that MFC terminated, even though it

       19         never terminated, and it didn't pay the fee, even

       20         though it didn't owe the fee, and an invoice was

       21         delivered and it didn't pay the fee when it got

       22         invoiced, and that's the breach.

       23                      So one thing we need to bear in mind is

       24         this:  This clause, the termination for convenience

       25         clause, is meant to compensate KBR in the event that


                                                                    250
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         MFC decides to terminate.  However, we must bear in

        3         mind that the compensation is only for the damages

        4         that arise under this contract.  It's not for other

        5         stuff.  It's not for, you know, some other service

        6         that KBR had delivered under a separate contract.

        7         It's not for discounts that KBR had given to MFC.

        8         It's not for any of that stuff.  And that's under

        9         Section 3.1.  If you look at Section 3.1, it says

       10         KBR's obligations under this license agreement shall

       11         not include any obligation on the part of KBR to

       12         furnish or make available to owner, meaning MFC,

       13         engineering, design, construction, or operating

       14         services.  All of that has to be done why separate

       15         contract.  So none of those services that we heard

       16         about, none of the assistance, non of the technical

       17         assistance, none of the operational assistance, none

       18         of the site work, all of that stuff, none of that

       19         comes into play under the -- under the KBR license

       20         agreement.  Some of it came into play under other

       21         contracts.  Whatever was not covered under other

       22         contracts, KBR booked as overhead, okay?  And you

       23         know what, they haven't shown up with it today.

       24         They haven't shown you what they've spent.  They

       25         told you they spent lots of man hours, but all of


                                                                    251
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         that went to overhead.  In fact, they recognize that

        3         in order to do a deal like this they're going to

        4         have to invest a substantial amount of time, none of

        5         which is compensable under this agreement, but

        6         they're going to have to spend a substantial amount

        7         of time in trying to cultivate this client, we don't

        8         even know how much time they spent, and one of the

        9         things you would expect if they're claiming that

       10         there was some damage here, that they would have

       11         come to us and told us what the damage is.  So we've

       12         had platitudes like lots of man hours, we had

       13         platitudes like free work, we've had all that stuff,

       14         but none of that has been presented to us.

       15                      Another thing you need to bear in mind

       16         is that there is a Section 3.4 that is a

       17         consequential damage waiver.  Both sides, neither

       18         party is entitled to consequential damages.  And so

       19         when you talk about things like reputational damage,

       20         things like damage to -- in the community, damage in

       21         the industry, our name is not as good anymore, all

       22         that other stuff, that's consequential damage and

       23         that's not recoverable under this contract.  Again,

       24         the focus is on $9.5 million.  That's what they get.

       25         That's all they're entitled to.  There's nothing


                                                                    252
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         else, nothing else under this contract that they're

        3         entitled to, and this contract is what's at issue in

        4         this litigation.

        5                      Now, talk about the restrictions.

        6         There are two restrictions under this contract,

        7         that's it.  The first one is under Section 2.1,

        8         which is the grant clause, gives MFC the right to

        9         use KBR's technology, and KBR is restricting MFC

       10         from using its technology with anyone but a

       11         KBR-approved contractor, and that's it.  Doesn't

       12         restrict MFC from signing with another EPC

       13         contractor.  It doesn't restrict MFC from signing

       14         with another contractor that's not approved by KBR.

       15         There's the license -- the assignment clause, which

       16         essentially prohibits MFC from assigning this

       17         contract to anyone other than a KBR-approved

       18         contractor.  There is no other restrictions.  That's

       19         it.  Now, maybe in retrospect, and maybe why we're

       20         here, is because somebody at KBR decided this wasn't

       21         such a good deal for them.  Maybe.  Maybe they

       22         decided that they've got to rescue this and they've

       23         got to come up with something that gives them some

       24         leverage over MFC to keep MFC within the fold,

       25         because none of the terms do that.  So they had to


                                                                    253
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         read something into 11.4 that it doesn't say to make

        3         that happen.  Now, MFC, and the reason why we're

        4         here today is because MFC signed an EPC contract

        5         with TKIS, and this happened in January of 2016 and

        6         right thereafter MFC got a notice from KBR that KBR

        7         had determined that MFC had, in its discretion,

        8         terminated the agreement.  So MFC said you -- KBR

        9         said you, MFC, says you may do it, and we said you

       10         have to do it and you terminated, pay us the money.

       11         Because none of that is in Section 11.4.  So what

       12         about the TKIS EPC contract?  So the TKIS EPC

       13         contract that MFC signed was highly conditional.  In

       14         fact, it verges on something like an agreement to

       15         agree.  The effectiveness, the closing date

       16         deliverables, nothing happens until financial close.

       17         The only thing that MFC got out of this was a -- was

       18         a bankable number, but nothing else.  Everything

       19         else, any other benefit, any other service that TKIS

       20         would provide, all of that waits until financial

       21         close and until notice to proceed is delivered to

       22         TKIS.  There is nothing else, and I invite you to

       23         look at this contract and look at it carefully,

       24         there is absolutely nothing else in this contract

       25         that happens until financial close.  And, in fact,


                                                                    254
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         under Section 2, which is here, this is the -- these

        3         are the conditions precedent.  There's actually one

        4         more, which I couldn't fit on the screen, but there

        5         is a host of them.  There is 14 conditions

        6         precedent.  Some of these may have been satisfied at

        7         some point, but TKIS in November of 2016 terminated

        8         the contract because one or more of these conditions

        9         precedent were not satisfied, and that was the end

       10         of that.  So what MFC signed with TKIS was a highly

       11         conditional, not yet effective contract for TKIS to

       12         provide services in the future and for MFC to

       13         benefit from TKIS services in the future and for MFC

       14         to pay TKIS services in the future.  It is more than

       15         executory.  It is highly conditional.  It is

       16         virtually an agreement to agree.

       17                      Let's look at other provisions which,

       18         by the way, is also why we're here.  Here is

       19         reference -- the first reference in the contract to

       20         Section -- to Exhibit C, which is the form of the

       21         license agreement.  It's an exhibit to the contract

       22         and it says -- it doesn't say license agreement.  It

       23         says form of license agreement.  This license

       24         agreement was not executed.  The license agreement,

       25         the definition of license agreement in the TKIS


                                                                    255
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         contract says that the license agreement will be

        3         dated not today, not January of 2016, but the date

        4         of financial close.  That's when the license

        5         agreement is dated.  Until that point there is no

        6         license agreement.  There is a form.  That form,

        7         yes, that form was negotiated.  That form -- and

        8         there is some initials on there by MFC personnel,

        9         but we heard testimony yesterday regarding KBR

       10         contracts that those initials that come up on the

       11         pages, unless there's a signature on it, KBR

       12         recognizes that such a contract has not been

       13         executed, and such a contract is not effective.  So

       14         Exhibit C is the form of technology license

       15         agreement.  Again, the initials which come up on the

       16         pages, and if you look at the signature page, that's

       17         what you find.  There are no signatures.  It was

       18         never executed.  It was a contract that only existed

       19         in a form.  There are no obligations under it.  MFC

       20         at that point had not signed a licensor for

       21         technology.  It wasn't there.  And, of course, under

       22         Clause 19, 19.1 of the Exhibit C it says "This

       23         agreement shall become effective upon the notice to

       24         proceed date."  It wasn't signed.  And even if it

       25         was signed, it would not be effective until the


                                                                    256
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         notice to proceed date.

        3                      Okay.  So let's really look at some of

        4         these claims that KBR was trying to push forward.

        5         Okay.  MFC is not contractually prohibited from

        6         signing with TKIS.  There's nothing under this

        7         agreement that prohibits that.  MFC never reached

        8         financial close with TKIS.  Had MFC reached

        9         financial close with TKIS, we may be having a

       10         different conversation today.  In fact, had MFC

       11         reached financial close with TKIS, you heard Mr.

       12         Qureshi say that they would have terminated for

       13         convenience the contract with KBR.  They would have

       14         delivered the money.  We wouldn't be here.  That

       15         would have been the end of that.  So no financial

       16         close at TKIS.  The TKIS contract, for ten months it

       17         existed.  The tenth month it was gone.  All that

       18         time the KBR contract did exist.  And you heard

       19         testimony from Mr. Divanji that those contracts

       20         cannot exist at the same time; that if you have one

       21         ammonia contractor, you can't go out and get another

       22         ammonia contractor and sign a binding contract with

       23         another ammonia contractor at the same time and that

       24         they just can't exist, so the first one has to go

       25         away.  Now, that, of course, is a laymen's


                                                                    257
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         discussion and there is a concept out there called

        3         repudiation of a contract.  We have no claim here

        4         that the MFC -- that the MFC KBR contract was

        5         repudiated.  That's not in the books.  What they're

        6         claiming -- now, if they had a repudiation claim,

        7         the problem they would have there if they advanced

        8         that claim is that they had no damages, and we

        9         wouldn't be here today because they cannot claim

       10         damages for repudiation, because they don't get

       11         anything until financial close.  Where is their

       12         damage?  And also under New York law, a repudiation

       13         must be positive and unequivocal.  There is nothing

       14         positive and unequivocal about the TKIS contract.

       15         And, of course, the KBR agreement is triggered by

       16         notice to proceed.  No damages until then.  And then

       17         you get the financial close with TKIS ammonia,

       18         that's when it kicks in.  And then, of course, at

       19         the same time there would be notice to proceed if

       20         this thing went to financial close with TKIS, and

       21         then the KBR license agreement would be terminated

       22         for convenience and the fee paid, if it all happened

       23         that way.  But, of course, we know that it did not.

       24         So KBR, when it got wind of the TKIS agreement, even

        2         there, it could have sent the message to one of its

        3         contacts at MFC and said, "We heard you signed a

        4         contract with KBR, which of course we knew about

        5         your negotiations since February."  This is

        6         January 2016.  There are plenty of e-mails out there

        7         that show that KBR was not kept in the dark about

        8         these negotiations.  There was nothing secret about

        9         it.  KBR knew from -- from a long time back that

       10         these negotiations were going on.  So instead of

       11         reaching out and saying that "We heard you signed a

       12         contract.  Tell us what about," you know, "maybe

       13         it's binding, maybe it's not, but at least tell us."

       14         No, this is what they did.  They sent this notice,

       15         which, you know, if you look at the language in

       16         11.4, it's not supported.  There's nothing in 11.4

       17         that supports this theory, that they are entitled to

       18         push termination for convenience from their end.

       19         Only MFC's entitled to do that, nevertheless they

       20         have did it, and in the process they told MFC in the

       21         subsequent letter that the -- as far as they're

       22         concerned, their project, this project between KBR

       23         and MFC has been terminated.  And that's how we're

       24         going to behave.  You're going to have to deliver,

       25         send us utter back all of the stuff that we've given


                                                                    259

        2         you.  Everything else.  We're done.  It's over.  So

        3         MFC's response, which came soon thereafter in March

        4         of 2016, was that, "Okay, you terminated.  You've

        5         told us this project is no longer under Section 11.3

        6         of the contract, therefore, not only have we not

        7         reached financial close, but our project," and, of

        8         course, a lot of this depends on how you read the

        9         two clauses, but one clause, 11.3, says "this

       10         project," and then 11.5 says "the North American

       11         project," there are reasons why different wording

       12         was used in those clauses.  So if you look at the

       13         actual wording of 11.3, and you take away all the

       14         fluff, 11.3 says, "This project is therefore

       15         terminated."  That's the reason why MFC felt as

       16         though it was able to, on March 28th, 2016, send

       17         this notice to KBR saying "You're going to play this

       18         game, here's what really happened."  Okay?  You

       19         terminated the contract.  We're going to send you

       20         this notice, which we are, that we haven't reached

       21         financial close, you terminated the project.  We're

       22         done.

       23                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So from your

       24         perspective, who -- I mean, who terminated it?  You

       25         just said that they -- MFC sent a letter saying "You


                                                                    260
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         terminated it, so we're terminating it"?

        3                      MR. HELLER:  Right.  So it's two

        4         different things; one is termination of the project,

        5         the other is termination of the contract.

        6                      So MFC's position in the March 2016

        7         letter is that KBR terminated the project by sending

        8         out that letter saying, you know, "We're done.  Send

        9         us back everything," et cetera, et cetera, even

       10         though we had no grounds to do so under 11.4.  So

       11         KBR -- MFC responded and said, "If you want to play

       12         that game, here's how it's going to work."  Okay?

       13         We have grounds now, which we didn't have before, to

       14         terminate under 11.3, and we're going to send you

       15         this notice, which we did, the project -- you need

       16         two things under the -- under 11.3 in order for MFC

       17         to be able to terminate.  First, it is not -- it has

       18         not reached financial close by April 30, 2014,

       19         that's Item No. 1.  The second one, the second thing

       20         is that this project is therefore terminated.  So

       21         those two things, now if they didn't exist before,

       22         which they may have, but now they certainly existed,

       23         and that gave MFC the opportunity, which it may not

       24         have wanted to use, but given that KBR started it,

       25         this is how it was going to finish.


                                                                    261
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2                      So the termination fee, if -- if KBR is

        3         correct, and which it's not, but if it's correct

        4         that it can somehow be payable before financial

        5         close, notice to proceed, if this contract can

        6         somehow be construed as allowing this fee to be paid

        7         before financial close, then our position and I

        8         think it's supported not only by the law, but by the

        9         facts that have been elicited, is a penalty.  It's a

       10         penalty and it's unenforceable.  And, again, as I

       11         mentioned earlier, you heard testimony from

       12         Mr. Ahmad that KBR's damages, as far as he's

       13         concerned, he didn't quantify them, he doesn't even

       14         know what they are because he didn't bother to

       15         check, but he booked all of this to overhead.  I

       16         don't know of a single case which says you're

       17         allowed to charge somebody overhead if you haven't

       18         invoiced it.  This is certainly never invoiced, and

       19         you look back at Section 3.1 of the contract, it

       20         says that KBR is not entitled to do any of that

       21         anyway.  So none of this stuff was available to KBR

       22         as damages under the contract, and when you look at

       23         the penalty analysis, the penalty analysis limits

       24         itself to whether or not there was a penalty under

       25         the contract at issue, to whether or not the company


                                                                    262
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         that or the party that is claiming its right to

        3         recover under this liquidated damage clause is

        4         actually looking to recover under a penalty clause.

        5         And also the case law will tell you that -- and I'll

        6         cite a case that unfortunately I don't have on the

        7         screen, but it's the Northern Shipping Funds case,

        8         and it's 998 F. Sub 2nd 301, which says that the

        9         terminology that the parties used to describe this

       10         clause is important, and it matters.  So we brought

       11         up five examples or four examples of KBR from

       12         different sources calling this clause a penalty

       13         clause, and I don't know how many times you need to

       14         see that.  It comes up, as far as we counted, at

       15         least 30 times in the documents that comes up, and

       16         probably more, we never really counted each one, but

       17         here are examples, and of course JX-60, which we

       18         quote below, which has Mr. Ahmad saying that if --

       19         which is that term over there:  However, if MFC

       20         can't reach financial close, then MFC doesn't incur

       21         any penalty.  That was -- that was delivered in the

       22         context of talking about MFC's view that Section

       23         11.4 somehow magically gets triggered when MFC signs

       24         a contract with another entity, with a competing

       25         entity.  So, you know, if you're talking about a


                                                                    263
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         competing entity, you're talking about triggering

        3         11.4, that's what he was talking about here and he

        4         says:  However, if MFC can't reach financial close,

        5         then MFC doesn't incur any penalty.  There's no time

        6         limit on that.  He didn't say MFC must also

        7         terminate the license agreement or the project.  It

        8         says:  If MFC can't reach financial close, no

        9         penalty.  So if MFC doesn't reach financial close

       10         with the competing entity, Mr. Ahmad recognized here

       11         that even though there was a contract signed, and

       12         even though it may be preceding, which, of course

       13         you know, this case it never did, with the competing

       14         entity, if MFC doesn't reach financial close with

       15         this entity, MFC doesn't incur any penalty.  That's

       16         what he was saying.

       17                      Now, we talk about or I've spoken about

       18         the effort here by KBR to take a horse, paint it as

       19         a zebra, and try to convince you and us that they

       20         actually have a zebra.  They don't.  It's still a

       21         horse.  There is still language in 11.4 that says

       22         that MFC may terminate.  MFC may terminate for

       23         convenience by paying the termination fee.  That's

       24         what it says.  So we -- they spent a lot of time

       25         talking about the Syed Ahsen Uddin e-mails.  Okay.


                                                                    264
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         Mr. Uddin is not hear today, and we acknowledge

        3         that.  There are a variety of reasons why he's not

        4         here today.  I don't want to get into the legal

        5         wrangling that we've had, the discussions we've had

        6         behind closed doors, but suffice it to say that

        7         everyone who has testified can tell the story that

        8         we need to tell, that MFC needs to tell in order to

        9         successfully defend this action, and we did not need

       10         to have Mr. Uddin here.  And that's very simple.

       11         It's simple as that.  He not need to be here.

       12                      Now, if you look at the e-mails that

       13         have been tossed around, the first e-mail, JX-6,

       14         willful termination is exercised by MFC before

       15         notice to proceed financial close.  Describing the

       16         then being negotiated 11.4.  So the full context of

       17         that is a new clause of termination has been

       18         introduced by KBR and we are contesting this clause,

       19         but KBR is insisting on it.  Mr. Qureshi testified

       20         here this morning that he was uncomfortable with

       21         that clause, and KBR -- and MFC's management was

       22         uncomfortable with that clause, and we don't know

       23         any reason other than the fact that that clause may

       24         have required that MFC pay some money that it didn't

       25         want to pay for that -- that discomfort and, in


                                                                    265
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         fact, that's what came out when Mr. Qureshi was

        3         asked the question.  So KBR's brief, in its brief it

        4         says MFC told outside engineering company Nexant,

        5         and we heard discussion of that in Mr. Harrison's

        6         sons closing, that its new contract with TKIS had

        7         replaced its 2013 license agreement with KBR.  And

        8         actually that's not what that document says.  So if

        9         you look at the document itself, there is a -- there

       10         is several dated columns here.  In the last one it

       11         says:  Finalized license agreement contractor is

       12         available as Exhibit C of the EPC contract, which

       13         shall be effective on financial close date.  That is

       14         very clear.  Yes, the language of that Exhibit C

       15         was, indeed, finalized, although it was still

       16         subject, potentially, to further negotiation, but in

       17         order for MFC to be able to leverage this contract

       18         with its lenders, it had to have something, and

       19         that's why the form was annexed.  And so it was very

       20         clear, we went through the text before, that that

       21         contract, that ammonia contract, the license to

       22         contract with TKIS was not effective until financial

       23         close.

       24                      So there is, of course, this whole

       25         exchange which Mr. Harrison, I believe, spent about


                                                                    266
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         45 minutes talking about, about this exchange in

        3         early to mid 2015 where MFC sought to have the fee

        4         "waived" even though everyone who is exchanging

        5         these e-mails at that time were not lawyers.  So,

        6         you know, when they say "waived," we don't know if

        7         they were talking about waived in a legal sense.

        8                      So in none of these communications, in

        9         none of them did MFC ever tell KBR or acknowledge

       10         from a query from KBR that signing a contract with a

       11         competitor triggered the clause, and that's why

       12         we're here, by the way.  It's not that MFC went to

       13         notice to proceed with the competitor, it's that

       14         they actually signed the contract, and that was it,

       15         a contract they didn't know anything about, they

       16         didn't know the contents of it.  Had they asked --

       17         had they asked that they might have been shown it,

       18         but they have never asked, but they decided they're

       19         going to terminate based on the signing, which is

       20         not in 11.4, it's not in the agreement, it's not

       21         anywhere talked about, and it's actually something

       22         that's not prohibited by the license agreement.  So

       23         the EPC work had to be completed by a KBR-approved

       24         third party -- third parties.  That's it.  That's

       25         the sole restriction in the license agreement.  And


                                                                    267

        2         then, of course, there are the MFC public

        3         disclosures, and, of course, those public

        4         disclosures talk about how MFC would have

        5         potentially, it's at the point in time where things

        6         actually congealed, which is financial close.  Now I

        7         concede that those disclosures don't use the word

        8         financial close in it.  But those who are reading

        9         those disclosures understand the context, and it

       10         does say that MFC, if it signs a contract with TKIS,

       11         an EPC contract, and goes with TKIS, that it --

       12         TKIS, would become the ammonia contractor or the

       13         ammonia licensor.  It does say that.  But those who

       14         know project finance understand then the under no

       15         circumstances would KBR, TKIS, or anyone else ever

       16         become the ammonia licensor unless this deal reached

       17         financial close.  Okay.  So in KBR's brief it says,

       18         that KBR technology, again, unequivocally responded

       19         that "KBR would not waive the termination fee as it

       20         was necessary to compensate KBR for these costs and

       21         opportunity loss in case MFC decides to proceed with

       22         one of our competitors."  And that's quoting Exhibit

       23         59 and, of course, if you look at the brief, you

       24         can't find this anywhere.  If you look at the full

       25         statement that came from Mr. Ahmad, we talked about


                                                                    268

        2         this before:  However, if MFC can't reach financial

        3         close, then MFC does not incur any penalty.  That's

        4         what it says.  It doesn't say that MFC has to

        5         terminate, which it doesn't.  It says that if MFC

        6         can't reach financial close with this third-party

        7         contractor, meaning TKIS, then it doesn't incur a

        8         penalty, and that makes absolute sense, and we've

        9         been talking about this, I've been talking about

       10         this from virtually the beginning, virtually word

       11         one in this arbitration, but if MFC does not reach

       12         financial close, there is no way, no way that it is

       13         obligated to pay this penalty.

       14                      KBR's brief says when KBR issued the

       15         termination letter, even without seeing the terms of

       16         the TKIS/MFC EPC contract, KBR knew that it was

       17         terminated -- that it terminated the KBR ammonia

       18         contracts including the 2013 license agreement.  It

       19         didn't see any of it, but it knew.  So the TKIS EPC

       20         contract, as we've gone through, does not preclude

       21         MFC from continuing with the KBR license agreement.

       22         In fact, what could very well have happened from

       23         the -- from Day One when they sign with TKIS, which

       24         is what did happen, MFC was -- signed the contract

       25         with TKIS.  That contract got terminated.  That is


                                                                    269

        2         the world of project finance.  These things do

        3         happen.  A lot of balls are up in the air until

        4         financial close.  There are a lot of potential

        5         contractors out there who sign agreements with these

        6         project companies.  In this case TKIS had signed the

        7         contract.  The ball was still up in the air.  It got

        8         terminated, but all the while the KBR license

        9         agreement still existed and MFC still had the

       10         opportunity and the right to go back ultimately to

       11         KBR and use KBR's ammonia technology.  Now, this is

       12         not -- this is not dangling KBR out there.  KBR

       13         consider is not a babe in the woods.  They know how

       14         this stuff works, okay?  This is not unfair.  This

       15         is how the world of project finance works.  There

       16         are a lot of alternative paths to potentially get to

       17         financial close and ultimately to the startup of the

       18         project, a lot of alternative paths.  They

       19         understand that.  They're a very sophisticated

       20         company.  This is a multi billion dollar operation.

       21         They're not going to get dangled, and if they were

       22         afraid about getting dangled, they would have

       23         written a term into this contract that says you may

       24         not dangle us.  But this happens, okay?  There are

       25         alternative paths to get there.  Ultimately, MFC


                                                                    270

        2         decided at the point when it did to sign with TKIS.

        3         That didn't work.  MFC had the opportunity to come

        4         back to KBR.  KBR decided, no, no, you're not going

        5         to do that because we're going to interpret this --

        6         this signing as something that it's not.  KBR says

        7         MFC admitted in an internal summary of termination

        8         clauses that it cannot -- that it can use another

        9         contract, but doing so requires 30 percent of the

       10         KBR license fee to be paid to KBR.  And by the way,

       11         this is the infamous Zunair memo, and Mr. Qureshi

       12         testified that Mr. Zunair was a lower level employee

       13         of Fatima's tech operation who reported to

       14         Mr. Salman Aslam, who, of course, reported up the

       15         chain, but, you know, Mr. Zunair took it upon

       16         himself or maybe he was told to do this, but this is

       17         what he wrote.  So later on he wrote that the

       18         ammonia license agreement does not state any

       19         exclusivity, okay?  That's what was going on.  With

       20         respect to engaging only KBR for the project,

       21         however, requires 30 percent of KBR license fee to

       22         be made payable in case of termination.  It doesn't

       23         say that if MFC breaches exclusivity, because it

       24         can't, because there's no restriction against

       25         exclusivity, but if MFC does terminate, and that


                                                                    271
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         termination would happen, although Mr. Zunair

        3         doesn't say that in this paragraph, that termination

        4         would have to happen at notice to proceed given to

        5         the other contractor, meaning TKIS.  That's the only

        6         time that this thing kicks in.

        7                      So ultimately we hope, we hope and

        8         pray, and certainly MFC and everyone involved hopes

        9         that this project will come to realization.

       10                      In essence, we're left with -- and to

       11         make this have simple, MFC under the letter, the

       12         notice that went out on March -- in March of 2016,

       13         terminated the contract.  And that's it.  It's

       14         entirely possible, though, and given the vociferous

       15         arguments that have been made on the other side,

       16         that you may find that that termination was

       17         ineffective.  It's possible.  We don't believe that

       18         it was ineffective, but possibly it was.  So at that

       19         point you have a binary decision really.  The binary

       20         decision is this:  If MFC had actually terminated

       21         for convenience, as KBR says it did, before notice

       22         to proceed was issued, there is not a dollar under

       23         the contract that is due to KBR as damages, not a

       24         dollar.  And it excludes virtually everything else.

       25         Everything that KBR was talking about, the thousands


                                                                    272
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         of man hours, all this other stuff that it says it

        3         does, the discounts, blah, blah, blah, the bottom

        4         line is that it does not suffer a dollar's worth of

        5         damage if termination happens before notice to

        6         proceed is issued.  Because at that point, up until

        7         to that point KBR gets nothing, and KBR understood

        8         that.  It's the plain language in the agreement.

        9         There is nothing -- there's no debate.  That's what

       10         the contract says.  And within the world of project

       11         finance it makes ultimate sense.  So if it happens

       12         before notice to proceed, it's a penalty, and we can

       13         talk about the analysis.  I mean, there are -- we

       14         cited a number of cases in our brief on this, and

       15         one thing that the Court needs to understand is that

       16         even though -- even though MFC has the burden, there

       17         still has to be a showing on the other side that

       18         there was some anticipated damage.  And all we've

       19         heard about is all this -- these services that were

       20         delivered that were expressly precluded under the

       21         contract.  Well, that's all we've heard about.  And

       22         we've heard about this reputational damage that's

       23         expressly precluded under the contract.  There's

       24         absolutely no measure of damage that this

       25         $2.85 million can possibly compensate KBR for


                                                                    273
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         because it incurred no damage.  That's the way the

        3         contract was set up.  Now, maybe they regret it.

        4         Maybe they don't like exactly what they signed.  But

        5         they signed it.  These are sophisticated people.

        6         These are people who understand that a contract says

        7         what it says, and you don't need to go to the person

        8         who drafted it to find out or the person who

        9         negotiated it to find out what it says, because it

       10         says what it says.  And 11.4 is clear.  We stipulate

       11         to that.  It's unequivocal.  It says what it says.

       12                      Now, if notice to proceed is delivered

       13         after -- after -- I'm sorry.  If termination is

       14         delivered after notice to proceed, given to another

       15         contractor, then, then all of a sudden there is real

       16         damage, potentially, because after notice to

       17         proceed, the contract defines notice to proceed as

       18         notice to proceed to KBR.  Potentially, they can

       19         claim, at that point, because notice to proceed was

       20         delivered to another contractor, they have damage.

       21         But that never happened.  There has been no

       22         financial close.  There's been no notice to proceed

       23         to deliver to anyone.  So at best, at best, we are

       24         here months, if not years premature.  This dispute

       25         is not ripe.  This dispute is -- it's a waste of --


                                                                    274

        2         a waste of time, it's a waste of energy.  It's a

        3         waste of all kinds of stuff, given that this thing

        4         may never happen.

        5                      There's a lot of dreams attached to

        6         this.  We hope that eventually it will come to

        7         fruition and that eventually -- and that KBR will be

        8         involved, we hope, but we're -- we're way away from

        9         that.  That hasn't happened.  But until that

       10         happens, there is no -- there is no penalty, there

       11         is no termination fee, there is nothing, and that's

       12         the way the contract is structured.

       13                      Thank you very much, and I thank all my

       14         colleagues and my new friends over here.  And we

       16                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you.

       17                      So, I just want to go back to something

       18         you said about whether the termination is effective

       19         or not.  And I don't -- you know, I don't have Live

       20         Note in front of me, but when I was understanding --

       21         I understand your argument to be that you made a

       22         comment about whether, if termination -- you think

       23         termination was effective, but I might find it's

       24         ineffective and if I find it ineffective, then

       25         there's a question about what damages, if any, could


                                                                    275
        1                            Closing - Heller

        2         be due to KBR and you argue nothing.  When I hear

        3         you use the term "effective", that makes me think

        4         about whether the contract is still -- is still in

        5         operation, and that's a different word than whether

        6         termination was valid, whether the grounds for

        7         termination that were asserted, whether a notice of

        8         termination of March 2016 asserting 11.3 is a ground

        9         for termination, validity, you know, as a practical

       10         matter, if the termination -- if, you know, the

       11         contract is dead, it's been killed, it's -- the

       12         question is from a legal perspective:  Did you have

       13         grounds to do -- was it a wrongful termination or

       14         did you validly assert it on grounds of 11.3?

       15                      MR. HELLER:  Okay.

       16                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Right?  Is that not

       17         the question that I'm asking?

       18                      MR. HELLER:  Yes.

       19                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Rather than whether

       20         it was effective.  In other words, if the contract

       21         is still living and breathing between the parties.

       22                      MR. HELLER:  Right.  So I think the

       23         only question to be decided there, and KBR's

       24         advanced this in -- in the course of this process,

       25         in the course of Mr. Harrison's closing.


                                                                    276

        2                      How do you read 11.3?  If you read 11.3

        3         the way we do, then that termination was effective.

        4         If you read it the way they do or they'd like you to

        5         read it, which we think doesn't make any sense, but

        6         it's possible that anyone, you know, I mean, things

        7         happen, you may find that their discussion is

        8         attractive.  If you find that that termination was

        9         not effective under 11.3, then as Mr. Ahmad said the

       10         other day, as they were discussing potentially

       11         renewing the relationship with MFC in 2017, after

       12         the notice to terminate was delivered, he said that

       13         he thought that that contract was still alive.  He

       14         didn't need to renegotiate it.  So from their

       15         perspective, and I'm not sure that I get it a

       16         hundred percent, but from their perspective, they

       17         believe, that there's a chance anyway, that that

       18         contract is still alive, and that if the termination

       19         was ineffective, it's not a wrongful termination,

       20         but it was simply ineffective, and that's -- and,

       21         therefore, the contract and whatever obligations are

       22         going to happen sometime down the road could kick

       23         in, and that -- that, I think, is what that means

       24         and that's why I say that if that termination was

       25         ineffective, if the -- if it wasn't something that


                                                                    277

        2         was available under 11.3, I don't think you can

        3         impute that the termination then becomes a

        4         termination under 11.4, because 11.4 is very

        5         specific.  You got to deliver the money.  It's at

        6         the owner's option, it's termination for

        7         convenience.  If the own, for some reason, made a

        8         mistake, and this was not the termination of the

        9         project, even though the other condition is

       10         satisfied, there's no notice to proceed, then it was

       11         not a wrongful termination, but it was simply an

       12         ineffective termination.  And if that is the case,

       13         that contract is still alive, they still have a

       14         potential claim later on when there is a -- a

       15         financial close, and that's it.  That's our

       16         position.

       17                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  I understand

       18         your -- I understand your position.

       19                      Mr. Harrison or Miss Barron, the --

       20         when Mr. Heller was talking about the January 2016

       21         circumstances, and he was making an argument about

       22         whether signing a contract with a competitor could

       23         trigger 11.4.  He spoke in detail about conditions

       24         precedent that are in the TKIS contract, and I

       25         haven't heard you speak much about the


                                                                    278
        1                              Proceedings

        2         conditional -- the argument that the EPC contract is

        3         not effective until certain conditions precedent

        4         have been met.

        5                      So I'd be interested in having you

        6         comment on -- on that argument, line of argument by

        7         Mr. Heller.

        8                      MR. HARRISON:  JX-589 is the

        9         January 25, 2016, e-mail forwarding the press

       10         release news article about MFC and TKIS signing the

       11         EPC contract.

       12                      We heard testimony about MFC going

       13         public with the lenders, and with vendors that it

       14         had this $2 billion plus contract.  We saw the

       15         public bond filings indicating that certain

       16         consequences flow from the signing of that contract.

       17         So while there were conditions precedent to the

       18         ultimate effectiveness, MFC held that contract out,

       19         that one-page contract, as a final EPC contract that

       20         had the effect of supplanting KBR's, the ammonia

       21         technology provider.

       22                      In the interim, between January 16,

       23         2016, when TKIS and MFC signed that hundred page EPC

       24         contract plus exhibits, and some ten months later,

       25         when TKIS ends up terminating that contract in late


                                                                    279
        1                              Proceedings

        2         2016, MFC terminates the KBR 2013 ammonia license

        3         agreement that's at issue in this case.  So at the

        4         time that MFC terminates the KBR ammonia license, we

        5         say late January 2016, MFC acknowledges at latest

        6         March 28th, 2016.  The MFC TKIS EPC contract is in

        7         effect.  It is subject to conditions, but it is in

        8         effect, and that's the controlling contract, and it

        9         precludes the use of KBR's technology.  The fact

       10         that MFC on March 28, 2016, in Exhibit 101

       11         unequivocally terminates and cancels the KBR ammonia

       12         license agreement at issue, as Exhibit 101 shows by

       13         it's language and as Mr. Qureshi, the author of that

       14         letter, admitted unequivocally here, makes that

       15         really easy for you and for us, because the TKIS

       16         contract was in force and effect at the time that

       17         MFC terminates us.

       18                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Any further

       19         comments, Mr. Heller?

       20                      MR. HELLER:  Yes, of course.

       21                      Again, you can put stripes on the

       22         horse, but it's still a horse.

       23                      So, yes, maybe they read these

       24         disclosures publicly, and maybe they decided that

       25         based on the public disclosures, you know, they're


                                                                    280
        1                              Proceedings

        2         upset.  So the way to do that is not to send out

        3         this litigation-laden notice, but to call up

        4         somebody, one of their contacts at MFC and say,

        5         "Hey, what's going on here?  What did you do?  Did

        6         you actually sign an agreement with TKIS?  Are you

        7         going forward with TKIS?  Are you proceeding with

        8         TKIS?"  No one of that happened.  Instead, within

        9         days, two days after they saw this press release,

       10         they sent this notice to MFC:  You've terminated

       11         under Section 11.4, which, of course, is absolutely

       12         impossible.  MFC is the only party that can

       13         terminate under Section 11.4.  So in response to

       14         that, and in response to the other letter that KBR

       15         sent out, which is a follow-up letter where KBR

       16         purported to say:  This project is over.  Give us

       17         back everything you've got.  That was the response

       18         that MFC believed was appropriate at that time.

       19                      MFC did not purport to terminate under

       20         Section 11.4.  It purported to terminate under

       21         Section 11.3.  That's MFC's option.  MFC does not

       22         have to terminate under 11.4.  Again, Mr. Qureshi

       23         said that if they go to financial close and they

       24         deliver notice to proceed to somebody else, they

       25         feel an obligation to terminate.  But short of that,


                                                                    281
        1                              Proceedings

        2         they don't have to.  It's may.  No -- no mandate,

        3         nothing.  It's all within the discretion of the

        4         project company.

        5                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Mr. Harrison.

        6                      MR. HARRISON:  Just two more thoughts

        7         on that, if I could.

        8                      One is that during this exchange of

        9         correspondence, as this dispute was coming to the

       10         fore in early and mid-2016, MFC never wrote back or

       11         said, "Wait a minute.  We didn't terminate you," or

       12         "The contract's still in force and effect between

       13         KBR and MFC," or, "You, KBR, misunderstand the

       14         nature of our EPC contract that we publicly

       15         announced as filing with TKIS."

       16                      Second point, on this notion of

       17         conditionality and conditions precedent, as MFC's

       18         lawyer has just argued in closing, the KBR 2013 --

       19         2013 contract at issue itself was is not effective

       20         in terms of imposing obligations on KBR and

       21         technology fee payment obligations on MFC until the

       22         condition of issuing notice to proceed took place.

       23         These contracts in the project finance world and in

       24         the real world have some conditionality, but you

       25         have an effective contract at a certain time.


                                                                    282
        1                              Proceedings

        2         That's why Mr. Qureshi, for example, could not

        3         identify any prior instance in the 83 year history

        4         of the Fatima Group where they've had at the same

        5         time technology contracts with competitors with only

        6         one to be used.

        7                      So the signing of the EPC contract with

        8         TKIS means that's the effective contract, that's the

        9         valid contract, that's the contract in force, and

       10         terminates us.  So this notion of conditionality

       11         somehow means the contract doesn't matter or doesn't

       12         replace is inaccurate.

       13                      And just on this related point, I guess

       14         I'm glad that I did anticipate the before or after

       15         financial close argument, because the

       16         contemporaneous writings, this time inside MFC for

       17         Mr. Uddin, show that the termination clause was to

       18         apply before NTP, which makes sense.  If MFC issues

       19         a notice to proceed to KBR under the license

       20         agreement, then the obligations kick in and KBR is

       21         going to get the $9.5 million under the license

       22         agreement, plus the additional $32 million under the

       23         two companion agreements.  A termination for

       24         convenience fee like 11.4, as Mr. Uddin's

       25         contemporaneous March -- excuse me, I think it was


                                                                    283
        1                              Proceedings

        2         May 2013 e-mails indicate, applies of course before.

        3         This is the consolation prize if we get terminated.

        4                      MR. HELLER:  I'll just repeat what I

        5         said before.  If you want to know what the contract

        6         says, look at the contract.  Don't call the guy who

        7         negotiated it.  The contract is clear.  We've

        8         stipulated it.  Both sides agree that these -- these

        9         clauses are not ambiguous, at least certainly 11.4

       10         is not.

       11                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Thank you.

       12                      Is there anything further that either

       13         side would like to add?

       14                      MR. HARRISON:  We would just like to

       15         thank you for your service and for your attention.

       16         This really has been smooth and nice for all of us.

       17                      MR. HELLER:  Same here.  Thank you.

       18                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Well, thank you to

       19         everyone for bearing with us for the last two days,

       20         and thank you to Susman Godfrey for the hospitality

       21         in providing hearing space for us.

       22                      In terms of wrapping up the

       23         demonstrative that was just used for the closing for

       24         the respondents, we'll mark as Respondent's

       25         Demonstrative 1.  And if I can ask both sides to


                                                                    284
        1                              Proceedings

        2         e-mail copies of the demonstrative that were marked,

        3         we'll do that before the record is formally closed.

        4                      As we previously agreed, we have these

        5         closing arguments in lieu of having post-hearing

        6         submissions.  Over the next day or so I will confirm

        7         that there's nothing further.  I don't think

        8         anything further that I need from either side, but I

        9         will go back to dot my I's and cross my T's and make

       10         sure that I'm not missing anything before I send a

       11         communication that formally closes the proceedings.

       12                      As you're aware, under the ICC rules

       13         there is a formal requirement that I close the

       14         proceedings, and that's under Article 27 of the

       15         rules.  At the time when I indicate that the

       16         proceedings are closed, no new argument or evidence,

       17         no new submissions can be submitted unless requested

       18         by me.  We do, of course, have a date for cost

       19         submissions, so I would close the record except for

       20         the issue of costs so that we, you know, stick with

       21         the September 23rd date that we have for the cost

       22         submissions, and then once the cost submissions come

       23         in, I would, again, close the proceedings.

       24                      In terms of a target date for the

       25         award, the ICC's expectation is clear that in a case


                                                                    285
        1                              Proceedings

        2         where a sole arbitrator is rendering award, the

        3         expectation is that a draft be submitted to the ICC

        4         for scrutiny within two months of the date of a last

        5         hearing or substantive submissions.  So that clock

        6         would run from today, even though you will get a

        7         letter from me formally closing the proceedings a

        8         few days from now.  So just less formally, for the

        9         interest and information of the parties, while I

       10         would intend to note in that letter that the -- that

       11         I would be meeting the two-month deadline, the

       12         reality is that I would expect to get that in much

       13         sooner.  My intention, since we had agreed on having

       14         an expedited transcript, is actually to work on that

       15         within the next week, and to finalize once I get in

       16         the cost submissions.  I do have some travel

       17         overseas, so I think the first week of October,

       18         realistically.  I don't have a firm behind me.  I do

       19         this by myself, so you're not going to get that date

       20         in your formal closing letter, but for your

       21         information, I do expect that around the first week

       22         of October that I would have an award to the ICC,

       23         they'll confirm when they received it, and then

       24         usually -- they say that it can be up to three weeks

       25         for them to do the scrutiny process, sometimes it's


                                                                    286

        2         less, sometimes it does take, you know, that length

        3         of time, but then it's once they get it back to me,

        4         about 24 hours for me to turn around any comments

        5         that they have and get it back to them.  So I would

        6         expect, knock on wood, that you would have a final

        7         award by, you know, two months from now.  I think

        8         it's likely that have you would have to in hand, I'm

        9         not going to but that in blood, but that is my

       10         expectation.

       11                      And let me just doublecheck here for

       12         one second to make sure I'm not missing anything

       13         else.  Okay.  Well, thank you to our Court Reporter

       14         today, and I think we're going to -- we've arranged

       15         for an expedited transcript, correct?

       16                      MR. HARRISON:  Yes.

       17                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So I'll look forward

       18         to receiving that, and look forward to receiving the

       19         demonstratives, and thank you, again, everybody, for

       20         your advocacy and participation.

       21                      MR. HARRISON:  Thank you.

       22                      MR. HELLER:  Thank you.

       23                      ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.

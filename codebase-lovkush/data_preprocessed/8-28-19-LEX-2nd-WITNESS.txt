         17    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

         18         Q.  Good afternoon.

         19         A.  Hi.

         20         Q.  My name is Daria Koscielniak, and

         21    I represent Mr. Oliver in connection with a

         22    lawsuit that you have filed against him.

         23             Have you ever given a deposition

         24    before?

                               Carolyn Chester           5



          1         A.  No.

          2         Q.  Can you state your full name for

          3    the record.

          4         A.  Carolyn B. Chester.

          5         Q.  What does the B stand for?

          6         A.  Brame, B-r-a-m-e.

          7         Q.  Before we get started, I'm going

          8    to go through some ground rules.

          9             Seated to your right and my left

         10    is the court reporter.  She's taking down

         11    everything that you and I say.  For that

         12    reason, it's important that your answers

         13    are verbal.  She can't take down nods of

         14    the head, hand gestures.  Things like

         15    "mm-hmm" or "uh-uh" will not be clear on

         16    the record that's created at the end of

         17    today.  Do you understand that?

         18         A.  I do.

         19         Q.  If you don't understand any of my

         20    questions, please let me know.  I'll be

         21    happy to rephrase or repeat it.  If you

         22    provide me with an answer, I'm going to

         23    assume that you understood the question; is

         24    that fair?

          1         A.  Yes.

          2         Q.  Are you under the influence of any

          3    kind of drugs, alcohol, medications,

          4    anything at all, that would affect your

          5    ability to understand my questions here

          6    today and answer them truthfully?

          7         A.  I don't understand the question.

          8         Q.  Is there any reason why you cannot

          9    understand my questions and provide honest

         10    and truthful testimony here today?

         11         A.  No.

         12         Q.  Again, are you under the influence

         13    of any kind of drugs, alcohol or medication

         14    today?

         15         A.  No alcohol, no drugs.

         16         Q.  Okay.  Did you take medication

         17    today?

         18         A.  I have -- I take a pill or

         19    something.  I mean, I'm not sure why you're

         20    asking me about my medication.

         21         Q.  Because medication can have an

         22    affect on an individual's ability to

         23    understand questions.

         24         A.  I understand everything you're

                               Carolyn Chester           7



          1    saying.

          2         Q.  Okay.  What kind of medication did

          3    you take today?

          4         A.  I don't have a list of my

          5    medications.

          6         Q.  What is it for?

          7         A.  I don't see a reason to give you

          8    that information.

          9         Q.  Is it for blood pressure,

         10    diabetes?

         11         A.  What does that have to do with --

         12               MR. GOODSTADT:  Carolyn,

         13         you have to answer questions

         14         like that.  The reason is it's

         15         discovery.  It doesn't mean it's

         16         going to come up at trial

         17         because it may not be relevant,

         18         but in a deposition you have to

         19         give information.  And it's not

         20         going to go any further than the

         21         deposition.  Okay?

         22               THE WITNESS:  Okay.

         23               MR. GOODSTADT:  So you can

         24         answer that question.

         13    same weight as if we were in a court of

         17    the record, we confirmed your social

         13         or not talking?  She's talking

          6    30 minutes, an hour?

          7         A.  I went through the light before,

          8    and when know I got to Stenton and

          9    Washington Lane, the light was red.  I

         10    don't know how many minutes.

         11         Q.  Was there any kind of construction

         12    going on in the area where the accident

          1    words how this accident occurred.

          2         A.  I was driving up Washington Lane

          3    headed towards Stenton.  It was a rainy

          4    day.  It was daylight.  I stopped prior to

          5    the crossroads of the passenger area on

          6    Washington Lane right before Stenton.  The

          7    light was red, and there I sat.

          8             To my right, I observed a

          9    gentleman crossing in front of me across

         10    Washington Lane, along side of Stenton, in

         11    his attempt to acquire a bus that was about

         12    to pull off.  I waited there until he

         13    passed by me, and as I sat there, I felt

         14    the impact.

         15         Q.  You said you waited until this

         16    gentleman passed by you.  Had the light

         17    changed at that point?

         18         A.  I don't recall.  I was concerned

         19    about the passenger who was going by -- the

         20    pedestrian, I'm sorry, the pedestrian that

         21    was going by, for him to get his bus, so I

         22    was sitting there.

         23         Q.  Were you the first car at the red

         24    light?

                               Carolyn Chester          41



          1         A.  I was.

          2         Q.  How many lanes are there on

          3    Washington and that intersection with

          4    Stenton?

          5         A.  Just one going in both

          6    directions.

          7         Q.  One in each direction?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  Is there parking in that area --

         10         A.  No.

         11         Q.  -- on the side of the road?

         12         A.  No.

         13         Q.  Is there a bus lane?

         14         A.  There may be.

         15         Q.  And you said that you were stopped

         16    there for several minutes before the impact

         17    occurred?

         18         A.  Yes.  I was waiting for the

         19    pedestrian to walk by me, and not run him

         20    over.  And while I sat, I felt the impact

         21    of the car hitting me in the rear.

         22         Q.  When you say to not run him over,

         23    did you observe whether he had the

         24    crosswalk or the green light to cross in

                               Carolyn Chester          42



          1    front of you at that point?

          2         A.  I don't remember what the lights

          3    were doing.  I was concerned about the

          4    pedestrian and not to run him over, and I

          5    was sitting there at the light; never

          6    moved.

          7         Q.  What did the impact feel like?

          8         A.  It felt like somebody had jolted

          9    the whole car.

         10         Q.  Did the vehicle move as a result?

         11         A.  Lightly.

         12         Q.  How did it move?

         13         A.  From the force of the car hitting

         14    me in the rear.

         15         Q.  Was the vehicle pushed forward or

         16    to any other direction as a result of the

         17    impact?

         18         A.  I remember my body being pushed

         19    forward, and then -- yeah.  I remember my

         20    body being pushed forward.

         21         Q.  Was the vehicle moved as a result

         22    of the impact?

         23         A.  I don't remember what the vehicle

         24    was doing.

          1         Q.  Was your foot on the brake at the

          2    time of the impact?

          3         A.  Absolutely.

          4         Q.  Okay.  Did your body strike

          5    anything inside the vehicle as a result of

          6    the impact?

          7         A.  The seatbelt and the steering

          8    wheel.

          9         Q.  What part of your body came into

         10    contact with the steering wheel?

         11         A.  My left shoulder and my chest.

         12         Q.  Did the seatbelt prevent you

         13    from -- did it catch you before you hit the

         14    steering wheel, or what happened?

         15         A.  I think the seatbelt helped me not

         16    impact the steering wheel, so it did hold

         17    me.  But I did still felt a push, and I was

         18    like, oh, my goodness.  I just remember

         19    being -- I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't

         20    believe it.

         21         Q.  So I just wanted to clarify.  Did

         22    you feel the seatbelt caught you, and

         23    that's what came into contact with your

         24    chest and your shoulder?  Or did you

                               Carolyn Chester          44



          1    physically move forward, and you struck the

          2    steering wheel?

          3         A.  I was thrust forward from the

          4    impact of the rear.

          5         Q.  Okay.

          6         A.  And as a result, I felt the

          7    seatbelt on my shoulder, and my chest went

          8    up to the steering wheel.

          9         Q.  Okay.  So it was your chest that

         10    came into contact with the steering

         11    wheel --

         12         A.  The chest and shoulder, because it

         13    was a jolt (indicating) like that.

         14         Q.  Okay.  Did your shoulder actually

         15    hit the steering wheel?

         16         A.  I don't recall.

         17         Q.  Did you strike any other part of

         18    your body on anything else inside the

         19    vehicle?

         20         A.  My whole left side was just

         21    jolted.  My shoulder, my chest, my knee,

         22    all of that was just discombobulated.  I

         23    don't know if that's a word (laughter.)

         24         Q.  Did you strike your left knee on

                               Carolyn Chester          45



          1    anything inside the vehicle?

          2         A.  Whatever the undercarriage was

          3    that was under there.

          4         Q.  Did you hit any other part of

          5    your body on anything else inside the

          6    vehicle?

          7         A.  Not that I recall.

          8         Q.  How would you characterize the

          9    severity of the impact; light, medium,

         10    heavy?

         11         A.  It was startling, and it was

         12    impactful because I don't sit at a light

         13    expecting to be hit.  So I think the fact

         14    that I was hit, and it hit so hard, I think

         15    I was just sitting there like what the hell

         16    just happened.  And it didn't occur to me

         17    that I had been hit until, you know, I kind

         18    of came to and said, "Oh, my God.  I've

         19    been hit."  I looked at my rearview mirror,

         20    and I'm like, I've been hit, so...

         21         Q.  Did you lose consciousness as a

         22    result of the accident?

         23         A.  Not that I recall.

         24         Q.  Okay.  You said you kind of came

                               Carolyn Chester          46



          1    to, so did you black out at any point?

          2         A.  I was startled.  I don't remember

          3    blacking out, but I was startled, you know.

          4    It's like somebody comes up and hits you,

          5    and you didn't see it coming, you know, so

          6    I was startled.

          7         Q.  Were you able to exit the vehicle

          8    at the scene of the accident?

          9         A.  I remember looking -- what was

         10    your question?

         11         Q.  Were you able to get out of the

         12    vehicle at the scene of the accident?

         13         A.  Yes.

         14         Q.  Okay.  What happened when you

         15    exited the car?

         16         A.  I looked in my rearview mirror,

         17    and I saw Mr. Oliver come out with a

         18    cellphone in his hand.

         19         Q.  And then what?

         20         A.  He was apologizing to me.

         21         Q.  And were you still inside the car

         22    at that point, or were you outside --

         23         A.  I was outside.

         24         Q.  Okay.  And what happened after

                               Carolyn Chester          47



          1    that?  Did you have any other

          2    conversations?

          3         A.  I apologized and we exchanged

          4    insurance information.

          5         Q.  Did you look at the damage, or did

          6    you see if there was damage to the rear of

          7    your car?

          8         A.  I looked at the damage.  She has

          9    an emblem on the back that says "MV," and

         10    that looked like it had been pushed in.

         11         Q.  Was there any other damage that

         12    you saw to the rear of the vehicle that you

         13    were driving that day?

         14         A.  That's the only thing that I

         15    recall.

         16         Q.  Okay.  I think your attorney is

         17    going to want to see these.  I'll show you

         18    three photographs that we'll mark as

         19    Chester Exhibits 2, 3 and 4.

         20               (Documents were marked for

         21         identification as Deposition

          1    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

          2         Q.  Ma'am, do you recognize what's

          3    depicted in these three photographs that I

          4    handed you?

          5         A.  Yes.

          6         Q.  What is that?

          7         A.  It's the rear of my daughter's

          8    car.

          9         Q.  Okay.  Do you know who took these

         10    photographs?

         11         A.  No.

         12         Q.  Do these photographs accurately

         13    represent the damage sustained to the

         14    vehicle that you were driving on the date

         15    of the accident?

         16               MR. GOODSTADT:  If you

         17         know.

         18               THE WITNESS:  I don't

         19         know.

         20    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

         21         Q.  Okay.  You talked about part of

         22    the vehicle being pushed in.  Can you

         23    circle with this blue pen what part of the

         24    vehicle you believe was pushed in as a

                               Carolyn Chester          49



          1    result of the accident?

          2         A.  I'm saying where the MV was,

          3    because she had an emblem right there, and

          4    I see a portion of the MV gone, which

          5    indicated to me that part of the vehicle

          6    that was under that sticker was as well

          7    gone.  That's the only thing I can see from

          8    this picture.

          9         Q.  Can you circle the area you

         10    believe was damaged as a result of this

         11    accident?

         12         A.  So I'm just drawing a line right

         13    here (indicating).

         14         Q.  Okay.  Was there any other part of

         15    the vehicle that was damaged that you

         16    observed at the scene of the accident?

         17         A.  That's what I observed at the

         18    scene.  I think they found later more

         19    things wrong, but that's all I observed at

         20    the scene.

         21         Q.  Was the vehicle drivable from the

         22    scene of the accident?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  You said later that there were

                               Carolyn Chester          50



          1    more things wrong.  What happened; what was

          2    found later?

          3         A.  My daughter took it to her own

          4    repair shop, and she had it done under her

          5    insurance.

          6         Q.  Did she tell you what happened to

          7    the car, if there was additional damage to

          8    it?

          9         A.  There was additional damage, but I

         10    don't remember what it was.

         11         Q.  Did you look at the front of my

         12    client's vehicle while you were at the

         13    scene of the accident?

         14         A.  Yes.

         15         Q.  What did you see?

         16         A.  It was pretty messed up.

         17         Q.  Okay.  I'm going to hand you what

         18    was previously identified as Oliver-2 and

         19    Oliver-3.  Do you recognize what's depicted

         20    in these photographs?

         21         A.  Yup.

         22         Q.  Is this the vehicle that was

         23    involved in the accident with you from

         24    August of 2017?

                               Carolyn Chester          51



          1         A.  That's an assumption that I'm

          2    making.

          3               MR. GOODSTADT:  She

          4         doesn't want you to make an

          5         assumption.  She asked you a

          6         question.  Do you recognize

          7         those photographs?

          8               THE WITNESS:  Those

          9         photographs look like his car.

         10    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

         11         Q.  Okay.  In these two photographs,

         12    in Oliver-2 and Oliver-3, do they show what

         13    my client's, Mr. Oliver, vehicle looked

         14    like after the accident occurred?

         15         A.  Yes.

         16         Q.  Did you see any pieces of either

         17    Mr. Oliver's car or your car in the roadway

         18    after the accident?

         19         A.  I don't recall.

         20         Q.  Did you leave the cars where they

         21    were at the scene, or did you move them at

         22    some point?

         23         A.  I drove away after we...

         24         Q.  While you were exchanging

                               Carolyn Chester          52



          1    information, did you leave the cars exactly

          2    where they were when the accident occurred,

          3    or did you move them to the side of the

          4    road?

          5         A.  I don't recall.  I just recall I

          6    was exchanging information.  I don't

          7    remember what we did with the cars.

          8         Q.  Okay.  Did anyone call the

          9    police?

         10         A.  I didn't.

         11         Q.  Why not?

         12         A.  I don't know.

         13         Q.  Were you in any kind of pain at

         14    the scene of the accident?

         15         A.  I was just distraught.

         16         Q.  Did you call anyone from the scene

         17    of the accident?

         18         A.  I called my daughter.

         19         Q.  Did your daughter come to the

         20    scene?

         21         A.  No.

         22         Q.  Do you know of any witnesses to

         23    the accident?

         24         A.  No.

                               Carolyn Chester          53



          1         Q.  Did anyone else come to the scene

          2    of the accident after the accident

          3    occurred?

          4         A.  Not that I recall.

          5         Q.  Were you in pain at the scene of

          6    the accident?

          7         A.  I was just distraught.  I don't

          8    know if I was in pain or not.  I was

          9    just -- I was really, really upset.  I just

         10    couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe

         11    it.

         12         Q.  Did an ambulance arrive at the

         13    scene of the accident?

         14         A.  Not that I recall.

         15         Q.  When was the first time that you

         16    recall experiencing pain in any part of

         17    your body after the accident?

         18         A.  Later that night.

         19         Q.  And what was bothering you at that

         20    time?

         21         A.  Neck, shoulders, upper back.  Just

         22    my...

         23         Q.  Did you have any left knee pain?

         24         A.  Say that again?

                               Carolyn Chester          54



          1         Q.  Did you have any left knee pain?

          2         A.  That was an injury that I had

          3    prior to the accident in my left knee,

          4    and I felt it even more after this

          5    situation.

          6         Q.  How did your left knee feel before

          7    this accident?

          8         A.  We already have this on record,

          9    the torn meniscus.

         10         Q.  Okay.  And when you had the torn

         11    meniscus, did you have surgery for that?

         12         A.  No.

         13         Q.  Have you had surgery since the

         14    time that you had the torn meniscus?

         15         A.  No.

         16         Q.  Have you had treatment for your

         17    left knee?

         18         A.  Yes.

         19         Q.  What kind of treatment have you

         20    had?

         21         A.  Physical therapy.

         22         Q.  Where did you have the physical

         23    therapy?

         24         A.  The Rothman doctor sent me there.

                               Carolyn Chester          55



          1         Q.  Is that before the accident or

          2    after?

          3         A.  I don't recall.  I go currently.

          4         Q.  Had any doctor talked to you about

          5    having surgery on your left knee before

          6    the --

          7               MR. GOODSTADT:  I'm going

          8         to object.  I don't think

          9         there's any claim that there's

         10         any relationship with her knee

         11         situation to the motor vehicle

         12         accident.

         13               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Well,

         14         there are knee complaints noted

         15         after the accident.  She's

         16         testified that she hit her left

         17         knee on the underpart of the car

         18         and --

         19               MR. GOODSTADT:  I

         20         understand that, but I don't

         21         think there's any medical

         22         evidence that we've submitted

         23         that indicates any knee

         24         condition was caused, whether

                               Carolyn Chester          56



          1         directly or indirectly, as a

          2         result of the collision, but if

          3         you want to keep asking her, you

          4         keep going.  I'm just telling

          5         you there's no medical evidence

          6         that indicates that.

          7               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  That's

          8         fine.  But if she's going to

          9         testify that she hit her left

         10         knee --

         11               MR. GOODSTADT:  She's not

         12         going to testify that there's

         13         any correlation between any knee

         14         complaints that she may have and

         15         the motor vehicle collision, nor

         16         will any doctor.  You have the

         17         report from Dr. Allen.

         18               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Okay.

         19    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

         20         Q.  Other than the therapy at Rothman,

         21    did you treat anywhere else for your left

         22    knee?

         23         A.  No.

         24         Q.  Do you have plans to get surgery

                               Carolyn Chester          57



          1    on your left knee?

          2         A.  I don't know.

          3         Q.  Are you able to walk with the torn

          4    meniscus?

          5         A.  I walked here today.

          6         Q.  How does the torn meniscus affect

          7    you?

          8         A.  The discomfort.

          9         Q.  Before the accident, so before

         10    August of 2017, did you have any

         11    limitations as a result of your left knee

         12    having the torn meniscus?

         13         A.  No.

         14         Q.  You were able to do everything

         15    as you had before you had the torn

         16    meniscus?

         17         A.  Yes.

         18         Q.  Did your left knee pain worsen

         19    after the August 2017 accident?

         20         A.  It's something that hurts like a

         21    toothache, so if it was worse or better, it

         22    just hurt.

         23         Q.  Okay.  My question was, did it get

         24    worse after the 2017 accident?

                               Carolyn Chester          58



          1         A.  I don't recall.

          2         Q.  You said that you had pain in your

          3    shoulder as a result of the accident.  Was

          4    it both shoulders?

          5         A.  It hurt more in the left than it

          6    did the right.

          7         Q.  As you sit here today, do you

          8    still have pain in your neck?

          9         A.  All the time.  Yes.

         10         Q.  As you sit here today, do you

         11    still have pain in your shoulders?

         12         A.  Yes.

         13         Q.  As you sit here today, do you

         14    still have pain in your upper back?

         15         A.  Yes.

         16         Q.  Do you still have the left knee

         17    pain?

         18         A.  Yes.

         19         Q.  Have your pain levels changed at

         20    all since the time of the accident?  So,

         21    from when you initially felt the neck pain,

         22    the shoulder pain, the upper back pain, the

         23    left knee pain, has that changed or stayed

         24    completely the same?

                               Carolyn Chester          59



          1         A.  It's worse.

          2         Q.  When did it get worse?

          3         A.  Every night when I sleep.

          4         Q.  Okay.  My question was, has your

          5    pain changed at all.  You told me it got

          6    worse --

          7               MR. GOODSTADT:  You mean

          8         during the totality of her

          9         treatment, every minute, every

         10         month, every week, or just

         11         between when it first started

         12         and today?

         13               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Between

         14         when it first started and today.

         15               MR. GOODSTADT:  Okay.  Do

         16         you understand the question now?

         17               THE WITNESS:  These things

         18         didn't hurt me before the

         19         accident.  They hurt me every

         20         day now.

         21               MR. GOODSTADT:  She's

         22         asking you to compare and

         23         contrast the pain that you had

         24         in your neck, shoulders and

                               Carolyn Chester          60



          1         upper back right after the

          2         accident versus how it is today.

          3               Is that what you're

          4         asking?

          5               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Yes.

          6               MR. GOODSTADT:  Okay.

          7               THE WITNESS:  And you want

          8         to know if it's worse, better?

          9    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

         10         Q.  Right.  Is it the same?  Has it

         11    changed?

         12         A.  It changes.  It has changed for

         13    the worst.

         14         Q.  How did it change for the worst?

         15         A.  When it's cold or when I go to bed

         16    at night.  I have a specialized mattress

         17    that I bought that I had no pain in before

         18    the accident, and now, every night I wake

         19    up, I have pain in that same bed that gave

         20    me comfort.  Tempur-Pedic.

         21         Q.  When did you buy the mattress?

         22         A.  I bought the mattress before my

         23    husband died in 2016, and now I have a

         24    $9,000 bed that I don't sleep comfortably

          1    in anymore.

          2         Q.  Okay.  So your testimony is that

          3    you're having more pain today than you did

          4    immediately after the accident when you

          5    first felt the pain in your neck, shoulder,

          6    upper back and left knee?

          7         A.  Correct.

          8         Q.  Did you have any broken bones or

          9    fractures as a result of the accident?

         10         A.  No.

         11         Q.  Did you have any cuts or bleeding?

         12         A.  No.

         13         Q.  Did any part of your pain ever

         14    travel or radiate to any other part of your

         15    body?

         16         A.  Sometimes down my arm, my left

         17    arm.

         18         Q.  Where does that pain start?

         19         A.  From the shoulder to the elbow.

         20         Q.  From your left shoulder down to

         21    your left elbow?

         22         A.  Yes.

         23         Q.  And how often do you experience

         24    that?

          1         A.  Two, three times a week.

          2         Q.  Did any doctor ever recommend or

          3    discuss an EMG with you?

          4         A.  I'm not sure.  Dr. Allen did

          5    something.

          6         Q.  An EMG is a nerve test where

          7    they're testing to see if you have nerve

          8    damage.

          9         A.  Mm-hmm.

         10         Q.  Do you remember any doctor ever

         11    discussing that with you?

         12               MR. GOODSTADT:  She just

         13         said Dr. Allen.

         14               THE WITNESS:  Dr. Allen.

         15    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

         16         Q.  Did you ever have a nerve test

         17    performed?

         18         A.  I remember an MRI.  That's all I

         19    remember.

         20         Q.  Do you know why you didn't have an

         21    EMG test?

         22         A.  You have to ask the doctor.

         23         Q.  Well, did they recommend that you

         24    do one, or did you tell them that you

                               Carolyn Chester          63



          1    didn't want to do one?  What happened?

          2         A.  I remember Dr. Allen sending me

          3    for an MRI, and I had that done.

          4         Q.  Okay.  And Dr. Allen talked to you

          5    about an EMG?

          6         A.  I don't remember.  I didn't have

          7    an EMG.  I had an MRI, and the EMG, I don't

          8    remember.

          9         Q.  Do you have any other symptoms of

         10    radiating pain, any numbness or tingling,

         11    in any other part of your body after the

         12    accident?

         13         A.  No.

         14         Q.  When did that pain traveling from

         15    your left shoulder to your left elbow

         16    begin?

         17         A.  This year.

         18         Q.  When this year?

         19         A.  Like, the last two, three months.

         20         Q.  Why did it start two or

         21    three months ago?

         22         A.  I don't know.

         23         Q.  Was there any kind of incident or

         24    accident that happened two or three months

                               Carolyn Chester          64



          1    ago?

          2         A.  No.

          3         Q.  Had you ever had those kinds of

          4    symptoms or pain traveling from your left

          5    shoulder to your left elbow before two or

          6    three months ago?

          7         A.  No.

          8         Q.  When was the first time that you

          9    sought any kind of medical treatment after

         10    the August 2017 accident?

         11         A.  When?

         12         Q.  Yes.

         13         A.  It happened on the 7th.  I had a

         14    previous appointment that I had to keep on

         15    the 8th, and I sought treatment at Patient

         16    First after the 8th.

         17         Q.  And when you say a previous

         18    appointment, with who?

         19         A.  I had plans outside the state that

         20    I couldn't cancel.

         21         Q.  What kind of plans?

         22         A.  Plans to visit a friend 'cause

         23    it was an anniversary of my husband's

         24    death.

                               Carolyn Chester          65



          1         Q.  I'd like to offer you my

          2    condolences for your loss.

          3         A.  Thank you.

          4         Q.  When did your husband pass?

          5         A.  February 8th of '17.

          6         Q.  Where were the plans to go for the

          7    anniversary of his passing?

          8         A.  Atlanta.

          9         Q.  How long were you in Atlanta for?

         10         A.  Till I got back.  I think it was a

         11    weekend, but it wasn't a good trip.

         12         Q.  Did you fly there or drive there?

         13         A.  I flew.

         14         Q.  Did you have any kind of

         15    difficulties with the flight?

         16         A.  Yes.  A lot of difficulty.

         17         Q.  What happened?

         18         A.  'Cause I couldn't carry 'cause I

         19    was in pain, but I had already made the

         20    plans, so...

         21         Q.  You couldn't carry your luggage?

         22         A.  No.  I had trouble for everything,

         23    carrying my luggage, walking, just my

         24    handbag.  I tipped a lot.  I remember

                               Carolyn Chester          66



          1    tipping a lot asking bell caps to help me

          2    'cause I needed assistance.  I was pretty

          3    miserable the whole time.

          4         Q.  You said when you came back, you

          5    went to Patient First?

          6         A.  Absolutely.  Yes.

          7         Q.  And what did they do for you

          8    there?

          9         A.  I think they may have given me

         10    something for the discomfort, some kind of

         11    medicine for the pain, and told me to go to

         12    an orthopedic doctor.  And that's when I

         13    went to Rothman.

         14         Q.  What did they do for you at

         15    Rothman?

         16         A.  He referred me to physical

         17    therapy.  We talked about other forms of

         18    treatment, but I don't remember all of what

         19    it was.

         20         Q.  And did you go for therapy?

         21         A.  I did.

         22         Q.  Where did you go for that?

         23         A.  NovaCare, I think it was.

         24         Q.  What did they do for you at

                               Carolyn Chester          67



          1    NovaCare?

          2         A.  They evaluated me.

          3         Q.  Okay.

          4         A.  They gave me heat and cold packs,

          5    stimulation, massage and exercise.

          6         Q.  How many times did you treat with

          7    NovaCare?

          8         A.  I think it was, like, twice a

          9    week.

         10         Q.  When did you first start treating

         11    with them?

         12         A.  I don't remember the dates

         13    exactly.

         14         Q.  And how long did you continue to

         15    treat with them for?

         16         A.  Probably most of that, most of

         17    2017.

         18         Q.  Okay.  Were you discharged from

         19    them, or did you stop going?

         20         A.  I sought treatment in the water,

         21    in the pool.  Yeah, I went to another

         22    facility that had treatment that you did in

         23    the warm water.

         24         Q.  Okay.  We'll talk about that, but

                               Carolyn Chester          68



          1    were you discharged from NovaCare Rehab, or

          2    did you stop going?

          3         A.  I think when I went to the doctor

          4    maybe the beginning of the next year, he

          5    referred me to do the water 'cause I wasn't

          6    feeling as though as I was getting the

          7    results at NovaCare.

          8         Q.  Was the therapy at NovaCare

          9    helping?

         10         A.  It stayed the same.  It wasn't

         11    anything that was significantly better as a

         12    result.

         13         Q.  When did you start going for the

         14    water therapy?

         15         A.  Sometime in '18.

         16         Q.  And how often were you treating

         17    with them?

         18         A.  Maybe once a week, 'cause it

         19    wasn't close.  It was far.

         20         Q.  Where were they located?

         21         A.  Out near City Line Avenue.

         22         Q.  Did you try to look for a facility

         23    that was closer to you?

         24         A.  I did, but it wasn't -- it

                               Carolyn Chester          69



          1    wasn't a pool.  It was just like a big

          2    bathtub.

          3         Q.  What do you mean?

          4         A.  At the City Line Avenue, it was a

          5    recreational center, and it was a

          6    therapeutic pool.  At the other place, it

          7    was just a large like tub.  It wasn't a

          8    pool, so I didn't get the same type of

          9    results from that.

         10         Q.  What was the other place, the one

         11    that had like a bathtub?

         12         A.  I don't remember the name of it.

         13    I just remember...

         14         Q.  Where was it?

         15         A.  Near Cheltenham Avenue.  I see it,

         16    but I don't remember the street.

         17         Q.  Is it by any landmarks?

         18         A.  In, like, the Cedarbrook Mall, or

         19    it used to be Cedarbrook Mall.

         20         Q.  And how many times did you try to

         21    go there?

         22         A.  About once a week.

         23         Q.  To the one near the Cedarbrook

         24    Mall?

                               Carolyn Chester          70



          1         A.  Mm-hmm.

          2         Q.  Is this a yes?

          3         A.  The one near the Cedarbrook Mall,

          4    yes.

          5         Q.  Okay.  You said once a week.  How

          6    many weeks did you try going there?

          7         A.  Not long.  Maybe a month or so.

          8         Q.  Okay.  What part of your body did

          9    you have the MRI of?

         10         A.  With -- MRI with?

         11         Q.  You told me you had an MRI after

         12    the accident --

         13         A.  Dr. Allen.

         14         Q.  What part of the body did you have

         15    the MRI of?

         16         A.  I think it was upper -- upper

         17    body.

         18         Q.  Did any doctor discuss the results

         19    of the MRI with you?

         20         A.  I don't remember.

         21         Q.  Did your treatment change after

         22    you had the MRI?

         23         A.  No.

         24         Q.  Did any doctor discuss or

          1    recommend injections?

          2         A.  Certain injections increase your

          3    blood sugars, so I think it was -- one of

          4    the medicines makes your blood sugar

          5    elevated, so we weren't going to use that

          6    as an option.  And that might have been my

          7    only one, so I never had them, at least not

          8    that injection.

          9         Q.  Okay.  So who did you talk to?

         10         A.  I think the Rothman doctor.

         11         Q.  Okay.  So the doctor at Rothman

         12    talked to you about a specific type of

         13    injection, and it was your understanding

         14    that it would make your blood sugars

         15    rise?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17         Q.  So you didn't want to undergo it

         18    for that reason?

         19         A.  Yes.

         20         Q.  Did they talk to you about which

         21    part of your body you should consider

         22    injections to?

         23         A.  I'm not sure which part he was

         24    going to do.

          1         Q.  Okay.  Did you ever discuss any

          2    other types of injections with any other

          3    doctors?

          4         A.  No.

          5               THE WITNESS:  I need to go

          6         bathroom.

          7               MR. GOODSTADT:  Okay.

         12               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Can you

         14                      - - -

         19         Q.  Did any doctor discuss or

         20    recommend surgery with you to any part of

         21    your body after the accident?

         22         A.  No.

         23         Q.  Did you have any other treatment

         24    after the August 2017 accident that we

                               Carolyn Chester          73



          1    haven't yet talked about?

          2         A.  After the what -- what date?

          3         Q.  The accident that we're here for

          4    today.

          5         A.  Did I have any what?

          6         Q.  Did you have any other treatment

          7    that we haven't yet talked about?

          8         A.  No.

          9         Q.  Do you have any plans for any

         10    future treatment?

         11               MR. GOODSTADT:  Can I

         12         interject?  I don't mean to

         13         mis- -- because you asked her

         14         about therapy with NovaCare, but

         15         she went back to NovaCare a year

         16         later, so she technically hasn't

         17         talked about it.  She talked

         18         about NovaCare, but she did go

         19         back.  I don't think you --

         20               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  She

         21         didn't talk about that yet, so

         22         we can --

         23               MR. GOODSTADT:  We talked

         24         about the NovaCare, but not the

                               Carolyn Chester          74



          1         fact she went back.

          2               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Right,

          3         not that she went back.

          4    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

          5         Q.  Okay.  So you went back to

          6    NovaCare?

          7         A.  Yeah.

          8         Q.  Why did you do that?

          9         A.  I was hurting.

         10         Q.  Why did you decide to go back to

         11    NovaCare?

         12         A.  Because I was hurting.

         13         Q.  Why that facility specifically?

         14         A.  It was close to home.

         15         Q.  And who referred you to NovaCare

         16    Rehab?

         17         A.  Rothman.

         18         Q.  Okay.  And who had referred you to

         19    Rothman?

         20         A.  Patient First.

         21         Q.  Had you ever been to that

         22    Patient First before the date of the

         23    accident?

         24         A.  Have I ever been there before?

                               Carolyn Chester          75



          1         Q.  Yes?

          2         A.  Before or after the accident?

          3         Q.  Before the accident.

          4         A.  No.

          5         Q.  Okay.  Now I'm going to ask it

          6    again.  Did you have any other treatment

          7    that we haven't yet talked about?

          8         A.  Any other what?

          9         Q.  Any other treatment that we

         10    haven't yet talked about.

         11               MR. GOODSTADT:  Can I

         12         interject again?  Did we include

         13         Allen?  I know that she saw him,

         14         and I know she's been back, so I

         15         don't know if that characterizes

         16         as other treatment.

         17               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  It

         18         certainly would.

         19               THE WITNESS:  We talked

         20         about the MRI, and that's who

         21         sent me for the MRI.

         22    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

         23         Q.  Did you see Dr. Allen once or more

         24    than once?

                               Carolyn Chester          76



          1         A.  More than once.

          2         Q.  Okay.  How many times have you

          3    seen him?

          4         A.  I don't remember.  Two, three

          5    times maybe.

          6         Q.  When is the last time you saw

          7    him?

          8         A.  About two weeks -- two,

          9    three weeks ago.  Recently.

         10         Q.  Why did you see him two or

         11    three weeks ago?

         12         A.  Because of the pain in my arm, my

         13    left arm.

         14         Q.  The left arm?

         15         A.  Yes.

         16         Q.  What did he do for you two or

         17    three weeks ago?

         18         A.  He suggested that I have an MRI.

         19         Q.  To what part of your body?

         20         A.  I just remember the upper.

         21         Q.  Okay.  So when you went to see

         22    him two to three weeks ago, he suggested

         23    another MRI of the upper part of your

         24    body?

                               Carolyn Chester          77



          1         A.  I just remember the MRI.  He was

          2    back and forth about should we or should we

          3    not.

          4         Q.  Okay.  Are you talking about the

          5    MRI that you had back in August of 2017, or

          6    were you recommended for another MRI two or

          7    three weeks ago?

          8         A.  I was recommended for another

          9    one.

         10         Q.  Okay.  Do you have a date

         11    scheduled for that?

         12         A.  Do I have a date scheduled for

         13    that?

         14         Q.  For the MRI.

         15         A.  I've had an MRI.

         16         Q.  You just told me you were

         17    recommended for another MRI two or

         18    three weeks ago.  Do you have a date

         19    scheduled for that MRI?

         20         A.  I already had it.

         21         Q.  Yes.  I know you had an MRI --

         22               MR. GOODSTADT:  No.  She's

         23         saying she had a new MRI.

          1         Q.  When?

          2         A.  About two, three weeks ago.

          3         Q.  Okay.  And what were the results

          4    of that MRI?

          5         A.  He said he was going to write it

          6    on paper, Dr. Allen.

          7         Q.  Do you have a follow-up

          8    appointment with him scheduled?

          9         A.  No.

         10         Q.  Okay.  Other than the MRI, what

         11    did Dr. Allen discuss with you at the last

         12    appointment?

         13         A.  He talked about my injuries and

         14    why I was having the pain that I was

         15    having.

         16         Q.  Did he recommend any other

         17    treatment?

         18         A.  No.

         19         Q.  As you sit here today, do you have

         20    any other plans for any other future

         21    treatment?

         22         A.  I don't have any plans currently,

         23    not to say that I won't.

         24         Q.  Are you considering any other

                               Carolyn Chester          79



          1    treatment as you sit here today?

          2         A.  If the doctor recommends it, yes.

          3         Q.  Well, have you talked to any other

          4    doctor about any other treatment?

          5         A.  No.  But if I have a pain, I'm

          6    going to go to the doctor.

          7         Q.  Was there any point after the

          8    August 2017 accident where your injuries

          9    that you are claiming from the accident

         10    were feeling better, where they were

         11    improving?

         12         A.  They were feeling better after I

         13    got out of the pool therapy, but as soon as

         14    I got in the car and started driving or

         15    went to bed that night, that bed wasn't

         16    feeling as good as it used to in return.

         17         Q.  Now, has any doctor prescribed

         18    you medications after the August 2017

         19    accident?

         20         A.  Yeah.

         21         Q.  What kind of medications were

         22    prescribed to you?

         23         A.  My -- best I can recollect is

         24    Ibuprofen.

                               Carolyn Chester          80



          1         Q.  Who prescribed that for you?

          2         A.  I don't remember whose name is on

          3    the bottle.  I just know where it is.

          4         Q.  Was that your primary care doctor,

          5    your therapist, someone else?

          6         A.  I don't remember, dear.  I don't

          7    remember.  I just know I have it, and I had

          8    it sometime after the accident.  But I

          9    don't remember who prescribed it.

         10         Q.  When was the last time you had it

         11    filled?

         12         A.  Recently.

         13         Q.  Where do you have it filled?

         14         A.  CVS.

         15         Q.  Which one?

         16         A.  Jenkintown, Old York Road, 611.

         17         Q.  Did you have any other medications

         18    prescribed to you after the accident?

         19         A.  No.  Not for the injuries from the

         20    accident, no.

         21         Q.  Do you have health insurance?

         22         A.  Yes.

         23         Q.  With who?

         24         A.  Blue Cross.

                               Carolyn Chester          81



          1         Q.  How long have you had health

          2    insurance with Blue Cross?

          3         A.  Since the 1990s.  Since I was

          4    married.

          5         Q.  From the time of the accident

          6    until now, have you had any gaps in health

          7    insurance coverage, meaning --

          8         A.  No.

          9         Q.  -- has there ever been a time you

         10    didn't have health insurance from the time

         11    of the accident until now?

         12         A.  Never.

         13         Q.  How has this accident affected

         14    you?  You talked a little bit about how --

         15    or some of the ways it's affected you, but

         16    I'd like to know how it affected you in

         17    every part of your life.

         18         A.  It affects my quality of life in

         19    terms of my rest and my sleep.  The bed

         20    that I bought -- my husband bought for me

         21    for comfort is no longer giving me that, so

         22    every evening I wake up during the night,

         23    and in the morning, not feeling the comfort

         24    and rest that I once did.

          1             My abilities to interact with my

          2    three grandsons, 9-year-old twins and

          3    11-year-old, has diminished.  So, you know,

          4    stuff like bowling and basketball and just

          5    the things that boys do, I can't really

          6    participate in those activities anymore.

          7    No more bowling.

          8             No more things that I have to

          9    really exert myself; reaching my hands

         10    above my head, that kind of stuff.  I

         11    can't really carry anything really heavy

         12    'cause with that, I suffer discomfort,

         13    and sometimes I need things that I just

         14    don't have the strength to carry without

         15    pain.

         16         Q.  Did you try to do bowling and

         17    basketball with your grandsons after the

         18    accident?

         19         A.  (Laughter) it wasn't very

         20    successful, no.

         21         Q.  Okay.  So you tried once or

         22    twice?

         23         A.  I tried once with the bowling, and

         24    that was a disaster.  And the basketball,

          1    my one grandson is in a league, so he just

          2    kind of -- I just kind of watch now

          3    throwing the ball up in the hoops, and

          4    raising my hands above my head is not a

          5    comfortable position to be in.  And he's

          6    11, so he takes it very seriously.

          7         Q.  What happened when you tried the

          8    bowling; was it the same issue with --

          9         A.  It was too heavy.  The ball was

         10    too heavy, and if I found a ball that was

         11    comfortable, it was too small for my

         12    fingers to go in, so I just kind of gave my

         13    lane to somebody else.

         14         Q.  Anything else that's been

         15    affected?

         16         A.  Just I can't always carry the

         17    things that I need to carry, like a snack

         18    or lunch or something that I need to have

         19    with me most times 'cause I'm Type 1

         20    diabetic.

         21         Q.  Okay.  Did you have any of these

         22    types of limitations that you talked about,

         23    issues with your sleeping, interacting with

         24    your grandsons, difficulty with carrying

          1    heavy things, reaching things, before the

          2    August 2017 accident?

          3         A.  Not at all, especially the bed,

          4    sleeping.  Oh, my gosh.  We got customized

          5    mattresses for both of us to make sure that

          6    he was comfortable after having strokes,

          7    and I was comfortable because we were

          8    getting new beds.  And I shopped twice for

          9    a new mattress for myself and finally had

         10    found the ultimate one, and that one just

         11    causes me pain.  Tried to adjust the head,

         12    adjust the feet, different pillows, nothing

         13    seems to do the trick.

         14         Q.  Is it that you're waking up during

         15    the night, or is it that you just wake up

         16    and just feel uncomfortable?

         17         A.  I feel uncomfortable.  Where that

         18    bed just caused me to sink into a deep

         19    sleep, now I'm constantly tossing and

         20    turning.  And my Fitbit tells me that I'm

         21    12 times restless during the night, so I

         22    know that I'm not resting comfortably.  And

         23    before the accident, that was my dream, to

         24    get into that bed.  It's not anymore, so

                               Carolyn Chester          85



          1    it's almost like I need to toss it out,

          2    even though I'm still paying for it, and

          3    get something else.

          4         Q.  Did you have any kind of pain or

          5    discomfort in your neck before the

          6    August 2017 accident?

          7         A.  No.

          8         Q.  Did you have any kind of pain or

          9    discomfort in your -- let's start with your

         10    left shoulder.  Did you have any kind of

         11    pain or discomfort in your left shoulder

         12    before the August 2017 accident?

         13         A.  No.  I was enjoying life with my

         14    grandbabies.

         15         Q.  Did you have any pain or

         16    discomfort in the right shoulder before the

         17    August 22017 accident?

         18         A.  I had no pain or discomfort in my

         19    neck, or left or right shoulder, or upper

         20    back before the accident.

         21         Q.  Were you having chest pain before

         22    the accident?

         23         A.  The chest pain was just recent.

         24         Q.  Okay.  So that's a no?

                               Carolyn Chester          86



          1         A.  No, I wasn't having chest pain

          2    before the accident.

          3         Q.  But the left knee was bothering

          4    you before the accident, correct?

          5         A.  Correct.

          6         Q.  Okay.  Before August of 2017,

          7    did you have an MRI of any part of your

          8    body?

          9               MR. GOODSTADT:  You mean

         10         ever?

         11               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Say in

         12         the last ten years.

         13               THE WITNESS:  Maybe.

         14    BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

         15         Q.  Do you remember having an MRI of

         16    your neck or your back in the last

         17    ten years before the accident?

         18         A.  I don't remember.

         19         Q.  Okay.  Just a couple more

         20    questions.

         21             So there was a restriction on your

         22    license for corrective lenses.  Do you wear

         23    contact lenses, glasses?

         24         A.  I wear glasses.

                               Carolyn Chester          87



          1         Q.  Okay.  Do you wear them all the

          2    time or just occasionally?

          3         A.  I wear them a lot.  I wear them.

          4    I wear them a lot.

          5         Q.  Do you wear them all the time when

          6    you drive?

          7         A.  I wear them more at night than

          8    through the -- during the day.

          9         Q.  Why is that?

         10         A.  I just like to wear them at

         11    night.

         12         Q.  Okay.  Who's your eye doctor?

         13         A.  Dr. Lynn.

         14         Q.  Where is Dr. Lynn located?

         15         A.  On Chestnut Street.

         16         Q.  Were you wearing glasses on the

         17    date of the accident?

         18         A.  No.

         19         Q.  Did you have any difficulties

         20    with your vision on the date of the

         21    accident?

         22         A.  No.

         23         Q.  Had any doctor discussed or

         24    recommend injections with you before the

                               Carolyn Chester          88



          1    August 2017 accident?

          2         A.  No.

          3         Q.  Are you doing any kind of at-home

          4    therapy or anything else for your pain in

          5    between your treatment at NovaCare and in

          6    between the visits that you had at the

          7    water therapy?

          8         A.  They give you a paper to take home

          9    of exercises to do at home when they

         10    discharge you.

         11         Q.  And were you doing them?

         12         A.  Sometimes.

         13         Q.  How often would you do them?

         14         A.  Like, every two, three weeks I

         15    would have an opportunity to do them, and I

         16    would do them, like, on Monday, Wednesday

         17    and Friday every week.  Or, especially, I

         18    would do them if I was having some kind of

         19    increased pain, so...

         20         Q.  Did any doctor ever prescribe or

         21    recommend any kind of assistive devices

         22    like a neck brace a back brace?

         23         A.  They gave me these little things,

         24    patches, you put on.  And you turn it on,

                               Carolyn Chester          89



          1    and it stimulates.

          2         Q.  A TENS unit?

          3         A.  I'm not sure of the name of it.  I

          4    just know what it does.

          5         Q.  Have you used that device they

          6    gave you?

          7         A.  I do.

          8         Q.  How often do you use it?

          9         A.  Probably the same days I do the

         10    exercise the three times a week.

         11         Q.  And is that still something that

         12    you're doing?

         13         A.  Yes.

         14         Q.  Had you ever used one of those

         15    devices before the accident in August of

         16    2017?

         17         A.  They gave it to me during that

         18    timeframe.  That's when I got it, after the

         19    accident in 2017.

         20         Q.  Okay.  But you never used one

         21    before then?

         22         A.  No, never have.

         23         Q.  Okay.

            6                       DIRECT EXAMINATION

            7    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            8         Q.  Hello again, Mr. Cowley.  Again, my name is 

            9    John Robinson.  We just met very briefly just before we 

           10    started here, correct?

           11         A.  Correct. 

           12         Q.  All right.  Well, thank you for coming here so 

           13    we can talk to you a little bit about your report that 

           14    you issued in this case.  All right?

           15                   MR. ROBINSON:  Counsel, usual 

           16              stipulations?  

           17                   MR. FOTI:  Yes.

           18                   MR. COYNE:  Yes.

           19    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           20         Q.  All right.  So let -- how many times have you 

           21    been deposed?

           22         A.  I don't know the exact number, but I would say 

           23    roughly eight or nine times.

           24         Q.  All right.  I know we have a list of prior 

           25    testimony from you.  Is that list exhaustive or is there 








                                                                          


            1    some prior to that list?

            2         A.  I only started forensic work probably five 

            3    years ago, so I think there is one or two more that need 

            4    to be added to it since I last issued my report     

            5    but . . . 

            6         Q.  All right.  So there's a couple that are more 

            7    recent than the last one that shows up in your report, 

            8    correct?

            9         A.  Correct.

           10         Q.  When were those?

           11         A.  Oh, I think it was around October of last year 

           12    maybe, but I -- don't hold me to that.  I need to 

           13    probably refer to my latest Rules 26.

           14         Q.  Okay.  And so, in any event, you've deposed -- 

           15    you've been deposed two times since then.  Do you recall 

           16    generally the subject matter of the cases at issue?

           17         A.  I'm trying to think.  I think one was a -- a 

           18    mower rollover situation.

           19         Q.  Okay.  And do you know what the other one was?

           20         A.  You know, I'd have to look at -- I'd have to 

           21    look and see.  I can't remember.

           22         Q.  Okay.  Well -- and, yeah, try to keep your 

           23    voice up for the Court Reporter. 

           24         A.  I'm sorry.

           25         Q.  Since it's only been so many times that you've 








                                                                          


            1    been deposed, let me just go over some basic ground 

            2    rules.  I'll do it quickly.  

            3             Obviously, the Court Reporter here needs to 

            4    take down everything that both you and I say.  So try to 

            5    make sure, A, you keep your voice up; B, you give 

            6    audible responses to the questions so that she can 

            7    understand and type your testimony.  And try to let me 

            8    complete my question before you answer the question so 

            9    that she can take down everything that both of us say.  

           10    All right?

           11         A.  Sounds good to me.

           12         Q.  Okay.  Things like nods of the head, uh-huhs 

           13    and uh-uhs don't come out clear, so try to use yes or no 

           14    when you can.  All right?

           15         A.  We'll try our best.

           16         Q.  All right.  If I ask you a question that you're 

           17    struggling to understand, it's very -- we're talking 

           18    technical material here.  And if I ask a question that 

           19    doesn't make sense in the context of how I ask it, 

           20    please just tell me and I'll attempt to rephrase the 

           21    question.  All right?

           22         A.  I will.

           23         Q.  All right.  If you answer the question, I'll 

           24    operate on the assumption you understood it.  Fair?

           25         A.  Not fair.  I don't -- if you ask me the 








                                                                          


            1    question and I don't understand it, I may give you an 

            2    answer so . . .  

            3         Q.  All right.  But if I ask you a question that 

            4    you don't understand, I would like to ask you at the 

            5    beginning of the deposition to let me know.  Okay?

            6         A.  Well, we'll try our best.

            7         Q.  Fair enough.  

            8         A.  But I may miss.

            9         Q.  Okay.  If you need to take a break at any point 

           10    in time, say the word.  We'll take a break.  I have no 

           11    problem with that.  All right?

           12         A.  All right.

           13         Q.  If I have a question pending, I may ask you to 

           14    answer that question, but we'll certainly honor your 

           15    need for a break.  Fair?

           16         A.  I understand.

           17         Q.  All right.  Let me just start with -- just 

           18    quickly -- I'm going to hand you what's been marked as 

           19    Exhibit A to -- for the deposition here today, 

           20    which this is the Notice of Deposition that actually got 

           21    issued yesterday and served on the parties.  Have you 

           22    had an opportunity to review this Notice of Deposition?

           23         A.  I was actually on the airplane, so it came 

           24    rather late for me.  But, yes, I did have a chance to 

           25    read through it, look at the -- at the one before.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  It's -- it's similar -- 

            2         A.  It's got a few changes in terms of dates and --

            3         Q.  Correct.  And I understand that, in addition to 

            4    the materials that you had produced previously, you've 

            5    now provided to us some billing records that relate to 

            6    this case?

            7         A.  That's correct.

            8         Q.  All right.  

            9                   MR. ROBINSON:  And why don't we mark 

           10              these.  Well, you know what?  We've 

           11              already premarked B, C, D and E.  Let's 

           12              make that -- let's make that A-1.  

           13                        (Defendants' Exhibit A-1,

           14                         billing records,

           15                         marked for identification.)

           16    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           17         Q.  I'll hand you what has been marked as some 

           18    billing records that were produced to us this morning 

           19    which have been marked as Exhibit A-1.  Do you recognize 

           20    those documents?

           21         A.  Honestly, they're available online.  So most of 

           22    the times, I don't really look at these documents.  But 

           23    they are, in fact, the ones I -- I, in fact, issued.

           24         Q.  Okay.  And are those -- I haven't had a chance 

           25    to scour them.  Are those billing records current 








                                                                          


            1    through today, or do they stop at some point in time and 

            2    you'll have additional billing to do?

            3         A.  I -- I bill to the end of the month.  And, 

            4    basically, every first of the month, I issue my 

            5    invoices.

            6         Q.  All right.  So if anything -- I haven't looked 

            7    at them.  Do they include billing through the end of 

            8    July?

            9         A.  They do, yes.

           10         Q.  All right.  Have you done any additional work 

           11    since the end of July to prepare for today?

           12         A.  I have, yes.

           13         Q.  Can you estimate approximately how many hours?

           14         A.  I've done probably an hour and 75 minutes -- 

           15    no, 1.5 --  1.75 hours.  I do it in quarter-of-hours 

           16    increments.

           17         Q.  Okay.  So --

           18         A.  One and three-quarters, I would say.

           19         Q.  All right.  So since the beginning of August, 

           20    you've worked another hour and three-quarters?

           21         A.  Yeah.

           22         Q.  All right.  Did you have an opportunity to meet 

           23    with counsel to prepare for today?

           24         A.  I did.  So that would add another hour.

           25         Q.  All right.  All right.  So an additional hour 








                                                                          


            1    to prepare?

            2         A.  Right.

            3         Q.  Okay.  Did you meet with Attorney Rosetti or 

            4    Attorney Foti or both?

            5         A.  I wrote -- met with Attorney Foti.

            6         Q.  Okay.  All right.  And you had -- you had 

            7    issued a fee schedule as part of your disclosure and 

            8    your report.  Are you operating under those terms for 

            9    purposes of what you bill hourly and that type of thing?

           10         A.  I -- I do.  There is a discrepancy there, 

           11    though, and it will be corrected on the next -- I've 

           12    overbilled $30 an hour for some of the work.  It -- 

           13    it -- what happens is my billing actually occurs with a 

           14    number in it in terms of my billing hours, and it was 

           15    assigned to a different activity but -- so I overbilled 

           16    a little bit, but I will readjust that.

           17         Q.  All right.  So if I understand what you're 

           18    saying, you have different billing codes for different 

           19    types of activities?

           20         A.  Correct.

           21         Q.  And you have a different rate for different 

           22    types of activities?

           23         A.  Correct.

           24         Q.  And something that you did mistakenly got 

           25    billed to a certain billing code and there needs to be a 








                                                                          


            1    credit of $30?

            2         A.  Per hour, yeah. 

            3         Q.  Per hour?

            4         A.  Yeah. 

            5         Q.  Okay.  

            6         A.  So there's $195 that will show up in August, 

            7    correction.

            8         Q.  Okay.  So the total amount that this is off by 

            9    is $195?

           10         A.  That's correct.

           11         Q.  All right.  Now, we had a little bit of a 

           12    discussion before we got on the record about the 

           13    production of your file.  Your file was produced 

           14    previously to us when we were looking at possibly 

           15    deposing you sooner.  Is there anything that remains -- 

           16    that is part of your file now that it is your 

           17    understanding has not yet been produced to the parties 

           18    in this case?

           19         A.  I can think of any, no.

           20         Q.  All right.  You mentioned an update -- well, 

           21    you didn't mention it on the record.  You have an 

           22    updated CV, correct?

           23         A.  I do.

           24         Q.  Do you know if we have your updated CV or if 

           25    that is something we don't yet have?








                                                                          


            1         A.  Okay.  Well, part of this whole thing was I 

            2    sent my complete file to Moore, Foti and -- I don't 

            3    remember the -- whatever, the attorneys here.  And, in 

            4    the process of that, they said, well, can you just have 

            5    that information available to the other attorneys in the 

            6    case.  So my -- my Dropbox is current.  So whatever is 

            7    in my Dropbox is what is up to date right now.

            8         Q.  Okay.  

            9         A.  So you have access to -- to all of the 

           10    information that everyone else has on this case.  It -- 

           11    whether you've gone in and taken a look at that, I don't 

           12    know.  But it's available to you.

           13         Q.  All right.  Fair enough.  

           14         A.  So I don't know if you've gotten that or not is 

           15    the answer.

           16         Q.  All right.  So just so I can get it clear on 

           17    the record, there was the original production of a very, 

           18    very large file.  And then you said there were a few 

           19    additional things.  What are the additional things that 

           20    have been added to that Dropbox say in the last six 

           21    months?

           22         A.  Well, I wouldn't say the last six months.  

           23    Essentially, I would say what happened in the last 

           24    three -- three days, okay?  Because I added all the 

           25    e-mails.  I think we had a June date that we were 








                                                                          


            1    supposed to meet.  I've added all the e-mails from that 

            2    June date on until yesterday.  I don't have today's or 

            3    anything else.  So I've added all the e-mails to that.  

            4    I've also added some material that I've acquired, two 

            5    photographs and a -- a Microsoft page that has some URLs 

            6    on them.

            7         Q.  Okay.  All right.  

            8                   MR. ROBINSON:  Let's go off the 

            9              record for one second.  

           10                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at 

           11              10:37.  

           12                        (Off record, 10:37 a.m.)

           13                        (On record, 10:38 a.m.)

           14                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  On the record at 

           15              10:38.

           16    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           17         Q.  Okay.  All right.  So you mentioned that you 

           18    updated it in the last couple of days with respect to 

           19    the some e-mails back and forth between you and counsel, 

           20    correct?

           21         A.  That's correct.

           22         Q.  All right.  I presume that's predominantly just 

           23    scheduling e-mails and things like that for purposes of 

           24    coming to this deposition?

           25         A.  Well, basically most of the e-mails were 








                                                                          


            1    related to whether or not I should release the Dropbox 

            2    information directly to you guys, so that's -- 

            3         Q.  Okay.  

            4         A.  -- essentially the discussion that was doing 

            5    on.  I would not release them generally to opposing 

            6    counsel without getting permission from the ones who I'm 

            7    working for.

            8         Q.  Understood.  And then you also indicated that 

            9    there were two photographs.  What are the photographs?

           10         A.  One is a photograph of a -- a floor in -- I was 

           11    in Home Depot and I took a picture of the flooring in 

           12    their wood shed.

           13         Q.  Okay.  And what's the other photograph?

           14         A.  The photograph is of a -- from an Irish website 

           15    where there's gentlemen working over the top of a 

           16    staircase.

           17         Q.  Okay.  Let's -- let's start with the first 

           18    photograph.  Why, for purposes of this case, did you add 

           19    the photograph of the flooring in a wood shed from Home 

           20    Depot?

           21         A.  It has a non-slip surface.

           22         Q.  Okay.  All right.  And what, if any, bearing 

           23    does that photograph have on your opinions in this case?

           24         A.  My opinions in this case were that the platform 

           25    was -- had crawl boards on it and it had an aluminum 








                                                                          


            1    surface that was not -- had no perforations or no -- 

            2    well, it had holes in it, but the holes were larger than 

            3    required -- than, you know, the standards and they also 

            4    were not -- were not slip resistant.

            5         Q.  All right.  And so how is the flooring in a 

            6    wood shed in any way directly relevant to that opinion?

            7             Well, in their -- there are consistent -- 

            8    people come in with mud on their -- on their boots and 

            9    they have to use that particular area and it's of public 

           10    interest.  And if, in fact, someone would slip or fall 

           11    or hurt themselves based on that, then, of course, it 

           12    has some relevance because you've got the same kind of 

           13    conditions when you're climbing on machinery.

           14         Q.  Okay.  

           15         A.  And there --

           16         Q.  Go ahead.  

           17         A.  And, of course, the hole sizes that were in 

           18    that area allowed for the mud to -- to clear and clean 

           19    -- clean itself and -- and not contribute to the 

           20    slippery conditions that would otherwise occur there.

           21         Q.  Okay.  As -- as it relates to your review of 

           22    this case, you have absolutely no information at all 

           23    that Mr. Wylie slipped on that platform when he fell, 

           24    correct?

           25         A.  I have information that I -- when I examined 








                                                                          


            1    it, there are -- that the -- the surface was slippery 

            2    and it was also noted in Mr. Wylie's deposition that 

            3    it's slippery on Page 61 of his deposition.  So, yes, 

            4    there is a connection.

            5         Q.  Okay.  Different question.  At the time      

            6    Mr. Wylie fell, he testified that he walked backwards 

            7    off the machine, correct?

            8         A.  At the time, is that what you mean?  

            9         Q.  When -- 

           10         A.  What's -- what specific moment was that?  

           11         Q.  Sure.  What's your understanding of the actual 

           12    mechanism of how Mr. Wylie fell when he fell that day?

           13         A.  I understand that he fell off the back of the 

           14    machine.  I don't have the details of what -- what 

           15    occurred there.

           16         Q.  So you don't remember from his testimony?

           17         A.  He said he fell off backwards off that 

           18    platform.

           19         Q.  Right.  And did he testify he literally walked 

           20    off backwards off that platform?

           21         A.  Can you show me what you're referring to?  

           22         Q.  I'm just asking your recollection from the 

           23    testimony.  

           24         A.  My reck -- I don't have a recollection.

           25         Q.  All right.  Do you agree that Mr. Wylie, at no 








                                                                          


            1    point in time, testified that he slipped and that, as a 

            2    result of slipping, he then fell backwards off the 

            3    machine?

            4         A.  Mr. Wylie was not specific about his exact 

            5    moves.  In fact, if we look at those, he didn't tell us 

            6    whether he had hit -- a toe slip or a heel slip.  We 

            7    don't have that information.  We know that he fell off 

            8    the machine backwards.

            9         Q.  You just indicated in your testimony we don't 

           10    know if he had a toe slip or a heel slip.  We actually 

           11    have no information from Mr. Wylie that he slipped at 

           12    all at the time he fell back off the machine, correct?

           13         A.  I don't have information that he slipped off 

           14    the machine.

           15         Q.  All right.  So if -- if there's no evidence in 

           16    this case that he slipped before he fell backwards off 

           17    the machine, would you agree that the slipperiness has 

           18    no bearing on the nature of his accident?

           19         A.  I can't say that, no.  Just because he didn't 

           20    mention it doesn't mean that it wasn't a factor.  

           21         Q.  All right.  Well -- 

           22         A.  So . . .

           23         Q.  -- you're an engineer, right?

           24         A.  Correct.

           25         Q.  And in -- in assessing situations such as the 








                                                                          


            1    current case, you have to look at the body of actual 

            2    evidence that exists and then render opinions, correct?

            3         A.  I look at the evidence that exists, and I apply 

            4    the understanding of the engineering principles that I 

            5    have to make an assessment of that.  My assessment is, 

            6    in many cases, more likely than not.  It doesn't have to 

            7    be a hundred percent.

            8         Q.  Okay.  Is it more likely than not your opinion 

            9    in this case that Mr. Wylie slipped as he fell back off 

           10    the machine?

           11         A.  There's a question of slip and trip.  I talked 

           12    about trip.  I think I -- if I didn't, I meant to.  A 

           13    trip or a slip are two different things, of course.

           14         Q.  Okay.  Do you have an opinion more likely than 

           15    not that either of those actually happened?

           16         A.  Let me check -- check my report.  

           17         Q.  Sure.  

           18         A.  I did not have -- I don't have an opinion.

           19         Q.  Okay.  So you -- let me just make sure I'm 

           20    clear.  You don't have an opinion more likely than not 

           21    that Mr. Wylie slipped as he fell off the machine, 

           22    correct?

           23         A.  That's correct.

           24         Q.  You don't have an opinion more likely than not 

           25    that Mr. Wylie tripped as he fell off the machine?








                                                                          


            1         A.  That's correct.

            2         Q.  Based on Mr. Wylie's testimony, do you have an 

            3    opinion more likely than not that as he was working, 

            4    moving in a backwards position, that he simply walked 

            5    backwards off the machine?

            6         A.  I believe he walked backwards off the machine.

            7         Q.  And that's your opinion more likely than not, 

            8    correct?

            9         A.  Correct.

           10         Q.  And, therefore, you would agree with me that 

           11    the slipperiness and/or the potential trip hazard that 

           12    you've identified would have no impact on the mechanism 

           13    of Mr. Wylie's fall as it relates to your opinions from 

           14    a more-likely-than-not standpoint?

           15         A.  What they do is impress me as to how much 

           16    detail was put into the design of these working 

           17    platforms.  

           18         Q.   Okay.

           19                   MR. ROBINSON:  But can you read my 

           20              question back, please.

            1              10:47.

            2         A.  Could you repeat your question, please.

            3                   MR. ROBINSON:  Can you read it back 

            4              one more time?  

            5                   (Whereupon, the record was read back 

            6                    by the Court Reporter.)

            7         A.  Well, I certainly believe that the crawl boards 

            8    are a trip hazard, yes.  I have stated that already in 

            9    my report.

           10    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           11         Q.  Okay.  But you have no opinion that 

           12    Mr. Likely -- Mr. Wylie, more likely than not, tripped 

           13    when he fell backwards off the machine, correct?

           14         A.  I have no understanding of that.

           15         Q.  And no opinion?

           16         A.  No opinion.

           17         Q.  Okay.  I just want to sort of -- well, let me 

           18    back up.  

           19             You identified a second photograph -- 

           20         A.  Uh-huh.

           21         Q.  -- which is from an Irish website where you 

           22    indicated a gentleman working over the top of a 

           23    staircase?

           24         A.  That's correct.

           25         Q.  Okay.  Was he on a Warrior 1800?








                                                                          


            1         A.  No, but it was -- it was kind of -- it was an 

            2    -- it was a website that indicated that there needs to 

            3    be some things that people don't do.

            4         Q.  What's the name of the website?

            5         A.  I can pull it up for you, I guess.

            6         Q.  All right.  Do you actually have these two 

            7    photographs that we're talking about available to us 

            8    here?

            9         A.  I think I produced them. 

           10         Q.  Are they -- I saw -- I saw boxes. 

           11         A.  I don't know.  

           12                   MR. FOTI:  I think they were just 

           13              produced by -- by the Dropbox.

           14                   MR. COYNE:  They were produced on 

           15              August 5th in the Dropbox, and I couldn't 

           16              download them to print them out.  

           17                   MR. FOTI:  Let me do this:  Let me 

           18              go downstairs to the paralegal and see -- 

           19              we'll go off the record -- and see if 

           20              it's something we can produce in --

           21                   MR. COYNE:  I think I probably 

           22              needed to send back a request.  Then -- 

           23              but I just didn't have the time because 

           24              it was --

            1                   MR. ROBINSON:  Thanks very much.  

            2              Okay.  All right.  Let's proceed. 

            3    BY MR. ROBINSON:

            4         Q.  All right.  Mr. Cowley, let me hand you what's 

            5    been marked Defendants' Exhibit A-2.  Is this the first 

            6    photograph that you mentioned which was the photograph 

            7    of the flooring from a Home Depot wood shed?

            8         A.  Yes, uh-huh.

            9         Q.  All right.  So -- okay.  And -- and I'll hand 

           10    you what's been marked as Exhibit A-3 -- and, by the 

           11    way, is that a photograph you took?

           12         A.  Yes, uh-huh.

           13         Q.  Okay.  Can I have that back for one second?  

           14         A.  (Handing.)

           15         Q.  All right.  Then here -- I'll hand you what's 

           16    been marked as Exhibit A-3, which is the photograph that 

           17    you indicated came from an Irish website.  There is an 

           18    indication down in the bottom corner that says out, 

           19    colon, blank.  Does that have anything to do with the 

           20    website?

           21         A.  No.  You're holding the page that has the 

           22    website.  You see the J -- the jpeg?  That's the actual 

           23    photograph that you're looking at here.

           24         Q.  Got it.  So Exhibit A-4 shows us URLs for 

           25    www.skyway.ie, then 








                                                                          


            1    www.skyway.ie/lethalwaystousealadderpictures?

            2         A.  Uh-huh.

            3                   MR. FOTI:  I'd venture a guess 

            4              that's the one for this picture.

            5    BY MR. ROBINSON: 

            6         Q.  And then the third one, I'm not going to read 

            7    it out loud.  There's a third URL which has a jpeg.  Is 

            8    that the photograph that's been marked as -- 

            9         A.  Yes.

           10         Q.  -- Exhibit A-3?

           11         A.  I'm sorry.  The -- yes, that is.  

           12         Q.  All right.  And so A-3 depicts a gentleman who 

           13    has tried to secure a ladder across an open stairwell, 

           14    and he's climbing up on that ladder to try and perform 

           15    some painting activities, correct?

           16         A.  Correct.

           17         Q.  All right.  What, if anything, does that have 

           18    to do with this case?

           19         A.  What is the -- what I see is the open ladder -- 

           20    open stairway there.  I don't see him on the ladder.  I 

           21    don't see any of that.  I just see the open stairway and 

           22    him above it.  

           23         Q.  Okay.  You see an open stairway?

           24         A.  Yes, uh-huh.

           25         Q.  You mean in the -- in this particular case?








                                                                          


            1         A.  In this -- in this particular picture.

            2         Q.  Oh, right.  Okay.  But how, if at all, does 

            3    this have anything to do with the situation we're here 

            4    to talk about on the Powerscreen Warrior 1800 in Graham 

            5    Wylie's incident?

            6         A.  Nothing.  But it -- it does demonstrate that -- 

            7    that folks in Ireland do know and understand dangerous 

            8    conditions for stairways.

            9         Q.  This, in fact -- I mean, how would you describe 

           10    the decision that this individual that's standing on 

           11    this ladder made?

           12         A.  He had to decide what he was going to do when 

           13    he got to the end of the stair -- of the -- you'll 

           14    notice the paint is coming from what I presume is not an 

           15    open stairway because you can see the banister going 

           16    around the other side.  So essentially he had to make a 

           17    decision what he was going to do after he got off the 

           18    platform, if you will, onto the stair -- the stairway; 

           19    didn't he?  

           20         Q.  All right.  Do you think this was a smart move 

           21    on his part?

           22         A.  Well, if you read the context, I would have to 

           23    agree with that.  It must be lethal things that people 

           24    do with stairways -- with ladders.  Don't you?  

           25         Q.  All right.  All right.  Let me hand you what 








                                                                          


            1    has been marked as Exhibit B.  I'll be very quick with 

            2    this.  

            3         A.  Okay.

            4         Q.  This is your dis -- your expert disclosure in 

            5    this case.  Do you recognize that document?

            6         A.  I've never seen it.

            7         Q.  Okay.  You've never seen that document?

            8         A.  No, sir.

            9         Q.  All right.  I -- could you just take a quick 

           10    review and tell me if you disagree with any of its 

           11    contents?

           12                   MR. FOTI:  John, she just -- did you 

           13              mark --

           14                   MR. ROBINSON:  I want to do it when 

           15              I get -- 

           16                   MR. FOTI:  Okay.  

           17                   MR. ROBINSON:  You know, I want to 

           18              kind of keep it together.  

           19                   MR. FOTI:  That's fine.  

           20                   MR. ROBINSON:  While he's reviewing 

           21              this, I'll just say for the record that, 

           22              in addition to Exhibits 1 -- A-1, A-2 -- 

           23              I'm sorry.  In exhi- -- in addition to 

           24              A-2, 3 and 4 which were just marked, 

           25              identified and discussed with the 








                                                                          


            1              witness, counsel has provided us with an 

            2              updated CV as well as an updated 

            3              testimony listing for Mr. Cowley that we 

            4              will use at a later point.

            5         A.  I've read it.

            6    BY MR. ROBINSON:

            7         Q.  Okay.  The question is, is there anything -- 

            8    any changes or any -- anything about that document that 

            9    you consider to be inaccurate or incomplete?

           10         A.  No.

           11         Q.  All right.  Let me show you what's been marked 

           12    as Exhibit C, which is -- we printed it out on both 

           13    sides just to keep it a little bit smaller, but it's a 

           14    copy of FACETics Reference File No. 17-115, Wylie Soil 

           15    Screener Matter Catwalk Railing - Fall, dated July 13, 

           16    2018, addressed to Attorney Timothy Brignole, which 

           17    consists of 136 pages.  Do you recognize that document?

           18         A.  I do, yeah.

           19         Q.  And what is it?

           20         A.  It's the report that I submitted to him on the 

           21    13th of July.

           22         Q.  Okay.  So that's a complete and accurate copy 

           23    of your report in this matter, correct?

           24         A.  As far as I can tell, yes, it looks to be.

           25         Q.  All right.  I see that you have a copy of your 








                                                                          


            1    own report that you've been sort of thumbing through at 

            2    points during the deposition sitting next to the 

            3    exhibits that I gave you.  It is also 136 pages in 

            4    length?

            5         A.  It is.

            6         Q.  All right.  If -- if we have questions 

            7    throughout the day about your report, feel free to refer 

            8    to either copy that you prefer to refer to.  

            9         A.  I can set this one aside if you'd like.

           10         Q.  Whatever you want to do.  I mean, if -- I don't 

           11    know if you've marked up a copy or anything like that.  

           12         A.  I have not, no.

           13         Q.  Okay.  Let me show you what's been marked as 

           14    Exhibit D.  Do you recognize that document?

           15         A.  I think this particular document is a better 

           16    copy maybe even of one that I chose, R003, my materials 

           17    received list.

           18         Q.  Okay.  And do you understand this to be the 

           19    operative manual for the Warrior 1800 at issue in this 

           20    case?

           21         A.  I do, yes, sir.

           22         Q.  All right.  So -- because I understood from 

           23    your report and the materials that you produced that you 

           24    had a number of different versions of manuals, this is 

           25    the one that would apply to the unit at issue, correct?








                                                                          


            1         A.  Correct.  Those were also produced by 

            2    Powerscreen so -- 

            3         Q.  Understood.  I'm just making sure that for 

            4    purposes of your opinion -- 

            5         A.  For my opinions, this is it.

            6         Q.  -- this is the one that you're looking at.  

            7         A.  Uh-huh, yeah.

            8         Q.  Okay.  And, lastly, let me show you what's been 

            9    marked as Exhibit E.  This is just a little bit of 

           10    housekeeping.  It's a series of 159 pages of 

           11    photographs.  Do you recognize these photographs?

           12         A.  Yes.  I believe these to be -- on Page 18 of my 

           13    report, I believe those are the photographs that were in 

           14    Attachment No. 3.

           15         Q.  Okay.  So these are photographs that you took 

           16    and that then are photographs that, in part, you relied 

           17    on for purposes of issuing your report in this matter, 

           18    correct?

           19         A.  That's correct.

           20         Q.  Just, again, try to make sure I finish before 

           21    you -- before you answer.  We do this all the time.  You 

           22    know where I'm going with something and we always cut 

           23    each other off and answer things in our everyday 

           24    conversation.  Just for her sake, try to -- try to let 

           25    me just finish.  Okay?  








                                                                          


            1         A.  Yes.

            2         Q.  All right.  Now, let's turn to Page 67 of your 

            3    report, if you would.  Now, at page -- at Pages 67 

            4    through 71 of your report, you have provided your 

            5    curriculum vitae, correct?

            6         A.  That was my curriculum vitae as of the date of 

            7    the report.

            8         Q.  That's right.  And then today we've been 

            9    provided an updated curriculum vitae, correct?

           10         A.  That's correct.

           11         Q.  All right.  And the report is Exhibit C, 

           12    correct?  Go to the first page.  Go to the first page, 

           13    if you would.  

           14         A.  Yes, this is C.

           15         Q.  All right.  

           16                   MR. ROBINSON:  So let's make the 

           17              updated curriculum vitae Exhibit C-1, 

           18              please.  

           19                        (Defendants' Exhibit C-1,

           20                         updated curriculum vitae,

           21                         marked for identification.)

           22    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           23         Q.  All right.  I'm going to place Exhibit C-1 in 

           24    front of you as well so that you have both of your 

           25    curricula vitae.  Can you just let me know what the 








                                                                          


            1    changes are?

            2         A.  I think there were just minor spelling changes.  

            3    I don't think there was any major issue.

            4         Q.  Oh, okay.  So this just had typographical 

            5    issues, that type of thing.  All right.  

            6         A.  Yes.

            7         Q.  Okay.  So your CV indicates that you got a 

            8    Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from Iowa 

            9    State University, right?

           10         A.  I did, yes.

           11         Q.  And what year was that?

           12         A.  I believe that was 1976 but let me check for 

           13    sure.  It's been a long time ago.

           14         Q.  All right.  The CV doesn't indicate a day; 

           15    that's why I was wondering.  

           16         A.  Okay.  Right, 1976 it was.

           17         Q.  Okay.  And then you obtained a Master of 

           18    Business Administration from the University of Northern 

           19    Iowa.  On what date did you obtain that degree?

           20         A.  That was in May of 1988.

           21         Q.  Okay.  Besides continuing education and that 

           22    type of thing that might be part of your professional 

           23    career, do you have any other degrees?

           24         A.  I don't.

           25         Q.  Okay.  You spent 33 years with John Deere, 








                                                                          


            1    correct?

            2         A.  I actually worked for John Deere for 30 years 

            3    but as a -- as a consultant for them three more years.

            4         Q.  Okay.  Could you just describe for me -- you 

            5    know, I don't want to take too long with this, but give 

            6    me an overview of your responsibilities over that career 

            7    with John Deere.  

            8         A.  I -- I wore many hats, but I started as a -- an 

            9    intern working in the -- in the machine shop areas 

           10    around -- learning how to do lathes and so forth; worked 

           11    in the foundry a little bit so I got some background and 

           12    understanding of pouring and casting; worked in the heat 

           13    treat area so I understood heat treating materials.  

           14             Then I -- I moved into product design after I 

           15    graduated from college and worked on a number of 

           16    products, producing design drawings and working through 

           17    design issues putting cabs on a -- on a tractor, putting 

           18    egress and -- ingress, egress, considering all those 

           19    elements of the design.  

           20             I worked on various other activities; was 

           21    chosen to be part of a worldwide team to -- to design -- 

           22    define a -- tractor models that eventually resulted in 

           23    the 6000, 7000 Series tractors; became the chief -- 

           24    became a lead engineer for the chassis on that project; 

           25    worked -- from there, I basically got involved in test 








                                                                          


            1    and evaluation.  So I spent some time working with 

            2    product testing.  

            3             And then I was tapped on the shoulder to start 

            4    the first precision farming test group that tested 

            5    software and hardware together, and so I had 

            6    responsibility for testing desktop applications as well 

            7    as the embedded software on John Deere tractor -- 

            8    tractors, combines where I -- I had access to and worked 

            9    around a lot of tall equipment.  Like combines are tall, 

           10    very tall equipment.  We had to put -- put the StarFire 

           11    receiver up on top of those.  So I understood at lot 

           12    about ingress, egress, but also positioning equipment, 

           13    using handrails, things like that.  

           14             Then I -- because of my background, John Deere 

           15    was starting an initiative to define their processes 

           16    more completely.  So I think you've probably heard of 

           17    ISO-9000, things like that, that companies went through 

           18    at that time.  So I was tapped to do that I -- of my 

           19    broad background in different areas of the company.  

           20             And so I worked on that for a while and then 

           21    helped them with a study on CAD systems.  It was a -- 

           22    over an eight million dollar project to decide what kind 

           23    of CAD system we're going to use in the company.  

           24             And so, after that, basically I decided to -- 

           25    to find other employment.  








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Okay.  

            2         A.  But it was a personal decision to move to 

            3    Phoenix, but that's where I ended after 30 and a half 

            4    years working with the company.

            5         Q.  Got it.  And -- where -- when you were working 

            6    for John Deere, where were you?

            7         A.  I was located in two areas, basically Waterloo 

            8    and Moline area.

            9         Q.  Okay.  Now, John Deere, was that all 

           10    farm-related equipment, tractors, that type of thing?

           11         A.  When I got into precision farming, there was 

           12    some -- some construction equipment that I got involved 

           13    in, but that was mostly electronics and things like 

           14    that, yeah.  

           15         Q.  What types of construction equipment are we 

           16    talking about?

           17         A.  Oh, skidders, loaders.  There was a lot of 

           18    things.  Motor graders.

           19         Q.  Motor what?

           20         A.  Motor graders, you know, the ones with the 

           21    blades that push the -- 

           22         Q.  Yeah.  

           23                   COURT REPORTER:  Can you repeat 

           24              that?  

           25                   THE WITNESS:  Motor grader.








                                                                          


            1    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            2         Q.  Was any of the equipment that you were involved 

            3    with during your career at John Deere equipment that 

            4    would be used in the mining world?

            5         A.  I think you find front-end loaders and things 

            6    like that in the mining world. 

            7         Q.  Okay.  

            8         A.  So, I mean, there's a lot of cross-pollination.  

            9    I mean, there -- a lot of the equipment gets used across 

           10    the board.  I mean, just because there's a divide in the 

           11    federal government on how it --how it's assigned, it 

           12    doesn't make them different.

           13         Q.  Right, and we'll talk about that in a little 

           14    while.  Was your job -- at any point in time for John 

           15    Deere, was it your job to determine whether aspects of 

           16    that equipment were -- were complying with safety 

           17    regulations or anything like that as it relates to  

           18    rails --

           19         A.  Always.  

           20         Q.  -- stairways, that type of thing?

           21         A.  I'm sorry.  Always.

           22         Q.  Always.  Okay.  Did you have to involve 

           23    yourself with the mining regulations for that?

           24         A.  If they applied.

           25         Q.  Do you recall any particular projects where you 








                                                                          


            1    personally reviewed the mining regulations for 

            2    compliance with the design of a John Deere product?

            3         A.  When they applied.  I -- I don't recall if -- I 

            4    can't come up with anything right now at the moment.  

            5    When they applied, I had to --

            6         Q.  All right.  

            7         A.  -- apply them.

            8         Q.  Did you have to specifically review OSHA 

            9    regulations as it related to any aspect of your work 

           10    in -- in -- with John Deere products?

           11         A.  Always.

           12         Q.  Okay.  And --

           13         A.  Any specific one?  Is your -- is that what your 

           14    question was?  

           15         Q.  Well, I -- I'm just -- I'm asking you how -- 

           16    how did the OSHA regulations play into your role when 

           17    you were performing your various tasks for John Deere?  

           18         A.  Well, I mean, I think I noted that I was 

           19    involved in ROPS, okay?  OSHA, in 1975, came out with a 

           20    regulation that every vehicle had to have a rollover 

           21    protective structure; for example, tractors.  So I had 

           22    to understand them in all the detail that I needed to to 

           23    make sure that we designed a product that was compliant 

           24    with all standards.  

           25             I also to deal with the -- the European 








                                                                          


            1    standards the same way.  We had to make sure that they 

            2    were compliant with EC standards.  So that was just a 

            3    part of the daily activities.  

            4             If we wanted to sell in the European 

            5    marketplace, we had to meet European requirements.  If 

            6    we had to -- wanted to sell in the United States 

            7    marketplace, we had to deal with the U.S. requirements.  

            8    That was part of our job.  If we wanted to sell the 

            9    product around the world, we had to deal with it.

           10         Q.  So as it related to, say, for example, selling 

           11    to the European marketplace, did John Deere have 

           12    branches of the company that were based in these 

           13    European markets?

           14         A.  They did.  Of course, just -- their intent was 

           15    to try to make their balance of trade because of the 

           16    inflation rates that were going crazy at the time.

           17         Q.  Who -- who -- how was the delineation of 

           18    responsibility as it related to comply -- complying with 

           19    the European regulations for design and safety, who -- 

           20    who was responsible for that?  Was it an entity based in 

           21    -- in Europe or was it back here in the U.S.?

           22         A.  Well, of course, when you want to be involved 

           23    in a worldwide marketplace, there's a lot of dynamics 

           24    that are involved.  

           25             I can say that in Europe, there's what's called 








                                                                          


            1    the Certificate of Conformity that is required.  And 

            2    their view is that if you provide a product in the 

            3    marketplace that has been tested, if somebody doesn't -- 

            4    doesn't fulfill or changes that and does not alert the 

            5    authority having jurisdiction, then, of course, somebody 

            6    goes to jail.  And, of course, it has to be European 

            7    because that's in their purview.  They can do that.  

            8             In the U.S., we let the product liability cases 

            9    handle that.  And so there's -- there's a little 

           10    different dynamic that's involved.  But we do -- if we 

           11    want to sell in the marketplace, we have to understand 

           12    what happens in all the marketplaces that we want to 

           13    sell.  We can't just say, well, I did it good for EC but 

           14    I don't -- can't -- I don't know what's happening in the 

           15    United States so I'll sell my product anyway.  There's 

           16    a -- there's a -- there's a real problem with that kind 

           17    of thought process.

           18         Q.  Would the U.S.-based operations have 

           19    specialists that would know what regulations and/or 

           20    requirements applied in every given non-U.S. based 

           21    location where the product would be sold; or would they 

           22    rely on, for example, their -- their distribution arm in 

           23    those given locations to provide them with the input?

           24         A.  No.  We were required to know those.  If we 

           25    were designing a cab, we had to know what the -- what 








                                                                          


            1    the requirements were in all the marketplaces.  

            2             Those were brought to us, of course.  I mean, 

            3    we didn't do it by ourselves.  I mean, there was -- but 

            4    there was a lot of -- a lot of information provided as 

            5    to what the requirements were.  Before we started the 

            6    design, we had to know those.  

            7         Q.  Got it.  When you -- when you say those were 

            8    brought to us, from where would they be brought?  Who 

            9    would get it to you?

           10         A.  The -- I'm sorry.  The -- we had a homologation 

           11    set of folks that understood homologation and they 

           12    met -- I mean, they go to these standards committees all 

           13    the time, and they involve themselves in the standards 

           14    committees.  In fact, they try to establish what the 

           15    next standard's going to look like so they can make sure 

           16    that it's as close to conformity across the world as 

           17    they can.  

           18             So there was a lot of people that are involved 

           19    in these large companies, probably TEREX as well, that 

           20    get involved in the standards committees that make the 

           21    next set of stand- -- industrial standards that are 

           22    eventually incorporated into law by either the EC or by 

           23    the federal government.

           24         Q.  Okay.  In your involvement with John Deere, do 

           25    you recall ever personally designing any -- any 








                                                                          


            1    equipment with a catwalk on it where you designed it?

            2         A.  Where I designed a catwalk?  I wouldn't say I 

            3    had a -- anything to do with a catwalk, but I did have a 

            4    lot to do with steps and how those worked and how you 

            5    got in and out of a -- a cab.  

            6         Q.  All right.  And there's actually specific 

            7    regulations that deal with the cab, correct?  Like 

            8    vehicles that have a cab with an operator that's going 

            9    to be working in the cab, correct?

           10         A.  There's standards that -- that deal with a cab, 

           11    but there's also standards that deal with the indust- -- 

           12    industrial standards that deal with just working on a -- 

           13    on a special -- a piece of equipment, industrial 

           14    equipment.

           15         Q.  Okay.  All right.  So -- and you indicated that 

           16    you recall having some involvement with designing 

           17    equipment for -- for John Deere that had stairs on it.  

           18    What specific types of equipment?

           19         A.  I was mostly involved in my design career in 

           20    agriculture tractors, so I have to do that.  But I did 

           21    involve myself a little bit in how we had to install 

           22    StarFire receivers on combines, cotton pickers, things 

           23    like that.  I was called in to take a look at those 

           24    sometimes.

           25         Q.  What's a combine?








                                                                          


            1         A.  Combine is what goes through the field and 

            2    harvests.  It's really the money maker, right?  I mean, 

            3    it's the piece that actually takes the grain off the -- 

            4    off the stalk or off the -- off the blade and puts it 

            5    through the machine and that's what they take to market.

            6         Q.  Okay.  Did you have any involvement in any 

            7    design and/or safety aspects as it related to the stairs 

            8    on a combine?

            9         A.  If I -- in terms of what, design?  

           10         Q.  Yes.  

           11         A.  Okay.  I did use them quite -- quite often and 

           12    was involved from a -- from a use point of view.  But if 

           13    I felt that something was not safe, I would certainly 

           14    have -- want that to -- I don't recall of any at this 

           15    point.  

           16         Q.  All right.  Do you have any recollection of any 

           17    incident where you thought something was unsafe and 

           18    brought it to anyone's attention?

           19         A.  Oh, yes.  Yes, sir.

           20         Q.  As far as the stairs?

           21         A.  Oh, as far as the stairs?  You know, I don't 

           22    think so.  I think most of the time, that was pretty 

           23    well under- -- I mean, taken care of by our safety 

           24    groups and so forth.

           25         Q.  Okay.  Turning back to the farm equipment, you 








                                                                          


            1    said that your other involvement was on farm tractors.  

            2    Did you personally design farm tractors?

            3         A.  I did, yes.

            4         Q.  All right.  Did any of them have stairs?

            5         A.  They did, yes.

            6         Q.  All right.  Describe for me the types of stairs 

            7    they would have.  Why would they have stairs?

            8         A.  They had stairs that would allow them to get 

            9    into the cab, but there was a -- there was a landing in 

           10    front of the cab door that we had to make sure people 

           11    could get to.  

           12             On occasion, the stairs would be used when 

           13    there was -- the doors were open, so you had basically a 

           14    step process to get into the cab.  During -- I can 

           15    remember during some of those times when we were trying 

           16    to design, there was always this concern about the rails 

           17    because the steps were -- were much higher than the 

           18    30-inch limit.  So there was a concern that if the 

           19    standards would go to the point where people would have 

           20    to have a handrail, then we'd have to figure out how to 

           21    do that on those stairs.  

           22             We had -- had to -- in fact, I remember 

           23    sometimes we had to design the bottom step so that it 

           24    would -- flat so that we could get over an obstacle 

           25    if -- if it was in the way.  So there was a lot of 








                                                                          


            1    things that went into those kinds of designs.  

            2             But I do remember mostly that our hand -- we 

            3    were able to use hand -- handholds or hand grips, and 

            4    those were always horizontal, as I recall, in our 

            5    designs.  So if you wanted a hand grip, it would be 

            6    above you, and then you would have to hang on to above 

            7    you with one hand because there's what's called the 

            8    three-point -- three-point contract.

            9         Q.  Okay.  Well, in these farm tractor 

           10    situations -- and I realize they may vary.  I mean, how 

           11    many different farm tractors were you involved with as 

           12    it relates to the design?

           13         A.  The design of the tractors themselves, probably 

           14    four or five different generations.  Right?  

           15         Q.  Okay.  And were they different generations of a 

           16    certain model tractor?

           17         A.  No, no.  When I say generation, it's different 

           18    than -- than the automotive -- we're -- we're kind of an 

           19    automotive -- certainly I was part of SAE, so we're 

           20    Society of Automotive Engineers, but the number of 

           21    copies that we make a year were much -- probably like 

           22    your -- the industry you're involved in, your client's 

           23    involved in, very low-volume equipment.  So you don't 

           24    necessarily redesign a whole model, if you will, every 

           25    year.  It doesn't -- it's not like the auto industry 








                                                                          


            1    that --

            2         Q.  You'll make changes to the model as you go?

            3         A.  Correct.  And I think that's kind of what we 

            4    see here is there was a model change occurring in the 

            5    2009 time frame.

            6         Q.  That's right.  And when you say what we saw 

            7    occurring here, you're talking about the Powerscreen -- 

            8    Powerscreen Warrior 1800, correct?

            9         A.  That's what I'm talking about.

           10         Q.  Right.  And that model change was a scenario 

           11    where they now had the option to raise the platform as 

           12    it related to doing screen-changing activities, correct?

           13         A.  I wouldn't put it in those terms.

           14         Q.  What -- how would you put it?

           15         A.  I think they just decided to do that.  It 

           16    wasn't their option.  It didn't -- they didn't provide 

           17    you one that had that and one that didn't have that.  

           18    They did the whole thing that way.  So . . .  

           19         Q.  Okay.  Let's -- let's -- let's start right 

           20    there.  So the first -- the model that preexists this 

           21    modification, okay --

           22         A.  Model designed in 2005.

           23         Q.  Right.  So -- but -- yeah, right, that prior 

           24    model --

           25         A.  Uh-huh.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  -- it had a stationary platform that could not 

            2    be raised hydraulically, correct?

            3         A.  It used the same pivot point, yes.

            4         Q.  Right.  And -- that's right.  And so, 

            5    therefore, if -- and when you say use the same pivot 

            6    point, there would never be a scenario where the 

            7    stairs -- for lack of a better term, where the stairs 

            8    were not separated from the platform like can occur in 

            9    the newer model, correct?

           10         A.  I wouldn't characterize it that way.  I would 

           11    characterize it that when you -- you have a pivot point, 

           12    basically the angle can change, but you can't change the 

           13    elevation.  So the step may have gone down a couple -- 

           14    eighth inch or three-sixteenths.  I don't -- I'm just 

           15    trying to be careful here.

           16         Q.  No, that's fair.  That's a fair point.  What 

           17    you're saying -- let's just -- 

           18                   MR. FOTI:  I don't think he was done 

           19              answering.

           20                   MR. ROBINSON:  What's that?  

           21                   MR. FOTI:  He wasn't done answering.

           22    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           23         Q.  Go ahead.  

           24         A.  Well, I was just going to say that it -- 

           25    there's a -- there's a completely -- there's a different 








                                                                          


            1    scenario here.  I just want to make sure that we 

            2    understood that there is some variation in the -- in the 

            3    height.  I -- I just . . .  

            4         Q.  I understand.  What you're saying is -- you 

            5    were using your two hands, right?

            6         A.  I was.

            7         Q.  And the hand that was aimed to the -- toward 

            8    the table would be the stairway, correct?

            9         A.  It was stationary.

           10         Q.  Right, and that was stationary.  And the pivot 

           11    point for the platform was -- was where the platform met 

           12    that stairway and it would pivot, correct?

           13         A.  I don't know if it was where the platform met.  

           14    There's a pin there that we can see if we look at the 

           15    side of the vehicle.

           16         Q.  Right.  

           17         A.  And that pin was where it was rotating about.

           18         Q.  Right.  And prior to the modification, there 

           19    were two screens on the Warrior 1800, correct?

           20         A.  I don't agree with that characterization.

           21         Q.  Was there an upper screen and a lower screen?

           22         A.  There were -- my understanding, there was four 

           23    upper screens.

           24         Q.  Okay.  

           25         A.  I'm trying to make -- be -- be precise with 








                                                                          


            1    you.

            2         Q.  All right.  That's fair.  So there were upper 

            3    screens on the Warrior 1800 and a lower screen on the 

            4    Warrior 1800 prior to the modification where you could 

            5    change the elevation of the platform, correct?

            6         A.  That's my understanding, yes.

            7         Q.  All right.  And when the product existed in 

            8    that fashion, both the upper and lower screens had to be 

            9    changed while the platform -- while the platform was 

           10    what in the newer iteration would be considered working 

           11    position, correct?

           12         A.  No, sir.  I don't have that -- that is not the 

           13    proper characterization.

           14         Q.  All right.  How would you characterize it?

           15         A.  There's no definition as to which position it 

           16    had to be in in the newer nor in the older.

           17         Q.  No.  What I'm saying, though, is you didn't 

           18    have to elevate the platform on the former iteration to 

           19    change the lower screen or the upper screen because you 

           20    couldn't elevate the platform, correct?

           21         A.  There was no way to elevate the platform except 

           22    by using the rear lifting mechanisms.

           23         Q.  All right.  And what was your understanding of 

           24    why the change was made?

           25         A.  Well, I don't know that it was ever described 








                                                                          


            1    in the -- in the manual.  I don't think that was -- but 

            2    I think there was a -- there is -- there was some kind 

            3    of intent to try to make it easier for somebody to 

            4    change the screens.

            5         Q.  Which screens?

            6         A.  Either one of them, I guess.  I don't know. 

            7         Q.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go back to your CV.  

            8    You're licensed in five states but not Connecticut, 

            9    correct?

           10         A.  That's correct.  

           11         Q.  Let's -- under your work experience, there is 

           12    an entry at the second bullet point under your work 

           13    experience for FACETics.  Am I saying that right?

           14         A.  FACETics, yes.

           15         Q.  FACETics?  All right.

           16         A.  Under the second -- what page are you on?  

           17         Q.  Facetics -- Facetics is who you're working for 

           18    now, correct?

           19         A.  Correct, yes.

           20         Q.  All right.  And it indicates that you conducted 

           21    forensic investigation, failure analysis and testified 

           22    under oath as an expert witness for a variety of 

           23    products including the following example cases, and it 

           24    indicates soil screener.  

           25             Is that a separate investigation, or is that 








                                                                          


            1    the instant case that we're here for?

            2         A.  Since it dates -- since the date, I think, on 

            3    this one is September of 2018, I believe it might have 

            4    referred to this one.

            5         Q.  Okay.  

            6                   MR. FOTI:  Can we go off the record 

            7              for 30 seconds.  

            8                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

           14    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           15         Q.  Okay.  So, in any event, let's -- let's go back 

           16    just quickly.  I want to move off of your CV as soon as 

           17    I can here.  

           18             At no point in time during your work at John 

           19    Deere did you have any involvement with screeners like 

           20    the product at issue in this case, correct?

           21         A.  I wouldn't characterize it that way.

           22         Q.  How would you characterize it?

           23         A.  We had screeners in our harvesting equipment.  

           24    We were always concerned about what was coming through 

           25    the screens on an -- of course, you can understand 








                                                                          


            1    there's grain.  There's things that are moving through 

            2    it.  It just didn't happen to be rocks or wood products 

            3    or -- well, I guess you could say that chaff and things 

            4    like that from material, sometimes they use that to make 

            5    wood products, I guess.  

            6         Q.  Okay.  

            7         A.  So there were some -- some aspects of it that 

            8    are clearly translatable.

            9         Q.  All right.  You didn't design any John Deere 

           10    screeners for farming; did you?

           11         A.  I don't understand the question.

           12         Q.  Sure.  I asked you whether you had any 

           13    involvement with screeners.  Were they John Deere 

           14    screeners?

           15         A.  They were screens, yes.  We use screens in the 

           16    harvesting equipment.  So when you say screeners, are 

           17    you definitely wanting to see a power screener Warrior 

           18    1800?  

           19         Q.  Well, I -- what I'm trying to get at is, did 

           20    you have experience with designing anything that had 

           21    similar -- similar characteristics?

           22         A.  I said we had screen- -- screeners in the 

           23    harvesting equipment, and I'm trying to make sure that 

           24    you understand that those are screeners, too.

           25         Q.  I get it.  But what I'm asking you is, did you 








                                                                          


            1    have any involvement in designing any of those?

            2         A.  I had involvement with those, adjusting them 

            3    and making sure that they worked correctly when I was 

            4    doing my testing on those machines.

            5         Q.  All right.  Did you have any involvement with 

            6    any platforms or anything like that associated with 

            7    those screeners as far as designing it, assessing it for 

            8    safety issues, that type of thing?

            9         A.  I was always assessing it.  We were always 

           10    asked to make sure that everything was safe and we had a 

           11    safe work environment.  We were always asked to look at 

           12    those.

           13         Q.  Did you have any elevated platforms on those?

           14         A.  Of course we did.

           15         Q.  Okay.  

           16         A.  Those were elevated platforms.  You can see 

           17    them on those big, huge combine machines, a lot of 

           18    platforms.  Sometimes we had platforms to work on 

           19    engines and sometimes we had platforms to do a lot of 

           20    things on those machines.  Of course.

           21         Q.  All right.  And they had stairways to get to 

           22    those platforms?

           23         A.  Of course.

           24         Q.  Did any -- do you recall any of those platforms 

           25    having some kind of a system where the platform could be 








                                                                          


            1    elevated away from the stairwell?

            2         A.  Never.

            3         Q.  Okay.  So you never had any involvement with 

            4    that type of an issue?

            5         A.  No.  There would never -- I didn't see any 

            6    platforms that were elevated.  All the platforms that I 

            7    saw were all fixed and --

            8         Q.  Okay. 

            9         A.  And --

           10         Q.  That's all I'm asking.  Now, after that -- 

           11    after John Deere, you went to work for Amerworks for a 

           12    year in 2008, correct?  

           13         A.  ArmorWorks, yes.

           14         Q.  ArmorWorks.  All right.  You worked there for 

           15    one year?

           16         A.  No, I didn't.  Actually, it was a very short 

           17    period of time.  It was -- it had a short life, one 

           18    month.

           19         Q.  What type of products were you involved with at 

           20    ArmorWorks?

           21         A.  I was helping them organize their tool -- their 

           22    tools basically and developing their processes for 

           23    ISO-9000.  But, frankly, the -- I couldn't stand the 

           24    fumes that were coming off of their plastic 

           25    manufacturing, so I had to find something else to do.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  All right.  So ArmorWorks had nothing to do 

            2    with the heavy equipment, screeners, anything like that?

            3         A.  Well, Humvees would be big enough. 

            4         Q.  Okay.  

            5         A.  They're big, gas -- we were building armor for 

            6    those in the Iraq era.

            7         Q.  All right.  You weren't involved in the safety, 

            8    design of the Humvees themselves, correct?

            9         A.  No, sir.

           10         Q.  ESG Engineering, 2008 to 2009, what type of 

           11    work did you do there?

           12         A.  I helped with -- with solar panel development.  

           13    We built big structures that fit on top of parking 

           14    facilities.  The -- the solar would track the sun and 

           15    follow the sun as they go across, of course, using the 

           16    surface area that we had on parking ramps, one across 

           17    from the University of Arizona -- 

           18         Q.  Okay.  

           19         A.  -- one of the major ones.  One -- I'm sorry.  

           20    One -- one of the biggest ones was the one across from 

           21    the football stadium at Arizona State University.  

           22             I also worked on a small vehicle.  It's -- was 

           23    a three -- three-wheel commuter, and I did quite a bit 

           24    of work on the suspension system on that one.

           25         Q.  Okay.  And it looks like you spent a little 








                                                                          


            1    time at the Maricopa Unified School District as a 

            2    volunteer in 2010 and 2011.  And then -- were you 

            3    teaching?  

            4         A.  No.  They were -- they had a project where they 

            5    were trying to encourage their freshman students to 

            6    figure out what they were going to do with their lives.  

            7    So they had a program initiated by the state that would 

            8    allow them to go into what they call the "kneecap 

            9    system," and that would try to help their -- develop 

           10    their careers.  At the time, I had some time that I 

           11    could use, so . . .  

           12         Q.  Okay.  Did you -- did you go back to John Deere 

           13    in 2009?

           14         A.  Yes, I did.

           15         Q.  What was the nature of your responsibility 

           16    then?  

           17         A.  They wanted me to work from remote and help 

           18    them further their activities.  I helped them in the 

           19    2004 time frame.  They were getting to that point again, 

           20    refresh their memory. 

           21         Q.  Okay.  

           22         A.  So it was a very short contractual . . .

           23         Q.  Now, what's Augspurger Komm Engineering?  Where 

           24    is that located?

           25         A.  That's located in Arizona.  








                                                                          


            1         Q.  All right.  And so you made a move.  What -- 

            2    what did you do between 2009 and 2012?

            3         A.  2009 and 2012?  I thought you said that I 

            4    volunteered and a few things like that.  

            5         Q.  Oh, I see.  2010, 2011 is a volunteer?

            6         A.  Uh-huh.

            7         Q.  Okay.  Ox -- how did you end up going to 

            8    Augspurger Komm Engineering?

            9         A.  Well, there was a gentlemen who wanted to 

           10    retire.  He was a forensic engineer.  He wanted to 

           11    retire, so he recruited me.  He said, Hey, have you ever 

           12    thought about forensics?  So I took my Professional 

           13    Engineers exam and passed it.  So I'm a forensic 

           14    engineer now.

           15         Q.  All right.  During the four years while you 

           16    were at Augspurger, did you -- were you involved in 

           17    litigation cases during that time?

           18         A.  Yes, right.

           19         Q.  All right.  And was all of your work basically 

           20    related to litigation?

           21         A.  Correct.

           22         Q.  Were you hired by any companies as outside 

           23    consultants to do forensic engineering, or was it purely 

           24    litigation related?

           25         A.  Only one case that I can think of that was not 








                                                                          


            1    purely lit.  It was to look to see whether a crane could 

            2    be routed on the California -- from one place to 

            3    another.  You have to have an engineering approval for 

            4    moving a crane and making sure that it's not going to 

            5    hold up traffic or anything, you know.  It has to clear 

            6    -- it has to clear everything.

            7         Q.  Okay.  With the exception of that incident or 

            8    that situation, is there a way for you to describe for 

            9    me whether all of your litigation-related work was 

           10    plaintiff work or all of your litigation was defendant 

           11    work or a mix of both?

           12         A.  We try to stay 50/50.  I'm sure there's some 

           13    that drifted to 60/40 on occasions, but we were -- our 

           14    goal was to try to stay as neutral as we could be.

           15         Q.  Then you, in 2016, made the move to FACETics, 

           16    correct?

           17         A.  Well, yeah.  I just -- I just became a sole 

           18    proprietor at that time.

           19         Q.  All right.  So you just changed the -- is it 

           20    the same business but you changed the name and became a 

           21    sole proprietor?  Or you -- you started your own 

           22    company?

           23         A.  I started my own company.  Well, I had started 

           24    the company in 2004 as a consulting company, but I 

           25    extended it.  Now that I had the credentials as a P.E. 








                                                                          


            1    and so forth, I just extended it as a . . .

            2         Q.  Oh, okay.  So in 2004 you started FACETics?

            3         A.  Correct.

            4         Q.  What did you do between 2004 and 2016 as 

            5    FACETics?

            6         A.  Basically took contract work and did -- over in 

            7    Europe they called me a freiberuflich- -- 

            8    freiberuflicher, a freelancer.  So I did freelance work 

            9    basically for . . .

           10         Q.  And what -- what type of freelance work were 

           11    you doing?

           12         A.  Consulting.

           13         Q.  For -- for who?

           14         A.  FACETics.  The word "FACETics" comes from two 

           15    -- two terms, "facet" and I-C-S, which is a system of 

           16    facets.  And I was doing a lot of work in regard to 

           17    keeping track of artifacts, and people were having 

           18    difficulty.  They -- they couldn't -- I don't know if 

           19    you're familiar with the Dewey Decimal System.  

           20    Basically, there's a list of things and you try to 

           21    figure out which category they fit in out of the -- the 

           22    best one out of that whole list.  

           23             Well, with the advent of the -- of the 

           24    computer, there was a gentleman over in India who worked 

           25    for the library system that came up with a process 








                                                                          


            1    called -- his name was Ranganathan, and he came up with 

            2    a process where you classify them in different points of 

            3    view.  His was PSMET or something like that which had to 

            4    do with a lot of different categories.  

            5             But the bottom line is it's hard to find things 

            6    unless you classify them in a way that you can really 

            7    understand them.  We were having problems in the company 

            8    at John Deere trying to figure out how to find the 

            9    software version that goes with this hardware and so 

           10    forth.  So I was trying to help them understand how to 

           11    do this classification system so that everybody could 

           12    find what they were looking for in a different way, and 

           13    it's basically seven -- seven facets that I pro- -- I 

           14    propose.  So that was kind of the contract work that I 

           15    was doing along with -- during that time.

           16         Q.  Okay.  So --

           17         A.  And then I worked as a -- as the contract -- as 

           18    -- as -- for ArmorWorks and then John Deere again and so 

           19    forth.

           20         Q.  So was the contract work for FACETics for John 

           21    Deere?

           22         A.  Yes, uh-huh.

           23         Q.  Was the contract work for FACETics for 

           24    ArmorWorks?

           25         A.  There they might have classified me as an 








                                                                          


            1    employee.  But, you know, I was under -- as it goes, I 

            2    was working in my mind as working with smaller companies 

            3    trying to help them understand how that works.  And you 

            4    can see the work there was related to how to organize 

            5    the -- their product.

            6         Q.  Okay.  And then -- so when you went to 

            7    Augspurger to move into the field of forensic 

            8    engineering, did you have to go through any additional 

            9    training?

           10         A.  Well, we -- I was all in-house basically, and I 

           11    also -- I went to a lot of conferences, joined NSPE, 

           12    National Society of Professional Engineers, and that 

           13    allowed me based on -- the academy doesn't let you in 

           14    until you fulfill a certain amount of forensic 

           15    engineering background and can demonstrate your skills.  

           16    So I became a member of the National Asso- Academy of 

           17    Forensic Engineers.

           18         Q.  Okay.  

           19         A.  They -- they admitted me.

           20         Q.  All right.  So in 2016, why did you leave 

           21    Augspurger and sort of go solo?

           22         A.  I went solo because I wanted a little more 

           23    flexibility in my time.  I -- I understood the business 

           24    and I thought -- felt that I could have that 

           25    flexibility.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Okay.  And so -- and then since that time, 

            2    you've done -- you've been involved in litigation in 

            3    patent cases?

            4         A.  I -- I have, yeah.

            5         Q.  All right.  And you mentioned earlier the 

            6    mention of having testified under oath in a soil 

            7    screener case is actually this case?

            8         A.  Was it a soil screener?  

            9         Q.  Yes.  

           10         A.  I'm trying to think.  I may have been premature 

           11    there.

           12         Q.  But it is this case?  You got it in there 

           13    before it happened, but this is the case.  I'm just 

           14    trying to make sure you haven't previously testified -- 

           15         A.  No, I have not.

           16         Q.  -- in another piece of litigation where issues 

           17    related to a screener or the safety of a screener were 

           18    at issue.  

           19         A.  No, I have not.

           20         Q.  All right.  Fair enough.  

           21         A.  I think I was anticipating the -- I think I had 

           22    a -- September of that year, I had -- 2008 -- I had a 

           23    request to come testify here.

           24         Q.  Okay.  And you've testified in tractor rollover 

           25    cases?








                                                                          


            1         A.  I have, yes.

            2         Q.  Tractor/mower thrown object cases?

            3         A.  I have.

            4         Q.  Automotive sunroof leaks?

            5         A.  I have.

            6         Q.  Back at Augspurger, you testified with respect 

            7    to expert issues in heavy construction equipment 

            8    hydraulic systems?

            9         A.  Yes, I have.

           10         Q.  You do have an entry under Augspurger for 

           11    agricultural machinery guarding and warning?

           12         A.  I do.

           13         Q.  What -- what's -- do you remember the case 

           14    where you testified on that?

           15         A.  I did.

           16         Q.  What was at issue in that case?

           17         A.  There was a soil -- a sod harvester case.  A 

           18    gentleman was trying to brush a piece of sod -- they 

           19    used a sod harvester for harvesting sod, but they also 

           20    used a harvester for scraping.  

           21             Essentially what you want to do is have a very 

           22    flat surface where sod can grow.  So after they cut the 

           23    sod the first time, sometimes they leaves scraps where 

           24    it's -- the water -- the -- the grass isn't all that 

           25    healthy and they go around it and they leave it there, 








                                                                          


            1    but they have to come back and do what they call 

            2    "scrape."  

            3             Well, he was out scraping that day, and he saw 

            4    a piece of sod bouncing on the -- on the metal track 

            5    that picks it up and puts it into a roll.  And so he 

            6    reached in with his gloved hand and tried to move it 

            7    off, and his hand got caught and -- in between the 

            8    roller and the track and it pulled him in.  

            9             He was standing on -- balanced himself on the 

           10    roller.  It took everything off him.  He was naked and 

           11    he was bleeding profusely when they finally found him.  

           12    He was able to put his head up against the -- the 

           13    harvester to get his -- answer his phone or call -- call 

           14    for help.  And when they got there, his arm had been 

           15    chewed up so bad they had to remove the hand.

           16         Q.  Who were you hired by in that case?

           17         A.  In that case, I was actually hired by the 

           18    plaintiff.

           19         Q.  Okay.  And who were the defendants in the case?

           20         A.  The defendants in the case was a company called 

           21    Buck Cyrus.  

           22         Q.  Bucyrus?

           23         A.  Bucyrus.  

           24         Q.  Yeah.  

           25         A.  Do you know them?  








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Yeah.  Where was that case pending?  Where was 

            2    that case pending?

            3         A.  Oh, it -- in Arizona.

            4         Q.  Arizona.  Did you actually provide testimony in 

            5    the case?

            6         A.  I gave a deposition and it settled.

            7         Q.  All right.  Okay.

            8         A.  In favor -- in favor of the plaintiff, I might 

            9    say.

           10         Q.  Do you remember the name of the case?

           11         A.  I don't.  It's in my . . .  

           12         Q.  It's in the list.  All right.  Let's turn to 

           13    your -- it's actually Page 72 of your report.  

           14                   MR. ROBINSON:  And just so we're 

           15              clear, the -- we marked the updated CV as 

           16              C-1.  Let's make an updated list of 

           17              testimony C-2, please.  

           18                        (Defendants' Exhibit C-2,

           19                         updated list of testimony,

           20                         marked for identification.)

           21                   MR. ROBINSON:  Thank you.

           22    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           23         Q.  By the way, with FACETics, are you the sole 

           24    employee of FACETics?

           25         A.  My wife helps me out, but we're a sole -- sole 








                                                                          


            1    proprietorship.

            2         Q.  Yeah, does she perform forensic analysis 

            3    engineering, or does she like keep the books, that type 

            4    of thing?

            5         A.  That type of thing.

            6         Q.  All right.  So she helps you with the -- with 

            7    the bookkeeping?

            8         A.  Right.

            9         Q.  All right.  So I'll give you what's been marked 

           10    as Exhibit C-2, which is an updated list of testimony.  

           11    I see that the version that we had from your report 

           12    seems to only be missing the most recent entry at the 

           13    top of Exhibit C-2; is that correct?

           14         A.  That's correct.

           15         Q.  All right.  What were the -- what was the 

           16    nature of the issues at play in the Cole Bradshaw case?

           17         A.  Cole Bradshaw was a thrown objects from a 

           18    mower.

           19         Q.  All right.  Who were you hired by?

           20         A.  I was hired by a company in Texas.  I can't 

           21    remember the name.

           22         Q.  Were you hired by the defendant in that case or 

           23    the plaintiff?

           24         A.  The plaintiff.

           25         Q.  All right.  And was it about mower issues with 








                                                                          


            1    guarding against objects being thrown out -- 

            2         A.  Well, actually, it was kind of an interesting 

            3    case.  They had -- he was mowing an area that had just 

            4    been under development, and somebody had stripped the 

            5    copper out of some -- some underground cable and hidden 

            6    it alongside of a fence line.  And as he was mowing, it 

            7    came out of the mower, bounced off the back wheel axle 

            8    and hit him in the head, pierced his skull and had 

            9    called -- he was able to call and get some help, and 

           10    they put a plate -- a plate in his head to fix -- to fix 

           11    it, but he was able to survive.

           12         Q.  Okay.  Do you recall the name of the firm that 

           13    hired you in that case?

           14         A.  That was in Texas.  I'm going to say -- oh, 

           15    man.  I -- I think it's -- it was I-K-I-N.

           16         Q.  I-K-I-N is the firm?

           17         A.  Uh-huh.  

           18         Q.  Do you remember what city in Texas?

           19         A.  I think it was in Houston.

           20         Q.  And did you give just deposition or deposition 

           21    and trial testimony in that case?

           22         A.  That settled, too.  I just gave dep- -- 

           23    deposition.

           24         Q.  Deposition and then the case settled.  All 

           25    right.  








                                                                          


            1             Marinex, Inc. v. Double Press Manufacturing, do 

            2    you know who you were hired by in that case?

            3         A.  I was hired by the plaintiff in that case 

            4    again.

            5         Q.  All right.  And in that case, do you know who 

            6    the firm was that hired you?

            7         A.  I think it was Baker & Baker.

            8         Q.  All right.  And did you provide deposition and 

            9    trial testimony or --

           10         A.  That was an arbitration.  I had to -- I gave 

           11    deposition and then I had -- the next day, I had to give 

           12    testimony at trial or arbitration.

           13         Q.  At the arbitration, okay.  

           14         A.  It was a retired Judge but, nonetheless, 

           15    conducted the same way.  

           16         Q.  All right.  I see two entries for Marinex here 

           17    on two different dates, December 7th of '16, November 

           18    16th of '16.  Are those the two -- is that the 

           19    deposition and the arbitration testimony?

           20         A.  Right.  You'll notice down below, there's a -- 

           21    the type of testimony I was giving is in column "Type."

           22         Q.  Yeah, I was going to ask you about that.  

           23    What's -- what are these designations?  What's D?  

           24         A.  D says "deposition"; doesn't it?  

           25         Q.  Oh, okay.  Oh, is there something that tells me 








                                                                          


            1    that?

            2         A.  There's a key at the bottom.

            3                   MR. FOTI:  There's a legend at the 

            4              bottom.  You don't have it on yours.

            5                   MR. ROBINSON:  I don't have it on 

            6              mine, okay.

            7    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            8         Q.  All right.  The new version actually gives us a 

            9    legend for your categories.  I was going to ask you 

           10    that.  A is "arbitration."  D is "deposition."  T is 

           11    "trial," correct?

           12         A.  Correct.

           13         Q.  So the only time you've ever testified at trial 

           14    was in the Bombardier Recreational Products case?

           15         A.  Every one -- other one has settled.

           16         Q.  Yep.  And the Bombardier case was -- you were 

           17    hired by whom?

           18         A.  A company in Canada, a big company in Canada.  

           19    I can't remember the name.

           20         Q.  Was it Artic Cat?

           21         A.  No.  I was working -- oh, yeah, I was working 

           22    for Arctic Cat on that one.  

           23         Q.  All right.  So you were -- was this a patent 

           24    case?

           25         A.  Yes.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Okay.  Do you know the name of the firm you 

            2    were working for in that case?

            3         A.  I'm trying to bring it back but it's so long 

            4    ago.

            5         Q.  All right.  Hartford Fire Insurance Company v. 

            6    Scherer, that's a deposition.  Were you on behalf of the 

            7    plaintiff or the defendant in that one?

            8         A.  I was on the defendant on that one.

            9         Q.  Do you know the name of the firm that hired 

           10    you?  

           11         A.  It was -- you know -- I'm so sorry.

           12         Q.  It's okay.  

           13         A.  It's an Arizona firm.  It was -- they were out 

           14    of -- out of Phoenix.

           15         Q.  That was an Arizona case.  What was at issue in 

           16    that case?

           17         A.  They just purchased a half million dollars 

           18    worth of forage harvester equipment, one with a lad- -- 

           19    tall ladder, a big platform and all those kind of 

           20    things.  And it was less than a hundred hours and it 

           21    burned to the ground.

           22         Q.  So what was the nature of your involvement?

           23         A.  Well, the problem was that a third-party 

           24    actually produces a better kernel processor than CLAAS 

           25    makes, so they purchased this -- a new -- a new kernel 








                                                                          


            1    processor at the same time they bought the machine; 

            2    however, the kernel processor arrived on a different 

            3    date than the -- than the forage harvester.  So they 

            4    allege that this new processor had been put into the 

            5    machine.  And as it turned out, it was a case of fraud 

            6    basically.  They had -- they had -- a third-party had -- 

            7    had rebuilt the kernel processor and had completely 

            8    miss . . .  

            9         Q.  Okay, okay.  Let me ask you a different 

           10    question.  Safe to say that none of the cases in which 

           11    you've testified have involved a screener, correct?

           12         A.  That's safe to say.

           13         Q.  In any of the cases where you testified, was 

           14    the analysis of OSHA regulations, MSHA regulations or 

           15    any of the similar issues that are an issue in our given 

           16    case that we're here for, were they -- were any of those 

           17    types of analyses done for any of these cases?

           18         A.  It's hard to understand the word "similar."  

           19         Q.  All right.  Did you have to -- did you provide 

           20    any testimony related to the analysis of OSHA 

           21    regulations in any of these cases?

           22         A.  I did.

           23         Q.  Which ones?

           24         A.  The one where the gentleman lost his hand.

           25         Q.  That would have been the -- which case?  Is 








                                                                          


            1    that the Licka case or is that the Bradshaw case?

            2         A.  Neither one of those.  

            3         Q.  Okay.  I missed it then.  Which one was it?

            4         A.  Grieser v. Bucyrus.  

            5         Q.  Okay.  In any cases, did you -- any of these 

            6    cases, did you provide any testimony as it relates to 

            7    mining regulations?

            8         A.  No.

            9         Q.  All right.  Were any of the regulations that 

           10    are actually at issue in your report in this case the 

           11    same OSHA regulations that were at issue in the case 

           12    where you testified?

           13         A.  Maybe a warning issue.

           14         Q.  Okay.  

           15         A.  That would be the only connection, I think.  I 

           16    think it's only a warning issue; that might be it.

           17         Q.  All right.  And that was the case where you 

           18    testified on behalf of the defendant with respect to 

           19    that lawn mower, correct?

           20         A.  I don't think that's correct.  

           21         Q.  Who did you -- who was your -- who was your 

           22    client?  Who were you working for in the case where you 

           23    provided the OSHA-related testimony?

           24         A.  Buck Cyrus.

           25         Q.  Oh, that's the Bucyrus case.  All right, fine.  








                                                                          


            1    All right.  I'll give you that back.  All right.  So you 

            2    were first retained in December of 2017 by the Brignole 

            3    firm, correct?

            4         A.  That's correct, I think.

            5         Q.  All right.  Do you remember how that came 

            6    about?

            7         A.  I think there was a -- there's a company called 

            8    The Expert Institute out of New York City.  I think they 

            9    were the ones that first approached me about it.

           10         Q.  Okay.  Had you ever done any work for Tim 

           11    Brignole or his firm prior to that?

           12         A.  No, sir.

           13         Q.  All right.  Have you ever done any work for 

           14    Attorney Foti's firm?

           15         A.  No, sir.

           16         Q.  All right.  Let's turn to your report which has 

           17    been marked as Exhibit C.  When you first got hired to 

           18    do an analysis of this case, what was your understanding 

           19    of the scope of the assignment?

           20         A.  I was supposed to conduct a safety assessment 

           21    analysis from the documentation that he provided me.

           22         Q.  Were you supposed to conduct a full-blown 

           23    analysis of the -- of any and all issues that you 

           24    identified as a result of your inspection of the Warrior 

           25    1800 at issue?  Or was your assignment more limited that 








                                                                          


            1    than that?

            2         A.  I had already mentioned that my mode   

            3    operendum (sic) is to look at any safety issue.  In 

            4    fact, I've had to actually call into question whether 

            5    something should be actually operated any further in 

            6    several of my cases.  So if I see a safety issue, I will 

            7    generally report that.

            8         Q.  You've drawn that conclusion in this case, that 

            9    this -- that the Warrior 1800 as it existed on the date 

           10    of this incident should not continue to be operated; is 

           11    that correct?

           12         A.  I think I -- my -- my conclusions are on Page 

           13    60- -- I'm getting there.  On Page 64, I believe I -- 

           14    I've already identified that due to the serious nature 

           15    of the defects and nonconformance to federal code, this 

           16    screener on track should not be sold to any U.S. 

           17    customer without modifications to comply with all the 

           18    compliant -- the applicable OSHA and MSHA regulations.

           19         Q.  Okay.  Should it be rented to others for use?

           20         A.  It's in the process of being litigated right 

           21    now.  So, at this point, I -- I am not taking any 

           22    action.

           23         Q.  Well, what do you mean by that?

           24         A.  What I mean is, under my -- as a professional 

           25    engineer, I'm called upon when I see something that 








                                                                          


            1    is -- that is a danger to the public, I'm called upon to 

            2    take action to mitigate it, to get it done.  So -- 

            3         Q.  All right.  

            4         A.  -- under courtesy of my client, I'm careful not 

            5    to necessarily raise this.  I've -- I've already brought 

            6    the awareness -- with my report, I've brought the 

            7    awareness to -- to the company that produced this 

            8    machine.

            9         Q.  Right.  So --

           10         A.  So it's -- 

           11         Q.  -- my question is -- I'm sorry.  I don't want 

           12    to cut you off, but my question was, you've indicated 

           13    here it should not be sold?

           14         A.  Uh-huh.  

           15         Q.  Right.  

           16                   COURT REPORTER:  Yes?  

           17                   THE WITNESS:  The answer is yes.

           18    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           19         Q.  Right.  And do you also agree if one is owned 

           20    by an entity, it should also not be rented to another 

           21    for use as it exists?

           22         A.  I believe the manufacturer has a lot of 

           23    responsibility to recall those machines and make sure 

           24    that they are correctly built properly.

           25         Q.  All right.  So my question is, should an entity 








                                                                          


            1    here in the United States that owns one of those 

            2    machines as it existed at the time you inspected it, 

            3    should that machine be rented to another for use?

            4         A.  Who is renting it to whom for use?  And what do 

            5    they know about this particular case?  

            6         Q.  What's the difference?  If your position is 

            7    that it shouldn't be sold at all because of the nature 

            8    of the defects that you find in it, don't you also agree 

            9    that nobody should be renting it to someone else to use 

           10    it?

           11         A.  I think the manufacturer should fix the 

           12    machines before they put them out there.  They need to 

           13    put a recall out so people understand that they're dan- 

           14    -- using a dangerous machine.

           15         Q.  Okay.  So let -- let me -- let me just ask you 

           16    to answer the question that I posed.  Putting aside your 

           17    opinion on what the manufacturer should do, if an entity 

           18    in the United States, a U.S. entity, owns and possesses 

           19    one of these machines, should it actively rent them to 

           20    others for use?

           21                   MR. FOTI:  I have to object just to 

           22              the form of the question.  Are you asking 

           23              an entity that is -- that is aware of the 

           24              issue?  

           25                   MR. ROBINSON:  Sure.  








                                                                          


            1         A.  Okay.  If they're aware of the issue, then they 

            2    should not rent it.  On occasion, people are not aware 

            3    that they've got a dangerous machine and they continue 

            4    to do that.  I don't know that I can stop -- I think 

            5    it's the owner -- owner and manufacturer that, when they 

            6    know that there's something wrong, they need a recall.  

            7    That's essentially the . . .  

            8    BY MR. ROBINSON:

            9         Q.  Do you know what Graham Wylie does for a 

           10    living?

           11         A.  I believe he's a salesman.

           12         Q.  For who?

           13         A.  I think he sells a lot of different products.

           14         Q.  For who?

           15         A.  I think he works for Powerscreen New England.  

           16    I may be -- may be off.  I know that the names have 

           17    changed and . . .

           18         Q.  Okay.  

           19         A.  I think that's where he works now.

           20         Q.  Do you know that as part of the way Graham 

           21    Wylie has made a living since the accident is to either 

           22    sell and/or rent the Warrior 1800?

           23         A.  I think I read in his deposition that he had 

           24    told a -- a new person that this machine is -- I don't 

           25    think he used the word "dangerous."  I think he used the 








                                                                          


            1    word if you don't have a gate on it, be careful of it.  

            2    It will hurt you -- it could hurt you.  I think I 

            3    remember reading that in his deposition, that he was 

            4    warning his new clients that this machine had a problem.

            5         Q.  All right.  So -- but does that absolve -- 

            6    well, hold on a second.  You said a moment ago that 

            7    nobody -- nobody that's aware of the issue should either 

            8    sell or rent this machine to someone else for use in -- 

            9    in the condition that it's in, correct?

           10         A.  I think I said that the manufacturer needs to 

           11    recall these machines.  If that's not my opinion here -- 

           12    I think I've said it here, the -- should not be sold to 

           13    any U.S. customer without modification to comply with 

           14    all the applicable OSHA and M- -- MSHA regulations.  So 

           15    I think the only people that can actually modify that 

           16    machine is the manufacturer.

           17         Q.  All right.  

           18                   THE WITNESS:  Time?  Are we doing 

           19              okay?

            3    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            4         Q.  Okay.  So in -- in your report, you have a 

            5    section where you tell us all about all the materials 

            6    that were received.  When you say received, you mean 

            7    received from counsel in the case, correct?

            8         A.  That's correct. 

            9         Q.  And then you went out and obtained a variety of 

           10    other materials on your own, correct?

           11         A.  I did, yes.

           12         Q.  You went and inspected the machine on -- I've 

           13    got the date somewhere.  You went and inspected the 

           14    machine on July 29, 2018; is that correct?

           15         A.  I'm looking for my inspection section.  I don't 

           16    put my -- these dates to mind here.  It was on July 29, 

           17    2018, yes.

           18         Q.  Yeah.  And how long were you there that day?

           19         A.  I'd have to look at my financial -- I think I 

           20    was there three or four, maybe five hours.  I -- I'm 

           21    only estimating here.

           22         Q.  The billing records might tell us that?

           23         A.  Yeah, they'll tell you that.

           24         Q.  Okay.  And were you alone or were you with 

           25    others?








                                                                          


            1         A.  I was with others.

            2         Q.  Who else was there?

            3         A.  There was a photographer there.  I don't know 

            4    his name.  I have his card but I don't remember it.

            5         Q.  Are -- are the -- are the photographs that have 

            6    been marked as -- 

            7                   MR. COYNE:  E.

            8                   MR. FOTI:  E.

            9    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           10         Q.  -- as Exhibit E, were those taken by that 

           11    photographer?

           12         A.  No, sir.

           13         Q.  These are your photographs?

           14         A.  These are my photographs.

           15         Q.  But there was an additional photographer there?

           16         A.  Correct.

           17         Q.  Do you know who they were there on behalf of?

           18         A.  I didn't ask.

           19         Q.  Do you -- do you know -- was Attorney Brignole 

           20    with you that day?

           21         A.  Yes, he was.

           22         Q.  Was the photographer with you as part of your 

           23    group that was inspecting the screener?

           24         A.  He was doing his independent work.  I wasn't 

           25    aware of what was going on there.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Okay.  Was Graham Wylie there?

            2         A.  He was, yes.

            3         Q.  All right.  Was there anybody else there?

            4         A.  Not that I recall.

            5         Q.  Were any of the Sheelans there?

            6         A.  No.

            7         Q.  Do you know who they are?

            8         A.  No.

            9         Q.  Do you know if anybody from -- anybody else 

           10    besides Graham Wylie from Powerscreen Connecticut was 

           11    there?

           12         A.  No.

           13         Q.  Was Attorney Brignole the only lawyer there?

           14         A.  He was.

           15         Q.  I also noted that in your report you indicated 

           16    that you also have a conversation with Mr. Wylie about 

           17    the case, correct?

           18         A.  I don't know if I -- could you show me that?  

           19    Maybe I --

           20         Q.  Let me see where it is.  

           21         A.  If it's my report, I think I . . .

           22         Q.  I'm not sure exactly where it is, but I think 

           23    you indicate you had a discussion with Mr. Wylie.  I'll 

           24    see if I can find it.  

           25             Let's put it this way:  Do you recall, as you 








                                                                          


            1    sit here today, if you had a conversation with Mr. Wylie 

            2    as part of your investigation?

            3         A.  He asked me if I wanted a coffee and went and 

            4    got me a coffee, as I recall.

            5         Q.  All right.  So you don't recall anything 

            6    besides that?

            7         A.  No.

            8         Q.  So there's nothing about any conversation that 

            9    you had with Mr. Wylie that informs you as it relates to 

           10    your opinions in this case?

           11         A.  No, sir.

           12         Q.  All right.  So as it relates to Mr. Wylie's 

           13    rendition of the events related to this case, all of 

           14    your information would come from his deposition 

           15    transcript, fair?

           16         A.  That's fair.

           17         Q.  All right.  And you received the Witte and 

           18    Richardson depositions as part of the materials you 

           19    received?

           20         A.  I'm trying to think.  I did receive Dan Witte's 

           21    but I'm not -- maybe if it's -- if it's in here, it's -- 

           22    I'm not sure.  

           23         Q.  All right.  I stand corrected.  If you look at 

           24    the last page, which is Page 8 of your report, which is 

           25    the last section of materials you received --








                                                                          


            1         A.  Yeah.  

            2         Q.  -- there's a list.  You received Mr. Witte's 

            3    deposition?

            4         A.  I did.

            5         Q.  Did you read it in its entirety?

            6         A.  I did.

            7         Q.  You were not provided with the exhibits from 

            8    that deposition?

            9         A.  That's correct.

           10         Q.  Was there any difficulty in assessing the 

           11    testimony as it related to the exhibits without being 

           12    able to look at the exhibits?

           13         A.  I don't know.

           14         Q.  Don't recall?

           15         A.  Don't recall.

           16         Q.  All right.  Did you read in detail Mr. Wylie's 

           17    videotaped deposition?

           18         A.  I didn't see the video.

           19         Q.  Did you read the transcript?

           20         A.  Did I read the transcript of that?  Yes, I 

           21    think I did.

           22         Q.  Okay.  You also did not receive all of the 

           23    exhibits that were part of Mr. Wylie's deposition.  Do 

           24    you recall whether you had any difficulty understanding 

           25    any of the testimony without having the exhibits 








                                                                          


            1    available to you?

            2         A.  I don't know at this point whether that would 

            3    have changed my opinion.

            4         Q.  Okay.  You received also the two depositions of 

            5    Oliver Donnelly?

            6         A.  That's correct, yes.

            7         Q.  Okay.  

            8         A.  One was -- you'll note the difference there is 

            9    one was condensed and the other was full.

           10         Q.  Okay.  All right.  And did you read 

           11    Mr. Donnelly's deposition in detail?

           12         A.  I did.

           13         Q.  And it looks like you did not receive a 

           14    transcript from Mr. Richardson's deposition, correct?

           15         A.  I did not.

           16         Q.  Okay.  At any point in time, have you learned 

           17    anything about the testimony of Mr. Richardson?

           18         A.  I have not.

           19         Q.  Okay.  Other than what is listed in detail in 

           20    your report and the few items that have been provided to 

           21    us today that we've marked as exhibits, is there 

           22    anything else that you relied on to form your opinions 

           23    in this case?

           24         A.  I would just note that I didn't get the 

           25    invitation to this deposition until yesterday as well.  








                                                                          


            1    So those are not late coming.  They just didn't come 

            2    because I didn't know whether I was invited to a 

            3    deposition or not.  So the point is, I know we've talked 

            4    about it several times that you're getting them late 

            5    but --

            6         Q.  That's -- that's not my point.  All I'm trying 

            7    to make --

            8         A.  Okay.

            9         Q.  -- sure is -- 

           10         A.  All right.  I just wanted to clarify that.

           11         Q.  Including what we've added -- 

           12         A.  Okay.

           13         Q.  -- as exhibits here today -- 

           14         A.  Right.

           15         Q.  -- coupled with everything that has already 

           16    been produced and is identified and listed in your 

           17    report -- 

           18         A.  Uh-huh.

           19         Q.  -- did you rely on any other materials for 

           20    purposes of rendering your opinions in this case?

           21         A.  No, sir.

           22         Q.  Okay.  Did you also separately inspect an 

           23    additional Warrior 1800 besides the one at issue in this 

           24    case?

           25         A.  I did not.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  You did not, okay.  Did you personally, at any 

            2    point in time, physically get up on the screener when 

            3    you were involved in your inspection?

            4         A.  No, sir.

            5         Q.  Did Mr. Wylie physically get up on the screener 

            6    at all while you were doing your inspection?

            7         A.  I didn't pay attention.

            8         Q.  I think your report indicated that they -- it 

            9    was inoperable, right?  They couldn't raise and lower it 

           10    when you were there to inspect it?

           11         A.  No, sir, that was operable. 

           12         Q.  Oh, did -- was it raised and lowered while you 

           13    were there?

           14         A.  Yes, it was.

           15         Q.  Okay.  Did you consult with any other 

           16    experts -- 

           17         A.  Can I clarify that last one?  

           18         Q.  Yeah, sure.  

           19         A.  You said was it operable.  The answer is it was 

           20    not mobile.  I'm sorry.

           21         Q.  All right.  I think I misread -- I misstated my 

           22    question.  I think your report indicates that the unit 

           23    itself, the screener, was not mobile due to certain 

           24    reasons; however, I think what you're saying is that did 

           25    not prevent you from raising and lowering the platform, 








                                                                          


            1    correct?

            2         A.  That's correct. 

            3         Q.  Okay.  Fair enough.  And I think --

            4         A.  I mean, that's the problem I have with 

            5    answering that first question.  Are the answers all --

            6         Q.  No need -- no need to explain.  I understand.  

            7    It was a bad question.  And I think the photographs 

            8    obviously will depict the screener in both the lowered 

            9    and raised position, correct?

           10         A.  Correct.

           11         Q.  All right.  Now, did you consult any other 

           12    experts, any other engineers, anybody from OSHA, 

           13    anybody, any other individuals with respect to the 

           14    formulation of your opinions?

           15                   MR. FOTI:  You're talking actually 

           16              speak to as opposed to reading reports 

           17              from?  

           18    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           19         Q.  Let's start with speak to.  

           20         A.  I don't believe I've spoken to anybody in this 

           21    case yet.

           22         Q.  Okay.  And when you say "yet," do you have an 

           23    intention of speaking with anyone else?

           24         A.  Well, unless I see some changes, I think I'm 

           25    obliged, as a -- as a P.E. to make some statements about 








                                                                          


            1    this.

            2         Q.  Who would you make those statements to?

            3         A.  Probably the -- if there's any committees or 

            4    whoever is trying to -- if there is any standards that 

            5    are involved, I'd certainly talk to them and ask them 

            6    if they're -- what their opinion was and if they need to 

            7    modify those -- those standards at all to -- to -- if 

            8    they're -- if they're sending out of compliance here.

            9         Q.  I'm confused.  Didn't you render your report 

           10    after assessing the standards that you believe apply?

           11         A.  I did, yes.

           12         Q.  Well, who else would you be talking about --

           13         A.  Well -- 

           14         Q.  -- as far as who you would go consult with or 

           15    advise of these issues?

           16         A.  Okay.  I am a -- a part of the ROPS Standard 

           17    Committee with the ASABE.

           18         Q.  Say that again.  

           19         A.  I am a member -- I'm a committee -- involved in 

           20    committees in S -- ASABE, American Society of 

           21    Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

           22         Q.  Okay.  

           23         A.  For example, they're responsible for the ROPS 

           24    committee.  And in the case of a rollover, I was -- I 

           25    approached them and I said, Look, I think your standard 








                                                                          


            1    -- the standards we have today are getting outdated.  

            2    They don't include a certain piece of equipment that's 

            3    involved here.  

            4             So I will go to those committees and try to see 

            5    if there's anything we can do to make sure that if 

            6    something hasn't been covered, that it is covered.

            7         Q.  All right.  So -- 

            8         A.  So that's -- that's how I start.  And then, if 

            9    that doesn't go anywhere, then I'll -- I'll work with 

           10    the -- with the authority on the jurisdiction.  

           11             In this case, there's two cases.  The machine 

           12    is used for wood products, which includes OSHA, and it's 

           13    included in gravel and whatever for mines.  So 

           14    essentially I wrote a letter to the -- to OSHA in regard 

           15    to one of my cases --

           16         Q.  Okay. 

           17         A.  -- and I'll follow through on it.

           18         Q.  All right.  And do you -- sorry I keep cutting 

           19    you off, but I thought you were done.  

           20             So you envision in this case writing -- first 

           21    starting by communicating with the ASABE committee about 

           22    your findings as it relates to this product.  And if 

           23    that doesn't remedy the situation, you would report the 

           24    issues to OSHA and/or the MSHA?

           25         A.  You've mischaracterized my statements.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Well, then tell me how I'm mischaracterizing 

            2    it.  

            3         A.  Well, I -- I don't think the ASABE -- this is 

            4    not an issue.  I was giving you an example of what I 

            5    have done in the past.  

            6         Q.  What would you do in this case?

            7         A.  Well, there certainly are standards that apply 

            8    here, right?  

            9         Q.  Right.  But as I understood your testimony, you 

           10    indicated that if -- if the standards don't properly 

           11    cover it, that you might go to that entity to see if the 

           12    standards can be improved or updated to properly address 

           13    the situation, correct?

           14         A.  That was what I gave you as an example, not 

           15    this case.  

           16         Q.  Okay.  What, if anything, do you plan to do in 

           17    this case?

           18         A.  I'll ask my counsel whether he wants me to 

           19    advance the case.

           20         Q.  So it's up to your lawyer?

           21         A.  No, it's -- right now it's under litigation and 

           22    I'm not going to -- you -- you and your firm are -- have 

           23    my report.  You know what's -- what my opinions are.  So 

           24    if there's no action taken, I will follow through and 

           25    make sure that the public is safe.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  But that will depend on a conversation you have 

            2    with Mr. Wylie's counsel?

            3         A.  I won't do it until it's released because 

            4    you -- your company now, the plaintiff, is aware of the 

            5    issue.  Now they may not agree with me at this point -- 

            6                   MR. FOTI:  You mean the defendant?  

            7                   THE WITNESS:  The defendant, yeah.

            8         A.  You may not agree with me at this point, but 

            9    I'm not going to take it there until this is settled one 

           10    way or another.

           11    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           12         Q.  All right.  Well --

           13         A.  Because the people that need to fix it know 

           14    about it.

           15         Q.  Are you saying that there's a question in your 

           16    mind as to whether the regulations you've cited properly 

           17    cover the situation?

           18         A.  No.

           19         Q.  There's no doubt in your mind?

           20         A.  No doubt in my mind.

           21         Q.  That all of the regulations you've cited for 

           22    violations apply to this situation and this screener?

           23         A.  I do.

           24         Q.  Okay.  And -- all right.  

           25         A.  But it's my duty as a professional engineer to 








                                                                          


            1    follow through if I feel the public is at risk.  I lose 

            2    my license if I don't.

            3         Q.  All right.  So just so I'm clear, so if and 

            4    when you get to the point where you want to exhaust that 

            5    public duty, the entities you would advise are OSHA and 

            6    the MHSA (sic), correct?

            7         A.  At this point, like I said, I think all the 

            8    standards are there that identify that there is a 

            9    problem here, so there wouldn't be no need to do that on 

           10    this case.

           11         Q.  Then who would you publicize it to?

           12         A.  I -- I was just answering your question.  I 

           13    know it's kind of a convoluted way but -- I think you're 

           14    right; the only two entities that have -- fully have 

           15    jurisdiction here right now are the -- are the MSHA and 

           16    OSHA.

           17         Q.  All right.  So it's your intent at some point 

           18    to advise those two entities about the Warrior 1800 in 

           19    its current iteration?

           20         A.  Not if it's a recall.  I mean, if the recall 

           21    takes place and you guys fix it, I mean the defendants 

           22    fix it, no problem.  But I have an obligation under my 

           23    license to do that.  That's the gravity of this 

           24    conclusion.

           25         Q.  As part of your investigation in this incident, 








                                                                          


            1    did you become aware of a single instance of any other 

            2    individual ever falling off the platform on a Warrior 

            3    1800?

            4         A.  I know I'm not going to give you a direct 

            5    answer here.  I'm just going to ask you -- in terms of 

            6    Boeing 737, they had two incidents.  Now it's going to 

            7    cost them 5.- -- 4.9 billion dollars in reparations.  

            8    I'm sorry.  One incident is enough here.  You need to 

            9    figure it out and figure out how to fix it.

           10                   MR. ROBINSON:  All right.  Obviously 

           11              motions to strike are reserved but . . .

           12    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           13         Q.  So the answer to my question is -- are you 

           14    aware of any other incident where anyone else has fallen 

           15    off the platform of a Warrior 1800?

           16         A.  No, but I am aware of one and that's enough.

           17         Q.  Okay.  And this all started with a line of 

           18    questioning where I asked whether you consulted any 

           19    other experts, any other engineers, anybody at OSHA, 

           20    anybody at MHSA (sic) before and as part of rendering 

           21    your report in this case.  And I think your answer was 

           22    no, you did not, correct?

           23         A.  I haven't carried it out beyond the confines of 

           24    my business at this point.

           25         Q.  All right.  Did you -- did you read any -- only 








                                                                          


            1    just because of the qualification from counsel, did you 

            2    re- -- read any other reports, incident reports, 

            3    anything like that from OSHA or MHSA (sic) or from any 

            4    other engineers or anyone as part of your analysis in 

            5    this case?

            6         A.  I perused them but I didn't pick any of them 

            7    out as something that I needed to include in my report.

            8         Q.  When you say you perused them, what did you 

            9    peruse?

           10         A.  I perused the -- the incident reports on MSHA 

           11    and I found nothing that had Warrior 1800 in it,      

           12    so . . .  

           13         Q.  Okay.  And, therefore, you didn't include them 

           14    as part of the materials reviewed in this case, correct?

           15         A.  Well, yeah, browsing through a lot of 

           16    information sometimes is -- and it doesn't -- if it 

           17    doesn't impact my opinions, I don't necessarily depend 

           18    on it.

           19         Q.  You don't think that it mattered that you -- 

           20    that you perused all the incident reports that you could 

           21    look at from MHSA (sic) and found no similar incident?

           22         A.  Well, it told me that my incident was one.  

           23    Certainly that gave me a -- a data point.

           24         Q.  But, nonetheless, you chose not to include all 

           25    of that information that would show the lack of a 








                                                                          


            1    similar incident in your report or in the materials 

            2    reviewed, correct?

            3         A.  My report is 136 pages, sir.  

            4         Q.  I get it.  So the answer is you made that 

            5    decision?

            6         A.  I made that decision, yeah.

            7         Q.  Okay.  Did you -- did you look at any OSHA 

            8    incident reports, anything like that?

            9         A.  No, I did not.  I didn't include that in my 

           10    purview.

           11         Q.  Anything else besides the MHA -- MHSA (sic) 

           12    reports?

           13         A.  Not that I recall.

           14         Q.  Where did you get the information as it related 

           15    to Powerscreen Connecticut changing its name to 

           16    Powerscreen New England?

           17         A.  Oh, I see where you're going with that.  Yeah, 

           18    I did include that.  Yeah, I think I included that in my 

           19    report, too.  You should have that as a -- as an 

           20    attachment here; isn't it?  Was it included here?  I 

           21    gave you a website on that on page -- what was it?  I 

           22    believe it was 88.  Was that your question?  

           23         Q.  What page are we looking at?

           24         A.  88 of 136.  That's when I purchased that.  

           25         Q.  Yeah, I mean, I can tell you that it's on   








                                                                          


            1    Page 3 of your report.  I'm just starting to get into 

            2    your report here where it indicates that Power- -- 

            3    Graham Wylie is an employee of Powerscreen New England.  

            4         A.  Okay, I'm sorry.

            5         Q.  The name of the company was changed from 

            6    Powerscreen Connecticut to Powerscreen New England in 

            7    2011, but I don't see a citation here, so I'm trying to 

            8    understand where you're getting that.  

            9         A.  Page -- I believe it was from their website.

           10         Q.  Okay.  

           11         A.  I think it's below -- if you look on Page 15, I 

           12    cited it.

           13         Q.  Page what?

           14         A.  Page 15.

           15         Q.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go back to Page 3 of 

           16    your report.  In the -- right below the paragraph that I 

           17    just referenced, it indicates that at the time of the 

           18    incident, Mr. Wylie was helping to set up a 

           19    demonstration screener.  What did you mean by that, set 

           20    up a demonstration screener?

           21         A.  I think he explained it well in his deposition.  

           22    If you read it fully, you'd see that he was talking 

           23    about there's a difference between what they do with a 

           24    rental and what they do with a demonstration.  

           25             The demonstration is their expectation that 








                                                                          


            1    they will buy it, so they put it in for a certain period 

            2    of time, try to make sure that the machine is operating 

            3    properly so that they get the best results from the 

            4    machine.  So they -- they handle them with a little more 

            5    tender care than they a rental because their expectation 

            6    is that some day it will be converted to a sale.

            7         Q.  Okay.  All right.  I just didn't -- I wasn't 

            8    sure if you were trying to say that he was doing -- 

            9    setting up a demonstration of the screener or if this 

           10    was a demonstration screener.  I get it.  Okay.  It's 

           11    the latter, correct?  

           12         A.  It's a demonstration machine.

           13         Q.  Got it.  Now, on the next paragraph, you 

           14    indicate on the date of the incident and by the time 

           15    Mr. Wylie arrived on the scene, Mastro employees had 

           16    already raised the screenbox to its mesh-change 

           17    position.  This means that the front jack-up cylinders 

           18    were in their extended position and they had secured the 

           19    jack-up links in mesh-change position, correct?

           20         A.  That's my understanding.

           21         Q.  All right.  Where do you get that 

           22    understanding?

           23         A.  From his deposition.

           24         Q.  Did you read the part of the deposition where 

           25    Mr. Wylie said he didn't recall one way or the other 








                                                                          


            1    whether the -- whether it was in the raised position or 

            2    in the lowered, working position?

            3         A.  You know, Mr. Wylie had a lot to say.  I had to 

            4    assume -- I had to -- not assume.  I had to read into it 

            5    with my judgment as to what was going on.

            6         Q.  How do you make a judgment whether he fell off 

            7    a raised platform or fell off the platform in the 

            8    lowered position?  How do you make that judgment without 

            9    actual evidence of what happened?

           10         A.  I think there was also evidence in Mr. Dan 

           11    Witte's.  I have to look and see.  I'm sorry; I may be 

           12    talking outside -- let me take a look, sorry.

           13         Q.  Sure, you can take a look.  

           14         A.  I don't . . .

           15         Q.  If I represent to you that Mr. Witte testified 

           16    that he was unable to say whether the screenbox was in 

           17    the raised or lowered position when Mr. Wylie arrived, 

           18    would -- would that refresh your recollection at all as 

           19    to what Mr. Witte said?

           20         A.  I'm trying to think.

           21                   MR. FOTI:  Do you need to look at 

           22              your -- 

           23                   THE WITNESS:  I need to -- 

           24                   MR. ROBINSON:  Sure.  

           25                   MR. FOTI:  Off the record.

           10    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           11         Q.  All right.  While we took a break there, you 

           12    went through the transcript, and I think maybe you found 

           13    some testimony that you're relying on.  Can -- can you 

           14    tell me what, if anything, you have found that Mr. Witte 

           15    said?

           16         A.  I haven't found anything that Mr. Witte said, 

           17    but I found testimony from Mr. Wylie, what Mr. Wylie 

           18    said.

           19         Q.  You did?

           20         A.  I did.

           21         Q.  Okay.  What did Mr. Wylie say?

           22         A.  On Page 124 of his transcript, Line No. 8 says, 

           23    It would have been the top pin.  

           24         Q.  Okay.  Do you know if anywhere else within 

           25    Mr. Wylie's own testimony he qualifies that answer?








                                                                          


            1         A.  Could we have a break?  

            2         Q.  I'm just asking you if you remember.  

            3         A.  I don't recall.  I mean, 123 -- Page 123 to -- 

            4    I read it but I can't remember if there was conflicting 

            5    testimony.

            6         Q.  All right.  Let's do this:  For purpose of your 

            7    opinions, do you agree that, regardless of what all the 

            8    testimony says, you are making the assumption for 

            9    purposes of your opinions that the catwalk was in the 

           10    Pin 3 elevated position at the time of the fall?

           11         A.  No.  No.  

           12         Q.  All right.  Then in what position are you -- in 

           13    what position are you assuming the catwalk to be at the 

           14    time of the fall?

           15         A.  I have to go by what this says, and I agree 

           16    there might -- there might be conflicts.  But, again, I 

           17    have to make that decision.  I think he was clear in his 

           18    testimony.  When he came up -- he was being asked what 

           19    he observed when he came up to the machine, and I have 

           20    to trust what he thought was happening at that time.

           21         Q.  Okay.  So what you're saying is you trust that 

           22    part of his testimony that you just cited to us, 

           23    correct?

           24         A.  That's evidence.  I mean, I understand.

           25         Q.  All right.  And if, in fact, he said somewhere 








                                                                          


            1    else that he really couldn't remember or something along 

            2    those lines, you're accepting that as the basis for 

            3    where the catwalk was in the elevated position at the 

            4    time of the fall, correct?

            5         A.  I am, yes.

            6         Q.  All right.  And so, for purposes of all of your 

            7    opinions, you are making the assumption that the catwalk 

            8    was in the elevated Pin 3 position, correct?

            9         A.  No, sir.  It didn't -- it did- -- doesn't 

           10    matter.  My opinion stays the same.  It's a dangerous 

           11    machine.  

           12         Q.  Okay.  

           13                   MR. ROBINSON:  We can take a break.  

           14         A.  They're working over the staircase.

           15                   MR. ROBINSON:  We can take a break.

           22    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           23         Q.  Okay.  Throughout your report, you refer to the 

           24    mesh-change position many, many times, correct?

           25         A.  I believe that's what I do, yes.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Right.  And so you consider the mesh-change 

            2    position to be the elevated position for the platform, 

            3    correct?

            4         A.  I'm using it in the terms that were in the 

            5    instructions.

            6         Q.  Right, the 23-step instructions mention the 

            7    mesh-change position, correct?

            8         A.  That's correct.

            9         Q.  Okay.  And -- but just so we're clear, I just 

           10    -- what I'm trying to do is just get some terminology 

           11    correct because I want to make sure we're on the same 

           12    page, right?  Is the jack-up position the same thing as 

           13    the mesh-change position?

           14         A.  I can only go based on the information that's 

           15    in the -- in the instructions.

           16         Q.  Well, I'm going on your report. 

           17         A.  Okay.  

           18         Q.  If you talk about jack-up -- 

           19         A.  Can I -- can I explain?  

           20         Q.  Yeah.  

           21         A.  I don't know.  The "jack-up" has been used 

           22    colloquial -- colloquially as well, so I think that's 

           23    what they -- people mean by that is that it's where the 

           24    cylinders are extended on the -- I think that was the 

           25    intent of the 2009 change.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  To allow for that jack-up position, which is 

            2    the same thing in -- for purposes of our testimony, 

            3    would you consider the jack-up position to be the same 

            4    thing as the mesh-change position?

            5         A.  I think that was the intent of the instruction.

            6         Q.  It is also the intent in how you use the words 

            7    throughout your report?

            8         A.  Yes, uh-huh.

            9         Q.  Okay.  

           10         A.  I tried to use the same as I thought the 

           11    instructions were saying.

           12         Q.  Got it, okay.  Now, why, if at all, if you 

           13    know, did TEREX, slash, or Powerscreen, why did they 

           14    make this revised version of the product to include the 

           15    jack-up or mesh-change position?

           16         A.  I think Mr. Donnelly tried to explain that in 

           17    his testimony.  

           18                   MR. FOTI:  I was going to object.  

           19              Are you asking this witness why your 

           20              company did something?  

           21                   MR. ROBINSON:  I'm asking what his 

           22              -- for purposes of his opinion, if he --

           23                   MR. FOTI:  If he knows.

           24    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           25         Q.  If you know, what is your understanding for 








                                                                          


            1    purposes of your opinions as to why the jack-up feature 

            2    was implemented?

            3         A.  I can only go based on what Mr. Donnelly's 

            4    testimony was.

            5         Q.  Okay.  And do you have any reason to dispute 

            6    what Mr. Donnelly said about that?

            7         A.  They were the ones that made the decision to do 

            8    that.  I don't have any dispute with what he said he was 

            9    -- the purpose was he was doing it.

           10         Q.  Okay.  So you accept his testimony on that 

           11    issue?

           12         A.  Well, I don't necessarily agree with him, but I 

           13    -- I accept his testimony on that.

           14         Q.  What -- what about his testimony about why they 

           15    did it do you disagree with?

           16         A.  I understand from Mr. Wylie's testimony that he 

           17    -- he didn't think that was a necessary move.  That's 

           18    the only reason why I -- I say -- I think there was 

           19    opin- -- different opinions about that.

           20         Q.  Mr. Wylie is a U.S. salesman working for 

           21    Powerscreen Connecticut, correct?  

           22         A.  Correct.  They made the decision to do that for 

           23    the reasons they did.  I don't know.  I don't have the 

           24    information that they used.

           25         Q.  From Mr. Donnelly's testimony, what is your 








                                                                          


            1    understanding as to why they implemented this change for 

            2    the jack-up or mesh-change position?

            3         A.  They -- what I understand is that it would 

            4    allow for more ease in removing and replacing the lower 

            5    screen.

            6         Q.  Right.  Okay.  

            7         A.  That's my understanding from his testimony.

            8         Q.  Okay.  And --

            9         A.  And --

           10         Q.  -- prior to that change -- 

           11         A.  -- there might be other reasons, too.  That's 

           12    the main one that I understand.

           13         Q.  All right.  Prior to that change, it's true 

           14    that the upper mesh screens and lower mesh screens had 

           15    to be -- those changes had to be made from the 

           16    non-jack-up or non-mesh-change position that you now 

           17    could accomplish with the new iteration, correct?

           18         A.  My understanding is you could do it either way.  

           19    Before or after, you could use the -- you could do the 

           20    change.

           21         Q.  Right.  You could do the change -- 

           22         A.  Uh-huh.

           23         Q.  -- but is it your understanding it was more 

           24    difficult to change the lower the mesh screens and 

           25    that's why they added the jack-up feature?  








                                                                          


            1         A.  That was Mr. Donnelly's statement but I don't 

            2    know that that's true.  I don't know --

            3         Q.  All right.  

            4         A.  -- one way or the other.

            5         Q.  Have you found any evidence from any source to 

            6    suggest there was any other reason they made that 

            7    change?

            8         A.  There was another one that was kind of floated, 

            9    and I don't recall exactly where it was, but the -- for 

           10    some reason, they can get inside -- into that area more 

           11    readily.  Someone could actually crawl into that space 

           12    and clean off I think it was something conveyers.  I 

           13    didn't spend a lot of time doing that.

           14         Q.  Okay.  But when you say someone could get 

           15    inside or crawl into that space you're talking about the 

           16    lower level below the platform when it is placed in the 

           17    jacked-up position, correct?

           18         A.  Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

           19         Q.  All right.  I only have -- this is part of your 

           20    file, but I only have one copy.  I'll show it to you.  

           21                   MR. ROBINSON:  Can you just mark 

           22              this as whatever we're up to?  

           23                   COURT REPORTER:  In the As?  

           24                   MR. ROBINSON:  Yeah, let's not go F.

           14         Q.  All right.  I'm going to hand you what's been 

           15    marked as Exhibit A-5, and I believe this appears in 

           16    your Materials Acquired section of your report which 

           17    appears at Pages 9 and 10.  So if you could, go to  

           18    Pages 9 and 10.  

           19         A.  Okay.

           20         Q.  All right.  If you could, go to Page 10, 

           21    there's a mention of market introduction of the screener 

           22    jack-up screenbox, correct?

           23         A.  I'm sorry.  What date it is?  

           24         Q.  Page 10, looks like January 24 of 2007.  

           25         A.  Yes.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  And it indicates market introduction of the 

            2    screener jack-up screenbox, right?

            3         A.  That's correct.

            4         Q.  All right.  Is that that document that we've 

            5    marked as Exhibit A-5?

            6         A.  It appears to be, yes.

           10         Q.  Okay.  So this is a document that was part of 

           11    the materials that you produced.  The title of the 

           12    document doesn't perfectly match up with anything in the 

           13    materials acquired, but it looks like what you're 

           14    referring to here is the market introduction of the 

           15    screener jack-up screenbox, correct?

           16         A.  Let me check my files, if you don't mind.

           17         Q.  Okay.  

           18         A.  Can we go off the record?  

           19         Q.  Sure.

            3    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            4         Q.  All right.  Just to follow up from the break, 

            5    is -- is this document that's been marked as Exhibit A-5 

            6    what is referenced on Page 10 of -- I'm sorry; I lost 

            7    the page.  Yeah, Page 10 of your report which indicates 

            8    the market introduction of the screener jack-up 

            9    screenbox?

           10         A.  It is, yes.

           11         Q.  All right.  And that's also dated January 24, 

           12    2007, correct?

           13         A.  Yes.

           14         Q.  All right.  And it's an eight-page document, 

           15    correct?

           16         A.  Yes.

           17         Q.  And is that a document that you went out and 

           18    independently located or obtained for purposes of your 

           19    review in this case?

           20         A.  Yes.

           21         Q.  Where did you find it?

           22         A.  I found it on the internet somewhere.

           23         Q.  Okay.  Can I have that back for one second?  

           24         A.  (Handing.)

           25         Q.  All right.  And as part of that marketing 








                                                                          


            1    material when this was -- when this was implemented, 

            2    under "Advantages," the final entry in that list states, 

            3    Screenbox lifts hydraulically for access to bottom deck 

            4    mesh and collection conveyer, correct?

            5         A.  Correct.

            6         Q.  All right.  So that's consistent with what we 

            7    were just talking about.  The purpose for implementing 

            8    this change in the design was so that the bottom deck 

            9    mesh and the conveyer that is -- that would be below the 

           10    platform could be accessed more easily, correct?

           11         A.  Are you asking me to say this statement is 

           12    correct?  I think it's asked and answered.  I think I 

           13    said yes.  This statement states that it's for the lower 

           14    screens.

           15         Q.  Okay.  And it doesn't say anything about using 

           16    the jack-up feature to change the upper screens, 

           17    correct?

           18         A.  Well, this is not a document that instructs 

           19    anybody.  This is just an announcement of a -- of a 

           20    change that they're making.

           21         Q.  That's right.  And so they had -- they had a 

           22    product --

           23         A.  Uh-huh.

           24         Q.  -- that already existed, correct?  Meaning the 

           25    Warrior 1800 without the jack-up feature, correct?








                                                                          


            1         A.  Correct.

            2         Q.  And you told me that the way it works in this 

            3    industry is you'll make a modification or a change but 

            4    it won't be a whole- -- wholesale new product.  You'll 

            5    be updating it and changing it as you go, correct?

            6         A.  And in- -- and also including the right 

            7    instructions in your -- in your manuals, too.  

            8         Q.  All right.  Okay.  But as they were 

            9    implementing this potential change, that's the document 

           10    that they put out which indicated that the advantage of 

           11    this change was so that you could change the lower 

           12    screens and access the conveyer on the lower level, 

           13    correct?

           14         A.  It's just an announcement of a future -- we do 

           15    that a lot in marketing.  It's not a -- it's not a 

           16    document that helps anybody do anything with it.  So it 

           17    just goes to marketing people for features that might be 

           18    new.  

           19         Q.  What -- what in- -- I just want to look at it 

           20    again.  I'm not quite done with it.  What information do 

           21    you have about the actual training that Powerscreen 

           22    provided to operators as it related to the use of this 

           23    jack-up feature?

           24         A.  I don't have any but I asked for it.

           25         Q.  So at this point, you have no knowledge about 








                                                                          


            1    what information they provided in their training of 

            2    individuals using the product after this change, 

            3    correct?

            4         A.  I asked for it but I did not receive.

            5         Q.  The answer to my question is at this point, you 

            6    have no information, correct?

            7         A.  I have no information right now, yes.

            8         Q.  Okay.  And have you seen anything in any of the 

            9    documentation that has indicated any other use of the 

           10    platform in the jacked-up position?

           11         A.  It's called the mesh-changing position and it's 

           12    left in that mesh-changing position for the upper 

           13    screens on the -- in the -- in the instructions how to 

           14    use it.

           15         Q.  That's your interpretation of the instructions?

           16         A.  No, it's not my interpretation.  It's in that  

           17    -- in the steps.  You can see the steps all say stop -- 

           18    stop the -- stop the engine, start the engine, raise and 

           19    lower the deck to do those things.  

           20             There's no -- no step in there that states to 

           21    put the -- put the -- the -- I'm going to say the 

           22    screenbox structure down into the lower position to work 

           23    on the -- on the nuts and bolts on the -- on the upper 

           24    level.  So the instruction says leave it up and change 

           25    the screens up there.  So that's clear.  That's clear in 








                                                                          


            1    the instructions.

            2         Q.  Okay.  Do you know what instructions -- what 

            3    the instructions looked like for purposes of screen mesh 

            4    changing prior to the implementation of the jack-up 

            5    screenbox?

            6         A.  It's immaterial because we have the 

            7    instructions that tell us what happens when you have 

            8    the --

            9         Q.  Sir, sir, we're going to get through this a lot 

           10    more quickly if you would just answer my question.  I 

           11    appreciate where you're going with your opinion, but I'm 

           12    asking you a very simple question.  

           13             Do you have any information about the 

           14    instructions at -- that -- that appeared in the manual 

           15    for the Warrior 1800 as it related to screen mesh 

           16    changing prior to the implementation of the jack-up 

           17    feature?

           18         A.  No.  I asked for that information; did not 

           19    receive it.

           20         Q.  All right.  Now, if people in the industry had 

           21    been familiar with the screen-mesh changing procedures 

           22    prior to the existence of the jack-up feature, and then 

           23    this change comes out which provides them with 

           24    instructions about how to raise and implement the 

           25    jack-up feature into its raised position, do you agree 








                                                                          


            1    with me that those people in the industry that had that 

            2    familiarity already knew how to change the screen?

            3                   MR. FOTI:  Objection as to form.

            4                   MR. ROBINSON:  Yeah, that was a 

            5              lousy question.  I'll ask another one.

            6    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            7         Q.  Mr. Wylie knew that the upper screen mesh would 

            8    normally be changed in the lowered position, correct?

            9         A.  I have no knowledge of that.

           10         Q.  You didn't see his testimony on that?

           11         A.  I don't recall.  If you have something, you can 

           12    show me.  

           13         Q.  For purposes of your opinions, do you agree 

           14    that there's no need for the jack-up feature to be in 

           15    the jacked-up position to change the upper screen mesh?

           16         A.  It can be done either way.

           17         Q.  Okay.  And you don't recall Graham Wylie 

           18    repeatedly testifying that you can change the upper 

           19    screen from the lowered position?

           20         A.  I don't recall, no.

           21         Q.  All right.  And do you recall that he testified 

           22    that he always changed the upper screen from the lowered 

           23    position prior to the date in question unless he had an 

           24    instance where he had a large crew and he wanted to be 

           25    able to do both screens at the same time because it 








                                                                          


            1    would take less time?

            2         A.  I think that's what he said, yes.

            3         Q.  All right.  So Mr. Wylie, on the date in 

            4    question, had historically changed the upper screen mesh 

            5    from the lowered position, correct?

            6         A.  I'm not sure what he had done.  You'd have to 

            7    ask him.  

            8         Q.  Do you recall what he testified about how many 

            9    times it had actually occurred where he had a large 

           10    enough crew to do both decks at the same time?

           11         A.  I don't recall those details.  

           12         Q.  Do you agree that Mr. Wylie had been on the 

           13    machine, not necessarily this particular machine but the 

           14    same machine, the Warrior 1800 with the jack-up feature 

           15    many times before his fall?

           16         A.  I don't know what "many" means.  I don't know 

           17    that I recall whether he used that word or not.  But, 

           18    yeah, I know he had been on the machine several times.

           19         Q.  He was the salesman for the product, correct?

           20         A.  Correct.

           21         Q.  He was intimately familiar with the product, 

           22    correct?

           23         A.  He should have been.

           24         Q.  And he was intimately familiar with the fact 

           25    that there was no gate at the end of the platform, 








                                                                          


            1    correct?

            2         A.  That's -- apparently on the day that he was 

            3    there, he didn't realize that there was no gate.  I 

            4    think it's obvious he would have enjoyed having one.  

            5         Q.  Okay.  So he knew it from all of his experience 

            6    with the machine, but he didn't know it that day?

            7         A.  That day he was probably looking at nuts.

            8         Q.  You indicated that Mr. Wylie was on the left 

            9    side of the machine when he fell, correct?

           10         A.  That's my understanding.

           11         Q.  If you look at Exhibit E --

           12         A.  Uh-huh.

           13         Q.  -- are we -- in the bottom picture, are we 

           14    looking at the left or the right side of the machine on 

           15    the first page?

           16         A.  That would be 1715180629002?  

           17         Q.  Yes.  

           18         A.  No, that's not the left side.

           19         Q.  So that's the right side of the machine?

           20         A.  No, sir.

           21         Q.  What is that?

           22         A.  That's the rear of the machine.

           23         Q.  I'm sorry.  Maybe we're talking about the wrong 

           24    one.  Is -- it shows the rear of the machine and one of 

           25    the sides of the machine.  








                                                                          


            1         A.  It's an ISO picture, yes.  It's an ISO and 

            2    we're seeing the rear and the left side.

            3         Q.  Okay.  So that is the left side that is 

            4    depicted as part of the photograph?

            5         A.  Okay.  I would agree to that --

            6         Q.  Okay.  All right.  

            7         A.  -- characterization.  

            8         Q.  All right.  Just making sure we're all talking 

            9    about the same side of the machine.  Was Mr. Wylie 

           10    right-handed or left-handed?

           11         A.  I didn't ask him.

           12         Q.  Do you know?

           13         A.  I don't know.

           14         Q.  Does it matter?

           15         A.  Doesn't matter.

           16         Q.  Okay.  Why do you -- throughout your report, 

           17    you men- -- you talk about scaffold.  Do you consider 

           18    this catwalk a scaffold?

           19         A.  I don't know what to consider it, frankly.

           20         Q.  Why do you say that?

           21         A.  Well, it looks like an aerial lift, but then it 

           22    doesn't have the controls for it.  It looks like -- I 

           23    mean, the whole problem is there -- I asked for the 

           24    standards by which it was constructed and there was none

            1             So I don't really know what the intent was of 

            2    the designer, but it appears that they were somehow 

            3    trying to figure out how to lift this thing, this item.  

            4    And -- and it's -- it's accessible by people, so it was 

            5    either a scaffold or it was an aerial lift or one of 

            6    those.

            7         Q.  Or something else?

            8         A.  Could have been.  Special lift.

            9         Q.  A moveable platform?

           10         A.  Could be.

           11         Q.  A platform you can simply move out of the way 

           12    with no intent to have human beings standing on it when 

           13    it's moved out of the way?

           14         A.  That's -- that is not -- does not prevent human 

           15    beings from climbing up and standing on it.  

           16         Q.  That's not my -- that's not my question. 

           17         A.  Well -- 

           18         Q.  Could the intent of it have been just to make 

           19    it a platform that you could move out of the way so that 

           20    you could access the lower screens and conveyers?

           21         A.  If that was the intent, there should have been 

           22    safety measures so that people could not get back on it, 

           23    or there should have been some way to make sure -- to 

           24    prevent people from being on it when it was in the upper 

           25    position.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Are there -- are there clear instructions on 

            2    the machine that state, Do not climb on the machine?

            3         A.  There is a -- there is a label that is very 

            4    confusing to read.

            5         Q.  We'll get there in a minute.  

            6         A.  Okay.  You asked the question.  I -- I gave my 

            7    answer.

            8         Q.  Okay.  So you're saying it's not a clear 

            9    instruction that it says do not climb?

           10         A.  The word "climb" -- do not climb has a -- has a 

           11    connotation that I think we need to explore because it 

           12    could mean a lot of things to different people.

           13         Q.  If -- if the platform is in the jacked-up 

           14    position and, therefore, the stairway doesn't have any 

           15    form of a natural progression to the platform, wouldn't 

           16    it be necessary to climb in some fashion to get up onto 

           17    the platform?

           18         A.  It would be necessary to climb up onto a step.  

           19    I think we say we climb onto a step.  So the very fact 

           20    that there's a step means that you have to climb.  

           21    That's a part of the process of moving our -- our center 

           22    of gravity up a particular item.  So the word "climb" 

           23    can mean as simple as don't put your foot on this piece 

           24    of metal if you -- if you understand what I mean.  So 

           25    the confusion is very, very difficult here.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Okay.  Going back to Page 3 of your report, 

            2    you -- you have a section at the bottom of Page 3 about 

            3    Mr. Wylie's hospital course.  Is there anything about 

            4    that that relates to your opinions in this case?

            5         A.  I always check to make sure that when somebody 

            6    tells me that there's something that goes wrong that I 

            7    can connect the injury with what is being claimed.  So 

            8    that's as far as I take it.  I don't worry about the 

            9    medical parts of it.  I just simply understand that if 

           10    he fell on his -- on -- on the step, he probably got 

           11    injured in this way, and that's where I stop.

           12         Q.  You're not attempting to make medical --

           13         A.  No.  No, I'm not.

           14         Q.  -- causation opinions, correct?

           15         A.  No. 

           16         Q.  Okay. 

           17         A.  I just need to make sure that the mechanical 

           18    elements agree with the statement.

           19         Q.  Okay.  There's a chart on Page 4 or Table 1?

           20         A.  Table 1, yes.

           21         Q.  Where did all that information come from?

           22         A.  It comes from what I can glean from the 

           23    information that I -- as I observe it or I'm told or 

           24    whatever.  I get that information relatively 

           25    artifactually of the equipment that I'm looking at.  It 








                                                                          


            1    comes from different places, but it summarizes it for me 

            2    so I know what's -- what's happened.

            3         Q.  All right.  So references to all of this 

            4    information appear somewhere within your file materials?

            5         A.  Correct.

            6         Q.  But you just don't have specifics at hand?

            7         A.  At the moment, I didn't reference any.  

            8         Q.  Okay.  Do you notice that there's no reference 

            9    to Powerscreen -- well, strike that.  Actually, it's not 

           10    important.  

           11             If we look at these various other manuals that 

           12    are referenced on Page 5 -- you said Manual 2, Manual 3, 

           13    Manual 4, Manual 5 -- what manuals are those?

           14         A.  It would be this manual right here.  

           15    (Indicating.)

           16         Q.  Well, I think you indicated that that was R003, 

           17    which is Manual 1 which is the operative manual for this 

           18    machine, correct?

           19         A.  It was too large to send in one file, I think, 

           20    so they divided it up so that this whole document came 

           21    in multiple sections.  

           22         Q.  Ah, so this is all just that -- that manual?

           23         A.  If you look at the files, you'll see that it 

           24    was just that manual.

           25         Q.  Okay.  All right.  








                                                                          


            1         A.  They kept -- came in separate electronic files.

            2         Q.  For purposes of your opinions and your 

            3    testimony, I just want to make sure I understand what 

            4    you consider yourself to be an expert in.  Are you an 

            5    expert in these types of Powerscreen machines?

            6         A.  I'm an expert in mechanical systems.  My whole 

            7    development, whole education was involved in mechanical 

            8    systems.  

            9             I do have some experience, of course, in 

           10    software.  I told you about that as well, testing 

           11    software.  So there is a -- there is -- there's a span 

           12    of things, but I've involved -- I've been involved in 

           13    metal formation.  I've been involved in all sorts of 

           14    different mechanical types of devices, and that's what I 

           15    spend my time doing is looking at mechanical systems.  

           16         Q.  So for purposes of this particular product, do 

           17    you consider yourself an expert in safety regulations 

           18    applicable at the time of manufacture and sale?

           19         A.  I consider myself an expert when it comes to 

           20    understanding how to read standards and how to apply 

           21    them in a proper manner, yes.

           22         Q.  All right.  The specific standards that are 

           23    cited throughout your report -- and there's a lot of 

           24    them, right? -- did you have personal prior experience 

           25    in assessing products and applying these particular 








                                                                          


            1    standards?

            2         A.  I think the answer would be yes.  You know, 

            3    having to apply steps and so forth to -- to the 

            4    equipment that I was involved in designing, yes.

            5         Q.  Okay.  OSHA and MSHA have conflicting -- or 

            6    maybe that's not the right word.  They have -- they each 

            7    have separate jurisdiction over certain circumstances, 

            8    correct?

            9         A.  That's correct, yes.

           10         Q.  Which apply here?

           11         A.  This particular machine applies to both -- both 

           12    of them apply because the machine is actually used for 

           13    wood products as we know it as well as stone and gravel.  

           14    So they would both have jurisdiction.

           15         Q.  Okay.  Now, you agree that both MSHA and OSHA 

           16    actually are regulatory schemes that apply to employers, 

           17    correct?

           18         A.  I understand that.

           19         Q.  They apply to employers and they apply to job 

           20    sites where employees are working, correct?

           21         A.  That's right.

           22         Q.  All right.  They're not actually manufacturing 

           23    regulations; is that fair to say?

           24         A.  I think if you're going to use a part- -- 

           25    particular piece of equipment by an employer that -- 








                                                                          


            1    that somehow the manufacturer has an obligation to read 

            2    those same -- those same standards and make it possible 

            3    for those employers to use that.  So indirectly they 

            4    are, yeah.  They're -- they're under the same 

            5    jurisdiction.

            6         Q.  Well, the regulatory scheme applies to 

            7    employers, correct?

            8         A.  Correct.

            9         Q.  And, in fact, OSHA can only implement any kind 

           10    of an action as it relates to an OSHA violation to an 

           11    actual employer, correct?

           12         A.  That's correct.  But if  the equipment is -- 

           13    that they're use- -- that they're implementing and 

           14    applying doesn't meet the standards, then, of course, 

           15    they're not going to be able to use that anymore, right?  

           16         Q.  And that would be the employer's decision to 

           17    use or not use that particular piece of equipment, 

           18    correct?

           19         A.  The employer makes the decision, yes.  That 

           20    doesn't -- but that does not preclude the employee 

           21    from -- from stating that the equipment that the 

           22    employer purchased was -- was -- was dangerous to him.

           23         Q.  All right.  And Mr. Wylie actually had a crew 

           24    of other mechanics or operators that worked with him on 

           25    these machines both before and after this incident, 








                                                                          


            1    correct?

            2         A.  I don't understand your question.

            3         Q.  Did you see from Mr. Wylie's testimony that he 

            4    was the salesman, but -- but the company that he worked 

            5    for also had other individuals, operators, that would 

            6    perform things like screen mesh changes and do different 

            7    types of activities on the machines?

            8         A.  No, I didn't see that.

            9         Q.  Okay.  All right.  

           10         A.  I don't think that was true.  That was -- 

           11    that's a mischaracterization of his statement.

           12         Q.  Was Mr. Wylie -- was Mr. Wylie a supervisor of 

           13    any other employees?

           14         A.  Not that I'm aware of.

           15         Q.  Okay.  And just if I wasn't clear, it's also 

           16    true -- I think we were talking about OSHA 

           17    predominantly, but the same is true for the Mine Safety 

           18    Health Administration and its regulations.  It implies 

           19    -- it applies to the employer, correct?

           20         A.  That's correct.

           21         Q.  All right.  

           22         A.  But the equipment, again, if it doesn't meet 

           23    the standards, the injured party can actually pursue 

           24    litigation against the -- the actual manufacturer.

           25         Q.  Well, that -- your expertise is as an engineer, 








                                                                          


            1    correct?

            2         A.  Right.

            3         Q.  All right.  You're not an expert in -- 

            4         A.  Not at all.

            5         Q.  -- who can pursue whom in litigation, correct?

            6         A.  No, sir.

            7         Q.  All right.  

            8         A.  You are that and I'll leave that to you.  

            9         Q.  Page 17 of your report, you indicate -- you 

           10    have a First Responders section?

           11         A.  Excuse me; 17?  

           12         Q.  Yes.  

           13         A.  I'm sorry.  Please hold on.  That I do, yes.

           14         Q.  And what is the importance of this section of 

           15    your report to your opinions?

           16         A.  I normally include it in my reports because it 

           17    helps me understand what -- what was going on at the 

           18    time of the injury.  Sometimes it's relevant.  Sometimes 

           19    it's not.  But at this point, I record it.

           20         Q.  Notwithstanding your prior testimony as it 

           21    related to the review of the various transcripts, have 

           22    you spoken or interviewed Mr. Witte or Mr. Richardson at 

           23    any point in time?

           24         A.  No, sir.

           25         Q.  Have you attempted to do that?








                                                                          


            1         A.  No, sir.

            2         Q.  We spoke a little bit earlier about your 

            3    inspection which took place on July 29, 2018, correct?

            4         A.  That's correct, yes.

            5         Q.  I want -- I want to follow-up on something we 

            6    talked about earlier.  You indicated that there are 

            7    problems with the machine regardless of whether the 

            8    platform is in the jack-up position or in the lowered, 

            9    working position, correct?

           10         A.  That's correct.

           11         Q.  And what you mean by that is, the machine is 

           12    what it is.  If I've identified these problems, it 

           13    doesn't mean that if you lower it, these problems don't 

           14    still exist because the machine still has the capacity 

           15    to be raised, correct?

           16         A.  It has nothing necessarily to do with lowering 

           17    and raising.

           18         Q.  All right.  Well, is -- is a gate required -- 

           19    if -- if this platform was -- was secured and could not 

           20    be raised to the jack-up position at the 55-inch height, 

           21    would a gate be required?

           22         A.  At that point, it becomes questionable whether 

           23    or not it's an aerial lift.  As soon as you start 

           24    jacking it up, it becomes an aerial lift.   At that 

           25    point, it is required that there be a gate on it.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  So -- but -- so let's back up.  If it's -- if 

            2    it's not -- if it doesn't have the ability to be jacked 

            3    up, right --

            4         A.  Correct.

            5         Q.  -- and it's -- it's secured, it's stable in 

            6    that position where the stairs meet it at the 55 inches 

            7    and you can walk onto the platform -- 

            8         A.  It's on the -- it's on the pin that -- that 

            9    pivots; is -- 

           10         Q.  Right.  

           11         A.  -- that what you're talking about?  

           12         Q.  Does it require -- does it require a gate?

           13         A.  I think the issue is not so much whether or not 

           14    it requires a gate.  It's whether or not the work area 

           15    is secure.

           16         Q.  Well, pursuant to your analysis of the case, 

           17    would it require a gate if it was never going to be 

           18    raised and it was secured there?

           19         A.  Again, it's -- it's where the work needs to be 

           20    performed that's -- that determines whether or not there 

           21    needs to be a gate or not.  So, yes, it would have to 

           22    have a gate.

           23         Q.  What regulation would you rely on to state that 

           24    in the 55-inch height, a gate would be required?

           25         A.  Okay.  There needs to be some kind of way to 








                                                                          


            1    protect the operator while he's in -- working on this -- 

            2    in this particular mode.  It -- it appears to me that 

            3    Powerscreen, their opinion was that as long as he could 

            4    hang on -- hang out over the work area and reach these 

            5    three bolts that extended past the platform, it was none 

            6    of their concern.

            7         Q.  What's the basis of your testimony that that's 

            8    what Powerscreen thinks?

            9         A.  I know it's very difficult, but at some point 

           10    you have to assess where we are here.  There is no 

           11    work -- the work platform does not extend the length of 

           12    the task.  I think that's clear here.

           13         Q.  Did you read the testimony of Mr. Witte and 

           14    Mr. Donnelly?  Yes?  

           15         A.  Mr. Donnelly -- yes, I did.

           16         Q.  All right.  And they testified about how you 

           17    could change those three bolts that extend off the 

           18    platform simply by standing on the first step of the 

           19    stairs, correct?

           20         A.  You've got another standard though that you 

           21    have to meet.  That is, you have to have a three-point 

           22    -- if you're standing on the stairs, you have to have a 

           23    three-point connection.  So either both feet have to be 

           24    on the stairs and one hand attached or one -- one -- two 

           25    hands have to be attached and one foot on the stairs.  








                                                                          


            1             So there's a -- there's a problem by doing 

            2    that.  By saying that you can do that, that's against 

            3    the standards.  You can't do that with the standards.  

            4    So you're required to have a three-point connection to 

            5    the -- to the vehicle.  So how can you reach the bolt 

            6    and tighten it if that's the case?  

            7         Q.  Where in -- where in your report do you talk 

            8    about this three-point -- 

            9         A.  No, I -- I -- I cited the standards that 

           10    require that.

           11         Q.  The three-point attachment?

           12         A.  Let me -- let me think if I -- the exact point 

           13    that is, but that -- that is a requirement.

           14         Q.  All right.  Show me where in your report you 

           15    talk about a three-point attachment.  

           16         A.  It will take me a while because I have to --

           17         Q.  Which regulatory scheme are we talking about?

           18         A.  I think it was an OSHA for sure and that -- if 

           19    that's -- I mean, I -- we've established that it doesn't 

           20    matter whether it's one or the other, MS- -- MSHA or 

           21    whether it's OSHA, right?  

           22         Q.  Okay.  So I don't recall reading anything in 

           23    your report about any violation of a three-point 

           24    attachment, but I might have missed it.  It's a long 

           25    report. 








                                                                          


            1         A.  It is, yeah.

            2         Q.  So if it's in there, show me.  

            3         A.  Well, I think it'll take me a while --

            4         Q.  Okay.  

            5         A.  -- because I have to read the whole thing.

            6         Q.  Okay.  

            7                   MR. FOTI:  Let's go off the record.

            9              2:44.  

           10                   (Off record, 2:44 p.m.)

           11                   (On record, 2:54 p.m.)

           12                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  On the record at 

           13              2:54.  

           14                   MR. ROBINSON:  Okay.  Just reading 

           15              back the question.  

           16                        (Whereupon, the record was read back 

           17                         by the Court Reporter.)

           18         A.  Okay.  It's on Page 64.  

           19    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           20         Q.  Okay.  

           21         A.  My first point says, Due to the serious nature 

           22    of the defect and noncompliance to federal code, the 

           23    Powerscreen Warrior 1800 on track should not be sold to 

           24    any U.S. customers without modifications to comply with 

           25    all the applicable OSHA and MSHA regulations.  








                                                                          


            1             And so then I turn to page -- Page 9, and   

            2    Page 9, the item No. A180209-001 is SAE J185.  And that 

            3    particular document on Paragraph 3.20 it says, The 

            4    three-point support feature -- features of -- of an 

            5    access system which permit a person to use 

            6    simultaneously two hands and one foot or two feet and 

            7    one hand while ascending and descending or moving about 

            8    on the machine.  So it's based on those.  

            9         Q.  Which section was that again, 3.-what?

           10         A.  3.20, 3.20.

           11                   MR. FOTI:  Is that OSHA?  

           12                   THE WITNESS:  No.  OSHA has adopted 

           13              it if you look at the front page.  

           14                   MR. FOTI:  What was it you were 

           15              citing from though?  

           16                   THE WITNESS:  I'm citing from the 

           17              SAE J185, which they state was the basis 

           18              for their design.  

           19                   COURT REPORTER:  "Was the basis 

           20              for"? 

           21                   THE WITNESS:  "Their design," of the 

           22              subject machine.  

           23    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           24         Q.  All right.  Well, first let's talk about this.  

           25    There's actually a handle right on that stairway just 








                                                                          


            1    above Stair No. 2, correct?

            2         A.  I wouldn't call it a handle.  I'm sorry.

            3         Q.  What is it?

            4         A.  I wouldn't characterize it that way.

            5         Q.  What is it?

            6         A.  It's a piece of metal that has a C shape, and 

            7    it's welded to the -- to the machine.

            8         Q.  And that's not a handle?

            9         A.  No, sir.  A handle would be either vertical or 

           10    horizontal.  That's based on the standard as well, the 

           11    same one.

           12         Q.  Okay.  But there --

           13         A.  So there's a -- there is a contraption that one 

           14    could say is something that you're supposed to hang on 

           15    to.  But it's not above person and it's not a real -- it 

           16    doesn't comply with the standards.

           17         Q.  Okay.  And both feet can be placed on the 

           18    stair, correct?

           19         A.  There's room for two feet, but the problem is 

           20    that little archer thing, that round or C-shaped thing 

           21    that they welded takes up most of the second step.  So 

           22    essentially you only have room for one -- one foot on 

           23    that.  I just bring that to your attention.

           24         Q.  All right.  Well, so -- just so we're clear, if 

           25    you're standing on the first stair because of the 








                                                                          


            1    C-shaped rod that you can grab on to with your hand, 

            2    correct -- 

            3         A.  That's not a handle as described in the 

            4    standard.

            5         Q.  That's not the question I asked you.  

            6         A.  I'm sorry.  It's -- it doesn't comply --

            7         Q.  You said there's a C-shaped rod above the 

            8    second step, correct?  

            9         A.  That gets in the way of you getting up the -- 

           10         Q.  All right.  And you can -- you can hang on to 

           11    that with your hand; is that correct?

           12         A.  I -- I would presume you could, yes.

           13         Q.  All right.  And you're saying that that 

           14    C-shaped rod would prevent you from standing with both 

           15    feet on the first stair?

           16         A.  No.  I'm saying at the second one.

           17         Q.  All right.  You can't stand with both feet on 

           18    the second stair?

           19         A.  Your ankles would -- I mean, I wouldn't want to 

           20    balance on that.

           21         Q.  All right.  Then you saw Mr. Wylie's testimony 

           22    about how they were handling the issue of loosening the 

           23    bolts, correct?

           24         A.  You'll have to be more specific.  What -- what 

           25    are you -- what is it that you -- 








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Did you read Mr. Wylie's testimony about what 

            2    he was doing that day before he fell?

            3         A.  As I understood it, he was -- let me see if I 

            4    can characterize it, and maybe you'll agree or whatever.  

            5    But, anyway, he was standing on the platform with his 

            6    back towards the entrance, and he had his hands on a 

            7    spanner, which I believe is a wrench.  We call it a 

            8    wrench.  And he was holding the wrench for Dan Witte who 

            9    was in the screener above on the screens using an air 

           10    gun on the bolt heads to tighten them.

           11         Q.  Right.  And so that second individual was 

           12    inside on the inside of the -- the screener while 

           13    Mr. Wylie was on the platform, correct?

           14         A.  That's what I understood from it.

           15         Q.  All right.  Do you agree that the provision 

           16    that you just cited, 3.20, applies to ladders?

           17         A.  It's in the ladder section.

           18         Q.  It's in the ladder section; isn't it?

           19         A.  Yes, sir.

           20         Q.  It's not in a stairway section; is it?

           21         A.  No.  But what is -- what is -- is this a 

           22    stairway or is it steps?  You know, that's the whole 

           23    problem here.  They don't -- the whole thing is so 

           24    convoluted the way it's designed. 

           25         Q.  Well -- well, I'm asking you -- 








                                                                          


            1         A.  I'm sorry.  It's -- it's -- it's just 

            2    unfortunate that they kind of mismatched and nothing -- 

            3    nothing's standard to the case.

            4         Q.  Okay.  I'm going to -- I'm going to -- you're 

            5    the expert here rendering your expert opinion?

            6         A.  That's correct.

            7         Q.  That's a ladder provision that you just cited 

            8    for the three-point connection, correct?

            9         A.  That is in the ladder section, yes.

           10         Q.  This is not a ladder; is it?

           11         A.  I didn't say that.  I didn't say one way or 

           12    another what it was --

           13         Q.  Okay.  

           14         A.  -- in my report.

           15         Q.  Let's back up a second.  Now, I've tried to 

           16    review your whole report because it's long, and I want 

           17    to try and see if I can capture the issues that you've 

           18    laid out in one -- you know, in sort of a clean list, 

           19    okay?  

           20             You -- you have opinions as it relates to the 

           21    lack of a gate, correct?

           22         A.  Yes.

           23         Q.  All right.  You have opinions as it relates to 

           24    the lack of an attachment point for a restraint system, 

           25    correct?








                                                                          


            1         A.  An anchor point, yes.

            2         Q.  An anchor point, okay.  You have opinions about 

            3    a pinch point, correct?

            4         A.  I do, yes.

            5         Q.  You agree the pinch point has nothing to do 

            6    with this case and what happened to Mr. Wylie?

            7         A.  In this case and what happened to Mr. Wylie, 

            8    no.  But it is a safety issue on the machine.

            9         Q.  Different question.  I understand you've got 

           10    your list of all the problems that you believe you've 

           11    determined to exist on this machine based on your review 

           12    of these various regulations, correct?  That's true?

           13         A.  I would not characterize it exactly that way.  

           14    I think there are a lot more, but I just felt like I 

           15    just needed to stop at some point.

           16         Q.  Okay.  So here you have an expert report and an 

           17    expert disclosure in this case, correct?

           18         A.  Correct, I do.

           19         Q.  And you put in this report what you found to be 

           20    the violations that you located, correct?

           21         A.  Yes, at the time.  At the time.

           22         Q.  And you testified earlier today that when you 

           23    take on an assignment, regardless of what its scope is, 

           24    as a responsible engineer, for purposes of the public, 

           25    you're going to identify all the issues that -- that you 








                                                                          


            1    think exist with respect to a particular piece of 

            2    equipment, correct?

            3         A.  No, sir.

            4         Q.  You didn't say that earlier today?

            5         A.  No.  I say if I observe one, I will make note 

            6    of it and I will actually try to make sure that it's 

            7    mitigated.

            8         Q.  Well, you just told me a moment ago there's 

            9    definitely more but you decided to stop for purposes of 

           10    your report?

           11         A.  Right.  It was -- it was in June -- in July.  

           12    And as I looked at it further, I have -- I have, you 

           13    know, further opinions so . . .  

           14         Q.  Okay.  Anyway, the pinch point has nothing to 

           15    do with what happened to Mr. Wylie, correct?

           16         A.  Only that it's in the -- it -- it's an 

           17    indicator of the standard of care that was applied to 

           18    the design of the step area.

           19         Q.  He didn't get pinched; did he?

           20         A.  No, sir.

           21         Q.  Okay.  And there's no evidence that he used the 

           22    pinch point as a step to get up onto the platform 

           23    either; is there?

           24         A.  That's not in the record, but it certainly 

           25    presents itself a very good opportunity for him to use 








                                                                          


            1    that.  

            2         Q.  In which case he'd be climbing on the unit; 

            3    wouldn't he?

            4         A.  No, sir.  He'd be using a step.  

            5         Q.  That's not a step; is it?

            6         A.  It could be use -- it can be used as a step.  

            7    Of course.

            8         Q.  So your -- the point that you identified as a 

            9    pinch point is -- is a step on that --

           10         A.  It's not -- 

           11         Q.  -- on that machine?  

           12         A.  Sorry.  It is a colloquial step, if you will.  

           13    It would be one that somebody could use as a -- as an 

           14    invitation to put their foot up there so that they could 

           15    reach the -- the platform, yes.  

           16         Q.  If there's a bolt sticking off the side of the 

           17    machine, someone could kind of Jerry rig their foot onto 

           18    the bold to use it as a step; couldn't they?

           19         A.  They could -- 

           20                   MR. FOTI:  Object to the form.

           21         A.  -- yes.

           22    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           23         Q.  That's not a step; is it?

           24         A.  If it's used to -- to move your body upward, I 

           25    would classify it as a step.  Whether or not it's a -- 








                                                                          


            1    it's got that title or part number or not.

            2         Q.  Sure.  If there's -- let's say there's bolts, 

            3    multiple of them, up the side of a machine up to like  

            4    20 feet and somebody uses those bolts and has strong 

            5    hands and kind of cli- -- works their way up the 

            6    machine.  Are they -- are they using steps when they do 

            7    that?

            8         A.  They do that on -- on radio towers.  It's the 

            9    same thing.

           10         Q.  Are they using steps?

           11         A.  Yes, of course.

           12         Q.  Okay.  Are -- are those bolts steps, sir?

           13         A.  Yes, sir, they are.

           14         Q.  Are they climbing the machine?

           15         A.  That's the intent.  They're climbing -- 

           16    while you're -- as we've stated before, the word 

           17    "climbing" is -- is -- you're trying to make it a legal 

           18    term, and it's a -- it's one where you put your foot up 

           19    on the step.  You're climbing the stairs.  We use that 

           20    term all the time in a colloquial sense.

           21         Q.  You also have opinions with respect to the lack 

           22    of a railing on the open end of the stairway, correct?

           23         A.  That's correct.

           24         Q.  How many stairs are there?

           25         A.  Physically you have to climb four of them, the 








                                                                          


            1    ground being one of them that holds you up.

            2         Q.  You start on the ground?

            3         A.  Uh-huh.

            4         Q.  You go to the first level.  That's the first 

            5    stair, correct?

            6         A.  Uh-huh.  Correct.

            7         Q.  You go to the second level.  That's the second 

            8    stair, correct?

            9         A.  Correct.

           10         Q.  And then in -- on this machine, the third step 

           11    is onto the platform, correct?

           12         A.  Correct.  But we -- we sometimes count from 0, 

           13    1, 2, 3, and we get four that way.

           14         Q.  Ah, so -- so the first stair is the ground --

           15         A.  Could be --

           16         Q.  -- the earth?

           17         A.  -- yes.  

           18         Q.  And these railing requirements that you've 

           19    cited are four-stair stairway requirements, correct?

           20         A.  Well, it's -- like I said, it's potatoes, 

           21    potadoes.  We don't know whether it's a stair, a ladder.  

           22    Those -- that information is not clear to us because I 

           23    don't have what the design standards were that they used 

           24    to design this product.  

           25             So if there's no -- if, for example, I take, 








                                                                          


            1    for example, this aerial lift that we have, I don't see 

            2    any controls.  But, in essence, if it was a real aerial 

            3    lift, there would be controls that the operator could do 

            4    and you wouldn't have to worry about communicating to 

            5    somebody a long ways away for operating the machine.  

            6             So, like I said, this -- without the design 

            7    intent and without knowing what standards were being 

            8    applied, at this point, it's my -- my estimate that it 

            9    could be either or all of the above so . . .

           10         Q.  As an expert, for purposes of trying to define 

           11    what this platform was, isn't the lack of controls on 

           12    the upper platform an indicator to you that it's not an 

           13    aerial lift?

           14         A.  Well, isn't there a sign that says do not get 

           15    on this thing while you're doing certain -- no, there's 

           16    no -- there's no signs.  There's nothing that -- that 

           17    tells me -- anybody on the machine to stay off that 

           18    lift.  So it would be an aerial lift because it moves 

           19    the person above.

           20         Q.  So back to my question, for purposes of the 

           21    definition of an aerial lift, does the lack of -- of a 

           22    control on that upper level indicate to you that it is 

           23    not an aerial lift?

           24         A.  I don't know what the intent of the designer 

           25    was.  But if it goes up, it certainly has to have 








                                                                          


            1    controls.  

            2             But back to the -- I want to finish up.  I was 

            3    going to continue that four-step issue.  There's -- 

            4    there's a -- actually, the standard requires two things.  

            5    One is whether or not it has four steps or whether or 

            6    not the platform is 30 mill -- 30 inches from the 

            7    ground.  So, in that case, it violated as well.      

            8    So . . .  

            9         Q.  Which -- which regulation are you referring to 

           10    now?

           11         A.  It's the regulation in the -- in the 29 CFRs.

           12         Q.  Which one?

           13         A.  You want me to look that up now?  

           14         Q.  We'll come -- we'll probably come back to it.  

           15             Notwithstanding your opinions as it relates to 

           16    whether there should have been a railing on this 

           17    stairway, you agree that the lack of a railing on this 

           18    stairway had nothing to do with Mr. Wylie's fall, 

           19    correct?

           20         A.  I'm not clear on what your question is.  

           21         Q.  For purposes of your opinion, you assume that 

           22    the platform was in the jacked-up position based on the 

           23    testimony you looked at earlier today, correct?

           24         A.  Correct.

           25         Q.  And, therefore, the platform was elevated above 








                                                                          


            1    the stairway and the stairway was down below off of the 

            2    unit, correct?

            3         A.  The stairway was down below off the unit?  The 

            4    stairway is affixed to the chassis.

            5         Q.  Right.  And so when the platform raises, the 

            6    stairway does not raise, correct?

            7         A.  The last step does.  Step No. 3 does.

            8         Q.  Okay.  

            9         A.  Zero, one -- three does.

           10         Q.  All right.  So it -- when Mr. Wylie backed off 

           11    the unit, when he backed off the unit, the lack of a 

           12    railing on the stairway had nothing to do with this 

           13    fall, correct?

           14         A.  I don't see it that way.  I think you're 

           15    mischaracterizing my -- I would say ultimately that the 

           16    availability of a handrail is there so you can catch 

           17    yourself as well.  So if -- it not being there, of 

           18    course he had nothing to hang on to, right?  So as you 

           19    move -- as you're falling, you can grasp at things that 

           20    are still in your -- in your purview and reach, so I 

           21    can't characterize it that way.  Your statement is -- 

           22    is -- 

           23         Q.  Okay.  So what you're saying is, as he fell off 

           24    the platform --

           25         A.  Right.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  -- and he was on his way down --

            2         A.  Moments, seconds before.

            3         Q.  Well, wait a minute.  Let's talk about this.  

            4    You've got the platform and it's got a guardrail around 

            5    the platform, but it just doesn't have a gate at the end 

            6    of the platform, correct?

            7         A.  It doesn't have a gate, no.

            8         Q.  Right.  And if you fall backwards through that 

            9    open area where there's no gate, the -- the -- the stair 

           10    railing that you're talking about would be attached down 

           11    below --

           12         A.  No, sir.

           13         Q.  -- on -- on the stairs that are affixed to the 

           14    chassis?

           15         A.  I'm sorry I interrupted you.  No, sir.  The -- 

           16    the handrail would be attached directly to the platform.  

           17    That would go with the platform.  It has to go to the 

           18    four -- Step No. 3 would have the beginning of the plat- 

           19    -- of the handrail.  The handrail has to be on the open 

           20    side based on the standard, and it has to have -- and 

           21    you have to be able to grasp it, and that would have 

           22    been a last chance had he been able.  So I don't agree 

           23    with your characterization.

           24         Q.  Okay.  You have opinions about the width of the 

           25    walkway and the fact that two people cannot move around 








                                                                          


            1    on the platform, correct?

            2         A.  The answer is correct.

            3         Q.  All right.  And -- but on the date in question, 

            4    the only person on the walkway was Mr. Wylie, correct?  

            5    On the platform.  

            6         A.  The -- the width question is two parts, so I 

            7    don't know how to answer that question.

            8         Q.  What do you mean by the width question is two 

            9    parts?

           10         A.  There's -- there's a width requirement if 

           11    there's a single person on it, and there's a width 

           12    requirement if there are two on it.  According to 

           13    Mr. Donnelly, he felt that -- that somebody shouldn't be 

           14    climbing on the screens, and I agree with him.  And I 

           15    think I said that in my report.  So the platform should 

           16    have been designed for two people; that's one question.  

           17             The other -- the fact that Mr. Wylie was on the 

           18    platform by himself, there is a -- they have a cover 

           19    over this flywheel, and it restricts it to less than 

           20    what the requirement is and the standard.  So there are 

           21    two problems there.

           22         Q.  Cover over the flywheel?

           23         A.  Yes.

           24         Q.  Where are you talking about?

           25         A.  Maybe we can see a picture.  Would that be 








                                                                          


            1    helpful?  

            2         Q.  Yeah.  Show me where we should look.  

            3         A.  Okay.  Let me see what I can see.  Go to    

            4    Page 91 of 159 in my photographs.

            5         Q.  Yes.  Give me one second.  

            6                   MR. FOTI:  Where are we?  

            7                   THE WITNESS:  Page 91 of 159.

            8    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            9         Q.  Okay.  

           10         A.  So as you look at the -- you can see that the 

           11    width is 14 and a half inches until it gets to that 

           12    point.  Then it's 9 and a half, and that's just too 

           13    narrow for a person.

           14         Q.  All right.  When you say, When you get to that 

           15    point, you're talking about how there's a blue box  --

           16         A.  There's a blue box sitting on the left-hand 

           17    side of the -- of the walkway.  As you can see, you 

           18    see -- you're looking at the slipping surface.  You're 

           19    looking at the -- 

           20         Q.  All right.  So we're talking about Photo 182?

           21         A.  I think they're showing the same in -- 182 and 

           22    181 are the same.

           23         Q.  Yeah, all right.  

           24         A.  Looks like the same -- little bit different 

           25    angle.  You can see the trip hazard better.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  All right.  So which end of the platform goes 

            2    down to the 9 and a half inches?

            3         A.  It's in the middle.

            4         Q.  All right.  The area that Mr. Wylie fell off of 

            5    is -- is at the end, correct?

            6         A.  That's correct.

            7         Q.  All right.  And so he's not in the area where 

            8    it's 9 and a half inches when it happens, correct?  He 

            9    doesn't fall from the area where it's 9 and a half 

           10    inches, correct?

           11         A.  No, sir, he doesn't.

           12         Q.  And he also is the only person on the walkway 

           13    when he falls off, correct?

           14         A.  That's correct.

           15         Q.  All right.  And the other person is on the 

           16    inside of the screenbox, correct?

           17         A.  In our situation, yes.

           18         Q.  Okay.  

           19         A.  I might note that the 14 and a half inches is 

           20    out of -- out of standard as well.  It should be 20 

           21    inches on an opening.

           22         Q.  But because he fell off backwards off the end, 

           23    the width of the -- the width of the walkway has nothing 

           24    to do with his fall; does it?

           25         A.  I wouldn't characterize it that way.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  How is it related?

            2         A.  Well, it -- it -- it determines how close in or 

            3    how far out a -- a handrail would be.  So it's very 

            4    important that you have -- maintain that width so that 

            5    you can -- you can grab those things as you're -- as 

            6    you're falling down a set of stairs.

            7         Q.  Well, wait a minute.  If it's more narrow, 

            8    aren't the handrails closer to you than if it's wider?

            9         A.  If I can get -- I don't know if you've ever 

           10    wrestled.  Have you ever wrestled, John?

           11         Q.  I can't answer questions.  

           12         A.  I'm so sorry.  If you're wrestling, you -- you 

           13    -- what happens is you have to learn how to use your 

           14    leverage.  And most of the time, what would be useful is 

           15    to have your hands a little further out.  Because when 

           16    you start to fall, you tend to push outward with it.  So 

           17    you'd be looking for the rail much further out than -- 

           18    than that 14 and a half inches. 

           19         Q.  Are you an expert on the dynamics of how bodies 

           20    react when they fall?

           21         A.  I understand the mechanics of those, yes, 

           22    because bones and muscles are much the same as 

           23    mechanical linkages.

           24         Q.  Are you a biomechanics expert?

           25         A.  I have testified in cases in biomechanics, yes.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  What case did you testify in where you were a 

            2    bi- -- where you were qualified as a biomechanics 

            3    expert?

            4         A.  Well, I had to deal with biomechanics a lot 

            5    when I was working on cabs, and I learned a lot about 

            6    biomechanics through my experience.  I worked with a 

            7    company called Henry Dreyfuss & Associates.  I don't 

            8    know if you ever heard of them or not.  They were 

            9    heavily involved with AT&T and others when they -- and 

           10    we had to deal with a lot of those mechanical things 

           11    that we do with our hands and our arms, especially when 

           12    you're in the middle of operating levers on a machine.  

           13    Those are all very critical in knowing exactly how and 

           14    where to position them.  So I've had to deal with that 

           15    in my career experience, yes.

           16         Q.  What education have you had in biomechanics?

           17         A.  I've had -- I had the courses, in-house 

           18    courses, that I could get from John Deere.

           19         Q.  What are the names of courses?

           20         A.  I can't recite them at this point, but you can 

           21    check my John Deere records.

           22         Q.  Do you have an undergraduate degree that 

           23    provided you with any formal education in biomechanics?

           24         A.  I have the experience of working with 

           25    biomechanics and that's -- that's where I --








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Do you have an undergraduate degree -- 

            2         A.  I have --

            3         Q.  -- that provided you with any experience in 

            4    biomechanics?

            5         A.  We talked about mechanical, mechanical systems 

            6    that we use, yes, in our bodies, but I don't say --

            7         Q.  In what course?

            8         A.  In what course?  

            9         Q.  In what course in undergraduate school?

           10         A.  Mechanical design.

           11         Q.  Okay.  And -- all right.  So what was there, a 

           12    chapter on biomechanics in mechanical design?

           13         A.  Just like there was on springs and bolts and 

           14    other things, yes.

           15         Q.  Okay.  What part -- was any aspect of your MBA 

           16    study related to biomechanics?

           17         A.  No, sir.

           18         Q.  All right.  And what courses, if any, did you 

           19    take as far as continuing education that related to 

           20    biomechanics?

           21         A.  You know, I don't have a recollection of all of 

           22    the things that I've taken.  I've had a long career, a 

           23    lot of courses.  So I probably should sometime compile 

           24    all that when I have time.

           25         Q.  But you can't give me an answer now?








                                                                          


            1         A.  Not -- no, I can't.

            2         Q.  In this instance, you also have opinions about 

            3    the lack of a control system or a -- being present up on 

            4    the platform, correct?  You rendered opinions with 

            5    respect to lacking them, correct?  

            6         A.  I may have stated it.  I don't think it was in 

            7    my formal conclusions though.  

            8         Q.  I'm sorry?

            9         A.  I may have stated it somewhere in this.  I 

           10    don't know where.  If it's in my report, I may have 

           11    given an opinion.  

           12         Q.  Okay.  But there's no -- there's no 

           13    relationship or relevance to Mr. Wylie's fall because 

           14    there didn't happen to be controls up on the upper 

           15    platform, correct?

           16         A.  I don't believe the platform was in motion at 

           17    the time.

           18         Q.  So you agree with me?

           19         A.  I would agree with you.

           20         Q.  Okay.  I just want to -- I want to do this 

           21    quickly to make sure that I know every regulation you're 

           22    relying on for each of your opinions, okay?  And I 

           23    created my own chart, but I believe that you cite to   

           24    30 CFR 56/57 of the MSHA.  Let me back up.  

           25             The regulations that you appear to rely on as 








                                                                          


            1    it relates to your opinion for a lack of a gate are as 

            2    follows:  30 CFR 56 and 57 of the MSHA?  

            3         A.  I think there's actually, yeah, some paragraphs 

            4    in there.

            5         Q.  Okay.  Then ANSI Z10?

            6         A.  ANSI Z10 is a way to eliminate risks and how to 

            7    avoid risks.

            8         Q.  All right.  So does that not relate directly to 

            9    the gate issue?

           10         A.  Oh, of course it does.  

           11         Q.  Okay.  

           12         A.  If, in fact, they're aware that -- that this is 

           13    being used as a -- as a lift, then they should 

           14    definitely figure out how to avoid that or eliminate it 

           15    or whatever they needed to do.  So it's the process of 

           16    making sure that this is addressed and how -- how it 

           17    gets done.

           18         Q.  Okay.  Are there any other regulations you rely 

           19    on with respect to the formulation of your opinion as it 

           20    relates to the lack of a gate on the platform?

           21         A.  It's the area platform.  I think there's an 

           22    ANSI standard, ANSI 8092.2 (sic).

            6    BY MR. ROBINSON:

            7         Q.  A92.2.  All right.  Anything else?

            8         A.  Well, there are -- there are cases where A -- 

            9    ANSI A92.6 self-propelled, elevating work platform has 

           10    gates.  

           11         Q.  Anything else?

           12         A.  I think -- I think those are all of them.

           13         Q.  Okay.  The regulations that I believe you rely 

           14    on for your opinions with respect to the lack of a 

           15    handrail or a stair rail are as follows:  29 CFR 

           16    1910.23(d)(1)(ii)?

           17                   MR. FOTI:  Could you repeat that one 

           18              more time, please.

           19                   MR. ROBINSON:  29 CFR 

           20              1910.23(d)(1)(ii).  

           21    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           22         Q.  Is that one of them that you rely on?

           23         A.  I'm sorry; I didn't capture -- can you -- 29?  

           24         Q.  CFR 1910.23(d)(1)(ii).

           25         A.  I think it's 23, 1910.23(d)(1).








                                                                          


            1         Q.  That's the one I had listed.  

            2         A.  Okay.  Then we agree.

            3         Q.  You rely on that one.  Do you rely on any other 

            4    particular regulations for your opinion as it relates to 

            5    the lack of a stairwell -- stair railing?

            6         A.  I think ISO and others have the same kinds of 

            7    requirements.  The ISO 2687 and the -- I think 

            8    I'm quoting it correctly.  Just let me look at 

            9    my conclusions for sure.  I'm looking.  

           10                   MR. FOTI:  The only problem, when 

           11              you -- just make sure you keep it up 

           12              because you are speaking so she's trying 

           13              hard to -- 

           14                   THE WITNESS:  I know.  

           15                   MR. FOTI:  -- catch you.  

           16         A.  It's ISO 2687, ASAE J185.

           17    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           18         Q.  SAE J185?

           19         A.  Uh-huh.  Yes, I'm sorry.

           20         Q.  Okay.  All right.  Anything else?

           21         A.  I believe that's it.

           22         Q.  With respect to your opinion that the platform 

           23    is not wide enough for two people, do you rely on SAE 

           24    J185 for that?

           25         A.  As well as the ISO standard, ISO 2687.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  ISO 2687.  Do you rely on anything else besides 

            2    that?

            3         A.  I thought there was another one.  There's a -- 

            4    29 CFR requirement for runways that have to be at least 

            5    18 inches wide, 1928(b)(5)(ii)(a). 

            6         Q.  Okay.  With respect to SAE J185, doesn't that 

            7    apply to machines where the operator or any other 

            8    employee must climb onto the machine to enter the cab?

            9         A.  No, sir.

           10         Q.  No?  

           11         A.  No, just -- work platforms as well.  It does 

           12    include a cab portion.

           13         Q.  Okay.  You've already indicated that you don't 

           14    believe lack of controls on the platform had anything to 

           15    do with this incident, correct?

           16         A.  It's just another difficult thing to figure out 

           17    exactly what the design intent was.

           18         Q.  Okay.  If -- I want you to make an assumption.  

           19    Notwithstanding your opinion, which I recognize already 

           20    is that it's not clear from the written materials that 

           21    nobody should be on the platform when it's in the raised 

           22    position -- I understand that that's -- that's your 

           23    position.  

           24             But if, in fact, the instructions, warnings, 

           25    materials were sufficient such that everyone knew the 








                                                                          


            1    only purpose of placing the platform in the jacked-up 

            2    position was to perform the change out of the screens, 

            3    the lower screens, and to perform whatever work you 

            4    could otherwise do below the platform and, therefore, no 

            5    one would ever be on the machine when it was -- on the 

            6    machine platform when it was in the jacked-up position, 

            7    would the machine be in violation of any of the 

            8    regulations we've discussed?

            9         A.  That's a hypothetical and I don't know that I 

           10    can answer that one.  You know, the whole question is 

           11    foreseeability and foreseeability of whether or not 

           12    someone might violate that just to get the job done.  

           13    You know, I think you have to physically restrict that 

           14    from occurring or you'd have to put enough -- enough 

           15    deterrent to make sure that nobody does that because you 

           16    can do both screens at the same time.  It just makes it 

           17    more efficient.  I mean, people go for the efficiencies.  

           18    You're always being challenged to be efficient.  

           19             So foreseeability, I think, is the issue here, 

           20    and whether they took enough steps to avoid -- to 

           21    eliminate -- I can go down through the list of the Z10 

           22    things to reduce their risk.

           23         Q.  Okay.  What I'm getting at, though, is let's 

           24    assume nobody is going to go on it.  I'm just -- I want 

           25    to ask you to make an assumption.  








                                                                          


            1         A.  It's hard for me to.

            2         Q.  Make the assumption that nobody is going to go 

            3    on the platform in a raised position.  And, therefore, 

            4    the only time anyone would go on the platform would be 

            5    when it's in the lowered position where that -- where 

            6    there's that transition from the stair onto the 

            7    platform.  Is the machine in violation of any of the 

            8    regulatory schemes that you've cited?

            9         A.  Of course.  The platform lifts.  The -- the 

           10    work -- work area doesn't continue along the task.  And 

           11    I mean by that that there's three bolts still off the 

           12    end of the work area, right?  We've got to understand 

           13    that.  And if the -- if the platform doesn't go 

           14    continuously, then we don't have a safe product here.  

           15    So, yes, it would be in violation.  

           16             You don't work over stairs.  You don't work 

           17    over moving parts.  You don't work over any of those 

           18    kinds of things on a piece of machinery and call it 

           19    safe.

           20         Q.  I just want to make sure I understand which 

           21    ones you would consider it to still be in violation of.  

           22    I think you told us earlier that if it's in that lower 

           23    position and you have that natural transition from the 

           24    stairway onto the platform, you don't -- you wouldn't 

           25    require a gate at that location, correct?








                                                                          


            1         A.  No, sir.  I didn't -- you're mischaracterizing 

            2    my testimony.  I would include a gate if -- if there 

            3    were stairs that were down there and you needed to lean 

            4    over those stairs to work on something if you were 

            5    restrained and had a -- had -- I mean, there's a lot of 

            6    things that have to go together.  It's -- that wasn't -- 

            7    I -- I was not privy to the design intent here so -- and 

            8    I'm asking for the design intent because I want to 

            9    understand what was the intent.  

           10             You're asking me to assume something that was 

           11    related to somebody's intention for that particular 

           12    product, and I'm saying the design intent, you have to 

           13    include foreseeability in that, and that's what I'm 

           14    saying is lacking here.

           15         Q.  All right.  What I'm trying to understand is 

           16    under what circumstances is it caused to be a violation?  

           17    Is it because there's three bolts that you have to reach 

           18    out to that requires a gate or simply -- simply anytime 

           19    you have three stairs onto a platform at 55 inches, you 

           20    have to have a gate?  That's what I'm asking.  

           21         A.  Okay.  I understand your question, but I don't 

           22    know that I can say that the gate is the only solution 

           23    here.  I'm saying there's a lot of solutions that are 

           24    possible that you could pick.  The designing engineers 

           25    had a lot of latitude to make those kinds of decisions, 








                                                                          


            1    and they made the decision that they did which caused 

            2    the injury.  It's -- it's the cause connection that I've 

            3    got here.

            4         Q.  What role do you ascribe to Mr. Wylie as far as 

            5    causing the injury?

            6         A.  You know, I'm not sure what kind of a state 

            7    Connecticut is.  I don't have any idea.  But I don't see 

            8    reason why he shouldn't be able to safely work on that 

            9    machine.

           10         Q.  You read his transcript?

           11         A.  I did.

           12         Q.  You know his involvement with the machine?

           13         A.  I think he did everything according to the -- 

           14    the instructions.

           15         Q.  Okay.  So are you saying you ascribe no 

           16    responsibility to Mr. Wylie for walking backwards off 

           17    the machine?

           18         A.  I -- I do.  I -- I assign no -- no 

           19    responsibility to him.  He had -- he was trying to do 

           20    his best to get that machine up and running and 

           21    demonstrated.

           22         Q.  Okay.  

           23         A.  It's a dangerous machine.  

           24         Q.  With respect to the height controls or the 

           25    controls on the platform not being on the upper 








                                                                          


            1    platform, I think you cited construction -- OSHA at    

            2    29 CFR 1926.453(b)(2)(ix), 30 CFR 56/57.11001, ANSI 

            3    Z535.4, and ANSI Z10.  Are there any others that would 

            4    apply as it relates to your opinion?

            5         A.  I think it would be -- well, I think that a 

            6    complete review -- these things change all the time.  

            7    There's always modifications.  Standards change all the 

            8    time.  So I would say that the designer of this product 

            9    needs to stay in touch with all the different -- and I 

           10    understand from Mr. Donnelly's testimony that -- that he 

           11    only looked at those things that were in his backyard 

           12    that were happening in Europe.

           13         Q.  So for purposes of your opinion that you've 

           14    rendered in this case and the report that you've issued, 

           15    again the question is, is there anything outside of the 

           16    four standards I just cited that you're relying on for 

           17    that opinion?

           18         A.  I'm relying on the opinion that -- yeah, those 

           19    are the ones I'm relying on.  Yes.

           20         Q.  Okay.  For the issues with the stairway and 

           21    step height, you cited ISO 2867; is that correct?

           22         A.  2687, I believe is the correct number.  2687.

           23         Q.  2687.  I had it backwards.  Okay.  2687, 

           24    correct?

           25         A.  Correct.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  ISO SAE J185?

            2         A.  That's correct.

            3         Q.  30 CFR 56/57.11002?

            4         A.  I'm sorry.  

            5                   COURT REPORTER:  Please keep your 

            6              voice up.

            7         A.  I'm sorry.  I'd have to look through all those 

            8    to make sure.  Do you want me to do that? 

            9    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           10         Q.  Well, I'm just trying to make sure that I know 

           11    each regulation that you're relying on for each opinion.  

           12         A.  I think I've already stated that, right, for 

           13    the record?  So is this just repeating what we just did?  

           14    If it is, I'll just agree with it.

           15         Q.  If you need to review the report, go ahead and 

           16    review it.  I don't want you to just agree with me 

           17    because you think I'm saying something -- 

           18                   MR. FOTI:  John, what he's saying 

           19              for the record is the citations you're 

           20              making he cited in his report.  

           21                   MR. ROBINSON:  He cited them in his 

           22              report and I've tried to capture them by 

           23              issue as opposed to just whatever appears 

           24              in the report wherever it appears.

           25                   MR. FOTI:  So what he's asking is 








                                                                          


            1              you've cited certain -- 

            2                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.  

            3                   MR. FOTI:  -- regulations -- 

            4         A.  And I agree with my report as -- as Mr. Muller 

            5    (phonetic) said, I agree with my report.  

            6    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            7         Q.  All right.  Well, let me ask you a different 

            8    way.  Assume ISO 2687, SAE J185 and 30 CFR 56/57.11002 

            9    of the MSHA relate to your opinions as it -- as to the 

           10    stairway and step height.  Can you think of any others 

           11    that you're relying on?

           12         A.  Stairway and step height.  No.

           13         Q.  All right.  Then with respect to your opinions 

           14    as it relates to inadequate anchorage for personal 

           15    restraint systems -- 

           16         A.  Correct.

           17         Q.  -- 30 CFR 56/57.15005.  

           18         A.  And all the Z standards.

           19         Q.  Yeah, I'm not done yet.  I'll keep going. 

           20         A.  Oh, okay.

           21         Q.  That's one of them?

           22         A.  What is that?  

           23         Q.  30 CFR 56/57.15005?

           24         A.  That would be the mining -- 

           25         Q.  Correct.  








                                                                          


            1         A.  -- identified in mining.  Again, we're talking 

            2    about what now again, please?  

            3         Q.  Inadequate anchorage for restraint system.  

            4         A.  I don't think that's an anchorage thing.  CF -- 

            5    30 CFR is not --

            6         Q.  Okay, so not that one.  All right.  How about 

            7    ANSI Z359.1, fall protection?

            8         A.  That is, yeah.

            9         Q.  ANSI Z10?

           10         A.  No.

           11         Q.  Okay.  ANSI -- oh, so not ANSI Z10?

           12         A.  No.

           13         Q.  ISO 14567?

           14         A.  ANSI -- I'm sorry.  

           15         Q.  ISO 14567?

           16         A.  Yes.

           17         Q.  ISO 14566?

           18         A.  Yes.

           19         Q.  Do you have any opinions about lack of 

           20    training?

           21         A.  I didn't get any information related to 

           22    training, so I have no way to respond to that.  I've 

           23    asked for it.  I did not receive it.

           24         Q.  Okay.  So as of now, you have no opinions on 

           25    the lack of training?








                                                                          


            1         A.  I can't comment.

            2         Q.  Okay.  Then you also had opinions about the 

            3    inadequacy of the manual instructions?

            4         A.  I did, yes.

            5         Q.  All right.  And for that you relied on ANSI 

            6    Z535.3, criteria for safety symbols?

            7         A.  That is part of it, yes.

            8         Q.  Okay.  ANSI Z535.6, product safety information 

            9    and product manuals, instructions and other collateral 

           10    materials?

           11         A.  Correct.

           12         Q.  ANSI A92.6, aerial work platform standards?

           13         A.  Correct.

           14         Q.  ANSI Z10?

           15         A.  Z10 is, again, the -- what the manufacturer 

           16    needs to do to make sure that they don't -- that they're 

           17    using whatever method is best for the situation.

           18         Q.  So it's a general --

           19         A.  No.  It says -- it says there's a hierarchy of 

           20    things you need to do.  Try to -- if you can do it, 

           21    avoid it.  In other words, if you don't need a screener, 

           22    don't put it in the marketplace.  Number 2, eliminate; 

           23    eliminate the issue so that you don't have to deal with 

           24    it, like -- like design it out.  Three, if you can't do 

           25    that, the next step is to try to engin- -- to -- to put 








                                                                          


            1    in engineering controls so that if somebody had a -- you  

            2    had a -- you have a switch, for example, on the raise 

            3    and lower.  And if the raise and lower was occurring, 

            4    you'd shut out the -- the jack-up.  You'd have to make 

            5    sure that they're in the lower position before you do 

            6    that, which they didn't do.  There's a -- there's a 

            7    series of steps that you take to try to mitigate the 

            8    issue.  

            9         Q.  Okay.  

           10         A.  And that's the process that I don't see 

           11    happening in this particular company to try to eliminate 

           12    this problem.

           13         Q.  Okay.  So Z10 doesn't directly apply to 

           14    inadequate instructions.  It's -- other than the fact 

           15    that there is a section --

           16         A.  You might have to warn -- 

           17         Q.  You get to the point of potentially warning?

           18         A.  Correct.

           19         Q.  So that's how Z10 comes in --

           20         A.  That's correct essentially, yeah.

           21         Q.  All right.  ISO 14566, does that relate to 

           22    inadequate instructions?  It's personal equipment for 

           23    protection against falls.  

           24         A.  Yeah.  That's basically the fall protection.  

           25    The question of whether -- whether they should have used 








                                                                          


            1    restraint versus fall protection, that's -- that's 

            2    what's involved in that.

            3         Q.  As it relates to their instructions?

            4         A.  Right.

            5         Q.  Okay.  

            6         A.  In other words, you have to -- in many cases 

            7    you have to tell people what them kind of a -- how to 

            8    set the lanyard, where to -- where to place the 

            9    connection.

           10         Q.  And pinch point, I don't think there were any 

           11    regulatory citations for pinch point, correct?  

           12         A.  There are, yes.

           13         Q.  Are there in your report?

           14         A.  No, not in my report.

           15         Q.  Okay.  

           16         A.  But I cite them in other works I do.

           17         Q.  Okay.  Have I covered the various issues and 

           18    the various regulations that you can think of that apply 

           19    to each of them?

           20         A.  I believe so, yes.

           21         Q.  Okay.  You comment in your report at Page 21 of 

           22    136, in the middle -- one of the middle paragraphs, it 

           23    says, ISO 2687 or SAE J185 standards do not address 

           24    reaching off the platform to do maintenance to the 

           25    screenbox.  What do you mean by that statement?  What 








                                                                          


            1    are you getting at?

            2         A.  Well, I think that was that three-point 

            3    question that we had there.  

            4         Q.  Well, the three-point question we had relates 

            5    to ladders, right?

            6         A.  And we don't know wha- -- whether this is a 

            7    ladder or what we -- we don't know what it is, what it 

            8    was designed to -- I don't know what the standard was it 

            9    was designed to.

           10         Q.  The platform is not a ladder, right?

           11         A.  The platform isn't, no.

           12         Q.  Right.  So, in essence, these standards you are 

           13    stating in your report do not address reaching off the 

           14    platform to do maintenance, correct?

           15         A.  I don't think so.  I think there's other ones 

           16    that do.

           17         Q.  Which ones?

           18         A.  I would cite -- let me just -- let me just go 

           19    back.  

           20                   MR. FOTI:  John, right after this 

           21              question, can we take a break?  

           22                   MR. ROBINSON:  Sure.  

           23         A.  If we look at Page 26 -- 

           24    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           25         Q.  Uh-huh.








                                                                          


            1         A.  -- I cite 29 F- -- CFR 1910.21, working 

            2    surfaces.  It says here, about basically -- it starts 

            3    off, Dangerous --

            4    BY MR. ROBINSON:

            5         Q.  Yep.  

            6         A.  -- equipment means equipment such as vats, 

            7    tanks, electrical equipment, machinery, equipment or 

            8    machinery with protruding parts, or other similar units, 

            9    that, because of their function or form, may harm an 

           10    employee who falls into or onto this -- this equipment.  

           11    So this is dangerous equipment since he can fall onto 

           12    protruding parts.  

           13         Q.  Okay.  And that, again, assumes that the 

           14    procedure is to stretch off of the platform to reach 

           15    those last three bolts, correct?

           16         A.  I think I tried to show it illustrated in a 

           17    picture that I got from an Irishman who said that's a 

           18    dangerous thing to do, reach over stairs and try to do 

           19    things.  No, I mean, if I have to answer this question, 

           20    yes.

           21         Q.  Right.  Okay.  

           22                   MR. ROBINSON:  You need a break?  

           23                   MR. FOTI:  Yeah.

            5    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            6         Q.  Okay.  We talked about this a little before, 

            7    but I just want to make sure I'm clear on where you're 

            8    coming from with respect to your opinions.  Is this 

            9    platform, for purposes of your opinions, a scaffold?  

           10         A.  Again, I'll say I don't know the intent of the 

           11    designer on this particular design.  It has 

           12    characteristics of aerial lifts.  It has characteristics 

           13    of scaffolds.  It has characteristics of walkways.  It 

           14    has characteristics of all these.  So that's why it's -- 

           15    like I said, I -- I have to take and include all of them 

           16    because I don't know what the intent of the -- of the 

           17    design was.

           18         Q.  Okay.  How -- why would it be an aerial lift?

           19         A.  Well, because it's on a self-propelled machine 

           20    and you can raise it, and that's what -- the definition 

           21    of an aerial lift is a machine that has a platform that 

           22    lifts up and carries personnel with it or could carry 

           23    personnel with it.  So, to me, it's -- it could qualify, 

           24    but what's absent is the controls.  So it's hard to 

           25    distinguish which one of these we have.  So, therefore, 








                                                                          


            1    we have to include all of them.  

            2         Q.  Unless, of course, the intent is not for it to 

            3    carry personnel at all when it's in the elevated 

            4    position.  Then it's not an aerial lift, correct?

            5         A.  It's an aerial lift.  It's a question of 

            6    whether or not you -- you prevent people from being 

            7    lifted on it.  So you'd have to sense where people are, 

            8    and you'd have to sense what is going on on the machine 

            9    and foreseeability.  

           10             So I -- I think I've answered that question, 

           11    but I know it's really hard because, as you look at it, 

           12    it would seem that you could tell somebody don't get on 

           13    that thing and it would be fine.  But if you're not 

           14    there to tell them, nobody is going to know it.  They're 

           15    going to use -- use whatever means that they have to 

           16    make the operation efficient.  I think we've been 

           17    through that.

           18         Q.  Okay.  But, I mean, to qualify as an aerial 

           19    lift, it has to have the intent to lift people, correct?  

           20    It's not it just lifts cargo?

           21         A.  I -- I -- do you know what the intent was?  

           22         Q.  I'm asking you, to qualify as an aerial lift 

           23    for purposes of your -- of your opinions, would one of 

           24    the requirements of an aerial lift be a lift that would 

           25    actually lift people, for example, as opposed to just 








                                                                          


            1    lifting . . .

            2         A.  Cats?  

            3         Q.  Boxes.  

            4         A.  Okay.  Well, an aerial lift carries with it 

            5    equipment.  You can carry a lot of things in an aerial 

            6    lift, and so, you know, to just say -- for me to try to 

            7    answer that question, I don't think -- again, I think 

            8    what you have to do is -- is really try to figure out if 

            9    that was the intent of the -- and, in my opinion, it 

           10    was.  Basically, the intent was to -- again, I know 

           11    there's -- there's information in -- in the 

           12    documentation; you're going to say that.  

           13             But I think foreseeabilitywise that there was 

           14    no statement made do not get on this lift in their 

           15    instructions.  There is no warnings that say don't get 

           16    on this lift.  It says -- in fact, it says use this 

           17    lift, according to the warning that I saw.  It says you 

           18    need to get on this thing because that's what you -- 

           19    what it's intended for.  Look at -- look very carefully 

           20    at the -- at the diagram and it says use the lift.

           21         Q.  Show -- show me where you're referring to.  

           22         A.  Okay, just a second.  Let me do that for you.

           23         Q.  Just point me to a page, please.  

           24         A.  All right.  It says that on -- on this page 

           25    right here.  (Indicating.)








                                                                          


            1         Q.  All right.  So, just for the record, we're 

            2    looking at Page 61 of 36 (sic) of your report, right?

            3         A.  That's correct.

            4         Q.  And that actually shows a warning sign that 

            5    actually appears right on the stairway as you're walking 

            6    up to the machine, correct?

            7         A.  That's correct.

            8         Q.  All right.  And the first thing it said -- it's 

            9    got -- it's got black letters with an exclamation point 

           10    and an orange heading that says, Warning, correct?

           11         A.  That's correct.

           12         Q.  And then below it, it says, Fall hazard, 

           13    falling from this machine can result in serious injury 

           14    or even death, correct?

           15         A.  That's correct.

           16         Q.  So clearly a warning is being conveyed to 

           17    anyone approaching that machine that falling in that 

           18    area could cause injury, correct?

           19         A.  In fact, it states -- even worse, it says 

           20    warning and it should say danger.

           21         Q.  Okay. 

           22         A.  Because it's -- it actually has the -- the 

           23    words "even death," so it -- it carries too low a 

           24    characterization.

           25         Q.  All right.  And then, below it, it says, Do not 








                                                                          


            1    climb on machine, and there's a person climbing their 

            2    way onto, you know, a structure with a red circle around 

            3    it and a line through it, correct?

            4         A.  I think I see that, yes.

            5         Q.  All right.  So clearly the warning is telling 

            6    the user and/or someone approaching the machine not to 

            7    climb on it, correct?

            8         A.  It's saying that you should not climb on it.

            9         Q.  Right.  Let me ask you a question.  If --

           10         A.  By the way, they didn't show stairs there 

           11    either.

           12         Q.  Right.  So if Mr. -- well, stairs are pretty -- 

           13    pretty obvious, right?  You expect somebody to use 

           14    stairs to work their way up the stairs, correct?

           15         A.  Climb on it?  Yes, climb on it.  So the word 

           16    "climb" there is kind of -- do not scale maybe, do 

           17    not --

           18         Q.  Just -- 

           19         A.  The problem -- the problem we have is this 

           20    warning is not clear.

           21         Q.  All right.  So just so we're clear, you don't 

           22    think the average human being would be able to 

           23    comprehend that warning with that -- with that 

           24    demonstrative diagram as to what they mean by don't 

           25    climb on the machine?  Just for purposes of your 








                                                                          


            1    opinion, it's not clear, correct?

            2         A.  It's not clear.

            3         Q.  Okay.  Now, it then says, Use a suitable 

            4    lifting platform to service the machine, correct?

            5         A.  And does this --

            6         Q.  No, no, just answer my question.  Let's -- this 

            7    will --

            8         A.  Wait, wait, wait.  I answered your question.  I 

            9    said yes.

           10         Q.  That's the question --

           11         A.  No, no.  I'm sorry; I get to continue.

           12         Q.  No, you don't.  

           13         A.  I do.

           14         Q.  It's a yes or no question.  

           15         A.  No, I get -- I get to continue.

           16         Q.  No.  That's -- that's all I -- 

           17         A.  I get to clarify -- I get --

           18         Q.  Sir, sir, we're not going to end at five 

           19    o'clock.  I want to get through this.  But every time I 

           20    ask you a question, you answer something else.  And I'm 

           21    not trying to argue with you, but it's getting beyond 

           22    the pill of what we allow.  I'll be honest with you.  So 

           23    just listen to the question and answer it, and then 

           24    we'll get through this.  Your counsel can ask you any 

           25    questions he wants.  Or at trial, you can clarify 








                                                                          


            1    anything you want.  Just answer my questions, please.  

            2    All right?  

            3             So the words that it says on the document are 

            4    "use a suitable lifting platform to service the 

            5    machine," correct?

            6         A.  That's what it says.

            7         Q.  All right.  And within your report, you 

            8    actually rely on those words to suggest that what it's 

            9    conveying to the operator or user is that it's telling 

           10    them to use that platform as the lifting platform, 

           11    correct?  The platform associated with the machine.  

           12         A.  Do I get to answer the question in full?  

           13         Q.  Yeah, I asked you whether, throughout your 

           14    report, you rely on this other diagram which shows the 

           15    person on a lift and these words that say "use a 

           16    suitable lifting platform to service the machine" for 

           17    the proposition that what that's conveying to the user 

           18    is that they should use the platform at issue in this 

           19    case as a lifting mechanism, correct?

           20         A.  With the word "suitable," is that what you're 

           21    emphasizing?  Can I take that out and just use a 

           22    platform as a lifting -- 

           23         Q.  I'll tell you what.  On this one, answer 

           24    however you want.  

           25         A.  Okay.  I just want to make sure that I'm not 








                                                                          


            1    being limited in terms of my --

            2                   MR. FOTI:  You're not being limited.  

            3                   THE WITNESS:  Okay, thank you.

            4                   MR. FOTI:  Answer the question.

            5         A.  All right.  So what it conveys is that -- that 

            6    instead of climbing on the machine, they should be using 

            7    a lift.  I've already pointed out there's several 

            8    problems with the wording of it already, and so hinging 

            9    everything on a word doesn't help this.  

           10             "Suitable" would be a word that -- they 

           11    wouldn't understand necessarily what a suitable -- how 

           12    it differs from the lift platform that they're using 

           13    already.  So I think it conveys the idea that you 

           14    shouldn't be climbing.  You should be using -- you 

           15    shouldn't be scaling.  You should be using the platform 

           16    that we've provided here. 

           17    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           18         Q.  All right.  

           19         A.  And that's the way it reads to me.

           20         Q.  So you don't interpret this as reading if they 

           21    -- if you're going to be working your way up the 

           22    machine, you should be bringing some other independent 

           23    lift to the machine so you could access high points on 

           24    the machine?

           25         A.  Yes, I -- I believe that I don't believe that.  








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Okay.  

            2         A.  Okay?  And it's written -- my reasoning is 

            3    below.  In the -- in the writing below, I said, you 

            4    know, if they had meant that to be the case, why would 

            5    they have even put a platform on the machine at all?  

            6    Just bring a cherry picker up and use it.

            7         Q.  Okay.  

            8         A.  So that's the reasoning behind it.

            9         Q.  This diagram of this platform with the cross 

           10    legs on the bottom of it -- 

           11         A.  It's called a scissor lift.

           12         Q.  Okay, scissor lift.  The lift on this machine 

           13    is not a scissor lift, correct?

           14         A.  The diagrams don't always agree.  I mean, 

           15    they -- they go to standard committees, and then those 

           16    standard committees finally have to agree on what the 

           17    symbol looks like.  So none of this is really depicting 

           18    exactly this machine, and we know that.  That's a human 

           19    factors element that I've picked up on and understand --

           20         Q.  And -- 

           21         A.  -- because I've had to make warnings myself.

           22         Q.  And the standards committee defines what these 

           23    should look like, correct?

           24         A.  They have to go through committee, yes. 

           25         Q.  All right.  And -- 








                                                                          


            1         A.  And I'm part of the committee that does that.

            2         Q.  And you're not a human factors expert, correct?

            3         A.  I am involved in -- yes.  See, the word human 

            4    factors you're using is not -- is a broad term that is 

            5    not necessarily -- this part of it is human factors as 

            6    well.  You have to deal with what people understand and 

            7    what people use.  So it is human related.

            8         Q.  Do you hold yourself out as a human factors 

            9    expert witness?

           10         A.  In areas, I do, yes.

           11         Q.  Okay.  In any aspect of this particular case?

           12         A.  Warnings, sure.  Warnings definitely.

           13         Q.  All right.  So -- 

           14         A.  Z535.

           15         Q.  Okay.  

           16         A.  All sorts of them.

           17         Q.  All right.  So the warnings applicable in this 

           18    case, you're holding yourself out as a human factors 

           19    witness?

           20         A.  I participate in the standards committee.

           21         Q.  All right.  Which standards committee is that?

           22         A.  That's ASAE manuals and displays.  They have a 

           23    section on identifying these symbols.

           24         Q.  What's your role with the committee?

           25         A.  I -- I just participate.  I'm there -- attend 








                                                                          


            1    meetings when -- 

            2         Q.  How often do you attend the meeting?

            3         A.  In the last couple years, I've been there each 

            4    year.  In Louisville, they meet.  

            5         Q.  All right.  How many people are there?

            6         A.  The conference is rather large depending on 

            7    which -- which committee.  Each committee has a number 

            8    of people, but we get correspondence and we do a lot of 

            9    work online.  

           10         Q.  Okay.  So you attend one meeting a year?

           11         A.  One meeting a year.

           12         Q.  Last couple of years?

           13         A.  Yeah.

           14         Q.  How about prior to that?

           15         A.  Basically was involved in SAE.  I was chair of 

           16    this section.  So a lot of these things go on in SAE, 

           17    too.  There's -- there's human factors things that 

           18    relate to warnings and labels.

           19         Q.  When were you the chair of what section of SAE?

           20         A.  I was -- in 2001, I with the chair for the 

           21    Mississippi Valley, the second largest section of 

           22    Society of Automotive Engineers.  

           23         Q.  All right.  And when did you stop being 

           24    involved with that?

           25         A.  Well, I mean, I'm a -- I'm a lifetime member 








                                                                          


            1    now.

            2         Q.  Right.  You were involved on a committee in 

            3    2001.  Have you been on a committee since?

            4         A.  I -- I'd have to think through that one.  I 

            5    don't recall how long it's been since I've been on the 

            6    SAE committee.  I volunteer a lot of time though on 

            7    STEMS research and so forth, and I've been active in 

            8    that.  I've been involved in the STEMS activities.

            9         Q.  Okay.  So, now, back to this, Page 61, you 

           10    actually state, This warning level conveys a message 

           11    that the operator must use the aerial lift.  And you're 

           12    referring to the platform that's part of the machine, 

           13    correct?

           14         A.  That was the way I would interpret it, yes.

           15         Q.  All right.  So your interpretation of this is 

           16    that they must use that platform if they're seeking to 

           17    service the machine?

           18         A.  That's what I think it conveys, yes.

           19         Q.  Got it.  Would -- the platform itself, do you 

           20    agree that it has a proper railing around the entirety 

           21    of the platform with the exception of the missing gate?

           22         A.  No.

           23         Q.  What's wrong with the railing?

           24         A.  There are -- there's chains.

           25         Q.  Okay.  So there's a chain at one location, 








                                                                          


            1    right?

            2         A.  Two chains.

            3         Q.  Two chains on each side or two chains in -- 

            4         A.  Four chains.

            5         Q.  Okay.  So there's two chains on the platform at 

            6    issue, the one he fell off of?

            7         A.  Yes.

            8         Q.  Okay.  Should there be any kind of a warning 

            9    sign, such as those that appear on Page 61, to tell the 

           10    user not to climb up on the railings?

           11         A.  I don't understand your question.

           12         Q.  Is there any kind of a properly approved 

           13    warning sign?  Because you said these have to go through 

           14    committee, right?

           15         A.  The -- the images do.

           16         Q.  Right.  Is there any kind of a sign that would 

           17    be required to tell someone not to climb up on those 

           18    railings?  Or would that just be common sense?

           19         A.  It gets down to where it's physically -- the 

           20    height of the railings are specified, and I have to 

           21    admit, I did read one case where somebody put a -- put 

           22    a -- a pipe across the midsection.  I was talking to you 

           23    about the MSHA things I read where they actually put a 

           24    beam across the midsection once, stood on top of that, 

           25    fell off 56 feet to their death.  








                                                                          


            1             So I'm sure there's probably cases where you 

            2    need a sign, Hey, don't do something stupid here.  It's 

            3    4:30 in the afternoon.

            4         Q.  So do you think there's a sign that would apply 

            5    to that situation, like, Hey, don't do something stupid.  

            6    Don't put a beam across an obvious hazard.  It's 4:30 in 

            7    the afternoon.  Is there a sign that you can use for 

            8    something like that?

            9         A.  It's -- it's a matter of determining how to -- 

           10    how to mitigate your risks.  

           11         Q.  So under some circumstances, the sign I just 

           12    described should be used?

           13         A.  There's -- sometimes a gate is worthwhile.  

           14    Sometimes a restraint system is worthwhile.  

           15    Sometimes all these different things that we can do to 

           16    try to mitigate.  I think I told you about the Z10, and 

           17    we can down through that again if you want to.  Warnings 

           18    are way low.  Warnings are way low.  We try to -- we try 

           19    to eliminate before it gets down that low.  

           20         Q.  Right.  

           21         A.  So you're asking me a question that I'm saying, 

           22    well, I'm going down through my hazard reduction.  And 

           23    at some point, you've got to say, look, I've done what I 

           24    could to help the guy.  I've instructed him, whatever.  

           25    And there may be training.  Again, we don't have that 








                                                                          


            1    information.  I don't know what was talked about at all 

            2    on that so . . .  

            3         Q.  If you have a platform that has proper 

            4    railings, right, and a proper gate, do you need a sign 

            5    to tell somebody don't climb up and stand on the rungs 

            6    of the railing?

            7         A.  It caused one person's death.  It depends on 

            8    the situation, right?  I think you've got to look at 

            9    each -- each set of circumstances differently.  Here 

           10    we're looking at a specific case.  You're asking me for 

           11    a hypothetical, and I'm saying, well, it depends.  

           12    Because you've got -- again, you've got to use the Z10 

           13    risk mitigation process in -- when you're developing and 

           14    designing product.

           15         Q.  All right.  And one of the ways you can 

           16    determine the foreseeability is if something actually 

           17    happens and then you now know it can happen, correct?

           18         A.  Well, foreseeability is -- is taking proactive 

           19    action.  And I notice they did have a risk assessment, 

           20    but I'm not sure.  I can't recall what the dates were on 

           21    that.  I doubt they went through that process and 

           22    decided that there was a problem there.

           23         Q.  Did that risk assessment form the basis for any 

           24    of your particular opinions here?

           25         A.  Yeah.  I did look at it.  I did see the level 








                                                                          


            1    of detail that went into it.  Again, I -- I failed to 

            2    put it on a timeline, so I'm a little -- I can go down 

            3    and look through it, if you want me to.  Anyways, it's 

            4    on Page 7.  I can go look at it.  

            5                   COURT REPORTER:  Page 7?  

            6                   THE WITNESS:  Page 7.

            7         A.  I can go look at R058.  It's a 14-page risk 

            8    assessment.  I don't know when it occurred.  

            9    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           10         Q.  I'll tell you what.  Just in the interest of 

           11    moving along, let's not go there.  All right?  Let's 

           12    talk about the instructions.  

           13             Why don't we look at Page 99 of your report.  

           14    Actually, I'm going to move forward to page -- the 

           15    instructions, I believe, and your analysis of them 

           16    begins on Page 99.  

           17         A.  Oh, I didn't analyze any after 61.  What is 99?  

           18    It was just a record of what it was so we can refer to 

           19    it.

           20         Q.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, that's right.  

           21    Because within your report, you removed some of the 

           22    diagrams and that type of thing?

           23         A.  Right.

           24         Q.  You just listed what the steps were?

           25         A.  The steps and added whether it was up or down.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  That's right.  Now, let's just turn to    

            2    Number 21.  It indicates visually check for vibration in 

            3    the screen mesh when the screenbox is running.  

            4             What, if anything, do you know about whether 

            5    experienced operators would know to lower the screenbox 

            6    before performing that vibration test?

            7         A.  You used the word "experienced."  I'm not sure 

            8    what level of experience they have.  Can you clarify 

            9    that?  

           10         Q.  What, if anything, do you know about whether 

           11    the screenbox should be lowered when a person performing 

           12    the screen changing activities is going to perform that 

           13    vibration test?

           14         A.  Again, I'm still not clear.  It's a long 

           15    question and I'm trying to understand exactly what 

           16    you're asking me.

           17         Q.  Sure.  Do you know one way or another whether 

           18    the screenbox should be lowered in order to perform the 

           19    vibration test and run the screenbox?

           20         A.  I believe it should be lowered, yes.  

           21         Q.  And what I mean by that is, pursuant to the 

           22    procedure.  Pursuant to the procedure --

           23         A.  I don't know what -- 

           24         Q.  -- those who are performing this task on a 

           25    regular basis, what, if anything, do you know about 








                                                                          


            1    whether the screenbox should be lowered to the working 

            2    position before the visual check for vibration in the 

            3    screen mesh can be made while the screenbox is running?

            4         A.  I'm sorry.  The question is -- just -- just 

            5    give it to me straight.  What is it you want to know?  

            6    What is it you wanted?  

            7         Q.  Do you have any information one way or another 

            8    whether operators that perform this work, the mechanics 

            9    that perform the work that change out the screens -- 

           10         A.  Okay.

           11         Q.  -- whether they are to lower the screenbox to 

           12    the working position before they visually check for 

           13    vibration in the screen mesh when the screenbox is 

           14    running?

           15         A.  When the screenbox is running, no one should be 

           16    around -- on the platforms and the -- and the support 

           17    should be lowered, yes.  The machine should not be 

           18    operated when it's in the upper position.  That's why 

           19    it's so confusing here because we don't have exact 

           20    records or we don't have exact statements.  All of a 

           21    sudden, it's up, and all of a sudden, it's down.  It's 

           22    locked out and then it's not.  It's -- it's not proper 

           23    instructions here.  

           24         Q.  I think we're talking Apples and oranges.  I'm 

           25    asking you what, if any, information do you have about 








                                                                          


            1    what the individuals in the field do when they perform 

            2    Step 21?

            3         A.  I know what they do when they perform Step 21.  

            4    I am -- I'm informed on that.

            5         Q.  What do they do?

            6         A.  Well, they -- basically, we have to start the 

            7    machine up and run it and put it into its shaking mode.  

            8    The screenbox has to be moving.  It's just like sifting 

            9    flour.  You have to get the machine to move, and there's 

           10    a crank in there that's a -- has an offset weight and 

           11    that offset weight turns and causes the shaking to 

           12    occur.  And we get -- you get a certain amplitude based 

           13    on how much mass is being moved at what speed.  There's 

           14    oscillations that occur because of this sinusoidal 

           15    action of the -- of the mass, and that's what causes 

           16    things to move through the screen.

           17         Q.  And in order to do that, the jack-up position 

           18    needs to be removed down to the working position so that 

           19    you can perform that vibration test, correct?

           20         A.  That is correct, yes.  Uh-huh.

           21         Q.  Okay.  All right.  Now --

           22         A.  Now, you asked -- but I think the question was 

           23    would a person with a -- that does it everyday know what 

           24    to do about that.  I think that was what I understood.  

           25    Now, if you're a brand-new person, you'd have to explain 








                                                                          


            1    that to the.  But if you were using it all the time, you 

            2    wouldn't.  So the instructions in your manual have to 

            3    take into account the person who doesn't know how to do 

            4    that.

            5         Q.  Okay.  And Mr. Wylie, of course, is one of 

            6    those experienced people, correct?

            7         A.  But the instructions don't say it here.

            8         Q.  All right.  But does -- let me ask you 

            9    something.  Does Mr. Wylie need an instruction to tell 

           10    him something that he full well knows from being the 

           11    experienced individual?

           12         A.  I don't know what Mr. Wylie knows unless he 

           13    tells me.

           14         Q.  Okay.  The -- the -- if you're going to run -- 

           15                   MR. ROBINSON:  Back on, sorry.  I 

           16              dropped my mic.  

           17    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           18         Q.  If you're going to -- I think you said a moment 

           19    ago nobody should be on the machine when you're running 

           20    that screenbox because of the vibration, correct?

           21         A.  I think it states that in the operators manual.

           22         Q.  Would you agree that nobody should be on that 

           23    platform, whether it's in the raised or lowered 

           24    position, while you're running that screenbox?

           25         A.  Either way.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Okay.  That would be a violation of the 

            2    manufacturer's instructions, you said?

            3         A.  Right. 

            4         Q.  I'm getting close.  

            5         A.  Can we take a break?

           13    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           14         Q.  Do you recall Mr. Wylie's testimony about 

           15    whether he ever read the manual?

           16         A.  I think he read the manual.  He said he didn't 

           17    read it all in one sitting, I don't think.  I think he 

           18    read portions that he needed to.

           19         Q.  Do you recall if he had any recollection about 

           20    any specific portions of the manual that he actually 

           21    read?

           22         A.  I don't recall that detail.

           23         Q.  Do you recall how long prior to the incident it 

           24    was that Mr. Wylie read the manual?

           25         A.  I don't recall.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  Do you recall whether he ever read the manual 

            2    more than once?

            3         A.  I don't recall.

            4         Q.  Can you render any opinion as it relates to 

            5    Mr. Wylie's reliance on the actual words, or lack 

            6    thereof, in the manual?

            7         A.  I don't know what he relied on.

            8         Q.  Okay.  Do you agree that the maintenance 

            9    section of the manual is clear about never allowing 

           10    unqualified personnel to attempt to operate, maintain, 

           11    remove or replace any part of the machine?

           12         A.  I don't think the word "qualified" is clarified 

           13    in there at all.

           14         Q.  All right.  Do you know anything about what 

           15    training programs are in place as to how people become 

           16    qualified to service these machines?

           17         A.  I've asked but not received information.

           18         Q.  Did you garner any information from 

           19    Mr. Donnelly about that training?

           20         A.  Only that he wasn't involved.  It was another 

           21    department that was -- that was writing up the manuals.  

           22    Service department, I think is what he said.

           23         Q.  How about in-person training?

           24         A.  I think he mentioned something about it, but 

           25    I'm not sure I identified -- since I didn't have the 








                                                                          


            1    training material, I didn't really spend a lot of time 

            2    on that portion of his deposition.

            3         Q.  All right.  Sorry for the gaps here, but I'm 

            4    trying to skip over some stuff to try and get this done.  

            5             You mentioned SAE J185 in a number of contexts, 

            6    but in one context, it was related to the gate issue; is 

            7    that correct?

            8         A.  I don't believe I addressed the gate issue 

            9    here.

           10         Q.  No?  Okay.  Do you have SAE 1 -- J185 available 

           11    to you?

           12         A.  I have that online.

           13         Q.  Well, I can give it to you.  Let's mark it.  

           14                        (Defendants' Exhibit F,

           15                         SAE J185, three pages,

           16                         marked for identification.)

           17    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           18         Q.  And I think -- you got it?  Okay.  I'll ask you 

           19    to take a look at Exhibit F.  This is SAE J185, right?

           20         A.  I believe it's a copy of that.  It's dated  

           21    June 1988.

           23                   THE WITNESS:  1988.

           24    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           25         Q.  Is that the version that you relied on for 








                                                                          


            1    purposes -- 

            2         A.  Yes, I do.

            3         Q.  Okay.  Now, if -- this is recommended practice 

            4    for access systems for off-road machines, correct?

            5         A.  That's correct.

            6         Q.  And it's got a variety of different sections to 

            7    it, but I want to particularly call your attention to 

            8    the handrails and handholds -- I'm sorry -- the 

            9    platform, passageways, walkways and guardrails, which is 

           10    Section 9.  Would you agree that this section applies, 

           11    for purposes of your opinions, to the platform at issue 

           12    in this case?

           13         A.  Where it doesn't conflict with the federal 

           14    regulations.  

           15         Q.  All right.  How do we know which governs?  And 

           16    when you say federal regulations, which ones?

           17         A.  We've gone through the CFRs.  I think they -- I 

           18    think those are all . . .  

           19         Q.  All right.  So the CFR conflicts -- so you've 

           20    relied on this, J185, for various opinions?

           21         A.  Uh-huh.

           22         Q.  But if it conflicts with what, OSHA or the 

           23    MSHA, OSHA or the MSHA would govern?

           24         A.  Again, it's a question of -- this is -- this 

           25    is, in fact, a CFR as well.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  I thought that you told us that OSHA adopted 

            2    this?

            3         A.  Well, don't we have that on the first page?  It 

            4    says U.S. code has been adopted.

            5         Q.  Okay.  So does this govern?

            6         A.  This governs along with everything else.

            7         Q.  Okay.  At Section 9.4 it states, Where an 

            8    opening has been provided in a guardrail other than to 

            9    provide access to a ladder or to steps, a device shall 

           10    be provided across the opening that meets requirements 

           11    specified in 4.3, right?

           12         A.  That's correct.

           13         Q.  And 4.3 is the section that talks about 

           14    handrails, handholds, guardrails capable of doing a 

           15    variety of things, correct?

           16         A.  That's correct.

           17         Q.  Doesn't 9.4 assume the lack of something 

           18    blocking the access to a ladder or the steps?

           19         A.  It's for an opening, but the intent of the work 

           20    space here, there were three more bolts off the end, so 

           21    you had to work over those steps, and that's where it 

           22    doesn't anticipate.

           23         Q.  Okay.  Well, that -- okay.  So, but for the 

           24    three bolts -- 

           25         A.  Right.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  -- this would apply?

            2         A.  Correct.

            3         Q.  All right.  And, again, you don't accept 

            4    Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Witte's testimony about how you 

            5    access those bolts is not from the platform?

            6         A.  I don't accept that, no, because it doesn't -- 

            7    you don't have the three-point.

            8         Q.  Okay.  And, again, your point about not having 

            9    the three-point is because it might be a ladder, 

           10    correct?

           11         A.  It might be a ladder.

           12         Q.  You had a document in your file called 

           13    Safeguarding Equipment and Protecting Employees From 

           14    Amputations.  It's an OSHA publication.  Is -- is 

           15    that -- did that form -- anything within that form the 

           16    basis of your actual opinions in this case, or is it the 

           17    regulations that we've already talked about?

           18         A.  No.  This is one that just happened to appear 

           19    in your list.

           20         Q.  Okay.  

           21         A.  The version maybe.  

           22         Q.  Give me a couple minutes.  I may be either done 

           23    or very close to done.  Let me just look over a couple 

           24    things.  

           25             Okay.  Quick question:  Because Powerscreen -- 








                                                                          


            1    you laid out in your report how there's Powerscreen in 

            2    Ireland, and then there's the Powerscreen importer in 

            3    the U.S., and then that gets sold to -- you know, 

            4    product then can get sold to Powerscreen Connecticut who 

            5    then -- who, obviously, Mr. Wylie works for, right?

            6         A.  I don't believe he works for Powerscreen 

            7    Connecticut anymore.  I think it's New England now.

            8         Q.  Okay.  Well, whatever iteration it is --

            9         A.  Okay.

           10         Q.  -- New England or Connecticut.  

           11         A.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I just want to make sure --

           12         Q.  But there's a -- your understanding is that, 

           13    not withstanding Powerscreen Connecticut, there -- which 

           14    is a separate company -- 

           15         A.  Right.

           16         Q.  -- a different entity, that there is a 

           17    Powerscreen entity affiliated with the Irish companies 

           18    that is the American importer of the -- of the product, 

           19    correct?

           20         A.  I'm not sure who is the importer, but I know 

           21    TEREX is the overall parent.  So they would be 

           22    responsible for what comes into the United States.

           23         Q.  I was wondering whether you have any opinion 

           24    one way or the other as to whether the -- the arm of 

           25    that company, the American importer of the product, or 








                                                                          


            1    whether the Irish manufacturer of the product, Irish -- 

            2    Ireland-based manufacturer of the product, would have 

            3    the obligation to comply with these various regulations?  

            4    Is it one or the other or both?  Or how do you -- how do 

            5    you see the responsibility?

            6         A.  Well, I'm not a -- I'm not a -- not an 

            7    attorney, as you know, so my opinions would be based on 

            8    what I've heard before or seen before in my -- my work.  

            9    But a lot of times, you know, we get these -- we import 

           10    a toilet.  I'm thinking specifically of a toilet hose 

           11    that goes underneath from your hose -- from the spigot 

           12    on your water.  You turn it off there and up to the 

           13    toilet.  

           14             A lot of times, it's hard -- very hard to trace 

           15    who actually produced that particular product, but 

           16    whenever we can, we try to trace it to the manufacturer 

           17    and -- who imported it or the person who imported that 

           18    product because they are basically bringing in a product 

           19    that needs to comply with U.S. and federal requirements.  

           20             So that's my understanding.  I don't know who 

           21    in this case actually imports it.  I don't really -- I 

           22    -- I think it fits under the parent company to -- to 

           23    identify that.  

           24         Q.  Okay.  

           25         A.  For you. 








                                                                          


            1         Q.  What specific warnings and/or decals do you 

            2    believe should have been on this machine that aren't 

            3    there?

            4         A.  Again, I don't know the design intent.  We've 

            5    gone through the Z10 activities, and we can go down 

            6    through that again if you'd like me to.  But I think 

            7    there's a lot of things that could have been done to the 

            8    machine prior to doing any warnings at all, and that's 

            9    why I don't want to opine on which specific warnings 

           10    should have been on the machine.

           11         Q.  Okay.  What should have been done to the 

           12    machine prior?  What should they have done?

           13         A.  Well, you need -- you need to make sure that 

           14    the work platform is as long as the task.  In other 

           15    words, you shouldn't stop three short because somebody's 

           16    backing along trying to tighten nuts.

           17         Q.  Okay.  So that assumes the bolt work off the 

           18    platform -- platform, so there's one issue.  

           19         A.  What's that?  

           20         Q.  Assumes they're doing the bolt work leaning off 

           21    the platform?

           22         A.  In both cases, whether you raised or lowered 

           23    the platform, you have that case.  

           24         Q.  Okay.  But my -- but, again, so what you're 

           25    saying is one of the ways they should have designed it 








                                                                          


            1    differently was so that the platform was actually 

            2    directly below those additional three bolts?

            3         A.  That's what I'm saying, yes.

            4         Q.  Okay.  That's one thing.  What else should they 

            5    have done differently?

            6         A.  They can offset the staircase and not put it -- 

            7    you wouldn't have to have a gate on an offset staircase 

            8    because you wouldn't be walking right through the gate 

            9    of off the back of the machine.  You can put it further 

           10    out or perpendicular.

           11         Q.  So are you saying that if the -- instead of 

           12    coming off the end of the platform, if the stairway came 

           13    off the side of the platform, no gate would be 

           14    necessary?

           15         A.  That's right.

           16         Q.  Okay.  

           17         A.  Because you'd be walking past the -- all along 

           18    your work area, you'd be walking past the bolts.

           19         Q.  All right.  What else should they have done 

           20    differently?

           21         A.  I mean, I -- I'm presuming here.  If they made 

           22    an area and if they -- for good reason, they wanted to 

           23    raise it, then I would say put the controls on the 

           24    aerial lift.  Make sure that the -- the -- the controls 

           25    were in an area where the operator could use them.  








                                                                          


            1             On this particular machine, the -- the controls 

            2    were where the operator can't be seen if he's on the 

            3    left -- on the left walkway --

            4         Q.  Okay. 

            5         A.  -- or -- 

            6         Q.  You -- you seem to qualify that opinion on, you 

            7    know, if it's meant to be an aerial lift.  Are you 

            8    saying that is a design they should have done on this 

            9    machine?  Or it sort of depends; you're not sure about 

           10    that?

           11         A.  Well, I don't know the design -- I -- much as 

           12    they -- much as people -- again, you can say a lot of 

           13    things about your product, but if you really get down to 

           14    it, in the United States here, if it's foreseeable, then 

           15    you've got some problems here, and I think it's 

           16    foreseeable.

           17         Q.  Okay.  

           18         A.  I -- it's my opinion that it's foreseeable that 

           19    people will get up on that platform.  There's -- there's 

           20    various reasons I've stated.  I don't think we need to 

           21    do through them again.  

           22             But I think there's reasons why people would 

           23    get up there and do that.  First, efficiencies.  

           24    Second -- that -- that's a major driver in business.  

           25    You want to get that thing done.  You want to get it out 








                                                                          


            1    and get it -- get it cranking.  If no stones are 

            2    rolling, there's no -- no money coming in.  

            3             So, economically, I think you're -- you're -- 

            4    you've got to look ahead and see what are the -- what 

            5    are the impetus for people to be on that machine trying 

            6    to get both screens changed at the same time so . . .

            7         Q.  Okay.  So we have extend the length of the 

            8    platform to cover the bolts.  We have change the 

            9    direction of the stairway and then you don't need a 

           10    gate.  And we have put controls up on the platform.  Is 

           11    there anything else?

           12         A.  Oh, yes.  Remove the chains.  Make sure that 

           13    you've got solid -- that -- that when you apply the 4000 

           14    newtons to the -- to the chains that they don't deflect 

           15    80 millimeters.  That's completely wrong.  

           16             Slip surfaces, all those things have to be 

           17    accounted for in -- under the federal rules.

           18         Q.  What would you have used for a -- for a 

           19    flooring surface?

           20         A.  I think I showed you a picture earlier.  We can 

           21    go back to that and review --

           22         Q.  Oh, you're saying that what you showed me from 

           23    the -- I think it was Photograph No. 1?

           24         A.  Precisely.

           25         Q.  Something like that is what they could have 








                                                                          


            1    used?

            2         A.  That's right.

            3         Q.  Okay.  Anything else besides what we've just 

            4    covered that they could have done -- should have done 

            5    differently with this machine?

            6         A.  That's quite a few.  I mean, there's a lot of 

            7    things you can go through.  As you go through it -- 

            8         Q.  Well, I need to know what you're going to say 

            9    at trial.  

           10         A.  Oh, okay.  So those are the ones I'm probably 

           11    going to bring up --

           12         Q.  Okay.  

           13         A.  -- if I haven't thought of anything more.

           14         Q.  All right.  Well, I want you to think right 

           15    now.  Are there any others?

           16         A.  There's time between now and trial.  I think I 

           17    could think about -- 

           18         Q.  Well, I -- I think we're going to certainly 

           19    show you what you said today if you do that at trial 

           20    so -- so why don't you just --

           21         A.  No problem.  You've already got a long list.  

           22    So, I mean, that's -- I can stay to that and still 

           23    get -- 

           24         Q.  Okay.  As you sit here now, having gotten 

           25    prepared to come here and render your opinions in this 








                                                                          


            1    case, those are the items that you would change?

            2         A.  That's right.

            3         Q.  Okay.  

            4         A.  Oh, I forgot the gate; excuse me.

            5         Q.  No, we talked about the gate.  

            6         A.  We can put the gate on here if we need to, as 

            7    long as you use retainer lines or retainer systems.  So 

            8    you can go that route, too.

            9         Q.  Oh, you can use retain- -- retention systems 

           10    instead of a gate?

           11         A.  No.  Re- -- retention systems with a gate 

           12    because you're leaning over the gate which -- which is 

           13    kind of leaning out of a basket.

           14         Q.  Okay.  

           15         A.  So there's regulations in terms of leaning out 

           16    of a basket if you have to.  There are CFRs, 29 CFRs.  

           17                   MR. FOTI:  John, I would just like 

           18              to point the expert to his report just to 

           19              see if there's anything he didn't talk 

           20              about because we got caught up in 

           21              conversation.  

           22                   MR. ROBINSON:  Yeah.  

           23                   MR. FOTI:  There's at least one 

           24              other thing that I note he put in here --

           25         A.  Oh, but I -- I'd like to admit my whole file 








                                                                          


            1    and use that as I need to from -- and that's --

            2    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

            3         Q.  All right.  Is there -- are there any other 

            4    changes that aren't covered by your report that you 

            5    would render any opinions about at trial?

            6         A.  Not at this time.

            7         Q.  Okay.  

            8                   MR. FOTI:  Where's your report?  

            9                   THE WITNESS:  Huh?  

           10                   MR. FOTI:  Where's your report?  I'm 

           11              trying to -- 

           12                   THE WITNESS:  Okay.  This -- this 

           13              ends my report here.  

           14         A.  You saw the pinch point, right?  You need to 

           15    solve the pinch point as well.

           16                   COURT REPORTER:  Saw?

           17                   THE WITNESS:  "Solve" the pinch 

           18              point problem.

           19    BY MR. ROBINSON:

           20         Q.  How would you solve the pinch point?

           21         A.  I'd put a guard on it, cover it so you can't 

           22    get your hand in there or your foot or any other item.  

           23                   MR. ROBINSON:  All right.  Subject 

           24              to maybe a question or two, I'm going to 

           25              pass the witness so we can use time.








                                                                          


            1                   MR. FOTI:  Okay.

            2                   MR. ROBINSON:  Thanks.  I'll switch.  

            3                   MR. COYNE:  I just don't want to -- 

            4              you can put it behind you.

            5                   MR. ROBINSON:  Yeah.  You know what?  

            6    

            7                       CROSS-EXAMINATION

            8    BY MR. COYNE:  

            9         Q.  Are you ready, Mr. Cowley?

           10         A.  I am.

           11         Q.  In your report, you refer to the working 

           12    position when you're referring to the machine.  Just to 

           13    be clear, is that when the platform, the upper part of 

           14    the platform, is down into the lowered position?

           15         A.  I'm using the terminology that --

           16         Q.  I'm just asking when you are referring to it in 

           17    your report, what are you referring -- it raised or 

           18    lowered?  

           19         A.  I'm referring to it as -- in its lowered 

           20    position.

           21         Q.  Okay.  And did you take a picture of the 

           22    platform with a tape measure adjacent to it when it was 

           23    in its lower position down at the lowest end of the 

           24    platform?

           25         A.  I did.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  You did?  With the tape measure?

            2         A.  With a tape measure, yes.

            3         Q.  Showing 55 inches?

            4         A.  That's right.

            5         Q.  Okay.  I just didn't see it in the 

            6    300-and-something pictures that I looked at.  

            7         A.  I know.  350 -- 317 pictures is a lot.  

            8         Q.  Now, turning to some of those instructions, I 

            9    just want to follow up a little bit.  And they're in 

           10    your report, so you can take a look at that.  But where 

           11    it refers to the Steps 8 through 19 --

           12         A.  Can you point me to a page?  

           13         Q.  Well, you I think put them there at Page --

           14         A.  Twenty-one?  

           15         Q.  -- 102.  No, where you actually put the 

           16    pictures.  You just did the steps on Page 21 but at  

           17    Page 101 and 102, I believe, where you set forth the 

           18    steps with the photographs.  

           19         A.  Okay, I'm looking at 101 and 102 now.

           20         Q.  Yeah.  And you see where it has Steps 8  

           21    through 14 and it's referring to A, C, B.  Do you see 

           22    that?

           23         A.  I do, yes.

           24         Q.  Is that a picture of the lower screen area or 

           25    the upper screen area?








                                                                          


            1         A.  It's a picture of the lower screen area.

            2         Q.  Okay.  And just above 15, Step 15, that's also 

            3    a picture of the lower screen area, correct?

            4         A.  I believe so, yes.

            5         Q.  Okay.  Now, when we get to M and N, which is on 

            6    the next page, it's the lower picture, Page 102 --

            7         A.  Yes.

            8         Q.  -- is that the upper screen area or the lower 

            9    screen area?

           10         A.  It could be upper; could be lower.

           11         Q.  I'm asking if you know. 

           12         A.  Okay.

           13         Q.  I'm not asking what it could be.  I'm asking 

           14    what you know.  

           15         A.  Okay.  What I know here is what they're trying 

           16    to do is depict the upper.

           17         Q.  Okay.  And how do you know that?

           18         A.  Because the bolt that comes out, the end bolt 

           19    on the end, are basically what I -- the features that I 

           20    saw at the upper end, the upper mesh.

           21         Q.  So -- and then take a look at the top of that 

           22    page.  You've got Steps 16 through 19?

           23         A.  Correct.

           24         Q.  And those are also referring back to the prior 

           25    picture which has the B, C and A designation?








                                                                          


            1         A.  That's correct.

            2         Q.  And that's referring, as we already said, to 

            3    the lower screen, correct?

            4         A.  That's correct.

            5         Q.  What -- withdraw that.  

            6             Do you have any information as to what Graham 

            7    Wylie's training was with OSHA or MSHA -- MSHA?

            8         A.  I don't have any idea what his training was.  

            9    I'm not sure on MS.  I think he probably had experienced 

           10    some training at OSHA.  He said at Halliburton or -- I 

           11    don't remember which company he had worked with but --

           12         Q.  Do you know if he's certified in either?

           13         A.  What do you mean by certified?  I need to 

           14    understand that.

           15         Q.  Do you have a -- well, OSHA, they certify 

           16    people, correct?

           17         A.  Well, there's a certification if you want to 

           18    run an aerial lift, yes.

           19         Q.  A certification is OSHA 10, OSHA 30, you have 

           20    cards, you have training?

           21         A.  There is a certification for running an aerial 

           22    lift, yes.

           23         Q.  And the certification just on OSHA?

           24         A.  On OSHA, yeah.

           25         Q.  Yeah.  And there is -- there is also a 








                                                                          


            1    certification for MSHA.  They can certify you as to 

            2    working in that aspect, correct?

            3         A.  Correct.  There's a certifications in mining.

            4         Q.  But they're a similar --

            5         A.  Similar -- 

            6         Q.  -- process?

            7         A.  -- yes, uh-huh.

            8         Q.  Do you know if he's certified in any of that?

            9         A.  I don't know that.

           10         Q.  In your conversations, did you have ask him or 

           11    the attorney about his certifications in either of those 

           12    issues?

           13         A.  I did ask, yeah.  

           14         Q.  And what was the response?

           15         A.  I didn't get a response there.

           16         Q.  You didn't get a response?

           17         A.  No.

           18         Q.  Isn't that important since you're referring to 

           19    OSHA and MSHA as to a large part of your opinion?

           20         A.  Well, my opinion is that if it's an aerial 

           21    lift, you have to certainly be certified.  That's part 

           22    of my opinion, yes.

           23         Q.  Well, isn't it important to find out what 

           24    Mr. Wylie's certifications are in that regard so as to 

           25    his training?








                                                                          


            1         A.  Well, I tried to -- I tried to get that 

            2    information.  I mean, as an engineer, I would love to 

            3    have more information than I could ever get.

            4         Q.  Well, wouldn't it -- 

            5         A.  So I tried as much as I could, yeah.  

            6         Q.  Wouldn't it be quite easy, because you were 

            7    retained by his attorney and basically for Mr. Wylie, to 

            8    get that information?

            9         A.  You know what?  I don't know and understand how 

           10    attorneys work.  

           11         Q.  Well, certainly easier than getting it from the 

           12    other side of the table, correct?

           13         A.  I would guess, yeah.

           14         Q.  Okay.  But you asked how many times?  Once?

           15         A.  I don't remember how many times.  I asked for a 

           16    lot of material that I didn't get.

           17         Q.  I'm not -- I'm not talking about the other 

           18    material that you asked for that you put in your report.  

           19    On to that issue, how many -- 

           20         A.  How many times?  

           21         Q.  -- times did you ask?  Yeah.  

           22         A.  I don't recall.

           23         Q.  Okay.  Now, we talked about the pinch point, 

           24    and you referred that one of your problems with that, if 

           25    I understand your testimony -- and I'm just kind of like 








                                                                          


            1    paraphrasing it, so if I'm incorrect in paraphrasing, 

            2    correct me, sir.  All right?

            3         A.  All right.

            4         Q.  But I think one of your problems is that pinch 

            5    point can also act as a step?

            6         A.  It's positioned very well to be a step.

            7         Q.  Okay.  

            8         A.  It's got the right cadence.  It's in the right 

            9    position to make it easy for people to use that as a --

           10         Q.  But it's not -- it's not -- it's not angled or 

           11    exactly positioned flat like a step, right?  

           12         A.  Well, yeah, there is some flatness to it.  I 

           13    think if you put your foot in it, you'd feel a higher 

           14    point than not.  But, in essence, I think you'd use 

           15    it -- 

           16         Q.  Okay.  

           17         A.  -- naturally.

           18         Q.  Okay.  And how come the metal rod that's over 

           19    the stairs can't also be a handle?

           20         A.  Metal rod over the stairs?  

           21         Q.  Yes, the little rod that you said is --

           22         A.  You can't use steps -- 

           23         Q.  No, no, no.  How come that is not considered a 

           24    handle from you?

           25         A.  Because it's not vertical or horizontal.  It 








                                                                          


            1    says that the -- the handle to use as a pull-up has to 

            2    be vertical or horizontal.  You have to use --

            3         Q.  And why can't it be a railing?  Because 

            4    railings, we know, follow the same angle as a stair.  

            5         A.  It doesn't have the -- it haven't have the 

            6    dimensions.  It has to be 34 inches off the step.  So 

            7    it's in the wrong place.

            8         Q.  So it's in the wrong place at the wrong angle, 

            9    but it's not a handle?

           10         A.  No.

           11         Q.  Yet the pinch point is a step?

           12         A.  Well, you have to make some judgments here, but 

           13    it -- it sits over the top of the stair and obstructs 

           14    the -- the flow of people up the stairs so -- and it's 

           15    not the right height.  

           16         Q.  Do you agree that OSHA and MSHA allows you to 

           17    use other equipment, other types of equipment, to 

           18    satisfy any perceived safety problems with the piece of 

           19    equipment or the machinery?

           20         A.  I'm sorry.  I don't understand your question.

           21         Q.  You can use a fall system that you attach, 

           22    correct?

           23         A.  I think I stated, yes.  

           24         Q.  I'll give you an example.  

           25         A.  Sure.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  You could use a separate aerial lift?

            2         A.  You could use a cherry picker, yes.

            3         Q.  Yes.  Okay.  And that can satisfy a lot of what 

            4    OSHA and MSHA finds as problematic for a particular 

            5    piece of equipment?

            6         A.  Normally, though, you wouldn't see any access 

            7    on the machinery itself if you were going to use 

            8    those -- some of those -- I mean the cherry picker, for 

            9    example.  You wouldn't -- you would not put anything 

           10    there and say you must use a cherry picker or something 

           11    like -- or a scissor lift or whatever.

           12         Q.  But you can remove those safety problems with 

           13    other pieces of equipment that the employee can utilize, 

           14    correct?

           15         A.  As long as they're properly instructed in 

           16    the -- in the manual.

           17         Q.  Of course.  Or if they know from their training 

           18    in OSHA and MSHA to use those things?

           19         A.  No.  It needs to be declared in the operators 

           20    manual.  It says on -- in many cases, retention, how you 

           21    attach to a piece of equipment, has to be identified in 

           22    the owners and operators manual.

           23         Q.  Where does it say that?  What regulation 

           24    requires that?

           25         A.  You want me to go through that now and find it?  








                                                                          


            1         Q.  No.  What regulation generally?  Is it in OSHA?  

            2    Is it in MSHA?  

            3         A.  OSHA.  I think it's in the -- the ANSI A92, in 

            4    some -- in some of those standards.  And then I think 

            5    there's a Z -- just a second.  Let me -- it's in the 

            6    ANSI Z359 series, and it's also in -- in the ISO, like 

            7    14567.

            8         Q.  So you're saying that the instruction manual 

            9    for the piece of equipment needs to tell you to go use 

           10    another piece of equipment?

           11         A.  Use the retainer -- it has to tell you how to 

           12    use and adjust the retainer.

           13         Q.  Okay.  It has to tell you to go use something 

           14    else?

           15         A.  Right.

           16         Q.  Who operated this machine when Mr. Wylie -- 

           17    around the time Mr. Wylie -- withdraw that.  

           18             Who operated this machine before Mr. Wylie was 

           19    injured?

           20         A.  I don't know.

           21         Q.  Did you ever ask that?

           22         A.  The machine was static.  It was shut off.

           23         Q.  Well, it was operated at some point beforehand?

           24         A.  They told him -- oh, when he came to the scene, 

           25    the -- the thing was already in its mesh-changing 








                                                                          


            1    position.

            2         Q.  And you base that on --

            3         A.  Mr. Wylie's testimony.

            4         Q.  -- that one comment in his testimony?

            5         A.  I believe that's sufficient for me to . . .

            6         Q.  Did you ask him if he ever operated it and 

            7    moved it?

            8         A.  You know, honestly, I don't think I've had a 

            9    conversation except, Mr. Cowley, would you like a cup of 

           10    coffee.

           11         Q.  Why wouldn't you take that opportunity to ask 

           12    him questions?

           13         A.  Well, I don't know.  It's -- it would be nice 

           14    to do that.

           15         Q.  It seems like it's a perfect opportunity.  

           16         A.  Uh-huh.

           17         Q.  You're looking at the machine that he was 

           18    injured on --

           19         A.  Uh-huh.

           20         Q.  -- and to ask him questions about what he was 

           21    doing at the time that he was injured, wasn't that a 

           22    perfect opportunity to ask him?

           23         A.  I didn't see it that way.  There were a lot of 

           24    people around.  There were photograph -- people 

           25    photographing.  I didn't want to necessarily -- 








                                                                          


            1         Q.  There was a photographer hired by Mr. Brignole 

            2    and Mr. Brignole, his attorney?

            3         A.  I didn't.  

            4                   MR. COYNE:  Okay.  That's -- that's 

            5              all I have.  

            6                   MR. ROBINSON:  Couple -- couple 

            7              things.

            8                   MR. FOTI:  I may have a couple.  Let 

            9              me just take one second.

           10                   MR. ROBINSON:  Okay.

           18                       CROSS-EXAMINATION

           19    BY MR. FOTI:

           20         Q.  I just have a couple questions.  This platform, 

           21    is it an option, in other words, something you purchase 

           22    as an option and added on to this equipment, or is this 

           23    something that comes with it?

           24         A.  The platform is part of the machine.

           25         Q.  Okay.  And what is the platform -- the platform 








                                                                          


            1    intended to be used for?  what maintenance is up there 

            2    that you would use that platform for?

            3         A.  I think there's two that they're looking at.  

            4    One basically is changing the upper mesh of the screener 

            5    and also for lubricating the crank system.

            6         Q.  Okay.  And in addition to changing the screens, 

            7    is there regular hourly maintenance with regard to those 

            8    nuts and bolts; in other words, do you have to check 

            9    them after so many hours of use?

           10         A.  I believe the operators manual says after ten 

           11    hours of use, you need to check the bolts.

           12         Q.  So is it your understanding that's what that 

           13    platform is for.  It's for servicing of the screen, 

           14    whether it's to tighten the bolts or to replace the 

           15    screen and to do greasing?

           16         A.  Or check bolt tightness, yeah.

           17         Q.  And there's steps leading specifically to the 

           18    platform?

           19         A.  There's steps that are on the chassis of the -- 

           20    the vehicle.  But in terms of steps, so the final step 

           21    is to step off onto the -- onto the platform itself.

           22         Q.  Okay.  But in order to get to the platform, you 

           23    have to use at least a couple of those steps?

           24         A.  Correct, yes.

           25         Q.  Okay.  So they put steps on the machine?








                                                                          


            1         A.  Right.

            2         Q.  And they put a platform on the machine?

            3         A.  Correct.

            4         Q.  Okay.  And as far as you know, that's the 

            5    structure you'd use in order to do those two maintenance 

            6    issues?

            7                   MR. ROBINSON:  Objection.

            8         A.  Correct.  

            9                   MR. FOTI:  That's all I have.  Thank 

           10              you.

           11    

           12                      REDIRECT EXAMINATION

           13    BY MR. ROBINSON:  

           14         Q.  Okay.  R068 to your report is the Warrior 2100 

           15    manual, correct?

           16         A.  That's correct.  

           17         Q.  And you actually have a discussion in the 

           18    report about how you think that -- I think that's the 

           19    manual.  Tell me if I'm wrong -- that manual does a 

           20    better job of distinguishing the operations for the two 

           21    screen changes, correct?

           22         A.  It does because there's a completely different 

           23    design involved.

           24         Q.  Got it.  Does the Warrior 2100 have a similar 

           25    jack-up feature?








                                                                          


            1         A.  It does, yes.

            2         Q.  All right.  And when -- what's the vintage -- 

            3    what's the year of the Warrior 2100 manual?  It's not 

            4    noted in -- in your report.  

            5         A.  I don't -- I'd have to look.  

            6         Q.  All right.  Do you have any recollection or 

            7    knowledge as to whether Mr. Wylie was familiar with the 

            8    2100 manual and the 2100 model as well?

            9         A.  I wouldn't know.  I mean, I take it back.  We 

           10    did look at a 2100 when I was there.

           11         Q.  All right.  As a salesman for Powerscreen 

           12    Connecticut and/or New England, depending on who it is, 

           13    would it be your expectation that Mr. Wylie would have 

           14    familiarity with the manual related to the 2100?

           15         A.  As of the date of the incident, I'm not sure 

           16    because I don't know when the 2100 actually became a 

           17    product.

           18         Q.  Okay.  The -- if, in fact, a gate was required, 

           19    what would its -- what should its design have been?  How 

           20    should -- how should it have been designed?

           21         A.  Well, it certainly should cover the entrance, 

           22    and it also should be able to support all the loads that 

           23    are applied to the guardrail.

           24         Q.  Okay.  How does it -- does it -- does it lock 

           25    closed?  Does it -- how does it work?








                                                                          


            1         A.  No.  It has a sufficient latching mechanism 

            2    that would allow it to take the forces of a person 

            3    leaning against it.  

            4         Q.  All right.  Is it self-closing or closed by the 

            5    individual or does it matter?

            6         A.  It -- it -- most of them are self-closing that 

            7    you have on equipment so that they close behind you.

            8         Q.  All right.  And should it open toward the 

            9    stair -- stairs or should it open toward the platform?

           10         A.  Normally opens towards the stairs.

           11         Q.  Okay.  One of the things you said in your 

           12    report is that any purchaser down the road from the 

           13    manufacturer cannot alter or modify an aerial lift, 

           14    right?  

           15         A.  Well, they can't modify a piece of equipment 

           16    and still maintain your -- your EC certification.

           17         Q.  Right.  But -- but do you agree that one way 

           18    they could do and maintain their certification is get 

           19    permission from the manufacturer or get permission from 

           20    an appropriate testing laboratory?

           21         A.  Normally a manufacturer wouldn't give that kind 

           22    of information unless they had tested and done that work 

           23    themselves.  And you can get -- you can get kits; for 

           24    example, we put out kits on occasion to try to meet the 

           25    -- the needs.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  You indicated that the -- the 1800 did not have 

            2    proper attachment anchoring points, correct?

            3         A.  I did say that.

            4         Q.  Did it have any?

            5         A.  Not that I could visually see.

            6         Q.  Do you recall if there were any anywhere on 

            7    the -- on the screener?

            8         A.  I don't recall seeing any.

            9         Q.  Okay.  

           10         A.  And they weren't -- certainly weren't 

           11    identified if they were there.

           12         Q.  In response to counsel's question, you said 

           13    besides changing the upper mesh, you would lubricate the 

           14    crank.  Are there any photographs that show us the 

           15    crank?

           16         A.  It's in that box.  It's hidden in the box.  I 

           17    didn't take it apart.  

           18         Q.  So when you say in the box, it's in the box 

           19    that limits the width of the walkway?

           20         A.  That's what I'm saying.

           21         Q.  That we looked at in the photograph?

           22         A.  That's what I'm saying.

           23         Q.  All right.  So it wouldn't matter whether 

           24    the -- the lift was in the jack-up position or down in 

           25    the working position for purposes of doing that, 








                                                                          


            1    correct?

            2         A.  It's -- it's in the same relationship to the 

            3    platform.

            4         Q.  Right.  So if it's down in the working 

            5    position, you can walk right up onto the platform, go 

            6    down to the box and do the lubrication of the crank, 

            7    correct?

            8         A.  Correct.

            9         Q.  All right.  Has your testimony ever -- I 

           10    realize you only testified at trial once.  But has your 

           11    testimony -- testimony ever been precluded or have you 

           12    ever been disqualified as an expert in any case?

           13         A.  Not that I'm aware of.

           14         Q.  Has your testimony ever been limited, based on 

           15    any motion practice for any given case, to certain 

           16    issues as opposed to other issues you were attempting to 

           17    render opinions on?

           18         A.  Not that I'm aware of.

           19         Q.  Okay.  I see nothing in your report suggesting 

           20    that there were any violations of any EC or EU European 

           21    standards.  You're not going to render any opinions that 

           22    this machine violates any of those, correct?

           23         A.  I'm not.

           24         Q.  All right.  So I'm correct?

           25         A.  I'm not going to render any opinions.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  All right.  Turn to Page 127 of your report 

            2    quickly, please.  What exactly is this -- what is this 

            3    attachment to your report?

            4         A.  It's an explanation of the standards related to 

            5    fall protection for aerial work platforms.

            6         Q.  Is this something that you created or -- I'm 

            7    just not sure what this document -- this page of the 

            8    document is.  Is it a continuation of the prior page?  

            9    What is it?  

           10         A.  I think the source is identified on Page 130.  

           11         Q.  Page 130?

           12         A.  Uh-huh.  Is that right?  

           13         Q.  Okay.  So -- I see.  So, for example, 

           14    everything that's on Page 126 was from the source 

           15    perhaps at the bottom there.  Oh, maybe not.  But then 

           16    starting at Page 127, that all comes from the source at 

           17    the bottom of Page 130; is that correct?

           18         A.  Yes, that's correct.

           19         Q.  All right.  

           20         A.  So it's from OSHA itself.

           21         Q.  So this is an OSHA publication as it relates to 

           22    aerial work platforms, correct?  

           23         A.  That's correct.

           24         Q.  And the need for fall protection, right?

           25         A.  That's correct.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  And it shows an aerial ladder.  It shows an 

            2    articulating boom, an extendable boom, and then it shows 

            3    you sort of what these types of systems can look like 

            4    when you raise these aerial lifts below that, correct?

            5         A.  Well, that -- that's a Class 2.  The Class 1 is 

            6    -- it's -- it's identifying different classes of aerial 

            7    lifts,  I think.

            8         Q.  None of these look anything like the two to 

            9    three to four, depending on how you want to define it, 

           10    stairway to the platform on the TEREX -- on the 

           11    Powerscreen screener, correct?

           12         A.  I don't know how to -- I don't think -- I think 

           13    I alluded to the warning label.  We can go back to that 

           14    discussion if you'd like to.  But there is a -- there is 

           15    a concept of a lift that includes all of these different 

           16    elements.  They have different ways of lifting it 

           17    vertically.  If you put a hydraulic cylinder under a 

           18    platform, you do the very same thing as Class 2s.

           19         Q.  But our -- our -- our device, whatever it is -- 

           20    it's hydraulics --

           21         A.  Uh-huh.  

           22         Q.  -- I believe, to lift our platform?

           23         A.  Uh-huh.

           24         Q.  Raises it 20 inches, correct?  I think you told 

           25    us it's 55 inches.  








                                                                          


            1         A.  Twenty, twenty -- probably 20 inches -- like I 

            2    said, 20 inches on the cylinder so . . .

            3         Q.  Right.  So I think what you told us is it's   

            4    55 inches when it's down in the working position and it 

            5    becomes 75 inches when raised, correct?

            6         A.  I believe that's correct.

            7         Q.  All right.  

            8         A.  For lifts.

            9         Q.  Let me ask you, these -- these items that are 

           10    depicted in Class 1 vehicle-mounted elevating and 

           11    rotating aerial devices, are they designed in such a 

           12    fashion where they can even move while the person is 

           13    elevated on the aerial device?

           14         A.  I'm sorry.  I lost the page.  

           15         Q.  Sure.  Page 127.  

           16         A.  There's no movement depicted.  I think in many 

           17    cases they actually have -- I'm trying to think of the 

           18    name.  They actually extend these stabilizers, if you 

           19    will, for this kind of equipment.  

           20         Q.  Got it.  And that's Class 2, correct?

           21         A.  Class 1.

           22         Q.  The Class 2 would get stabilized --

           23         A.  No.  You've got motion.  You can see -- you can 

           24    see manually it moves.  It's depicting arrows that move.

           25         Q.  Oh, okay.  So -- 








                                                                          


            1         A.  So -- 

            2         Q.  -- all right.  

            3         A.  You asked me Class 1.

            4         Q.  All right.  So start with Class 1.  Class 1 is 

            5    actually on a vehicle where they might be doing some 

            6    work at an elevated location.  Perhaps they're doing 

            7    work on a power line or -- 

            8         A.  Maybe only 20 inches.  

            9         Q.  -- whatever it is.  Well, they're elevated -- 

           10    look at the photographs.  Those types of devices -- 

           11    those types of vehicles with their aerial lifts can 

           12    raise someone, for example, to like -- say they're going 

           13    to do a telephone line or something like that.  On a 

           14    telephone pole, they're going to do some work.  My 

           15    question to you is, Class 1, can they be -- can -- while 

           16    the person is elevated in the aerial lift, are there any 

           17    regulations or anything that says you can't move the 

           18    vehicle at all while the person is elevated?  Do they 

           19    have to come all the way down, then you move again and 

           20    you move them, or can you move with them up there?

           21         A.  No, you can move with them up there.

           22         Q.  All right.  Now, with the manually propelled 

           23    elevating aerial platforms that are down in Class 2, I 

           24    think what you told us is that those will have arms that 

           25    will come out to secure it while you're doing some work, 








                                                                          


            1    correct?

            2         A.  You can.

            3         Q.  And those arms can come back in, and you can 

            4    also move them while the person is elevated, correct?

            5         A.  Well, I think, with permission, there's a lot 

            6    of things you -- the -- the operator can do.  

            7    Essentially, they put -- they put controls at the base 

            8    and they also put them up in the aerial device.  But 

            9    what has to happen is a person in the -- you get -- this 

           10    whole certification thing is really important because 

           11    you get the understanding that the person -- it's kind 

           12    of like driving a ship or an airplane.  There's always a 

           13    pilot in command, and the person in the bucket is the 

           14    person who can tell you who can operate the equipment.  

           15    So that person is -- is the commander of the machine.

           16         Q.  Okay.  But under the right circumstances, that 

           17    commander in the bucket can tell the person down below, 

           18    even with a type 2, bring up those arm extensions and 

           19    move me 8 feet over because I want to access something 

           20    over here, correct?  

           21         A.  Or even 6 inches or three, depending on -- 

           22         Q.  Whatever it might be.  

           23         A.  Right.

           24         Q.  But they're mobile, correct?

           25         A.  Correct.








                                                                          


            1         Q.  You agree that with respect to -- you agree 

            2    with this:  The instructions as it relates to the 

            3    screener at issue, there is to be absolutely no raising 

            4    or lowering of that platform until the machine is locked 

            5    out, correct?

            6         A.  That's very unclear.

            7         Q.  Isn't the first step lock it out?

            8         A.  Well, the first step is lock it out.  The 

            9    second step is run the engine and raise it so -- I'm 

           10    sorry.  It's so confusing. 

           11         Q.  Well -- but -- 

           12         A.  My point is, you know, if you want to write 

           13    those instructions, you need to because people don't 

           14    really understand how to run that machine.

           15         Q.  Well, does locking it out stop you from raising 

           16    and lowering --

           17         A.  Absolutely.  It locks out all power and you 

           18    actually have to -- when I lock out a piece of equipment 

           19    to do an inspection, I don't want anything.  I don't 

           20    want air pressure.  I don't want -- even though I'm 

           21    mechanical, I don't want electrical press- -- power.  I 

           22    don't want anything.  When I want lockout-tagout, you 

           23    can't do a thing to that machine.  It's down and dead.  

           24    That's what it means.

           25         Q.  Okay.  I just want to make sure we have it.  








                                                                          


            1    Page 136, you referenced a training video for the 

            2    screener.  That was definitely produced in the Dropbox?  

            3         A.  I believe it was, yes.

            4         Q.  Yes?

            5         A.  Yes.

            6         Q.  Okay.  All right.

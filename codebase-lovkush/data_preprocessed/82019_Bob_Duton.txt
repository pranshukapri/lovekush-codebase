           15    BY MR. NOCHO:

           16          Q.       Good morning.  My name is Kyle

           17    Nocho.  I represent the plaintiff in this case,

           18    the Estate of Taj'anae Siler.  Today I'm just

           19    going to ask you some questions about your job

           20    at Catholic Community Services, and then also

           21    some of the work that you did on Ms. Siler's

           22    case.  Okay?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       Have you ever been to a

           25    deposition before?

                                                               6



            1          A.       If I did, it was years.  It had

            2    to be 30, 40 years ago.  It was related to a

            3    car accident.  That's it.

            4          Q.       Okay.  I just want to give you

            5    some instructions so we're on the same page --

            6          A.       Sure.

            7          Q.       -- of how everything goes today.

            8    I'm going to ask you questions.  I would ask

            9    that you try to wait until I finish the

           10    question until you respond.  That way, the

           11    court reporter here can take down everything

           12    being said.  Otherwise, it may be tough to

           13    follow.

           14          A.       Uh-uh.

           15          Q.       Then another point also with the

           16    court reporter being here, if you want to say

           17    yes or no to a question, make sure you

           18    verbalize yes or no because I understand what

           19    you're saying today when you say uh-uh or

           20    uh-uh, but it's not captured on the transcript.

           21    Okay?

           22          A.       Uh-uh.

           23          Q.       You mean yes?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       And if at any time you want to

                                                               7



            1    take a break, use the restroom, just let me

            2    know and we can pause the deposition.  Okay?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       Okay.  Are you on any

            5    medications today affecting your ability to

            6    testify?

            7          A.       No.

            8          Q.       And also as part of the

            9    instructions, if there is any questions that

           10    you don't know, I would prefer that you answer

           11    saying that you don't know or if you are

           12    estimating that you say that you're estimating

           13    just so we're on the same page understanding,

           14    you know, your response to the question.  Okay?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       Okay.  Could you state your full

           17    name.

           18          A.       Robert Lee Dutton.

           20    employer?

           22          Q.       What is your current job title?

           25    court before?

            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       Under what circumstances were

            3    you testifying in a court?

            4          A.       Dependency Court for our

            5    clients.

            6          Q.       And when you say our clients,

            7    you mean your clients at Catholic Community

            8    Services?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       So that would be Dependency

           13          Q.       In preparation for today's

           19          Q.       These were e-mails that you sent

           20    as part of your job at Catholic Community

            1    Workers.

            2          Q.       You said you were no longer

            3    licensed.  Why are you no longer licensed?

            4          A.       I don't need it for my job.

            5          Q.       Did it expire, your license?

            6          A.       Yeah.  Probably -- I didn't

            7    renew it.  Probably, like, within a year plus.

            8    Whenever it ran out, I just didn't renew it.

            9          Q.       Did you it need for a previous

           13          Q.       Before you started working at

           14    Catholic Community Services, did you work any

           15    other human services or child welfare jobs?

           17          Q.       Which jobs?

           18          A.       I worked at Children's Aid

           19    Society when it was open.  I then went to

           20    Carson Valley School, Northern Homes for

           21    Children, Saint Francis, Saint Joseph's Homes

           22    For Children, and then finally at Catholic

           23    Community Services.

           24          Q.       Let's start at Saint Francis

           25    Home for Children.  What was your role there,

                                                               12



            1    your job responsibilities?

            2          A.       I had three positions there.  I

            3    started as the Director of Social Service.  I

            4    then became the Assistant Executive Director,

            5    which I did for many years, and then my last

            6    two years there were as the Executive Director.

            7          Q.       What was your role as the

            8    Executive Director?

            9          A.       I was the administrator for the

           10    program.

           11          Q.       What type of program was Saint

           12    Francis?

           13          A.       It's a residential group home

           14    program for adolescent males.

           15          Q.       How would the children end up at

           16    the facility, at the home?  Would they be

           17    contracted through DHS, for example, or

           18    something like that?

           19          A.       There were two primary sources.

           20    One would be a contractor with DHS, and the

           21    other was when we had an RTF Program.  It would

           22    have been referrals from CBH, Community

           23    Behavorial Health.

           24          Q.       Were you involved in the

           25    management of the RTF Program?

                                                               13



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       When you were the Assistant

            3    Executive Director, was your role any different

            4    from when you were the Executive Director?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       How did it differ?

            7          A.       Well, I mean, there's a

            8    difference in the authority of the position.

            9    One was the administrator and the other one was

           10    the assistant.

           11          Q.       Could you give some examples of

           12    some different responsibilities that you had as

           13    the Executive Director versus the Assistant

           14    Executive Director?

           15          A.       As the administrator, you're

           16    responsible for the overall operation of the

           17    agency so that all the departments would report

           18    to me.  When I was the assistant, I focused

           19    more on working with the social service

           20    clinical components of the program.  For

           21    example, I wouldn't have been involved with

           22    personnel decisions across the board as I would

           23    as the Executive Director as an example.

           24          Q.       Were there multiple Assistant

           25    Executive Directors?

                                                               14



            1          A.       No.  There was just myself.

            2          Q.       Then what were some of your

            3    responsibilities as the Director of Social

            4    Services?

            5          A.       Well, that was a long time ago.

            6    Basically, to supervise the social service, the

            7    social workers that were working with the boys

            8    and their families.  It was more focused on the

            9    social service piece of it.

           10          Q.       Were the social workers people

           11    that worked in the home or would they make

           12    visits to families?

           13          A.       All of the above.  They were

           14    assigned to the boys in the home and worked

           15    with the families, be the liaison with DHS, or

           16    at that time that was just DHS.

           17          Q.       Would it have been DPW at that

           18    time, Department of Public Welfare?

           19          A.       Wow.  I don't know when it

           20    changed, but it could have been.

           21          Q.       Okay.

           22          A.       I don't know when that changed.

           23          Q.       That's fine.  What were some of

           24    your job titles when you worked at Northern

           25    Homes for Children?

                                                               15



            1          A.       I was the Director of Social

            2    Service.

            3          Q.       Was it a similar role as when

            4    you were Director of Social Service at Saint

            5    Francis?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       About how long did you serve in

            8    that position?

            9          A.       Northern Homes was less than two

           10    years.  Maybe a year and a half.

           11          Q.       About how long did you work at

           12    Saint Francis total in time?

           13          A.       Little over 30 years.

           14          Q.       Why did you decide to leave

           15    Northern Homes to go to Saint Francis?

           16          A.       I thought it was -- it had the

           17    potential for better upward mobility.

           18          Q.       There wasn't as much opportunity

           19    for advancement at Northern Homes?

           20          A.       Correct.

           21          Q.       Then before Northern Homes you

           22    mentioned working at Carson Valley School?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       What was your job title when you

           25    were at Carson Valley School?

                                                               16



            1          A.       Basically, I was a supervisor of

            2    the diagnostic programs.  Carson Valley is a

            3    residential program and two of the units were

            4    diagnostic programs.  So I was responsible for

            5    that.  I did both the residential and the

            6    social service components, oversaw the

            7    residential and social service components of

            8    that program.

            9          Q.       What is a diagnostic program?

           10          A.       At that time, children would

           11    come to us through the contract with DHS.  It

           12    wasn't clear whether or not they needed to be

           13    in -- it was to do a workup on the children and

           14    then make recommendations back to DHS.

           15          Q.       So would that workup involve,

           16    like, a clinical evaluation?

           17          A.       Yes.  Psychiatric,

           18    psychological, social service assessment of the

           19    family, their progress in therapy, how they

           20    were doing in the program residentially.  Sort

           21    of a comprehensive report.

           22          Q.       About how long were you working

           23    at Carson Valley?

           24          A.       About six and a half years.

           25          Q.       You also mentioned previously

                                                               17



            1    working at Children's Aid; is that correct?

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       What type of job did you have at

            4    Children's Aid?

            5          A.       I was a social worker,

            6    residential social worker.

            7          Q.       Was Children's Aid a residential

            8    program?

            9          A.       Yes, it was.  Well, the program

           10    I was in was residential.  It was a large

           11    foster care program with a residential

           12    component.

           13          Q.       So would it have workers going

           14    out to place children in foster homes, for

           15    example, and then also have a residential

           16    program where children could live?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       As a social worker, did you do

           19    home visits?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       What were you -- what was, like,

           22    the purpose of the home visit?

           23          A.       Well, you assess the families

           24    just in terms of the family dynamics.  You

           25    would want to know whether or not the family

                                                               18



            1    would provide, like, a safe visitation resource

            2    so that if the children needed visits, they

            3    could visit.  Also, to be part of making a

            4    recommendation as to whether or not the child

            5    could be reunified with the family.

            6          Q.       Did you also evaluate the child

            7    or family for any services that they needed?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       When you started working at

           10    Catholic Community Services, did you work as a

           11    supervisor?

           12          A.       Yes.  I was hired as a

           13    supervisor.

           14          Q.       About when did you start working

           15    at Catholic Community Services?

           16          A.       I think it was June 21, 2014.

           17          Q.       Who did you report to at that

           18    time as, like, a supervisor?

           19          A.       Alan Speed.

           20          Q.       Has your supervisor changed over

           21    time?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       Have you had -- who are some of

           24    the other supervisors?

           25          A.       Just one other, Margaret

                                                               19



            1    Andrews.

            2          Q.       About when did your supervisor

            3    change to Margaret Andrews?

            4          A.       I don't -- end of 2016, maybe

            5    beginning of 2017.  I don't know for sure.

            6          Q.       So Mr. Speed and Ms. Andrews,

            7    were they Case Management Directors?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       What are some of the job

           10    responsibilities of a Case Management Director?

           11          A.       They are responsible for

           12    supervising the work of their units.  So at our

           13    agency we have two sites.  They each are

           14    responsible for one of the sites.  As far as

           15    case manage -- so their job is Case Management.

           16    So there are other people in the organization,

           17    but under the chain of Case Management, it's

           18    the Case Management Director and the four or

           19    five Case Management Supervisors that they are

           20    responsible for.  Then on each team, there are

           21    four or five case managers and support staff.

           22    So they are responsible for that operation.

           23          Q.       You mentioned there being two

           24    different sites?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               20



            1          Q.       Where are the sites located?

            2          A.       The site that I'm at is on

            3    Verree Road.  Do you need the address?

            4          Q.       If you know it.

            5          A.       10125 Verree Road.  Then the

            6    other is CORA Services, and I don't know that

            7    address.  It's three miles down the road.

            8          Q.       So both sites, they both have

            9    workers providing case management services?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       And that would include Community

           12    Umbrella Agency Services, so CUA Services?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14          Q.       Are you currently still a

           15    supervisor?

           16          A.       Yes.

           17          Q.       Okay.  About how many Case

           18    Managers do you currently supervise?

           19          A.       Five.

           20          Q.       Has that number changed over

           21    time?

           22          A.       I think briefly I might have had

           23    four, but no.  It's been five.  Occasionally,

           24    it was six, but generally I would say over the

           25    time, five.

                                                               21



            1          Q.       And then you mentioned each Case

            2    Manager would have a certain number of cases;

            3    is that correct?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       About how many cases would the

            6    Case Manager have?

            7          A.       Well, right now on my team it's

            8    about ten per worker.  It's varied over time.

            9    I mean, it's improved.

           10          Q.       When you say improved, what do

           11    you mean?

           12          A.       I mean that when -- well, the

           13    CUA started about a little after before I got

           14    there.  So it's a brand new agency.  So, you

           15    know, we would have case loads -- my workers

           16    might have 13, 14, 15, 16 cases, but that --

           17    the agency, DHS, everyone has worked to reduce

           18    that caseload to what seems a fairly manageable

           19    number at this point.

           20          Q.       And each case, that could have

           21    multiple children?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       So the case is really, like, the

           24    family?

           25          A.       It's by the family, yes.

                                                               22



            1          Q.       While Mr. Alan Speed was your

            2    Direct Supervisor, I guess, in the year 2016,

            3    who are some of the Case Managers that reported

            4    to you?

            5          A.       Wow.  Well, I know Eileen Gork

            6    was one.  You want their names?

            7          Q.       If you know it.  You can say you

            8    don't know if you don't know.

            9          A.       I think Ruth Hennessy was one,

           10    might have been.  I would have to look because

           11    there has been a number of them.  I don't know

           12    when my worker Walt Burwell came back.  I'm not

           13    sure.  He joined my team.

           14          Q.       Is there a lot of turnover in

           15    that position, the Case Management position?

           16          A.       I don't know how to define a

           17    lot.  Social work has changed, you know,

           18    positions change in social work.  I haven't

           19    felt that my team had excessive turnover.

           20          Q.       Do Case Managers typically stay

           21    on a job for more than one year, more than two

           22    years?

           23          A.       Probably on average would be,

           24    like, two to three years, on average.

           25    Although, my one worker Eileen is in her --

                                                               23



            1    she's starting her sixth year.  I had a staff

            2    member that just left, and she wasn't always on

            3    my team, but she worked for us for five years.

            4    There is some good longevity with some staff.

            5          Q.       Did you ever have a Case Manager

            6    you mentioned before, Selara Harris, on your

            7    team?

            8          A.       No.

            9          Q.       What is the Case Manager

           10    Supervisor's role in providing the CUA

           11    Services?

           12          A.       The supervisor's role?

           13          Q.       Yeah.

           14          A.       Well, you're responsible for

           15    overseeing how the case is progressing.  We

           16    have our focus which is on, you know, safety

           17    and permanency and the child's wellbeing.

           18    Those are the core values.  Our work is focused

           19    on supporting that.  I mean, your responsible

           20    to manage them in terms of their personnel, in

           21    terms of their job, how they are doing on their

           22    job, evaluating that.

           23          Q.       When you say them, who do you

           24    mean?

           25          A.       I mean Case Managers.  There is

                                                               24



            1    also support staff so that there would be -- on

            2    our team, we'll have an outcome specialists, we

            3    have a Case Aide.  Sometimes we have aftercare

            4    workers.  Those are all support staff.  Their

            5    role is to support the Case Managers.  In a

            6    way, everything supports the Case Managers.  We

            7    have to look at quality.  We have to look at

            8    compliance.  All of those issues that go in

            9    terms of Case Management.

           10          Q.       And when you say compliance,

           11    compliance with what?

           12          A.       Compliance with the agency's and

           13    DHS's expectations of what needs to be done for

           14    good practice, meeting the timelines for some

           15    of the documentation that needs to be done on a

           16    case, the quality of the work that's being

           17    done, making sure you keep an eye, you're

           18    overseeing these cases.

           19          Q.       Would that be following the CUA

           20    Practice Guidelines?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       You mentioned an Outcome

           23    Specialist.  What role does the Outcome

           24    Specialist play?

           25          A.       It's a support role.  They do

                                                               25



            1    things that are in support to the Case Manager.

            2    They may supervise a visit.  They may be get

            3    documents.  They may take things to the

            4    parents.  They may provide transportation for

            5    children or families.  They put documents into

            6    records.  Things that, you know, just tasks

            7    that will support and help Case Management.

            8          Q.       And we say supervised visits, do

            9    you mean visits between the children and the

           10    parent?

           11          A.       Parent and child, yes.

           12          Q.       Would they accompany the Case

           13    Manager on home visits or placement visits?

           14          A.       They could, but it's not a main

           15    part of their job.  If two staff were needed,

           16    sure they would, yes.

           17          Q.       What are some examples of when

           18    two staff would be needed?

           19          A.       If you were trying to transport

           20    a child or multiple children or if a child was

           21    demonstrating behavorial problems.  If there

           22    was a support person that could speak different

           23    languages, you might do that for

           24    interpretation, those kinds of things.  But

           25    it's not a main part of the -- accompanying the

                                                               26



            1    Case Manager is not a major part of the job.

            2          Q.       You also mentioned aftercare

            3    staff.  What does aftercare staff --

            4          A.       Aftercare is a voluntary service

            5    that felt it would be, instead of just closing

            6    the case, that you could offer service, you

            7    know, just sort of follow-up services.  So you

            8    ask a family when their case is ready to be

            9    closed whether or not they would like to have a

           10    staff touch base with them, check in with them,

           11    follow up to make sure things are going okay

           12    with school, is there any problem with therapy,

           13    whatever the focus of the case was.  If they

           14    say they would like those services, then we

           15    would visit them on a prescribed basis,

           16    whatever was agreed upon, and it's a voluntary

           17    service for the families and children.

           18          Q.       Would the Case Aide have a

           19    similar role as the Outcome Specialist?

           20          A.       Yes.  We talk about it a lot.  A

           21    lot of it overlaps.  There are certain other

           22    sort of distinct things that they do.  For

           23    example, an Outcome Specialist doesn't request

           24    the birth certificates or the social security

           25    cards.  So things like that that are just for

                                                               27



            1    the Case Aide to do.  But in many other areas

            2    there are overlaps.  They put records in the

            3    files, they can go out and supervise visits.

            4    They can do a number of similar things to the

            5    Outcome Specialist.

            6          Q.       Do you remember working with any

            7    of these support staffs on Taj'anae Siler's

            8    case?

            9          A.       I did not.

           10          Q.       As a supervisor, did you have

           11    regular meetings with your Case Managers or do

           12    you have regular meetings with your Case

           13    Managers?

           14          A.       Well, I meet with them

           15    individually and then we have some team -- we

           16    also meet for team meetings.

           17          Q.       What's the difference between an

           18    individual meeting and team meetings in terms

           19    of what's discussed?

           20          A.       The individual meetings would be

           21    much more focused on the case, on the

           22    individualized cases.  That's where you would

           23    really work with the Case Managers on their

           24    cases.  A team meeting is going to be more

           25    general.  It will get at policies and

                                                               28



            1    procedures.  It's going to get at team work

            2    issues or scheduling issues, general practice

            3    issues, those kinds of things.  We really

            4    wouldn't be doing individual look at cases in a

            5    group.

            6          Q.       When you do an individual look

            7    at cases, what are you looking for as the

            8    supervisor?

            9          A.       Well, I'm looking for the

           10    quality of the work.  I want to see that they

           11    are doing the work that they are supposed to be

           12    doing.  I'm looking at the relationship they

           13    have with the family.  I'm looking at

           14    compliance, you know.  Have they seen the

           15    child, have they assessed for safety, do they

           16    know the services that the child is involved

           17    with and are they following up, did they get

           18    their assessments done in the prescribed

           19    timeframes?  All of those things go in to --

           20          Q.       And then I'm guessing you would

           21    make recommendations based on where they were

           22    meeting those guidelines or not meeting those

           23    guidelines?

           24          A.       Yeah.  We would talk about the

           25    direction moving forward.  These are the things

                                                               29



            1    that need to get done, this is the direction

            2    that we're going.  You're always -- I mean, as

            3    I said in the beginning, you're always looking

            4    at the safety issues, is this child safe?

            5    You're always looking at where we are going in

            6    terms of permanency because you're dealing with

            7    the law.  The law says that the child needs a

            8    permanent -- there needs to be movement towards

            9    permanency.  So we're working on permanency all

           10    the time.  So depending on the case, where are

           11    we in terms of establishing some kind of

           12    permanent situation for that child.

           13          Q.       And as a supervisor, to make

           14    that determination about permanency, what are

           15    you relying on?  Documents, conversations?

           16          A.       Yeah.  I mean, you're relying on

           17    the conversation, you're relying on the, say,

           18    the family's compliance with things.  You have

           19    court oversight so that you've got the tools.

           20    The tools of the work have to do with the court

           21    and what the court is asking, say, of the

           22    family and of the CUA or of anybody that's

           23    working towards the permanency for this case.

           24    Plus, you also have a Single Case Plan.  That's

           25    to be developed for each family, and it's

                                                               30



            1    generally every six months that you have that

            2    plan.  That's supposed to be for everybody to

            3    be on the same page as to where this case is

            4    moving forward.

            5          Q.       So the Single Case Plan would

            6    have the goals for the family?

            7          A.       Yeah.  The goals, objectives to

            8    work on, yes, and the child if they are over

            9    14.

           10          Q.       So the child, parents or

           11    caretakers of the --

           12          A.       They are invited to this

           13    meeting, yes.

           14          Q.       So there is a meeting to develop

           15    this Single Case Plan?

           16          A.       Yes.

           17          Q.       And you said that's updated

           18    every six months, is that what you said?

           19          A.       Yes.  Back in 2016, we were

           20    having those conferences every three months.

           21    That's changed to every six months.  The

           22    expectation is that the Single Case Plan had to

           23    be done every six months.  It could be done at

           24    that three month time if there was a

           25    significant change, but generally it would be

                                                               31



            1    every six months.

            2          Q.       How soon after a case was

            3    assigned to the CUA would a Single Case Plan be

            4    developed?

            5          A.       It doesn't happen -- it was a

            6    little slow at times as we were trying to

            7    figure it out.  The permanency teaming meetings

            8    are run by DHS so they schedule them.  In

            9    general, I would say within three to four weeks

           10    it would happen, plus or minus.

           11          Q.       When you say it, do you mean the

           12    teaming meeting or the plan?

           13          A.       The teaming meeting to develop

           14    the goals and objectives for the plan.  Then

           15    the Case Manager and the Case Management

           16    Supervisor have ten days to put that into

           17    writing for the Single Case Plan.

           18          Q.       So within a month of receiving

           19    the case, usually there would be a Single Case

           20    Plan?

           21          A.       In general.

           22          Q.       Was this set by any requirements

           23    by DHS or the agency's policies?

           24          A.       My understanding is that they're

           25    supposed to have it within about three weeks.

                                                               32



            1    In practice, it is when it is and then we have

            2    ten days, CUA has ten days, to get it in place.

            3          Q.       So would it affect your ability

            4    to provide CUA Services if you didn't have the

            5    Single Case Plan?

            6          A.       Not really.  You develop a

            7    tentative plan the day you get the case.  In

            8    terms of reading the case, you would want to

            9    know what you think is going on.  You're

           10    already getting information in the referral

           11    that comes through DHS.  They are in a way

           12    prescribing some things that look like we're

           13    going to move forward with, and then we're

           14    making contact with the child, we're trying to

           15    make contact with the parent.  So you're

           16    already gathering information that you're

           17    really going to bring to the Single Case Plan

           18    teaming meeting.  You're already working the

           19    case.

           20          Q.       And when you say you, do you

           21    mean the Case Manager?

           22          A.       Yeah.  Under direction of the

           23    Case Manager and supervisor.

           24          Q.       Just to go back a second.  You

           25    talked about individual and team meetings with

                                                               33



            1    the Case Managers; is that right?

            2          A.       In terms of the teaming

            3    meetings?

            4          Q.       Correct.  Oh, no, no.  Just

            5    supervision meetings.

            6          A.       Oh, supervision.  Yes.

            7          Q.       About how often would you have

            8    the individual supervision meetings?

            9          A.       You try to do it weekly.  You

           10    probably average, you know -- I don't mean

           11    weekly.  You try to do it a little bit more

           12    often, but it's probably monthly.

           13          Q.       The group meetings with the Case

           14    Managers, about how often would they happen?

           15          A.       The agency would like them to

           16    happen every month.  My team, we average

           17    probably every other month.  It's very

           18    difficult.  Our staff are all over in the

           19    field.

           20          Q.       You mentioned talking about

           21    different, like, policies or practice pointers

           22    in those meetings.  What is an example of one

           23    of those?

           24          A.       Say there is a new guideline

           25    that comes down from DHS, we would review that.

                                                               34



            1    If there is an internal policy change with

            2    Catholic Community Services, we would look at

            3    that.  We are tracked by DHS.  So there is what

            4    they call a scorecard.  We're always looking at

            5    scorecard issues because that's sort of a

            6    barometer of how we're doing.

            7                   If we get a high score, that's a

            8    way to say thank you to the staff.  If we get a

            9    lower score, it's, like, all right, how are we

           10    going to address this and how are you thinking

           11    about this?  How can we do this as a team, how

           12    do we correct something along?

           13          Q.       So the scorecard is developed by

           14    DHS?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       Does the scorecard measure

           17    compliance with DHS requirements?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       Is it, like, an A to F scale?

           20          A.       It's a 0, 1, or 2 scale.

           21          Q.       What does one represent on the

           22    scale?

           23          A.       Partial compliance.

           24          Q.       So I guess --

           25          A.       For example, Single Case Plan is

                                                               35



            1    developed, one point.  Single Case Plan is done

            2    within the ten day timeframe, two points.

            3    Single Case Plan isn't done within the ten day

            4    timeframe, then you're going to get a one.  If

            5    there is no Single Case Plan, zero.

            6          Q.       So the different areas of where

            7    the CUA is graded is on this scorecard?

            8          A.       Many areas, yes.

            9          Q.       You talked about the Single Case

           10    Plan has one type of document that you would

           11    review as a Case Manager.  Are there any other

           12    types of documents the Case Managers would

           13    create that you would review as a supervisor?

           14          A.       Yeah.  Many documents.  You have

           15    the Single Case Plan, every note that they

           16    enter in -- it's an electronic record -- every

           17    note that they enter into the record has to be

           18    reviewed and approved by the Case Management

           19    Supervisor.  Their assessments, there is a risk

           20    assessment, safety assessment.  There is a

           21    FAST.  There is a CANS.  There are four main

           22    assessment tools that have to be reviewed.

           23                   If there is a safety plan that's

           24    needed, that also has to be signed off by the

           25    Case Management Supervisor.  There is a number

                                                               36



            1    of referable actions that we take that have to

            2    be -- that can't move forward without approval

            3    by the Case Management Supervisor.  It could be

            4    prevention services for a placement.  All of

            5    those referrals need Case Management Supervisor

            6    approval.

            7          Q.       And all these documents, you

            8    said they were electronic?

            9          A.       No.  The Single Case Plan, the

           10    structure progress notes, which are the notes

           11    that the workers put in about their contacts

           12    with any client or if they get collateral

           13    information, like, an e-mail or something

           14    that's relevant to the case, they are going to

           15    put that in there.  The risk assessment, the

           16    safety assessment, they are all -- CANS and the

           17    FAST, they are all documents that are in there.

           18                   The CUA provider referral is in

           19    there, referrals for prevention services.

           20    There are some referables for, like, in

           21    adoption cases.  The SWAN Referral is a paper.

           22    It's a paper referral that a case management

           23    supervisor signs off on and then is forwarded.

           24    Then that gets uploaded as a document into the

           25    file.  But some of them are, you know, the

                                                               37



            1    forms.  The only way you can address the forms

            2    is on the electronic record.  For example, if a

            3    worker goes out and sees a child in a foster

            4    home, they come back and they have to write a

            5    note about that contact.  It's a structured

            6    note.  It's the same note for every entry.

            7    They finish that off and then it sits in a

            8    queue for me or for the Case Management

            9    Supervisor to approve.  It sits there until a

           10    Case Management Supervisor approves it and puts

           11    it into the record.

           12          Q.       When the Case Managers do these

           13    visits, they also have to complete notes for

           14    seeing children in a placement facility?

           15          A.       Yes, they do.

           16          Q.       So you mentioned foster homes,

           17    placement facilities, I guess, also if they

           18    went to the parent's home to visit the child?

           19          A.       Yes.  For in-home cases, yes.

           20          Q.       About how long after they make

           21    the visit do they need to complete the note?

           22          A.       Well, they say within six days.

           23    Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.

           24          Q.       What affects whether it happens

           25    or it does not happen?

                                                               38



            1          A.       The workers dedication to the

            2    job.  Their organization, their schedule, what

            3    interferes with getting it done, a variety of

            4    things.

            5          Q.       Did you ever review any

            6    documents or notes created by Selara Harris

            7    when she was working with the agency?

            8          A.       No.

            9          Q.       These documents clear on the

           10    case, they are typically uploaded to the

           11    Electronic Case Management System?

           12          A.       Yeah.  I mean, like, some of the

           13    documents are in the system and when you

           14    approve them they're approved within the

           15    system.

           16          Q.       Would you as a supervisor make

           17    home visits or placement visits?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       When would you make those kinds

           20    of visits?

           21          A.       I would do it to -- if I had a

           22    worker that was out and I needed to cover.  So

           23    someone calls up sick and they had an

           24    appointment and it needed to be done, you would

           25    go into a situation like that.  You would go

                                                               39



            1    when a worker said, I'm having a difficult time

            2    with this family.  I want another person with

            3    me when I go.  Very occasionally, it would be

            4    for, like, a safety concern if someone was

            5    concerned.  It might be that it's a complicated

            6    case or sensitive issue that needs to addressed

            7    with the family and they want some additional

            8    support.  You know, if as an agency we felt

            9    like we needed an extra pair of eyes on a

           10    family situation, we would do that.  It's not a

           11    regular part of the job, but it certainly can

           12    happen.  Sometimes it's just to meet the

           13    families.

           14          Q.       Did you ever complete any home

           15    or placement visits on Taj'anae Siler's case?

           16          A.       No.

           17          Q.       Do you ever attend Dependency

           18    Court for the case children as a supervisor?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       What would your role be in

           21    attending court as a supervisor?

           22          A.       Well, it could be various.  One

           23    would be to cover the case.  If I had a worker

           24    that's out or if, say, a worker changed, if I

           25    had been working a case with a worker for over

                                                               40



            1    a year and then that person resigned and took

            2    another job and then I have a brand new Case

            3    Manager who has only been on that case for a

            4    month, I would go to court and I would testify.

            5    I would go out to see that family and the child

            6    or that child because that's the safety -- I

            7    would see the child so I could testify to

            8    safety.

            9                   Then I would go and present the

           10    case for our agency in court.  I would go to

           11    support, like, a new staff person that's just

           12    learning the ropes in court.  We're going to

           13    prep for court.  Then I'm going to go with him

           14    or her to support them in court.  My role in

           15    that situation could be to supplement what the

           16    Case Manager is saying because I have

           17    continuity with the case.

           18          Q.       Were you ever ordered by the

           19    court to appear as a supervisor along with the

           20    Case Manager in a case?

           21          A.       Yes.  Once.

           22          Q.       What was the circumstances of

           23    that instance?

           24          A.       Well, the judge didn't like an

           25    answer that the Case Manager gave.  He felt

                                                               41



            1    like she didn't know the answer and was upset.

            2    He asked that I attend the next hearing.  I

            3    attended the next hearing and nothing about it

            4    came up.

            5          Q.       Did you ever attend any court

            6    hearings for Taj'anae Siler's case?

            7          A.       No.

            8          Q.       Before you mentioned having two

            9    different Case Management Directors that you

           10    reported to.  Would you similarly kind of

           11    regularly meet with them like you had with your

           12    Case Managers?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14          Q.       How often would you meet with

           15    their Case Manager Directors?

           16          A.       Once a month.  Like, for a

           17    formal meeting.  I would talk to them all the

           18    time, but for a formal meeting, once a month.

           19          Q.       What would you discuss at those

           20    formal meetings?

           21          A.       Personnel.  You know, what's

           22    going on with the staff on the team, any issues

           23    that I might have, how they are doing

           24    positively and negatively.  You would talk

           25    about anything that's new related to policies

                                                               42



            1    and procedures, and you would, depending on

            2    what we're -- so there could be problematic

            3    cases that needed to be reviewed.  Although,

            4    often times those get reviewed in between.

            5    Those situations don't wait.  Often it's to

            6    really focus, give you time to sit back and

            7    think on, like, the permanency issue.  Like,

            8    which cases are headed towards adoption, which

            9    cases are working to be reunified with their

           10    families, are there systemic things that are

           11    going on here that we need to address to move

           12    this process along.

           13          Q.       Would you create any notes based

           14    on that meeting or would the Case Manager

           15    Director make any notes based on that meeting?

           16          A.       Alan Speed would create notes

           17    sometimes.  I would keep handwritten notes for

           18    myself, but there is no documentation.  There

           19    is no formal documentation process for those

           20    meetings.

           21          Q.       Is there a formal documentation

           22    process for the supervisor and Case Manager

           23    meetings?

           24          A.       Yes.  Because in the electronic

           25    record, each case has to be discussed with the

                                                               43



            1    worker monthly so that there is a supervisory

            2    note in the electronic record monthly about the

            3    case.

            4          Q.       But there isn't something

            5    similar for the supervisor director meetings?

            6          A.       No.

            7          Q.       Do you ever recall discussing

            8    Taj'anae Siler's case with either Mr. Speed or

            9    Ms. Andrews?

           10          A.       I did not, no.

           11          Q.       I'm referring to those regular

           12    meetings.

           13          A.       No.

           14          Q.       Did you ever have an individual

           15    meeting with Selara Harris about Ms. Siler's

           16    case, a supervision meeting?

           17          A.       No.

           18          Q.       How did you first start working

           19    on Taj'anae Siler's case?

           20          A.       I think I touched that case

           21    twice.  The first time I got a call from -- I

           22    never quite know his role, but, like, a person

           23    that would sort of problem solve for DHS and

           24    CBH.  I got a call one day just from him

           25    because when I was at Saint Francis and we had

                                                               44



            1    a lot of dealings with CBH.  This is an

            2    employee for that system that has been around a

            3    long time, knows me, and knew I was at Catholic

            4    Community Services.  He called me because he

            5    wanted to know, like, who was the contact at

            6    our agency for the case.  I think there was a

            7    situation.  You know, they were trying to deal

            8    with her situation.

            9          Q.       When you say her, who do you

           10    mean?

           11          A.       Taj'anae.  They were trying to

           12    work on that case.  I mean, that's how I got

           13    involved with that case.  My role in that was,

           14    I'm just an alternate supervisor at that time.

           15    The supervisor and the worker were not in the

           16    agency.  I fielded that call.  I don't recall

           17    exactly what I did, but what I would have done

           18    was inform them who the supervisor is, who the

           19    worker is, what the status is about those

           20    things so that the system knew, you know, they

           21    were reaching out to our agency to get some

           22    contact.  I would pass that information on to

           23    him.

           24          Q.       Do you recall the name of the

           25    person at CBH?

                                                               45



            1          A.       Yeah.  Tom Zechiel.

            2          Q.       Would it be Tim?

            3          A.       Tim.  Thank you.

            4          Q.       You said you previously dealt

            5    with him through your work at Saint Francis?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       Was this your work for the RTF

            8    Program?

            9          A.       Generally would have been in

           10    RTF, yes.

           11          Q.       How was Mr. Zechiel involved in

           12    the RTF Program?

           13          A.       I think he was just a problem

           14    solver.  If there was something going on that

           15    was creating some difficulty, he was a problem

           16    solver.

           17          Q.       What are some examples of

           18    problems that would arise with the RTF that CBH

           19    would get involved?

           20          A.       They could be any number of

           21    things.  One could be clarity about where we

           22    are with evaluations, what somebody is

           23    recommending, what's happening with the

           24    authorization process because services with CBH

           25    have to be prior authorized.  Sometimes

                                                               46



            1    negotiating those issues, like, where is it in

            2    the system.  He could problem solve those

            3    things.  Sometimes you have to have somebody

            4    outside the system to dig in a little bit to

            5    find out, like, what's going on procedurally.

            6          Q.       What's involved in the

            7    authorization process that you mentioned?

            8          A.       For RTF?

            9          Q.       Yes.

           10          A.       Well, RTF is a specialized

           11    program and it requires medical necessity.  So

           12    for a young person to receive RTF Services,

           13    there has to be a psychiatric evaluation

           14    indicating the medical necessity for RTF

           15    Services.  That means that a psychiatrist has

           16    to be located, assessment has to take place,

           17    the documentation has to be written, and if it

           18    recommends medical necessity for RTF Services,

           19    then that's the document that then has to go to

           20    CBH.  CBH then has to approve that.

           21                   I believe the CBH process is

           22    that two doctors have to approve it.

           23    Basically, you're going to have the referring

           24    doctor and the medical director looking at that

           25    and making a decision as to whether or not RTF

                                                               47



            1    Services are going to be in place.

            2          Q.       When you say medical director,

            3    who employees this medical director?

            4          A.       CBH.

            5          Q.       What role did you play in the

            6    process as the Director at Saint Francis?

            7          A.       For RTF?

            8          Q.       Yeah.

            9          A.       Ensuring that the evaluations

           10    were done in the timeframes so that if you were

           11    looking for continued RTF Services, that the

           12    evaluation was done within the timeframes, the

           13    evaluation met the standards, and that medical

           14    necessity was indicated.  Then that document

           15    and all supporting paperwork would go to CBH.

           16          Q.       After medical necessity was

           17    found and CBH also approved, what would be the

           18    next step in the process?

           19          A.       CBH would locate an RTF

           20    placement.

           21          Q.       When you say RTF, would that be

           22    a Residential Treatment Facility?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       How would that facility differ

           25    from, for instance, the residential program you

                                                               48



            1    had under your supervision at Saint Francis?

            2          A.       Well, the easiest way is to say

            3    there is more support.  The support is more

            4    clinical support.  The therapist is going to --

            5    an example would be, in the residential program

            6    you might have an outpatient therapist, and the

            7    child would go to see the outpatient therapist.

            8    In an RTF Program, that therapist would meet

            9    with the child more than once.  Outpatient

           10    would be once a week.

           11                   In RTF, a child might see the

           12    therapist two to three times a week.  The

           13    therapist would be part of the team and go to

           14    the team meetings.  The therapist would have a

           15    relationship with the staff, a close

           16    relationship with the staff, so that there is a

           17    much more intense team work approach in RTF.

           18    It's designed to be therapeutic.  It's designed

           19    to support the child with the needs as

           20    identified by the psychiatric evaluation.

           21                   It was determined that they

           22    need, like, the clinical services.  They need

           23    the support of mill youth therapy that goes

           24    with an RTF.  The psychiatric oversight is more

           25    intense in terms of medication and regular

                                                               49



            1    contact with the psychiatrist.  For example, if

            2    it was in the residential program, the child

            3    might only see the psychiatrist every six

            4    months.  In a residential program, that child

            5    is going to see the psychiatrist every month.

            6    Those are examples.

            7          Q.       And then just to go back to the

            8    phone call that you mentioned from Mr. Zechiel,

            9    is it?

           10          A.       Zechiel.

           11          Q.       Other than trying to figure out

           12    the contact person at the agency for Ms. Siler,

           13    did you discuss anything else with him?

           14          A.       I don't recall except that I can

           15    imagine that he said that there was some issue

           16    that was being discussed.  You know, that

           17    someone, probably the Bridge, had called him

           18    with their concerns.

           19          Q.       Before this phone call, had you

           20    previously dealt with the Bridge on other

           21    cases?

           22          A.       Not while I was at the CUA.  I'm

           23    sure over the years I had dealings, but the

           24    Bridge program has changed over the years.  I

           25    had contact with the Bridge, but not recently.

                                                               50



            1    I mean, I have had contact since, but from when

            2    I started as a CUA Supervisor until this

            3    incident with the situation which Tim called

            4    me, I had no contact with the Bridge.

            5          Q.       You said the regular Case

            6    Manager and supervisor were not at the agency

            7    that day?

            8          A.       That's what I recall.

            9          Q.       Do you know if they were on

           10    vacation or were they just out of the office?

           11          A.       I don't know for sure.  I think

           12    somebody was on vacation and someone was out of

           13    the office, but I really don't know.

           14          Q.       So the regular Case Manager,

           15    that was Selara Harris?

           16          A.       Yes.

           17          Q.       And the regular supervisor, that

           18    was Theresa Hamlett?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       Did you ever have any

           21    discussions or phone calls with Theresa Hamlett

           22    about this contact with Mr. Zechiel?

           23          A.       I don't think so unless it was

           24    in passing, but, no.  I don't think so.  I

           25    think I sent an e-mail to update her.

                                                               51



            1          Q.       Did you have any conversations

            2    with your director, Alan Speed, about this

            3    contact?

            4          A.       I don't know.  I don't think so.

            5    I think my communication on this was e-mail.

            6          Q.       You mentioned touching the case

            7    at another instance as well.  What do you

            8    recall about that?

            9          A.       Well, what I recall about that

           10    was Theresa Hamlett came to me when the medical

           11    examiners office had called her when they had

           12    located Taj'anae or they figured out -- they

           13    had Taj'anae.  They just couldn't figure out

           14    what the connection was.  They made the

           15    connection to Theresa and she hadn't been in

           16    the position a long time.  I don't know how

           17    long she had been in the position.

           18                   She was also -- this was a

           19    totally new situation for her and she recently

           20    had a death, something in her family.

           21    Emotionally it was hard for her so she came to

           22    me and I helped her.  I supported her in terms

           23    of what needed to be done in that situation.  I

           24    just know that -- I mean, I knew what needed to

           25    be done in terms of notification.  I made sure

                                                               52



            1    that we notified our chain of command, the DHS

            2    chain of command, so that everybody was

            3    up-to-date.

            4                   I made sure that we were

            5    documenting everything that was happening,

            6    worked with her to setup the time for the

            7    medical examiners office to come talk to her so

            8    that there could be some identification

            9    confirmation.  Then it continued in terms of

           10    support.  We went to the family with the

           11    medical examiner out to the mom's house.  Then

           12    Theresa and I went to Taj'anae's funeral.

           13    That's the basic outline of what I did in that

           14    situation.

           15          Q.       Who was involved in the agency's

           16    chain of command that you mentioned?

           17          A.       That would have been Alan Speed

           18    and Theresa Thompson, our administrator, James

           19    Black, who is the CSS Administrator that

           20    oversees our program, and I'm sure I put James

           21    Amado on there.  He is head of -- I don't know

           22    his exact title, he's CSS.  He's over Jim

           23    Black.  He's the top person for us in terms of

           24    social services at Catholic Social Services.

           25          Q.       So Catholic Social Services

                                                               53



            1    oversees the work of Catholic Community

            2    Services.  Is that what you're saying?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       Who was involved in the DHS

            5    chain of command that you contacted?

            6          A.       I'm just going to -- probably

            7    Kim Ali.  I know for sure I would send it to

            8    her.  It could have been Stacey Boyd, possibly.

            9    I think Shapiro and maybe Figueroa.  I'd have

           10    to look at my e-mail to know, but those are the

           11    top people that would have -- some of those

           12    people I notified.  Probably most of them.

           13          Q.       Were you communicating with the

           14    DHS chain of command through e-mail or phone?

           15          A.       Yes, e-mail.  I can't recall if

           16    I called Kim Ali or not.  I've known her for a

           17    long time so I might of.  I probably did, but I

           18    really can't recall that.

           19          Q.       Then the agency's chain of

           20    command, was that mainly through e-mail or

           21    through phone as well?

           22          A.       I'm going to say e-mail.  I

           23    mean, I don't recall.  I'm sure I talked about

           24    it with Alan and Theresa, but I don't fully

           25    recall that.

                                                               54



            1          Q.       When you say talked, you mean,

            2    like, in person, e-mail, or by phone?

            3          A.       Well, I mean, I communicated by

            4    e-mail for sure.  I'm sure I talked -- I mean,

            5    I know how I would work.  I would talk to Alan.

            6    Theresa probably said something to me.

            7          Q.       What was your e-mail address

            8    during that time?

            9          A.       BDutton@CHS-adphila.org

           10          Q.       And that's your work e-mail?

           11          A.       Yes, it is.

           12          Q.       During the time you were

           13    responding to the death of Taj'anae Siler, did

           14    you speak with the medical examiner or anyone

           15    from the medical examiner's office?

           16          A.       Yes.  I don't know what his role

           17    -- just the staff member that was assigned to

           18    the case.  Maybe it's the investigator.  I

           19    guess that's what it would be.  The

           20    investigator came to the agency.  Theresa and I

           21    met with him as he showed -- I mean, I just

           22    went to support her.  He showed her pictures,

           23    which she -- and I think Selara was there and

           24    they confirmed that that was Taj'anae.

           25          Q.       Did you also see the pictures?

                                                               55



            1          A.       I didn't see the pictures.

            2          Q.       Did the staff member or someone

            3    else from the medical examiner's office tell

            4    you the cause of death?

            5          A.       I vaguely remember it was drug

            6    related.

            7          Q.       Do you remember hearing anything

            8    about it being related to any trauma, physical

            9    trauma?

           10          A.       No.

           11          Q.       Did either Theresa or Selara

           12    mention seeing any bruising or burning on

           13    Taj'anse's body?

           14          A.       I don't recall.

           15                   MR. NOCHO:  Let's take a brief

           16          five minute break.

           18                   (Whereupon, a brief recess was

           19          taken.)

           20                         - - -

           21    BY MR. NOCHO:

           22          Q.       Mr. Dutton, I just want to ask

           23    you some questions about some documents that we

           24    had received from your counsel.

           25          A.       Sure.

                                                               56



            1                   MR. NOCHO:  I'll mark the first

            2          one as Exhibit-1.

            3                         - - -

            4                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-1 was marked

            5          for identification.)

            6                         - - -

            7    BY MR. NOCHO:

            8          Q.       Just take a look and read

            9    through this, and I'm going to ask you some

           10    questions about it.

           11          A.       Okay.

           12          Q.       If I can direct you to the very

           13    first e-mail on the chain.  It's on the second

           14    to last page with the number CSS000672 in the

           15    corner.  Do you see that one?

           16          A.       Uh-uh.

           17          Q.       That e-mail is from Hilary Sees?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       Before receiving this e-mail

           20    from Ms. Sees, had you ever dealt with her at

           21    the Bridge?

           22          A.       No.

           23          Q.       Had you dealt with anyone else

           24    at the Bridge before?

           25          A.       No.

                                                               57



            1          Q.       So you see Tim is copied on this

            2    e-mail as well and he's the person you

            3    mentioned before?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       Right next to his name you see

            6    Jenny Midence?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       Had you ever dealt with her

            9    before?

           10          A.       No.

           11          Q.       After this point, did you ever

           12    have any conversations with Ms. Midence?

           13          A.       Not that I'm aware of.

           14          Q.       And then next to Mr. Zechiel's

           15    name you see jcbruch@yahoo.com.

           16          A.       That's a child advocate

           17    attorney, I believe.  I mean, he's one of the

           18    attorneys in the system.

           19          Q.       Have you dealt with, I guess,

           20    Mr. Bruch before?

           21          A.       Yes.  Because he's been on cases

           22    that I have, yes.

           23          Q.       Okay.  Did you speak to him at

           24    all about Taj'anae Siler's case?

           25          A.       No.

                                                               58



            1          Q.       And then I see in the to line,

            2    two different people that appear to work at the

            3    CUA.  There is you, Ms. Harris, and then

            4    Constance Gilmore; is that correct?

            5          A.       Yes.  Constance was not there at

            6    the time.  That's why I took her off in the

            7    e-mail above.

            8          Q.       When you say she wasn't there at

            9    the time, was she working at the agency --

           10          A.       No, she wasn't.  I believe she

           11    was not.

           12          Q.       Okay.

           13          A.       I don't know when she left, but

           14    I wouldn't take her off if she was...

           15          Q.       Still working at the agency, is

           16    that what you meant to say?

           17          A.       I don't know.  I can't answer

           18    that.  At some point, she left the agency

           19    whether she was there or not.  This would have

           20    been at the Verree office and Constance was at

           21    the CORA office.

           22          Q.       What was Constance's position at

           23    the agency?

           24          A.       Case Management Director.  She

           25    was a comparable position to Alan Speed just at

                                                               59



            1    a different office.

            2          Q.       If you look at the second

            3    paragraph in that e-mail, could you read that

            4    paragraph.

            5          A.       There have been several

            6    meetings?

            7          Q.       Yes.

            8          A.       Sure.  There have been several

            9    meetings at this point, which Fairmount has

           10    tried to setup including all parties to attempt

           11    to come up with a plan for T.S.  Not only have

           12    multiple meetings occurred now for T.S., that

           13    included the CBH, the Bridge, parents, and

           14    Fairmount, but multiple meetings have been

           15    attempted to be setup as well.  Phone

           16    conferences occurred on 7/5, 7/6, and 7/7.  As

           17    CUA was not present in any of these meetings,

           18    an e-mail was sent to CUA worker, Ms. Harris on

           19    7/7, which asked for CUA participation in a

           20    meeting on 7/11.  There was a read receipt on

           21    e-mail, but no response or attendance to the

           22    meeting.  To this date, we have not heard back

           23    from CUA regarding this client.  As was

           24    previously expressed, we had some concerns

           25    regarding this child and our inability to

                                                               60



            1    reach/have support from CUA makes it even more

            2    concerning.

            3          Q.       Where it reads we had some

            4    concerns regarding this child, do you know what

            5    concerns Ms. Sees is mentioning?

            6          A.       No.

            7          Q.       Do you know if the Bridge or Ms.

            8    Sees contacted also the regular supervisor on

            9    the case, Theresa Hamlett?

           10          A.       I don't know.

           11          Q.       After seeing this e-mail, did

           12    you reach out to Selara Harris?

           13          A.       No.  She was on vacation so I

           14    sent this e-mail to include her.

           15          Q.       So the next e-mail on the chain,

           16    that's what you're referring to?

           17          A.       Yes.  I mean, I was documenting

           18    that she was involved.  When I got involved, so

           19    like, my e-mail would include the worker and

           20    the supervisor and the Director.  I mean, I was

           21    communicating to them.  But, I mean, I didn't

           22    speak to Selara because she wasn't -- she was

           23    on vacation.

           24          Q.       How do you know that she was on

           25    vacation at that time?

                                                               61



            1          A.       I probably, when I got the call,

            2    went running around the office and asked, you

            3    know, is Selara here and someone was able to

            4    tell me she was on vacation.

            5          Q.       So she was on vacation at the

            6    time you sent this e-mail, I guess, that would

            7    be July 14, 2016?

            8          A.       I believe so.

            9          Q.       Do you know if she was also on

           10    vacation the week before during 7/5 --

           11          A.       I don't know.

           12          Q.       I'm sorry.  Could you wait to

           13    answer until I finish.

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       Do you know if Selara Harris was

           16    also on vacation 7/5, 7/6, or 7/7?

           17          A.       My understanding was she was on

           18    vacation the week that we were involved with --

           19    that's what I wrote in my e-mail so I assume

           20    that was the week.  I don't know what those

           21    dates are.  I would have to look.

           22          Q.       So she was on vacation both at

           23    the time that you sent the e-mail and the week

           24    before?  Is that what you're saying?  I'm just

           25    trying to understand.

                                                               62



            1          A.       When I sent the e-mail, I don't

            2    know what day of the week it was.  Say it was a

            3    Tuesday.  That week it was a Tuesday, she was

            4    on vacation.

            5          Q.       But you don't know if she was on

            6    vacation also the previous week?

            7          A.       I don't know.

            8          Q.       Okay.  Do you know if Theresa

            9    Hamlett was also on vacation the previous week?

           10          A.       I don't know.

           11          Q.       Did you ever supervise Ms.

           12    Harris on any of her cases?

           13          A.       Never.

           14          Q.       Did you have a discussion with

           15    Theresa Hamlett about Selara Harris' work as a

           16    Case Manager on any cases?

           17          A.       No.

           18          Q.       Were you involved in any, for

           19    instance, job performance evaluations for Ms.

           20    Harris?

           21          A.       No.

           22          Q.       So in that e-mail that you sent

           23    that you pointed to on that same page, there is

           24    a line that says, I will attempt to open lines

           25    of communication.  Do you see that?

                                                               63



            1          A.       Oh, yes.

            2          Q.       Okay.  What did you mean when

            3    you said you would attempt to open lines of

            4    communication?

            5          A.       That I was going to do what I

            6    did, which is to notify everybody.

            7          Q.       And when you say everybody --

            8          A.       That I was going to notify the

            9    Case Manager, the Case Management Supervisor,

           10    the Case Management Director.

           11          Q.       Did you have a phone call after

           12    this e-mail with personnel at the Bridge?  So

           13    for instance --

           14          A.       I did not.

           15          Q.       Are you aware of any other

           16    instances where people at the Bridge were

           17    having trouble reaching Ms. Harris?

           18          A.       No.

           19          Q.       If you turn the page to the

           20    previous page --

           21          A.       What number is at the bottom?

           22          Q.       671.

           23          A.       Okay.

           24          Q.       There is an e-mail that you sent

           25    on July 15, 2016.  Do you see that?

                                                               64



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       Okay.  It just talks about how

            3    you're covering the case for today?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       The next paragraph it reads, my

            6    understanding is that she is returning to the

            7    Bridge on Monday, July 18th, and being

            8    transported with 2-1 coverage back to the

            9    Bridge where she will have additional coverage

           10    for 1-1 for 16 hours a day that has been

           11    approved for seven days.  How did you gain that

           12    understanding?

           13          A.       I don't know.

           14          Q.       Do you recall reviewing any

           15    documents on the case?

           16          A.       I don't recall.

           17          Q.       Do you recall speaking to

           18    anyone, for example, Mr. Zechiel?

           19          A.       I know I talked to him

           20    originally.  I don't know if I had another

           21    conversation with him.

           22          Q.       Then if you go to the very first

           23    page of this e-mail chain, the bottom e-mail is

           24    from Nicole Kwatny?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               65



            1          Q.       You reached out to Ms. Kwatny?

            2          A.       Yes.  She is our CBH liaison.

            3          Q.       What role does she play in the

            4    process?

            5          A.       Our agency is assigned to her as

            6    a liaison.  She's there to support, problem

            7    solve.

            8          Q.       And when you say the agency

            9    assigned to her, that's the Catholic Community

           10    Services?

           11          A.       I said -- is that what I said?

           12          Q.       Yes.

           13          A.       Yes.  Catholic Community

           14    Services, yes.

           15          Q.       Then that e-mail she talks about

           16    how Taj'anae was approved for 1-1 for seven

           17    days.  That's CBH giving approval for that?

           18          A.       I believe so.  That would be my

           19    understanding.

           20          Q.       In response to that e-mail, you

           21    sent an e-mail also on July 16, 2016, you asked

           22    for a copy of the evaluation.  Which evaluation

           23    were you referring to?

           24          A.       From Fairmount.

           25          Q.       I'm guessing that would be a

                                                               66



            1    psychiatric eval?

            2          A.       Psychiatric eval, yes.  I mean,

            3    I was looking for recommendations to see if the

            4    placement, you know, if what they were

            5    recommending what resulting in that placement.

            6          Q.       When you say they, the person

            7    who did the evaluation at Fairmount?

            8          A.       Yes.  Is the Fairmount

            9    recommendation supporting this plan that they

           10    are putting in place.

           11          Q.       Do you know if the Fairmount

           12    evaluation did support the plan that they put

           13    in place?

           14          A.       I have no idea.  I don't think I

           15    ever saw it.

           16          Q.       In the next sentence you asked

           17    Ms. Kwanty to confirm CBH will make referrals

           18    to CHOR and CHOY.  Do you see that?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       What does CHOR stand for?

           21          A.       Children's Home of Reading.

           22          Q.       And what does CHOY stand for?

           23          A.       Children's Home of York.

           24          Q.       Are those two residential

           25    facilities?

                                                               67



            1          A.       Yes.  They would be RTF

            2    Programs.

            3          Q.       Did you know them from your

            4    previous work experience?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       Do you know if any referables

            7    were made to Children's Home of Reading or

            8    Children's Home of York?

            9          A.       No.  I'm a little -- I mean, I

           10    don't fully understand my e-mail on this one

           11    because there was not -- unless I was just

           12    trying to determine whether or not if it came

           13    back there wasn't going to be a recommendation

           14    for RTF whether or not that's possible to

           15    consider them.  My understanding was they had

           16    programs for children with sexual issues.  I

           17    can't recall exactly why I wrote that.

           18          Q.       Do you know if Taj'anae Siler

           19    had a history of sexual abuse?

           20          A.       Only what was in this e-mail

           21    right here below.  When CBH talked about it.

           22    There might have been some discussion -- when I

           23    talked to Tim Zechiel, he said something that

           24    those things that there were concerns about her

           25    sexual behaviors and drug use.  He could have

                                                               68



            1    said that.  I just don't recall.

            2          Q.       Did you suggest Children's Home

            3    of Reading, Children's Home of York based on

            4    your understanding of a sexual abuse history?

            5                   MR. LUCCA:  Objection to form.

            6          Just to the extent that he suggested

            7          anything.

            8                   THE WITNESS:  I'm not clear why

            9          I said that, but the logic for me would

           10          be that based on those things, like,

           11          where could she best be helped.  But I

           12          don't know the case.  I'm just gathering

           13          this from e-mails.  I mean, I've seen a

           14          lot of cases.  So, you know, when you see

           15          certain things, it triggers thinking

           16          about the system and where she could best

           17          be helped.

           18    BY MR. NOCHO:

           19          Q.       Did you ever talk to either

           20    Selara Harris or Theresa Hamlett about referral

           21    to send Taj'anae to Children's Home of Reading

           22    or Children's Home of York?

           23          A.       No.

           24          Q.       I just want to show you another

           25    document.

            5    BY MR. NOCHO:

            6          Q.       Just take a moment to read

            7    through this one, and I'll ask you questions

            8    again.

            9          A.       Okay.

           10          Q.       In this e-mail that was sent by

           11    you on July 15, 2016, sent to Theresa Hamlett

           12    and copying Alan Speed, was this an e-mail that

           13    you were following up based on the e-mail you

           14    received from Hilary?

           15          A.       It was to make sure that she --

           16    I mean, I'm communicating to her and to Alan

           17    Speed that I had involvement with this case and

           18    that there are notes in the system and I needed

           19    them to read them to know what was going on.

           20    It was mostly just to tell her I was involved

           21    while you were out, please pay attention to

           22    this and what the ongoing issues were, what I

           23    thought she would want to address when she got

           24    the e-mail.

           25          Q.       Is there a reason you did not

                                                               70



            1    include Selara Harris on this e-mail?

            2          A.       Because this was just

            3    supervisor-to-supervisor communication about my

            4    coverage.

            5          Q.       You talked about in this e-mail

            6    putting three notes with various e-mails from

            7    the past two days into ECMS.  When you say

            8    ECMS, is that Electronic Case Management

            9    System?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       Would you typically put e-mails

           12    into the ECMS?

           13          A.       Yes.  Important ones, yes.  If

           14    I'm covering something, yes.

           15          Q.       What about Case Managers?  Would

           16    Case Managers typically put e-mails into the

           17    ECMS?

           18          A.       If there is content in it that's

           19    helpful to the case, yes.

           20          Q.       Do you know if Selara Harris

           21    ever uploaded any e-mails into the ECMS?

           22          A.       I have no idea.

           23          Q.       Were you contacted at all when

           24    the agency terminated Ms. Harris' employment?

           25          A.       No.

                                                               71



            1          Q.       How did you found out about Ms.

            2    Harris being terminated?

            3          A.       I don't recall knowing.  I mean,

            4    the way it often happens, you know.  Someone

            5    says something about it.  I mean, no one

            6    communicated to me directly, you know, Selara

            7    is no longer here.  It just would have come up

            8    in incidental conversation.

            9          Q.       So incidental conversation with

           10    other people at the agency?

           11          A.       Yes.  I mean, I don't recall it

           12    as something in my head about her leaving.

           13          Q.       When you did hear, incidentally

           14    hear, about Ms. Harris being terminated, did

           15    that person give you a reason why that Ms.

           16    Harris was terminated?

           17          A.       No.

           18          Q.       Did you hear from someone else

           19    the reason why Ms. Harris was terminated?

           20          A.       No.  And I don't ask.

           21          Q.       In this e-mail, in the second

           22    paragraph, you talk about how Hilary Sees asked

           23    for the subcontractor referral and the Single

           24    Case Plan?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               72



            1          Q.       What is a subcontractor

            2    referral?

            3          A.       Subcontractor referral, the

            4    subcontractor in this case is the Bridge so

            5    that, you know, the payment for services goes

            6    from basically DHS/CUA to the Bridge.  So the

            7    subcontractor referral is our communication

            8    tool about the case to the subcontractor.  In

            9    this case, the Bridge.  It's a standard form in

           10    the system, which the Case Manager would fill

           11    out or Case Management Supervisor would fill

           12    out, whoever.  That's a referral that gets

           13    approved in our system, Case Manager, Case

           14    Management Supervisor, Case Management

           15    Director, then that gets sent down to the DHS

           16    CRU.  They would make the connection to the

           17    Bridge.  Once it's approved and accessible to

           18    us, to the CUA, we might be able to send it to

           19    the Bridge, but it's not our -- it's really the

           20    DHS responsibility in the referral process to

           21    get that to the Bridge or the placement agency.

           22          Q.       Does the CUA typically send the

           23    referral to the placement agency or does DHS?

           24          A.       It's DHS that sends the

           25    referable.

                                                               73



            1          Q.       So the CUA completes the form,

            2    sends it to DHS, then DHS would send it to the

            3    placement facility?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       Typically how long does it take

            6    for the placement referral or the subcontractor

            7    referral to be completed?

            8          A.       Anywhere from an hour to a day.

            9    When these situations happen, there is time

           10    pressures and it gets done.

           11          Q.       Would it be unusual for it to

           12    take two or three months for a subcontractor

           13    referral to be completed?

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       What is the purpose on the side

           16    of the facility of having the subcontract

           17    referral?  How does that help them?

           18          A.       It provides demographic

           19    information about the client, the client's

           20    family, information about court, information

           21    about attorneys.  It explains basically the

           22    origin of the case.  Then there is a history.

           23    There is ways to explain the child's

           24    circumstances, what's going on, what needs to

           25    be addressed, what restrictions there are, all

                                                               74



            1    of those situations.  In that case, the Bridge

            2    would understand that, you know, a little bit

            3    about our placement history, about what's been

            4    going on with the case, what the current

            5    situation is.

            6          Q.       So the Bridge would be lacking

            7    that information if they did not have access to

            8    the referral?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       Would it be a similar situation

           11    for the Single Case Plan?

           12          A.       The Single Case Plan would be

           13    helpful to the case because that outlines the

           14    objectives for the family, for the child, and

           15    for the CUA.

           16          Q.       So for instance, in this case,

           17    the Bridge wouldn't have access to those goals

           18    without having the Single Case Plan?

           19          A.       Unless someone talked to them

           20    about it, but no.

           21          Q.       Then the next sentence reads,

           22    they were not done so I said that Case Manager

           23    had to get them to her.  As you have seen, I

           24    did send the DRO.  What does DRO stand for?

           25          A.       It stands for Dependency Review

                                                               75



            1    Order, which no longer exist.  They still call

            2    it that.  It's the Permanency Review Order from

            3    family court.  Whenever there is a court case

            4    and court hearing, the DRO is the document that

            5    you're given at the end of the court hearing.

            6          Q.       I'm guessing this lists court

            7    orders for certain child or family?

            8          A.       It explains what the -- it

            9    addresses permanency.  The most important thing

           10    for that is what the court is expecting from

           11    the child, the agency, or the family.

           12          Q.       You mentioned how the Case

           13    Manager would have to send those documents.

           14    Other than the DRO to the Bridge, is the Case

           15    Manager the usual point of contact for document

           16    request from a facility?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       Do you know why those forms were

           19    not completed at that time?

           20          A.       No.

           21          Q.       Was Selara Harris the employee

           22    assigned to complete those forms?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       Were those forms supposed to

           25    have been completed before this point?

                                                               76



            1          A.       I'm going to assume yes since I

            2    wrote it this way.  The subcontractor referral

            3    would get done as her discharge from the

            4    hospital was imminent.  So it could have been

            5    right around the time that it was happening.

            6    That could have been a problem because she was

            7    on vacation.  It might have been something that

            8    had to have been done while she was vacation.

            9    I don't know.  I don't know the timing.

           10          Q.       Is there, like, a normal process

           11    or procedure for covering Case Managers cases

           12    when they are on vacation?

           13          A.       I would say there is no formal

           14    procedure for that.  Mostly, in general, I

           15    think it tends to fall to the Case Management

           16    Supervisor.

           17          Q.       So the supervisor would be the

           18    person responsible for making sure the tasks

           19    are being completed on the cases?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       Did Ms. Hamlett, Theresa

           22    Hamlett, reach out to you before Selara Harris

           23    went on vacation to ask with your help covering

           24    cases?

           25          A.       No.  Let me modify that.  We

                                                               77



            1    have a general -- we try to support each other

            2    in terms of the Case Management Supervisors.

            3    If Theresa was out on vacation, she would of

            4    let us know that she was out and let her staff

            5    know that they need to go to alternate Case

            6    Management Supervisors.  I don't know in this

            7    situation.  I don't know what the circumstances

            8    were in terms of staff being out.

            9          Q.       Then in the next paragraph you

           10    write, my recommendation would be for Selara to

           11    get to the Bridge next week to see Taj'anae in

           12    preparation for court on 7/25/16.  How did you

           13    develop that recommendation?

           14          A.       Well, I don't know where this

           15    is, but Taj'anae was going to the Bridge.  So

           16    when that placement takes place, it's our

           17    responsibility as a Case Manager to get out and

           18    see her in her new placement even though she

           19    had been there before.  In addition, because I

           20    had some involvement with the case, I noticed

           21    that the next court date was 7/25.  It's really

           22    important that the worker sees the child in the

           23    placement to be able to testify to safety in

           24    court.  I was just trying to be supportive to

           25    Theresa in terms of something that came to mind

                                                               78



            1    when I was covering, you know.  I picked up on

            2    this case to help out.

            3          Q.       One of the purposes of doing the

            4    visits to the placement would be to assess the

            5    child's safety?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       About how often would visits to

            8    children in placement facilities be done?

            9          A.       It needs to be done once a

           10    month.

           11          Q.       Do you know if it was done once

           12    a month for Taj'anae Siler's case?

           13          A.       I don't know.

           14          Q.       Are there instances where visits

           15    are made more than once a month to see children

           16    in placement facilities?

           17          A.       It can happen, yes.

           18          Q.       What are some examples of those

           19    cases?

           20          A.       It could be that there is, like,

           21    a visit that needs to be supervised by the Case

           22    Manager or a staff person and they would go to

           23    a facility to do that.  If there was a planning

           24    meeting scheduled that the Case Manager could

           25    get to, they might go to the facility and see

                                                               79



            1    the child when they are there.  It could be

            2    that there is a crisis and you would want to go

            3    there to support your child or to support the

            4    staff.  You know, just good case management

            5    decisions.  I mean, if a child needs extra

            6    support, you might go.

            7          Q.       When you talked about supervised

            8    visits at the facility, between the parents and

            9    the child?

           10          A.       Yes.  That could happen.  It

           11    could be in a foster home.  It could be the

           12    child lives with the maternal grandmother and

           13    you don't want to move the child.  You say the

           14    visit can take place in the home with a CUA

           15    worker there.

           16          Q.       You also mentioned if there is a

           17    crisis.  What are some examples of a crisis

           18    when you say that?

           19          A.       Like, for the Bridge, if the

           20    client was unsettled and disruptive and the

           21    staff were calling you and you felt like it

           22    could be a support, you might go to the

           23    facility to see the client or the staff.

           24          Q.       Would that include self-harming

           25    or threats of --

                                                               80



            1          A.       It could.  That becomes, like, a

            2    case management decision.  Case Manager, Case

            3    Management Supervisor, or it gets discussed at

            4    the agency.

            5          Q.       So that type of decision would

            6    be left up to Selara Harris in this case?

            7          A.       It could be and it could be that

            8    the supervisor gets involved by talking to the

            9    worker, seeing the e-mail, or knowing what's

           10    going on with the case, worker coming in and

           11    talking about the case with her.  It can come

           12    in different directions.  There is no set

           13    procedure for that.

           14          Q.       But it would be someone from the

           15    CUA agency?

           16          A.       It depends on what's going on in

           17    the case.  Everything is, like, individualized.

           18    You have to try to figure out what's the best

           19    support.  Maybe the support would be call her

           20    mother and have her mother call over there.  I

           21    don't -- each case is different.

           22          Q.       Those would be just case

           23    management decisions.  That's what you mean to

           24    say?

           25          A.       Yeah.

            1          Q.       I just want to ask you about one

            2    additional document.

            4                   (Whereupon, Exhbit-3 was marked

            5          for identification.)

            6                         - - -

            7    BY MR. NOCHO:

            8          Q.       Just take a look at this one and

            9    I'll ask you some questions about it.

           10          A.       Okay.

           11          Q.       So the bottom e-mail that's from

           12    Andrea Bowen at the Bridge and it was dated

           13    August 15, 2016.  Had you previously dealt with

           14    Andrea Bowen?

           15          A.       I mean, unrelated to this case?

           16          Q.       Relate or unrelated?

           17          A.       I would have to look at these

           18    e-mails to see if she's on there.

           19          Q.       But you don't recall one way or

           20    the other?

           21          A.       I don't know if she's on those

           22    e-mails.

           23                   MR. LUCCA:  If you don't know,

           24          you don't know.

           25                   THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

                                                               82



            1    BY MR. NOCHO:

            2          Q.       I was just wondering, for

            3    instance, if you dealt with her like you dealt

            4    with Mr. Zechiel before.

            5          A.       Oh, no.

            6          Q.       In that e-mail she is asking for

            7    a copy of the Single Case Plan?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Did she also reach out to you by

           10    phone around that time?

           11          A.       I don't recall that.

           12          Q.       Do you know if she had been

           13    trying to reach Selara Harris?

           14          A.       I don't know.

           15          Q.       In response to receiving this

           16    e-mail, did you call Selara Harris?

           17          A.       No.

           18          Q.       The next e-mail has you

           19    forwarding the e-mail to Theresa Hamlett.  Why

           20    did you decide to forward it to Theresa

           21    Hamlett?

           22          A.       She's the supervisor of the

           23    case, and it's something that was happening

           24    with her worker.

           25          Q.       Did you also forward this to Ms.

                                                               83



            1    Harris?

            2          A.       No.

            3          Q.       Would Ms. Harris be the one who

            4    was responsible for sending the case plan to

            5    the Bridge?

            6          A.       If her worker didn't.

            7          Q.       When you say her worker in

            8    reference to Ms. Harris, who do you mean?

            9          A.       All right.  So Selara Harris is

           10    responsible for developing the Single Case

           11    Plan.  She could send it to the Bridge.  If she

           12    doesn't send it to the Bridge, then it would

           13    then bump up to the Case Management Supervisor

           14    and make sure that it gets done.  She could ask

           15    someone to send it.  She could send it herself.

           16          Q.       Do you know if the Single Case

           17    Plan was completed at this point?

           18          A.       I don't know.

           19          Q.       Did anyone else from the Bridge

           20    reach out about getting the Single Case Plan?

           21          A.       Not that I recall, no.

           22                   MR. NOCHO:  I don't have any

           23          more questions for you, but the attorneys

           24          over here might have some questions for

           25          you.

            1    BY MR. HILL:

            2          Q.       Good afternoon, Mr. Dutton.  I

            3    just have a couple follow up questions.

            4                   MR. HILL:  We can mark this

            5          Exhibit-4.

            6                         - - -

            7                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-4 was marked

            8          for identification.)

            9                         - - -

           10    BY MR. HILL:

           11          Q.       It's essentially the same as

           12    Exhibit-1, except it has Ms. Kwanty's response

           13    to your e-mail regarding the evaluation to CHOY

           14    and CHOR.

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       So it's an e-mail dated July 18,

           17    2016, from Ms. Kwanty to you.  It says, Leona

           18    was denied by CHOY.  They will send to CHOR.

           19    They aren't sending any right now, don't know

           20    why.  She was also denied by Carson Valley.  Do

           21    you know who Leona is?

           22          A.       Yup.

           23          Q.       Who?

           24          A.       My best guess about this, and I

           25    can't answer the question, is that at the same

                                                               85



            1    time there was things going on with Taj'anae,

            2    there were things going on with another client

            3    on my caseload, Leona.  She was looking for --

            4    they were looking for an RTF Program for her.

            5    I can't tell you that this is related to

            6    Taj'anae.  This could fully be related to

            7    Leona.  It could have just been crossed.  Just

            8    a mix up in terms of communication about cases.

            9          Q.       Was Leona --

           10          A.       There is something that's not

           11    correct about this.  It's either Leona was

           12    wrongly put in there and that meant Taj'anae,

           13    but I don't believe that that's the case.  Then

           14    it helps clarify things about CHOR and the

           15    Children's Home of York.  I think that may have

           16    been more related to Leona.  If you understand.

           17    You know what I'm saying?

           18                   MR. LUCCA:  Just try to answer

           19          what he's asking.

           20    BY MR. HILL:

           21          Q.       Was Leona a client on your

           22    caseload at the time?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       Now, do you believe that the

           25    previous e-mail sent at 3:39 to Nikki regarding

                                                               86



            1    the evaluation in CHOR and CHOY, do you believe

            2    you were referring to Leona or Taj'anae?

            3          A.       My best guess, Leona, but I'm

            4    not sure.  It makes more logical sense to me.

            5          Q.       And Carson Valley, is Carson

            6    Valley an RTF?

            7          A.       It has an RTF Program, yes.

            8          Q.       So it has an RTF component and

            9    it also has a residential component?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11                   MR. HILL:  I have no additional

           12          questions.

           13                   MR. NOCHO:  I have no more

           14          questions.

           15                   MR. LUCCA:  Nothing.

            3                   I do hereby certify that I am a

            4    Notary Public in good standing, that the

            5    aforesaid testimony was taken before me,

            6    pursuant to notice, at the time and place

            7    indicated; that said deponent was by me duly

            8    sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and

            9    nothing but the truth; that the testimony of

           10    said deponent was correctly recorded in machine

           11    shorthand by me, to the best of my ability, and

           12    thereafter transcribed under my supervision

           13    with computer-aided transcription; that the

           14    deposition is a true and correct record of the

           15    testimony given by the witness; and that I am

           16    neither of counsel nor kin to any party in said

         17    BY MR. LAVIN:

         18         Q.  Good afternoon.  My name is Joe

         19    Lavin.  I'm here on behalf of the Defendant

         20    in this matter, David Spohn.  I'm here

         21    today to take your deposition.

         22             Prior to today, have you ever been

         23    deposed before?

         24         A.  No.

                              David P. Kowalewski        5



          1         Q.  Just so you know, to my left and

          2    your right is the court reporter.  She's

          3    writing down everything that we say, so at

          4    the end of the day, there will be a written

          5    transcript with the questions that I ask

          6    you and the answers that you provide to

          7    those questions.

          8             It's important, because the court

          9    reporter is here, that all of your

         10    responses to my questions have to be verbal

         11    responses.  The court reporter can't take

         12    things down such as head nods yes or no, or

         13    indications with your hands to the left or

         14    the right, so you need to verbalize

         15    everything.  Okay?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17         Q.  I'm going to be asking you a

         18    series of questions.  If at any point you

         19    don't understand my question, let me know,

         20    and I'll do my best to rephrase it for you.

         21    All right?

         22         A.  Okay.

         23         Q.  When you do answer a question,

         24    I'll assume you heard the question, you

                              David P. Kowalewski        6



          1    understood the question, and you're

          2    answering it truthfully and honestly to the

          3    best of your ability.  All right?

          4         A.  Okay.

          5         Q.  Do you understand that you are

          6    sworn in and under oath today?

          7         A.  Yes.

          8         Q.  And the testimony you're about to

          9    give has the same force and effect as if we

         10    were testifying in court in front of a

         11    judge or a jury?

         12         A.  Yes.  I understand.

         13         Q.  All right.  That being said, if

         14    you don't know or can't remember an answer

         15    to one of my questions, "I don't know" and

         16    "I can't remember" are perfectly acceptable

         17    responses.  All right?

         18         A.  Okay.

         19         Q.  I don't want you to guess at

         20    anything.  So if your answer is an

         21    estimation or an approximation, things like

         22    speed, distance, time of day, just let me

         23    know that your answer is an estimation or

         24    an approximation, and not an exact answer.

          1    All right?

          2         A.  Okay.

          3         Q.  Are you talking any medication

          4    today that would affect your ability to

          5    testify truthfully and accurately?

          6         A.  No.

          7         Q.  Did you take any medications

          8    today?

          9         A.  Yes.

         10         Q.  What did you take?

         11         A.  I take Coreg, I take Losartan, and

         12    that's it as far as cardiac medications.

         13    Other things are, just, Vitamin D and

         14    magnesium.

         15         Q.  All right.  Have you had an

         16    opportunity to speak with your attorney?

         17         A.  Yes.

         18         Q.  Are you prepared to go forward

         19    with today's deposition?

         20         A.  Yes.

         21         Q.  Can you state your name for the

         22    record?

         23         A.  It's Daniel Phillip Kowalewski.

         24         Q.  And have you ever been known by

                              David P. Kowalewski        8



          1    any other names?

          6         Q.  I am going to ask you for your

          7    full Social Security Number, but request

          8    that the court reporter just put the last

          9    four digits on the record.

         10             What is your Social Security

         11    Number?

          1         A.  February of 2011.

          2         Q.  What were you doing back in

          3    February of 2011?

          4         A.  I was a staff accountant for

          5    Cancer Care, which is a non for profit in

          6    New York City.

          7         Q.  How long did you work there?

          8         A.  11 years.

          9         Q.  Why did you stop working at Cancer

         10    Care?

         11         A.  I went on disability.

         12         Q.  What disabilities do you have?

         13         A.  It's my heart.  I have global

         14    cardiomyopathy.  That's how it's

         15    diagnosed.

         16         Q.  How long have you been diagnosed

         17    with the global cardiomyopathy?

         20    event for that?

         21         A.  No.  I had cardiac problems most

         22    of my life.  And at that point, I had had

         23    double valve replacement in 2005, and that

         24    helped get me through for the next

                              David P. Kowalewski       11



          1    six years.  But then I was unable to work

          2    after that.

          3         Q.  Prior to the accident that we're

          4    here for today, what problems did you

          5    experience related to your global

          6    cardiomyopathy?

          7         A.  Just, sometimes, fatigue during --

          8    later in the day.  You know, just

          9    tiredness.

         10         Q.  Any other problems that you relate

         11    to the global cardiomyopathy?

         12         A.  No.

         13         Q.  With the medications that you

         14    take, you're able to maintain --

         15         A.  Yes.

         16         Q.  All right.  Prior to the accident

         17    that we're here for today, have you ever

         18    been involved in another motor vehicle

         19    accident?

         20         A.  No.  Never.

         21         Q.  How about after the motor vehicle

         22    accident that we're here for today, have

         23    you been involved in any subsequent motor

         24    vehicle accident?

          2         Q.  Have you ever been injured at

          3    work?

          4         A.  No.

          5         Q.  So you've never applied for

          6    Workers' Compensation benefits?

          7         A.  No.

          8         Q.  You indicated that you applied for

          9    and received Social Security Disability

         10    back in 2011?

         12         Q.  Have you ever applied for Social

         13    Security Disability before that point?

         14         A.  No.

         15         Q.  All right.  Have you ever slipped,

         16    fell and injured yourself requiring medical

         17    treatment?

         18         A.  No.

         19         Q.  Have you ever had an object fall

         20    on you, injuring yourself and requiring

         21    medical treatment?

         22         A.  No.

         23         Q.  Have you ever broken a bone?

         24         A.  No.

          3         Q.  Have you ever had any types of

          4    surgery besides the valve replacement that

          5    we already talked about?

          6         A.  Yes.  I also had surgery on my

          7    aorta when I was 13 years old, and I also

          8    had back surgery, a laminectomy, in 2004.

          9         Q.  Okay.  What was the laminectomy

         10    for?

         11         A.  Back pain that I had, and they

         12    corrected it, 'cause I had a -- one

         13    herniated disc and one that was splintered,

         14    so they had to actually go in and remove

         15    that.

         16         Q.  And was that surgery successful?

         17         A.  Yes.

         18         Q.  Did you have resolution of your

         19    back pain after the 2004 laminectomy?

         20         A.  Yes.

         21         Q.  Do you remember how soon after the

         22    surgery you experienced relief?

         23         A.  Immediately.

         24         Q.  Do you remember who performed the

                              David P. Kowalewski       14



          1    surgery?

          2         A.  Yes.

          3         Q.  Who was it?

          4         A.  Andrew Casden, C-a-s-d-e-n. It was

          5    at Beth Israel Hospital.

          6         Q.  Was that in New Jersey or New

          7    York?

          8         A.  In New York.

          9         Q.  Any other surgeries besides the

         10    aorta surgery when you were 13, the

         11    laminectomy in 2004 and the valve

         12    replacement?

         13         A.  Well, recently, I had a pacemaker

         14    installed --

         15         Q.  When was that?

         16         A.  -- implanted.

         17             March 6th of this year.

         18         Q.  And who installed the pacemaker?

         19         A.  That was Dr. James Sandberg,

         20    S-a-n-d-b-e-r-g.

         21         Q.  Have you ever treated with Dr.

         22    Sandberg before the accident that we're

         23    here for today?

                              David P. Kowalewski       15



          1         Q.  Who referred you to Dr. Sandberg?

          2         A.  My cardiologist, who is Dr. Norman

          3    Marcus.

          4         Q.  Is that at CCLPVG Cardiology?

          5         A.  I don't know.  I think it's Lehigh

          6    Valley, LVHN Cardiology.

          7         Q.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  What was that

          8    cardiologist's name again?

          9         A.  Norman Marcus, M-a-r-c-u-s.

         10         Q.  Thank you.

         11             Are you experiencing any

         12    problems related to the pacemaker

         13    installation?

         14         A.  Not that I'm aware of right now.

         15         Q.  Did Dr. Marcus indicate why you

         16    needed the pacemaker?

         17         A.  Because of the global myopathy.

         18    It's just something that will help the

         19    heartbeat more efficiently.

         20         Q.  In the last ten years, besides

         21    any surgery-related incidents and related

         22    to this motor vehicle accident, have you

         23    had any reason to go to the emergency

         24    room?

                              David P. Kowalewski       16



          1         A.  Just -- well, the last time I was

          2    in the emergency room was -- I had an

          3    atrial fibrillation attack back in, I

          4    believe it was, April of 2017, that brought

          5    me to the emergency room.

          6         Q.  What happened in April of 2017 to

          7    lead to that?

          8         A.  I had seen the orthopedic doctor

          9    that was treating me for my shoulder, and

         10    he had given me a second dose of Depo

         11    Medrol, I think it's called; it's a

         12    steroid.  And that was around 5:30 in the

         13    evening, and then by twelve o'clock

         14    midnight, I started experiencing rapid

         15    heartbeat and, you know, pretty bad AFib.

         16    So, it wouldn't correct itself, so after

         17    half-hour, I went to the emergency room,

         18    and they had to cardio- -- chemically

         19    cardiovert me.

         20         Q.  Did you return to your previous

         21    state after going to the emergency room at

         22    that point?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  Did you ever experience additional

                              David P. Kowalewski       17



          1    cardiac issues that you relate to this

          2    accident?

          3         A.  Not after that, no.

          4         Q.  Are there any jobs that you were

          5    holding at the time of the accident that we

          6    haven't already talked about?

          7         A.  No.

          8         Q.  So you're not claiming any wage

          9    loss related to this accident?

         10         A.  Oh, no.  No.

         11         Q.  You had indicated that you have a

         12    Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts, correct?

         13         A.  Yes.

         14         Q.  And is there a particular medium

         15    that you focus in?

         16         A.  It was in film.

         17         Q.  Do you continue to create films?

         18         A.  No.  Not anymore.

         19         Q.  All right.  I'm going to shift

         20    gears now and talk about the accident that

         21    we're here for today.  As has been

         22    indicated in the previous deposition that

         23    you were here for, the date of accident was

         24    December 30th of 2016.  Does that date

                              David P. Kowalewski       18



          1    sound accurate to you?

          2         A.  That's correct.

          3         Q.  Do you remember what time the

          4    accident occurred?

          5         A.  It was, I would say, around 12- --

          6    between 12:45 and 12:55.

          7         Q.  What was -- what were the weather

          8    conditions like that day?

          9         A.  It was a sunny cool day, but it

         10    was sunny and clear.

         11         Q.  Where were the traffic

         12    conditions like at the time of the

         13    accident?

         14         A.  It was kind of congested.  It was

         15    a Friday afternoon right before the New

         16    Year's weekend, so there was quite a bit of

         17    traffic.

         18         Q.  Did you have any plans for the

         19    New Year's weekend?

         20         A.  Just staying home with the

         21    family.

         22         Q.  Where were you coming from?

         23         A.  I was coming from the Grocery

         24    Outlet, which is a grocery store in

                              David P. Kowalewski       19



          1    Quakertown.

          2         Q.  How long were you at the grocery

          3    outlet that day?

          4         A.  Probably about 30 to 40 minutes.

          5         Q.  Okay.  And where were you headed

          6    to?

          7         A.  Then I was headed home.

          8         Q.  Did you have to be there by a

          9    particular time?

         10         A.  No.

         11         Q.  What road did this accident occur

         12    on?

         13         A.  Route 309 South.

         14         Q.  Were you familiar with the

         15    location of the accident?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17         Q.  How often do you travel through

         18    that area?

         19         A.  Oh, maybe three to four times a

         20    week on that particular road.

         21         Q.  And how long had you been on 309

         22    before the impact occurred?

         23         A.  Maybe a mile.  That's the distance

         24    from the Grocery Outlet to the site of the

                              David P. Kowalewski       20



          1    accident.

          2         Q.  Has your license ever been

          3    suspended?

          4         A.  Never.

          5         Q.  Has your license ever been

          6    revoked?

          7         A.  Never.

          8         Q.  Have you ever been convicted of a

          9    crime?

         10         A.  Never.

         11         Q.  What type of vehicle were you

         12    operating on the date of the accident?

         13         A.  It was a Nissan Versa.

         14         Q.  Were you the owner of that

         15    vehicle?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17         Q.  Were there any mechanical problems

         18    with the Nissan Versa that you were aware

         19    of before the accident happened?

         20         A.  No.

         21         Q.  And 309 at the location of this

         22    impact, is it a one-way street or a two-way

         23    street?

         24         A.  Well, it's five lanes, two lanes

                              David P. Kowalewski       21



          1    in either direction, north and south, with

          2    a center median which can be used for

          3    turning.  Or it becomes -- yeah, a turning

          4    lane at the intersection.

          5         Q.  So the center median is actually a

          6    turning lane for both directions?

          7         A.  Yes.

          8         Q.  Where were you when the impact

          9    occurred?

         10         A.  I was in the left turning lane.

         11         Q.  Where were you intending to turn?

         12         A.  I was going to turn onto Station

         13    Road, make a left-hand turn onto Station

         14    Road, on the way to my residence.

         15         Q.  Whenever you did travel down 309,

         16    would you normally make the turn on Station

         17    Road?

         18         A.  Yes.

         19         Q.  Okay.  So even if traffic

         20    conditions were sparse, you would turn down

         21    Station Road?

         22         A.  Yeah.  That's the easiest way to

         23    get there, most direct.

         24         Q.  Did you ever see the other vehicle

                              David P. Kowalewski       22



          1    involved in this accident before the impact

          2    occurred?

          3         A.  No.

          4         Q.  Did you notice whether or not

          5    there was a gap in the traffic that was

          6    there?

          7         A.  No.

          8         Q.  Can you estimate your speed at the

          9    time of impact?

         10         A.  Probably about 35 miles an hour.

         11         Q.  How far away were you from your

         12    turn?

         13         A.  Probably four to five car

         14    lengths.

         15         Q.  And since you never saw the other

         16    vehicle, you can't estimate the speed of

         17    that vehicle, correct?

         18         A.  No.  No.

         19         Q.  How many impacts did you feel?

         20         A.  Just one.

         21         Q.  Can you describe the impact?

         22         A.  It was very sudden and very, uh --

         23    very hard.  It set the airbag off in the

         24    car.

                              David P. Kowalewski       23



          1         Q.  Did you come in contact with the

          2    airbag?

          3         A.  Oh, yes.

          4         Q.  Did you have any problems related

          5    to the airbag deployment?

          6         A.  I just recall there being a powder

          7    of something in the air at the time, and I

          8    guess I hit the steering wheel when I went

          9    forward and to the right.

         10         Q.  The front end of your vehicle was

         11    damaged, correct?

         12         A.  Oh, yes.

         13         Q.  Can you say what part of the other

         14    vehicle was damaged?

         15         A.  Yes.  It was the driver's side

         16    front, and probably from the front tire to

         17    the front of the car.  It didn't hit into

         18    his door.

         19         Q.  Was your vehicle totaled?

         20         A.  Yes.

         21         Q.  Did you ever have a conversation

         22    with the driver of the other vehicle?

         23         A.  No.

         24         Q.  Are you able to get out of your

                              David P. Kowalewski       24



          1    car at the scene?

          2         A.  No.

          3         Q.  Did you try?

          4         A.  Yeah.

          5         Q.  Okay.  Did you have any

          6    conversations at the scene of the

          7    accident?

          8         A.  Not with anyone but the police

          9    officer.  And as I find out now, there was

         10    a man there, and I didn't know who he was,

         11    who had come to me very soon after the

         12    accident occurred.  And he said that he --

         13    he checked to see how I was, and he said

         14    that he had called the police.  And if I

         15    needed an ambulance, if I wanted an

         16    ambulance, he said that he would call that,

         17    too, and that was the only conversation I

         18    had with anybody other than the police when

         19    they arrived.  And my sister arrived

         20    afterwards 'cause I called her on the cell

         21    phone after about two or three minutes

         22    later.

         23         Q.  And what is your sister's name?

         24         A.  Phyllis Kowalewski.

          1         Q.  Are there any witnesses to this

          2    accident that you're aware of?

          3         A.  No.  I mean, there were a lot of

          4    cars around.  I mean, I'm sure they saw it,

          5    but...

          6         Q.  How did you leave the scene of the

          7    accident?

          8         A.  In an ambulance.

         11    BY MR. LAVIN:

         12         Q.  Did you have your seatbelt on?

         13         A.  Yes.

         14         Q.  Besides the airbags, did your body

         15    come into contact with anything else inside

         16    the vehicle?

         17         A.  No.  Other than the steering

         18    wheel, I guess.  That's it.

         19         Q.  What part of your body came into

         20    contact with the steering wheel?

         21         A.  I would say the whole chest area

         22    and something, maybe, from the from the

         23    seatbelt, because I was all black and blue

         24    in this area here (indicating).

          1         Q.  Okay.  So you're indicating your

          2    right rib area?

          3         A.  Yes, my right rib area.

          4         Q.  Were you experiencing pain at the

          5    scene?

          6         A.  Yes.

          7         Q.  Where were you experiencing pain

          8    at that point?

          9         A.  All throughout the whole chest

         10    area.

         11         Q.  Did you have pain anywhere else at

         12    the scene of the accident?

         13         A.  No.  It was just in the chest

         14    area.

         15         Q.  So what hospital were you taken

         16    to?

         17         A.  Saint Luke's Quakertown.

         18         Q.  Had you ever been there before?

         19         A.  No.  No.

         20         Q.  And what did they do for you?

         21         A.  Well, they brought me to the ER.

         22    They took X-rays.  They took blood work,

         23    blood pressure, just checked the vital

         24    signs.

          1         Q.  Did you get any testing done that

          2    day?  You said X-rays?

          3         A.  X-rays.  Just X-rays.

          4         Q.  Do you know what body part you had

          5    X-rayed?

          6         A.  Yes.  It was my chest, the chest,

          7    the front and the right side.

          8         Q.  Are there any other tests that you

          9    are getting in the hospital that day?

         10         A.  Nothing other than blood work.

         11    No.

         12         Q.  Were you released that day?

         13         A.  Yes.

         14         Q.  And where did you go at that

         15    point?

         16         A.  Home.

         17         Q.  When you got home, were you

         18    experiencing pain?

         19         A.  Oh, yes.

         20         Q.  Where were you experiencing pain

         21    at that point?

         22         A.  In the chest and the side area.

         23         Q.  When was the next time you sought

         24    medical treatment?

          1         A.  It was that Tuesday, I believe,

          2    after the accident.

          3         Q.  Where did you go at that point?

          4         A.  I went to see my GP.

          5         Q.  And that's Quakertown Family

          6    Practice?

          7         A.  Yes.

          8         Q.  And where were you experiencing

          9    pain at that point?

         10         A.  Still in that same area,

         11    throughout my chest area and my side.  And,

         12    you know, by that time, I was all bruised

         13    very, you know, badly.  Very black and

         14    blue, and green and orange.

         15         Q.  Is Quakertown Family Practice and

         16    Grandview Health the same facility?

         17         A.  I believe they're within the same

         18    area.  They both share a building there.  I

         19    think it's 99 North West --

         20         Q.  Is there a difference in terms of

         21    who you treat with there?

         22         A.  I don't understand.

         23         Q.  So they share a building, but are

         24    they separate practices, the Quakertown

                              David P. Kowalewski       29



          1    Family Practice and Grandview Health?

          2         A.  Yes, they are.  They're separate.

          3         Q.  Okay.  So do you consider them

          4    both your primary doctor?

          5         A.  I would think that -- I'm not sure

          6    what they actually are called, Dr. Vasta,

          7    what he belongs to.

          8         Q.  Okay.

          9         A.  I think it's Grandview.  I don't

         10    know if it's called Quakertown Family

         11    Practice, but I know he's affiliated with

         12    Grandview Hospital.

         13         Q.  Okay.  How many times did you go

         14    to see your primary care doctor related to

         15    this accident?

         16         A.  I would say at least three times

         17    before I actually went to see the

         18    orthopedic doctor.

         19         Q.  And what did your primary care

         20    doctor do for you, if anything?

         21         A.  The primary care doctor, the first

         22    time on the 3rd, examined me, went through

         23    the whole thing just to see why I was in

         24    pain in the rib on the right side and to

                              David P. Kowalewski       30



          1    the chest.  They were afraid that there

          2    might have been some break or damage, so

          3    they sent me for an MRI -- not an MRI, a

          4    CAT scan that afternoon, so I had a CAT

          5    scan that same afternoon.

          6         Q.  Did you ever follow-up with your

          7    primary to discuss the results of the CAT

          8    scan?

          9         A.  Yes.

         10         Q.  What's your understanding of the

         11    results?

         12         A.  They said that there was no

         13    internal damage that they saw or any

         14    internal injuries, and the ribs are just

         15    bruised.

         16         Q.  And then did you follow up again

         17    with your primary care doctor?

         18         A.  Oh, yes.

         19         Q.  Do you remember why?

         20         A.  'Cause I was still experiencing

         21    pain.  And at that point, what they had

         22    done was they had prescribed some NSAIDs

         23    and Tylenol for the pain, but I really

         24    don't like taking the NSAIDs because of my,

                              David P. Kowalewski       31



          1    you know, heart and the reaction that it

          2    could have with the other medications.

          3             But I alternated that for a few

          4    weeks, and the pain was still there, so I

          5    went back at the end of the month, I

          6    believe, and told him that I was still

          7    having a lot of pain.  And at that point,

          8    it was really not only in the chest area,

          9    which was getting a little better, but

         10    mostly in the neck and shoulder area.

         11         Q.  All right.  And the third time

         12    that you went to see your primary doctor,

         13    do you remember why that was?

         14         A.  Because he had prescribed that I

         15    go for therapy after that time at the end

         16    of January, and I did go for physical

         17    therapy, maybe five or six sessions.  And

         18    they believed that it really wasn't helping

         19    me at that point, and they suggested that

         20    maybe I should see an orthopedic doctor.

         21    So I went back to my regular physician, and

         22    I believe he gave me a referral for the

         23    orthopedic doctor.

         24         Q.  All right.  So after going to your

                              David P. Kowalewski       32



          1    primary care doctor, you go to NovaCare

          2    Rehabilitation?

          3         A.  Yes.

          4         Q.  At Grandview Hospital?

          5         A.  That's right.

          6         Q.  And that was at the referral of

          7    your primary doctor?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  And as you indicated, you

         10    treated there approximately five or six

         11    times?

         12         A.  Yes.

         13         Q.  Into February of 2017?

         14         A.  Yes.

         15         Q.  But did you feel that the

         16    treatment there helped at all?

         17         A.  No.

         18         Q.  And that's why you stopped going

         19    there?

         20         A.  Yes.

         21         Q.  Then you went back to your primary

         22    care doctor?

         23         A.  Well, the therapist there said

         24    that they think that maybe I should see my

                              David P. Kowalewski       33



          1    primary care doctor and see an orthopedic

          2    doctor, because they said that, you know,

          3    with all the repetitions and all the

          4    exercises that I was doing, I should be

          5    feeling better.

          6         Q.  Okay.  And then at that point is

          7    when you went to Upper Bucks Orthopedics?

          8         A.  Correct.

          9         Q.  And how many times did you go

         10    there total?

         11         A.  Four or five times.  I'm not

         12    really sure.

         13         Q.  What did they do for you?

         14         A.  An examination of that whole area

         15    where my neck and chest -- I mean, my neck

         16    and shoulder.  Made me you know, try to

         17    lift my arm up, extend it, go to the

         18    front, to the back, to the side, just to

         19    see what kind of range of motion I had.

         20    Turning my neck to the right and to the

         21    left.

         22         Q.  So every time that you went

         23    there, was it, essentially, an examination

         24    and a conversation with the orthopedic

                              David P. Kowalewski       34



          1    surgeon?

          2         A.  Yes.

          3         Q.  Did he ever refer you for

          4    diagnostic testing?

          5         A.  Yes.  Yes.

          6         Q.  Do you know what type of

          7    diagnostic testing it was?

          8         A.  Yes.  I had an MRI.

          9         Q.  Of what body part?

         10         A.  Of the right shoulder and the

         11    neck, I would assume.

         12         Q.  All right.  And did he ever share

         13    the results of those tests with you?

         14    What is your understanding of those

         15    results?

         16         A.  What I understand -- this was the

         17    first thing he said that he saw in the

         18    shoulder, that there might be some sort of

         19    an inflammation in the area where the

         20    shoulder meets the rotator cuff or

         21    something.  He says there might be an area

         22    there that's inflamed, and I believe that's

         23    why he gave me another shot of the Depo

         24    Medrol, to help relieve that, and thinking

                              David P. Kowalewski       35



          1    that the steroid shots might help.  And --

          2         Q.  Now, with regard to the Depo

          3    Medrol, you indicated that you got

          4    another shot.  Had you had a shot of that

          5    before?

          6         A.  Yes.  I had that.  I believe at

          7    the first meeting with him he gave me

          8    that.

          9         Q.  All right.  And after the first

         10    shot, did you have any adverse effect from

         11    the first shot?

         12         A.  No.

         13         Q.  But the second time you got one,

         14    there were adverse effects?

         15         A.  Yes.

         16         Q.  And has any medical provider

         17    indicated why there was a difference?

         18         A.  Well, it could be that I might

         19    have had too much of that steroid, you

         20    know, whatever the medication is.  It's a

         21    steroidal medication that might have

         22    triggered the AFib episode.

         23         Q.  Did you ever consult with your

         24    cardiologist before getting the

                              David P. Kowalewski       36



          1    injection?

          2         A.  No.

          3         Q.  Did you consider it?

          4         A.  No.

          5         Q.  So after the second epidural or --

          6    I'm sorry, the second injection, you then

          7    went -- you said that was at around 5:30,

          8    and then around midnight, you went to the

          9    hospital?

         10         A.  Correct.

         11         Q.  And then you were discharged that

         12    day after having some testing done?

         13         A.  Yes.

         14         Q.  They had to actually chemically --

         15         A.  Chemically cardiovert me, and then

         16    they released me around 4:00 in the

         17    morning.

         18         Q.  All right.  Then after that, did

         19    you go to your cardiologist?

         20         A.  Yes.

         21         Q.  Okay.  And what did your

         22    cardiologist say to you?

         23         A.  Well, he did the cardiogram to

         24    check if everything was okay, and there

                              David P. Kowalewski       37



          1    might have been a possibility that that

          2    could have precipitated the onset of the

          3    AFib.

          4         Q.  Okay.  So did you say that it was

          5    also possible that there could have been

          6    another reason that the AFib occurred that

          7    night?

          8         A.  No.  No 'cause I haven't had an

          9    incident of that since prior to my valve

         10    surgery.

         11         Q.  I have one question that kind of

         12    goes back in time with my questions.  Have

         13    you ever been involved in any other

         14    litigation besides the case that we're here

         15    for today?

         16         A.  No.

         17         Q.  Are there any other doctors that

         18    you treated with related to the motor

         19    vehicle accident that we're here for today

         20    that we haven't already talked about?

         21         A.  Dr. DiBenedetto.

         22         Q.  And what type of doctor is he?

         23         A.  He's also an orthopedic.

         24         Q.  And is he at Lehigh Valley

                              David P. Kowalewski       38



          1    Physicians?

          2         A.  Yes.

          3         Q.  And who referred you to Dr.

          4    DiBenedetto?

          5         A.  I just referred to him myself

          6    because I wanted to get another opinion on

          7    the -- on my shoulder and my neck, you

          8    know, the pain.

          9         Q.  And how did you find Dr.

         10    DiBenedetto?

         11         A.  Well, he works in the same area

         12    where my -- where I have my cardiologist,

         13    so I know that Lehigh Valley Health is very

         14    reputable.

         15         Q.  How many times did you go to see

         16    Dr. DiBenedetto?

         17         A.  I saw him twice.

         18         Q.  Is it DiBenedetto?

         19         A.  Yeah.  I think it's DiBenedetto.

         20         Q.  So you saw him twice?

         21         A.  Yes.

         22         Q.  And what did he do for you?

         23         A.  Well, the first time I saw him, he

         24    reviewed the MRI from Dr. Hurley previously

                              David P. Kowalewski       39



          1    from the year before, and he saw the same

          2    thing.  He said that it probably is

          3    adhesive capsulitis and -- which is

          4    basically frozen shoulder, and he decided

          5    that I should go for different therapy

          6    specifically for that.

          7         Q.  Did you ever go to that therapy?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  Where was that?

         10         A.  That was at Lehigh Valley

         11    Therapeutic.  I'm not sure.  It's in the

         12    same building in Quakertown where my --

         13    where Dr. Vasta is, my --

         14         Q.  Where is that; do you know what

         15    road?

         16         A.  I think it's 99 North West End

         17    Boulevard.

         18         Q.  In Quakertown?

         19         A.  In Quakertown.

         20         Q.  How long did you go to Lehigh

         21    Valley Therapeutic for?

         22         A.  I'd say maybe five weeks.

         23         Q.  What did they do for you there?

         24         A.  Intensive maneuvers with the -- on

                              David P. Kowalewski       40



          1    the arm and shoulder, the right arm and

          2    shoulder; a lot of, you know, repetition.

          3    And they gave me exercises to do at home.

          4         Q.  Did treatment there help?

          5         A.  Yes.

          6         Q.  What is your understanding of the

          7    frozen shoulder?

          8         A.  I know that there's a period when

          9    it occurs that the pain seems to persist

         10    during what they call a thawing period, and

         11    I think that's the period that they

         12    explained to me, that I was in the thawing

         13    period at the time that I was having this

         14    pain.

         15         Q.  All right.  Any other medical

         16    providers you treated with related to this

         17    accident that we haven't already talked

         18    about?

         19         A.  No.

         20         Q.  All right.  So just generally, so

         21    I have an understanding, you go to the

         22    emergency room, then your primary care

         23    doctor.  Then you went to physical therapy.

         24    It didn't help, so you went back to your

                              David P. Kowalewski       41



          1    primary care doctor who referred you to an

          2    orthopedic surgeon, who you treated with

          3    until you got the second injection.  Then

          4    you went back to the emergency room.  Then

          5    you went to a different orthopedic doctor

          6    who then referred you for five weeks of

          7    physical therapy?

          8         A.  Correct.  That's true.

          9         Q.  Okay.  Any other diagnostic

         10    testing that you got done that we haven't

         11    already talked about, besides the X-rays in

         12    the emergency room, the CAT scan at the

         13    recommendation of your primary care doctor,

         14    and the MRI recommended by the orthopedic

         15    surgeon?

         16         A.  No.

         17         Q.  There was an X-ray in March of

         18    2017.  Did you get an X-ray of your chest

         19    when you went to the hospital after the

         20    second shot?

         21         A.  I don't recall.

         22         Q.  Okay.

         23         A.  I would think that I had an X-ray

         24    done by the orthopedic doctor prior to

                              David P. Kowalewski       42



          1    having an MRI.

          2         Q.  Okay.

          3         A.  Because initially I had it at the

          4    emergency room, and I know I had another

          5    X-ray somewhere along the line having to do

          6    with the first orthopedic doctor.

          7         Q.  Okay.  Is it true that the first

          8    orthopedic doctor that you saw you stopped

          9    going to after the adverse reaction?

         10         A.  After the adverse reaction and the

         11    fact that he thought that maybe surgery was

         12    an option for me.

         13         Q.  Okay.  So between Upper Bucks

         14    Orthopedic Associates and going to Lehigh

         15    Valley Physician Group, there was a year

         16    delay?

         17         A.  Yes.

         18         Q.  Why did you wait a year before

         19    seeking additional medical treatment?

         20         A.  Because I was just waiting for,

         21    maybe, it to start feeling better, and it

         22    never got any better.

         23         Q.  And when you say "it," what are

         24    you referring to?

                              David P. Kowalewski       43



          1         A.  The pain in my shoulder and arm,

          2    and the limited range of motion.

          3         Q.  Have you sought any medical

          4    treatment since May of 2018?

          5               MR. HESS:  Related to the

          6         accident?

          7               MR. LAVIN:  Related to the

          8         motor vehicle accident that

          9         we're here for today.

         10               THE WITNESS:  No.

         11    BY MR. LAVIN:

         12         Q.  As we sit here today, do you have

         13    any appointments to treat with anybody

         14    related to this accident?

         15         A.  Not to this accident, no.

         16         Q.  You had indicated that the first

         17    orthopedic surgeon had recommended surgery

         18    of some sort?

         19         A.  Yes.

         20         Q.  Has any other doctor recommended

         21    surgery?

         22         A.  No.

         23         Q.  Besides the injections that we

         24    already talked about, did you have any

                              David P. Kowalewski       44



          1    recommendations for additional

          2    injections?

          3         A.  No.

          4         Q.  Do you have any intention to make

          5    an appointment to treat for injuries

          6    related to this accident?

          7         A.  No.

          8         Q.  I have a note that Dr. Emanuel

          9    Shiowitz, S-h-i-o-w-i-t-z, was your primary

         10    care doctor in Brooklyn?

         11         A.  Yes.

         12         Q.  And you stopped seeing him in

         13    2011, correct?

         14         A.  Yes.  When I moved here -- oh, no.

         15    No, not 2011.  I moved here in 2013, so I

         16    saw him up until 2013.

         17         Q.  Okay.  And your current primary

         18    doctor, his name is what again?

         19         A.  Alfred Vasta.

         20         Q.  Prior to going to the emergency

         21    room the second time after getting a shot,

         22    had you ever gone to see your cardiologist

         23    related to this accident?

         24         A.  Yes.

                              David P. Kowalewski       45



          1         Q.  Okay.  And when was that?

          2         A.  It was probably soon after.  In

          3    January, I know I had to see a PA just to

          4    make sure that there wasn't any damage.

          5    They wanted to see me right away, and I

          6    know they did a cardiogram.  And they

          7    checked me for that.

          8         Q.  Was that after getting the

          9    injection with the adverse reaction?

         10         A.  Oh, no.  This was in January right

         11    after the accident, because I wouldn't let

         12    that go.

         13         Q.  Okay.  In terms of health

         14    insurance, you receive Medicare benefits,

         15    correct?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17         Q.  And you are also an AARP

         18    recipient?

         19         A.  Yes.

         20         Q.  Do you have any other form of

         21    health insurance?

         22         A.  No.  That's it.

         23         Q.  So I want to go through each body

         24    part.  You had indicated that you injured

                              David P. Kowalewski       46



          1    your neck and right shoulder in this

          2    accident?

          3         A.  Yes.

          4         Q.  Did you injure any other body part

          5    other than the chest and the right rib cage

          6    area?

          7         A.  No.

          8         Q.  Okay.  With regard to the chest,

          9    do you still experience pain that you

         10    relate to this accident in your chest?

         11         A.  No.

         12         Q.  How long did that take for that

         13    pain to resolve?

         14         A.  About a month.

         15         Q.  And a month later did you still

         16    have the bruising there?

         17         A.  It was fading, but it was still --

         18    yeah.  It was still a bit evident.

         19         Q.  All right.  And with regard to the

         20    right rib cage, do you continue to

         21    experience pain in your right rib cage?

         22         A.  No.

         23         Q.  How long did it take for the right

         24    rib cage pain to resolve?

                              David P. Kowalewski       47



          1         A.  About the same time.  About a

          2    month.

          3         Q.  All right.  Had you ever had neck

          4    pain before this accident?

          5         A.  No.

          6         Q.  How often do you experience neck

          7    pain now?

          8         A.  Rarely.  Not that I could say that

          9    it bothers me now in the neck.

         10         Q.  Okay.  So, now when you get neck

         11    pain, is it unrelated to this accident?

         12         A.  I would think so.

         13         Q.  How long did it take for the neck

         14    pain to resolve?

         15         A.  Ugh.  That took -- that took about

         16    three to four months for the neck pain,

         17    that I was able to turn my neck to the

         18    right side and be comfortable.  Yeah, about

         19    four months.

         20         Q.  When you did experience neck pain,

         21    can you describe what it felt like?

         22         A.  It was a sharp -- it's like a

         23    stabbing pain every time I turned to the

         24    right, and it went down into the back, the

                              David P. Kowalewski       48



          1    shoulder blade area.

          2         Q.  Did you ever experience neck pain

          3    after this accident related to this

          4    accident when you turned your head to the

          5    left?

          6         A.  To the left after the accident?

          7    At the beginning, yes.  There was -- when I

          8    turned either way, it hurt.

          9         Q.  All right.  But the neck pain did

         10    resolve about three to four month after

         11    this accident?

         12         A.  Yes.  Yes.

         13         Q.  Now, the right shoulder pain, had

         14    you ever had right shoulder pain before

         15    this accident?

         16         A.  No.  Never.

         17         Q.  Do you continue to experience

         18    right shoulder pain that you relate to this

         19    accident?

         20         A.  Only when I do some lateral

         21    movement with my arm, raising my arm.

         22         Q.  Okay.  And where on your body is

         23    the pain that you experience when you do

         24    the lateral movement?

                              David P. Kowalewski       49



          1         A.  It's right in the -- right in the

          2    shoulder area.

          3         Q.  Okay.  Like right in the joint

          4    (indicating)?

          5         A.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would say in the

          6    joint.

          7         Q.  Can you describe what that feels

          8    like when you do experience pain?

          9         A.  It's a sharp shooting pain,

         10    stabbing pain if I go to high up with it.

         11         Q.  Does that pain radiate anywhere

         12    else in your body?  Does it go down in your

         13    fingers or down your arm?

         14         A.  No.

         15         Q.  How often do you experience that

         16    pain?

         17         A.  Just about every time I forget

         18    and try to lift my arm up above my

         19    shoulder.

         20         Q.  Okay.  And can you approximate how

         21    many times in the last 30 days that

         22    occurred?

         23         A.  Oh, maybe two or three times.  If

         24    I'm reaching for something behind me and

                              David P. Kowalewski       50



          1    all, that would do it.

          2         Q.  So you indicated that when you are

          3    reaching, you experience the pain?

          4         A.  Yes.

          5         Q.  When you release your arm, does

          6    the pain go away?

          7         A.  Yes.

          8         Q.  Okay.  Can you rate the pain when

          9    you do experience it on a scale of one to

         10    ten, ten being the worst pain you can ever

         11    imagine?

         12         A.  Maybe about a five or six.  That's

         13    it.

         14         Q.  All right.  So we talked about

         15    your neck.  We talked about your right

         16    shoulder, the chest and right rib cage.

         17    Are there any other body parts you injured

         18    in this accident?

         19         A.  No.

         20         Q.  All right.  At any point, were

         21    your sleep habits affected by this

         22    accident?

         23         A.  At the beginning, it was just very

         24    uncomfortable in bed, you know.  Whenever I

                              David P. Kowalewski       51



          1    would turn and all, I would get pain, but

          2    that only lasted for, you know, a couple of

          3    months.

          4         Q.  Were you able to bathe yourself

          5    without any problems?

          6         A.  Oh, yes.

          7         Q.  Are you able to dress yourself

          8    without any problems?

          9         A.  Yes.

         10         Q.  Were there any household chores

         11    that are more difficult after this

         12    accident?

         13         A.  Well, any reaching for, you know,

         14    anything.  If I had something on an upper

         15    shelf, if I tried to reach for it, I would

         16    have to only use my left arm.  I couldn't

         17    reach up anywhere above my shoulder at that

         18    point.  You see, now I could do that, but

         19    at that point up until May of 2017 -- 2018,

         20    2018, I couldn't do that.

         21         Q.  All right.  Are you responsible

         22    for outdoor maintenance at your home?

         23         A.  No.

         24         Q.  Who is responsible for it?

                              David P. Kowalewski       52



          1         A.  Well, we have a landscaper who

          2    does that, and any, you know, work that I

          3    have to do outside, we have somebody

          4    help.

          5         Q.  And did you do that before this

          6    accident?

          7         A.  Oh, yeah.  I was able to do a lot

          8    more, and I was able to paint and do things

          9    that --

         10         Q.  Well, in particular, with regard

         11    to outdoor maintenance and the landscaper,

         12    did you have one before the accident?

         13         A.  Oh, yeah.  We had a landscaper

         14    since we moved in.  That's part of the --

         15         Q.  Now, you said you were doing art.

         16    Did you stop doing art after this

         17    accident?

         18         A.  No.  I didn't say "art."

         19         Q.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What did you

         20    say?

         21         A.  (Laughter.)

         22         Q.  What is it that you said you would

         23    do?

         24         A.  Painting.

                              David P. Kowalewski       53



          1         Q.  Painting?

          2         A.  Physically paint the wall or

          3    something --

          4         Q.  Oh.

          5         A.  -- you know, to paint the closet.

          6         Q.  Okay.  And that aggravates your --

          7         A.  Oh, yeah.

          8         Q.  -- shoulder?

          9         A.  Yeah.

         10         Q.  Is there anything you're unable to

         11    do now?

         12         A.  At this point, the only thing that

         13    I'll really unable to do regarding the

         14    shoulder is to move it laterally on the

         15    right side.  I can't, like, reach for

         16    things if I tried this (indicating) or went

         17    backwards with it, but I could move it

         18    forward and back that way, which I -- I

         19    wasn't able to do before the physical

         20    therapy I had.

         21         Q.  Did the injuries you sustained in

         22    this accident affect your personal

         23    relationships at all?

         24         A.  No.

                              David P. Kowalewski       54



          1         Q.  Are there any other ways that your

          2    life was affected by this accident that we

          3    haven't talked about today?

          4         A.  No, other than, you know, the pain

          5    and discomfort that I had.  That's it.

          6         Q.  All right.  So, essentially,

          7    besides the pain and discomfort that you

          8    experience, your life continued on as

          9    normal; is that fair to say?

         10               MR. HESS:  What, now or

         11         before?

         12               MR. LAVIN:  As of May of

         13         2018.

         14               THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I

         15         would say the only problem I

         16         have now is driving on 309.

         17         It's like more of -- I'm always

         18         afraid of watching out for

         19         somebody jetting out of a

         20         driveway or something, so I try

         21         to avoid 309.

         22               MR. LAVIN:  I have no

         23         further questions.  Thank you.

         24               MR. HESS:  I have several

          3                    EXAMINATION

          4                       - - -

          5    BY MR. HESS:

          6         Q.  In terms of diagnostic tests, do

          7    you recall having an X-ray of your neck and

          8    right shoulder in February of 2017?

          9         A.  The neck and right shoulder in

         10    February?

         11         Q.  And if you don't recall, you don't

         12    recall.

         13         A.  I don't recall.  I know I had one

         14    from the orthopedic doctor, but I don't

         15    recall when it was done.

         16         Q.  All right.  You talked about your

         17    chest and right rib area being injured.

         18    Were there any injuries to your abdomen

         19    or --

         20         A.  Well, they did the CAT scan there

         21    because they were afraid that there were

         22    some internal injuries.  So, it wasn't an

         23    abdominal CAT scan that was done.

         24         Q.  Did you ever have any symptoms in

                              David P. Kowalewski       56



          1    your abdominal area such as pain?

          2         A.  Yeah.  I did.

          3         Q.  And did you have any bruising of

          4    your abdominal area?

          5         A.  Yes.  It went from the -- all the

          6    way from the right rib down (indicating),

          7    down to the belly area right below where

          8    the rib cage is.

          9         Q.  All right.  Did your injuries for

         10    a period of time affect your ability to

         11    lift with your right arm?

         12         A.  Oh, yes.

         13         Q.  Did your injuries affect your

         14    ability to drive for a period of time?

         15         A.  Yes.  It was very, very difficult

         16    to turn my head to the right whenever I was

         17    parking or making a turn, or seeing if

         18    anybody was coming.

         19         Q.  Did your injuries for a period of

         20    time affect prolonged reading?

         21         A.  Reading?  No.

         22         Q.  If you were reading for half an

         23    hour or an hour, and your neck was in one

         24    position, did that affect your ability to

                              David P. Kowalewski       57



          1    read?

          2         A.  Well, yes.  I mean, normally when

          3    I read, I'm usually in a recliner because

          4    of that.

          5         Q.  So did the pain impact reading for

          6    a period of time?

          7         A.  Yes, for a period of time.

          8         Q.  And for a period of time, did you

          9    have some difficulty getting dressed due to

         10    your injuries?

         11         A.  Well, it was very hard to get on

         12    my shirt and take -- remove my

         13    undergarments.  That was the biggest thing

         14    because I couldn't maneuver the arm out, so

         15    I had to learn how to do it from my left

         16    side and slip everything over, and then

         17    vice-versa.  So, yeah, definitely.

         18         Q.  Were your household chores

         19    impacted for a period of time as a result

         20    of --

         21         A.  Oh, yes.

         22         Q.  Last question is, are you

         23    right-handed or left-handed?

         24         A.  Right-handed.

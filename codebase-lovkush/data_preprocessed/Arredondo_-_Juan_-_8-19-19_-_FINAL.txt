           25  to translate my questions into Spanish and your answers

            6  and wait for you to complete your answer before I ask

            7  another question.  Okay?  That way we're not talking

            8  over each other.  Okay?

            9                If there are any questions that I ask you

           11  phrased differently or just asked again, will you tell

           12  me that?

           13       A.  Okay.

           14       Q.  And since you have that opportunity, can we

           15  have this agreement that any question you've answered

           13  right?

           14       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Arredondo, I'm going to

           15  show you two maps.  The first one is Exhibit 1013, and

           16  the second one is Exhibit 1014.  I want you to look at

           17  these maps and see if you recognize them to be of the

           18  Kuraray plant.

           19                MR. NEWTON:  Here you go.

           20                MR. BICKHAM:  Thank you.

           21       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Take your time.

           22       A.  I can't see very well.

           23       Q.  Do you need glasses?

           24       A.  I forgot them.

           25       Q.  You forgot them?

                                                                      66



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  Okay.  Take your time and see if you recognize

            3  this to be the work area where you were working at the

            4  day of the accident.  And if you can't tell, then just

            5  tell us that.  But if you can figure it out, then tell

            6  us that, too.

            7       A.  I'm telling you I cannot be sure because I

            8  cannot see well.

            9       Q.  Do you use reading glasses, or do you have

           10  prescription glasses?

           11       A.  I have a prescription for glasses.

           12       Q.  But you forgot them?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  So you really can't see those maps, either one

           15  of those, Exhibit 1013 or 1014?

           16       A.  I cannot see very well the letters.

           17       Q.  Can you see the numbers?

           18       A.  Barely.

           19       Q.  Okay.  Can you figure out on either one of

           20  those maps, Mr. Arredondo, where you were working at the

           21  time of the accident on May 19, 2018?  Take your time.

           22  And look at both maps.

           23       A.  Point to the area 1400.  This is where I was

           24  at.

           25       Q.  Okay.  So I want you to take the court

                                                                      67



            1  reporter's pen there, if you will, or either your pen,

            2  the interpreter's pen, any pen you got there that you

            3  got your -- your hands on.  Okay?  And I want you to

            4  write the letter W where you were working.

            5       A.  I see the area, but I'm not sure where I was

            6  located because there was so many things there.

            7       Q.  Okay.  But just do the best you can and put a W

            8  in the area where you were working at the time of the

            9  incident.  By that I mean where you were assigned to

           10  work that day.

           11                Okay.  Might want to write a little bit

           12  darker so we can see it, little bit bigger, little bit

           13  darker.

           14                Okay.  Now where were you actually at that

           15  particular area at the time the -- you heard the people

           16  yelling and you started to get off the scaffolding?

           17  Same area or different area?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  Okay.  Then besides the W, if that's where you

           20  were working, I want you to write the letter I.  By the

           21  letter W where you wrote, put the letter I.

           22                Okay.  Now you said you never saw the fire

           23  because the pipes and the building was in your way.

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  Okay.  Can you find on the map where you first

                                                                      68



            1  saw smoke?  And if you don't remember, that's okay, too.

            2       A.  I don't remember very well.

            3       Q.  Okay.  Now write -- I want you to go to the

            4  area on the map.  And this is on 1014 that you're

            5  marking on.  I want you to mark with a letter E where

            6  you ended up at that muster point, that building you

            7  were at for three or four hours.  Can you locate it on

            8  the map?

            9       A.  It was at the entrance.

           10       Q.  Okay.  Write the word -- or the letter E, if

           11  you will, where you ended up.  That building.

           12                Okay.  So let me take a look at it, see if

           13  I can read your letters there.

           14                THE INTERPRETER:  That's E.

           15                MR. NEWTON:  E.  Okay.

           16                THE INTERPRETER:  And that's I there.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  All right.  I want you to

           18  circle the letter E so we can see it better on the map.

           19  Okay?

           20                There we go.  Okay.  And that was also the

           21  muster point, right?

           22                THE INTERPRETER:  (In Spanish) Si.

           23       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Very good.

           24                Now at the time that you were working on

           25  the scaffolding, were you wearing any kind of PPE?

                                                                      69



            1       A.  (Via Interpreter) Yes.

            7       Q.  Steel toe boots?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  Did you have a radio of any kind?

           10       A.  No.

           11       Q.  Now after you waited for three or four hours at

           12  the building, were you allowed to go back in and get

           13  your truck so you could drive home?

           14       A.  We were escorted to the truck.

           15       Q.  So you're escorted back where you had your

           16  truck and welding rig, and you got in it and drove home,

           17  right?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  Okay.  When is the first time after May 19,

           20  2018, that you got medical care of any kind?

           21       A.  The therapies with a Dr. Zicterman.

           22       Q.  Doctor who?

           23       A.  Zicterman.  I do not know how to pronounce it.

           24       Q.  Was this at Texas Rehab?

           25       A.  Yes.

                                                                      70



            1       Q.  And where is Texas Rehab?

            2       A.  By the Monroe on 45.

            3       Q.  You're sent there by your attorney, right?

            4                THE INTERPRETER:  Bless you.

            5                MR. BICKHAM:  Bless you.

            6                MR. NEWTON:  Pardon me.

            7                MR. BICKHAM:  Bless you.

            8                THE INTERPRETER:  Bless you.

            9                MR. NEWTON:  Usually do three.  What was

           10  his answer?  I'm sorry.  I was sneezing.

           11                THE INTERPRETER:  45.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  You were sent there by your

           13  attorney, right?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  And who did you see there?

           16       A.  The therapist, Dr. Zicterman, Zictman [sic].  I

           17  do not know how to pronounce it.

           18       Q.  Was he a chiropractor?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  Did you tell him what happened to you?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Did you tell him how you had gotten hurt?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  And what did you tell him?

           25       A.  That I hurt my knee.  I felt pain in my back

                                                                      71



            1  here by the neck and here by my waist as well as my left

            2  shoulder also.  A little bit.

            3       Q.  Did you tell him how much pain you were

            4  feeling?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst,

            7  what do you recall telling him your pain level was?

            8       A.  I think it was a 6.  I don't recall very well.

            9       Q.  Now if your medical records say that you told

           10  him it was a 4, would you disagree with that?

           11       A.  A little bit more.

           12       Q.  Okay.  But my question is, if the medical

           13  records say that you told him it was a 4, do you think

           14  they made a mistake and wrote down the wrong number?  Or

           15  is it possible that that's what you told him?

           16       A.  I don't remember what number I put on.

           17       Q.  So if it says number 4 out of 10 in your

           18  medical records, would you be okay with that?

           19       A.  I think it was more.

           20       Q.  But if it says 4, do you deny ever telling him

           21  it was a 4, or are you willing to go with what it says

           22  in your medical records?

           23       A.  I don't remember what I wrote down.

           24       Q.  Okay.  Do you recall telling him how you got

           25  hurt?

                                                                      72



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  What do you remember telling him?

            3       A.  That I had landed on my knees; that I had

            4  fallen off the ladder; that I had landed on concrete

            5  floor.

            6       Q.  Okay.  Did you tell it to the doctor or one of

            7  the staff members there?

            8       A.  Both.

            9       Q.  Mr. Arredondo, I've looked at your medical

           10  records from that day, and it doesn't say anything about

           11  falling down a ladder.

           12       A.  I do not understand the question of what is the

           13  point.

           14       Q.  Okay.  I've looked at the medical records for

           15  that day at Texas Rehab, and it doesn't say anything

           16  about you telling him that you had fallen down a ladder

           17  coming down from the scaffolding.

           18       A.  It was a long time ago.  I don't remember what

           19  I said.

           20       Q.  What it does say in your medical records that

           21  day is that you were hurt in a motor vehicle accident.

           22       A.  Well, that's not -- that's not true.  I didn't

           23  say that.

           24       Q.  If it says that in your medical records that

           25  you were hurt in a motor vehicle accident, would you say

                                                                      73



            1  that the records are wrong?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  So you're saying that you never told them you

            4  were hurt in a car accident?

            5       A.  That is correct.

            6       Q.  I've looked throughout your medical records,

            7  Mr. Arredondo, and there is no mention in any of the

            8  medical records, either at Texas Rehab Institute or

            9  Dr. Tomaszek or Dr. DeBender or Cypress Orthopedics or

           10  Dr. Bell or Dr. LeBaud where you told any of them that

           11  you had fallen down the ladder climbing down off the

           12  scaffolding.

           13       A.  No.  I didn't tell them anything.

           14       Q.  Do you have any explanation for why there's no

           15  mention in your medical records of any doctor you've

           16  ever seen since the accident where it says you fell

           17  coming down the scaffold ladder?

           18       A.  I spoke -- I spoke to my attorneys first, and I

           19  explained them.

           20       Q.  Okay.

           21                MR. BICKHAM:  Don't --

           22                MR. NEWTON:  I don't want to know what you

           23  talked to your attorneys about.

           24       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  I want to know what you told

           25  the doctors.  And so my question to you, again, is, sir,

                                                                      74



            1  I've looked throughout your medical records that we've

            2  obtained since May 19th, 2018, and nowhere in those

            3  records does it say anything about you falling coming

            4  down the ladder getting off the scaffolding that day.

            5  Do you have any explanation for that?

            6       A.  I went there and explained to them the problem

            7  that I had, and that is where I was sent.  I had

            8  difficulty talking to them.

            9       Q.  How did you have difficulty talking to them?

           10  Weren't you talking with interpreters?

           11       A.  I didn't -- deemed important for me to say it

           12  because I was being represented.

           13                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  I'm going to object as

           14  nonresponsive.

           15       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Each place where you went to

           16  get medical treatment, did you talk to someone who spoke

           17  Spanish?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  You remember seeing Dr. DeBender in August of

           20  2018?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  And you recall telling him that while working

           23  as a welder on scaffolding, you stepped into some of the

           24  scaffolding, lost your balance, and twisted your right

           25  knee?

                                                                      75



            1       A.  I don't remember.  This was a year ago.

            2       Q.  So you don't recall what you told Dr. Bender --

            3  DeBender?

            4       A.  No.

            5       Q.  You recall seeing Dr. Pierre LeBaud -- and

            6  that's L-E-B-A-U-D -- in January of 2019?

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  Did you tell him what happened to you when you

            9  got hurt?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  What do you recall telling Dr. LeBaud?

           12       A.  I don't remember very well.

           13       Q.  It says in Dr. LeBaud's records from

           14  January 29, 2019, that you were trying to escape the

           15  area of the explosion; you crawled and injured your

           16  right knee.  Do you recall telling Dr. LeBaud that?

           17       A.  I don't remember that.

           18       Q.  But you don't dispute it if that's what it says

           19  in his records, right?

           20       A.  I don't remember saying that.

           21       Q.  But you don't deny saying that, do you?

           22       A.  I don't remember.

           23       Q.  Did you end up getting some MRIs on your -- any

           24  part of your body?

           25       A.  Yes.

                                                                      76



            1       Q.  What part of your body did you have MRIs on?

            2       A.  Here on my neck.

            3       Q.  Where else?

            4       A.  In my knee.

            5       Q.  And where else?

            6       A.  No more.

            7       Q.  And where did you get those MRIs done?

            8       A.  It's called Opus MRI.

            9       Q.  And why did you go there?

           10       A.  For an MRI.

           11       Q.  Who sent you there, though?

           12       A.  My attorneys.

           13       Q.  Did he find any problem on your MRIs that you

           14  can remember?

           15       A.  I cannot -- I cannot explain that.  I do not

           16  know.  I don't remember.  The doctor did find something,

           17  but I could not explain -- I don't know what the name of

           18  it is.

           19       Q.  Was this something they found in your knee?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  You recall them telling you it was a cyst of

           22  some sort?

           23       A.  Yes.  It was a cyst.  Yes.  And a problem under

           24  my knee.  But I do not remember the name of it.

           25       Q.  Okay.  Does the word Baker's cyst mean anything

                                                                      77



            1  to you?

            2       A.  I don't remember.

            3       Q.  Now did you go to any kind of physical therapy

            4  or treatment of any kind after you went to that first

            5  doctor at Texas Rehab?

            6       A.  After the knee?

            7       Q.  After you went to Texas Rehab that first time,

            8  which, according to our records, was May 29, 2018.  That

            9  would be 10 days after the accident.  Does that sound

           10  right to you?

           11       A.  Correct.

           12       Q.  Okay.  Did you receive any therapy of any kind

           13  on any part of your body after seeing the chiropractor

           14  at Texas Rehab?

           15       A.  I was ten months, but I never -- I didn't see

           16  anybody else afterwards.

           17       Q.  Okay.  Is it your testimony that you went to

           18  therapy for ten months?

           19       A.  I'm not quite sure.  It's more or less.

           20       Q.  Okay.  Because your records only indicate a

           21  couple of months.

           22       A.  No.  It was more than that.

           23       Q.  So how many months do you recall going to

           24  therapy?

           25       A.  I don't remember very well.

                                                                      78



            1       Q.  Do you have any idea at all?

            2       A.  I think that -- I'm not quite sure how much.

            3       Q.  Was it three or four months?

            4       A.  More.

            5       Q.  Was it five or six months?

            6       A.  I'm not quite sure.

            7       Q.  Where was this therapy done?

            8       A.  With Dr. Zicterman.

            9       Q.  Was it at Texas Rehab?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  What kind of therapy did he give you there?

           12       A.  Put some -- put a blanket on my back and some

           13  wires on my back and also some wires on my knee.

           14       Q.  And what did these wires do?

           15       A.  I do not know.  They just put them there.

           16       Q.  And how long were these therapy sessions at

           17  Texas Rehab?  How long each time?

           18       A.  Around 20 minutes.

           19       Q.  How many days a week would you go to these

           20  therapy sessions at Texas Rehab?

           21       A.  I'm not sure.  I'm not -- I don't remember.

           22       Q.  Was it more than one day a week?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  Was it more than two days a week?

           25       A.  I'm not quite sure.

                                                                      79



            1       Q.  Okay.  So maybe one to two times a week.  Does

            2  that sound right?

            3       A.  Twice a week.

            4       Q.  Would they do the same therapy to you each

            5  time?

            6       A.  Sometimes would be some exercises with a ball.

            7       Q.  Okay.  Anything else?

            8       A.  Then I would turn a wheel with my right hand

            9  and then with my left hand.

           10       Q.  The main area of your body that was causing you

           11  problems was your right knee; is that right

           12  Mr. Arredondo -- Arredondo?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  Didn't keep you from working, though, right?

           15       A.  No.  But I worked with difficulty.

           16       Q.  But it didn't keep you from working, right?

           17       A.  I had to work.

           18                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; nonresponsive.

           19       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  The problems you were having

           20  with your right knee did not prevent you from working

           21  like you worked before the accident, right?

           22       A.  No.

           23       Q.  And no problems that you had with your neck and

           24  your back kept you from work, right?

           25       A.  It didn't prevent me, but it did cause pain.

                                                                      80



            1       Q.  The only time you missed from work was when you

            2  would go to these physical therapy sessions, right?

            3       A.  Yes.  I would leave early.

            4       Q.  Or for another doctor appointment, right?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  Did you say you went to see a Dr. Tomaszek?

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  Where is his office at?

            9       A.  Greenspoint.  But I do not recall the address.

           10       Q.  And why did you go see him?

           11       A.  Because there was some findings in the MRI here

           12  in my neck and my lower back.

           13       Q.  How many times did you see Dr. Tomaszek?

           14       A.  Once.

           15       Q.  And were you sent there by your lawyer?

           16       A.  Yes.

           17       Q.  What did Dr. Tomaszek tell you?

           18       A.  He told me there was no major issues; that the

           19  problem was going to go away with some pills.

           20       Q.  Did you give -- did he give you any pills?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  What area of your body was he saying the

           23  problems would go away with with some pills?

           24       A.  Here, my back, my waist.

           25       Q.  And what kind of pills did he give you?

                                                                      81



            1       A.  I don't remember the name.

            2       Q.  What were they for?

            3       A.  For -- for the problem that I had, but I did

            4  not know the name of the problem.

            5       Q.  Well, were they pain pills, or were they

            6  anti-inflammatories?  Or what do you recall?

            7       A.  I do not know.

            8       Q.  Did he give you the actual pills, or did he

            9  give you a prescription?

           10       A.  Prescription.

           11       Q.  And where did you have that filled?

           12       A.  At Walgreens.

           13       Q.  Same Walgreens you told me about before?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  And did you have it filled just that one time?

           16       A.  Once.

           17       Q.  No refills?

           18       A.  No.

           19       Q.  Did you take all the medicine or just some of

           20  it?

           21       A.  All of it.

           22       Q.  How many pills were there?

           23       A.  I do not know.

           24       Q.  You take it every day or every other day or

           25  once a week or what?

                                                                      82



            1       A.  Once a day.

            2       Q.  Until the pills were gone?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  Did it help any pain that you were having?

            5       A.  Yes.  Very much.

            6       Q.  And that didn't keep you from working either,

            7  right?

            8       A.  No.

            9       Q.  Okay.  No, it did not keep you from working,

           10  right?

           11       A.  No.

           12       Q.  Now you recall being told by the people who saw

           13  your knee that -- or saw the MRIs of your knee that the

           14  only thing they found was a cyst behind your kneecap?

           15       A.  Yes.

           16       Q.  They said everything else was fine, right -- I

           17  didn't mean to cut you off.

           18                THE INTERPRETER:  Sorry.

           19                THE WITNESS:  Something else under my knee

           20  here.  I do not know the name of it.

           21       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  I've been looking

           22  through your medical records, and the only things it

           23  says that they found was a cyst; that everything else in

           24  your knee was normal.

           25       A.  The doctor told me I had something else here.

                                                                      83



            1       Q.  On your knee?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  Do you remember what he told you?

            4       A.  That I had a problem.  I do not know the name

            5  of it.  I do not know what it was.  I can't remember.

            6       Q.  Which doctor told you that?

            7       A.  LeBron.

            8       Q.  LeBaud?

            9       A.  LeBaud.

           10       Q.  Because I've looked at all your medical records

           11  and the only thing that they found wrong with your knee

           12  was that you had a cyst.

           13                MR. BICKHAM:  Object to the form.

           14                He can answer.

           15       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  You can answer.

           16                That's what I'm trying to get to.  If you

           17  said that there's something else that you were told was

           18  wrong with your knee, I need to find out what that was.

           19       A.  I do not know the name of it.

           20       Q.  Now Dr. LeBaud offered to aspirate or to drain

           21  the fluid out of the cyst.  Do you recall him telling

           22  you that?

           23       A.  I don't remember.

           24       Q.  Do you recall him telling you that he could

           25  aspirate or drain the cyst but that you told him you

                                                                      84



            1  wanted to have the cyst removed?  Does that sound right?

            2       A.  Oh, yes.

            3       Q.  Okay.  Why did you want to have the cyst

            4  removed instead of just having it drained like he said

            5  he could do?

            6       A.  I thought it was the best.

            7       Q.  Did this doctor tell you he thought it was best

            8  that you remove it, or did he tell you something

            9  different?

           10       A.  He told me he was going to remove it, for it to

           11  prevent it from coming back.

           12       Q.  Well, I looked at your records for Dr. LeBaud,

           13  and I'm reading from your records right now.  And he

           14  says:  "Since the patient is adamant and wants to have

           15  the cyst removed and not aspirated, I will perform the

           16  excision of the Baker cyst, although I'm not convinced

           17  that this is really necessary."

           18                Do you recall him telling you that?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  But you decided to have it removed anyway?

           21       A.  Yes.  Because it bothered a lot.

           22       Q.  Do you remember having surgery on the 20th of

           23  March, 2019, to have the cyst removed from your knee?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  And you went home the same day, right?

                                                                      85



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  You didn't stay overnight in the hospital?

            3       A.  No.

            4       Q.  I'm looking at your doctor's note from the

            5  operation he performed where he described the procedure

            6  he did, and Dr. LeBaud says:  "There was no evidence of

            7  a tear of the medial meniscus.  The notch was also

            8  normal with normal ACL and normal PCL.  The lateral

            9  compartment was pristine."

           10                Do you recall him telling you that?

           11       A.  I don't remember very well.  I don't remember.

           12       Q.  Is it possible he told you that and you don't

           13  remember?

           14       A.  I don't remember.

           15       Q.  Okay.  I'm looking at the records from

           16  Dr. LeBaud, and he doesn't say there was anything wrong

           17  with your knee except for that Baker's cyst that he

           18  removed.

           19       A.  He told me I had something -- he -- he did --

           20  did some aspiration of something inside of my knee.  I

           21  do not know what it is.  And it was a by-product of a

           22  blow.

           23       Q.  Okay.  You say that he told you that he removed

           24  something from your knee that was a by-product of a blow

           25  to your knee?

                                                                      86



            1       A.  That he thought so.

            2       Q.  Okay.  Because there's nothing in your medical

            3  records that says anything like that, Mr. Arredondo.

            4       A.  I do not know if he told me that.

            5       Q.  Do you have any explanation for why it doesn't

            6  say anything about a blow to your knee causing any

            7  problem with your knee?

            8       A.  I do not know.

            9       Q.  Did he tell you what causes a Baker's cyst?

           10       A.  No.  I don't remember.

           11       Q.  Did he tell you that a Baker's cyst is commonly

           12  caused by arthritis?

           13       A.  I don't remember.  It's a long time ago.

           14       Q.  Is it possible he told you it was caused by

           15  arthritis; you just don't remember sitting here today?

           16       A.  I don't remember.

           17       Q.  Remember going back to see the doctor eight

           18  days later?

           19       A.  For the surgery?

           20       Q.  Yes.

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  And it says:  "The patient is walking full

           23  weight bearing."

           24                In other words, you were able to walk

           25  without difficulty.

                                                                      87



            1       A.  With a lot of difficulties.

            2       Q.  Okay.  But if they don't appear in your medical

            3  records, would you have any explanation why not?

            4       A.  He told me that he didn't want me to use a

            5  crutch; that he would like me to recover, do rehab

            6  without a crutch.

            7       Q.  When he operated on your knee and removed the

            8  cyst, did he tell you to do some exercises at home?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  And did you do those exercises at home?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  Did you do them exactly like he told you to?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  Well, I'm looking at your records of March 28,

           15  2019, Dr. Robert Bell.  Do you remember seeing Dr. Bell

           16  that day?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  And Dr. Bell says that, quote, The patient has

           19  not been compliant with his exercise and presents with a

           20  lag of extension, end quote.

           21       A.  I did the exercises when they told me to

           22  perform them eight days afterwards.

           23       Q.  Do you have any explanation for why it says in

           24  the records of Dr. Bell on March 28, 2019, that you had

           25  not been doing your exercises he gave you to do at home?

                                                                      88



            1       A.  Because he didn't tell me anything.  They told

            2  me this eight days afterwards.

            3       Q.  Well, you told me a minute ago, Mr. Arredondo,

            4  that the day of your surgery they gave you some

            5  exercises to do at home.  Is that not correct?

            6                MR. BICKHAM:  Objection; form.

            7                THE INTERPRETER:  Can I --

            8                MR. NEWTON:  Yeah.  Go ahead.

            9                MR. BICKHAM:  Yeah.  Go ahead.

           10                THE WITNESS:  They didn't tell me.  No.

           11  They didn't tell me.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  How long were you off work

           13  after surgery?

           14       A.  Up to now I haven't worked.

           15       Q.  But you've been looking for work, right?

           16       A.  Yes.

           17       Q.  No doctor's told you you can't work, right?

           18       A.  Yeah.  He told me I could go back to work.  I

           19  was discharged, but I have not been able to find a job.

           20       Q.  When do you recall being discharged to go back

           21  to work?

           22       A.  On June the 18th.

           24       Q.  But that is your signature on this page,

           25  correct?

                                                                      99



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  It's page 6 to Exhibit No. 1015, right?

            3       A.  I cannot see well.

            4       Q.  Look at the last page.  That is your signature,

            5  correct?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  Okay.  Now turn with me to page 3 of this

            8  document.  Says there that you worked from October 1,

            9  2018, to March 8, 2019, for Lexicon as a rig welder.  Is

           10  that correct?

           11       A.  Correct.

           12       Q.  Says your hourly wage was $52 an hour, correct?

           13       A.  Correct.

           14       Q.  That's a combination of what they pay you per

           15  hour as well as what they pay you for the lease and use

           16  of your welding rig, right?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  Okay.  And if you turn to page 4, the top of

           19  page 4, it says you work from March 13th, 2018, to

           20  September 27, 2018, as a rig welder for Force.  You see

           21  that?

           22                THE INTERPRETER:  Can you repeat the dates,

           23  please.

           24                MR. NEWTON:  Yes.  March 13, 2018, to

           25  September 27, 2018.

                                                                     100



            1                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

            2       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  And it shows your hourly wage

            3  there was $45 an hour.  You see that?

            4       A.  That is correct.

            5       Q.  And that's one of the reasons why you left and

            6  went to work for Lexicon is because they were paying you

            7  $8 an hour more, right?  $7 an hour.

            8       A.  Yes.  7.

            9       Q.  Yeah.

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Went to law school because they said there'd be

           12  no math.

           13                Look at answer number 5 on page 4.  You

           14  were asked to state the total amount of wages you earned

           15  in the 52 weeks prior to May 19, 2018.

           16       A.  I don't remember.

           17       Q.  Okay.  But you see it there on -- on the page,

           18  number 5:  "Please state the total amount of wages you

           19  earned in the 52 weeks prior to May 19, 2018"?

           20       A.  No.  It has nothing there.  I don't remember.

           21       Q.  But do you see those words there on the page?

           22       A.  5?

           23       Q.  Number 5.  Do you see where it says:  "Please

           24  state the total amount of wages you earned in the

           25  52 weeks prior to May 19, 2018"?

                                                                     101



            1       A.  Yes.  I can see it.

            2       Q.  Okay.  And it says:  "Answer:  From May 19,

            3  2017, to May 19, 2018, I estimate my salary to be" --

            4  and there's a bunch of capital Xs there.

            5                Do you see that?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  Okay.  Can you tell us today how much you made

            8  in the year before the accident of May 19, 2018?

            9       A.  I don't remember.

           10       Q.  Now you know someone named Raul Mendilla

           11  (phonetic)?

           12                THE INTERPRETER:  Let me see the name, sir.

           13                MR. NEWTON:  May not be pronouncing it

           14  right.

           15                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           16       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Who is Raul Mendilla?

           17       A.  A coworker.

           18       Q.  Okay.  Were you working with him on the day of

           19  the accident?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  Okay.  When I asked you earlier if you could

           22  tell me who you were working with, you didn't give me

           23  that name, did you?

           24       A.  He was a lead man.  Something like that.

           25       Q.  Did he work for Force?

                                                                     102



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  But were you actually working with him at the

            3  time of the accident?

            4       A.  I was with a pipefitter -- fitter and the --

            5  a -- the helper.

            6       Q.  Okay.  Well, if you look at the answer to

            7  number 8, top of page 5, it says:  "At the time of the

            8  explosion, Raul Mendilla and I were welding in the unit

            9  1400 area."

           10                Is that a correct statement, or is that an

           11  incorrect statement?

           12       A.  It is correct, but he was above me.  He was not

           13  in the same place.

           14       Q.  By above you, what do you mean?  Above you in

           15  rank?

           16       A.  No.  Up.  Working.

           17       Q.  He was working above you on a different

           18  scaffolding?

           19       A.  Yes.  I was on the platform.

           20       Q.  Okay.  But you were not actually working with

           21  Raul; is that right?

           22       A.  He was close -- he was nearby.

           23       Q.  But he was working above you.

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  What is his job?  Do you know?

                                                                     103



            1       A.  He was a lead man and a pipefitter.

            2       Q.  Lead man and a pipefitter?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  So he's not a welder like you?

            5       A.  No.

            6       Q.  And he wasn't next to you on the platform like

            7  these other two guys were, right?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  I'm looking at your answers to -- or your

           10  responses to requests for production.  And it says you

           11  recall texting some coworkers on the day of the

           12  accident.  Is that a true statement?

           13       A.  That is not correct.

           14       Q.  That is not correct.  Okay.

           15                So you don't recall texting any coworkers

           16  on the day of the accident?

           17       A.  No.

           18       Q.  Okay.

           19                (Exhibit 1016 marked.)

           20       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Let me show you what's been

           21  marked as Exhibit No. 1016 to your deposition.

           22                THE INTERPRETER:  1016?

           23                MR. NEWTON:  Yes.

           24       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Is this a picture of the

           25  outside of the Texas Rehab Institute where you went for

                                                                     104



            1  medical care?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  And that's the place you went to, right?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  Along the Gulf Freeway?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  You recall going to a training course when you

            8  were with Force and -- about March 9, 2018?

            9       A.  I don't remember.

           10       Q.  Okay.  I'm looking at your records from Force,

           11  your employment records.  Force Corporation.  And it

           12  says that you attended two required training courses.

           13  One was for Kuraray at the EVAL site on March 9, 2018,

           14  and another one was Basic Plus training that you

           15  attended in February of 2018.

           16       A.  Probably right.  I just don't remember this.

           17       Q.  Okay.  So if it says it in your records, you

           18  don't dispute that?

           19       A.  If it says so, yes.

           20       Q.  Okay.  And was that safety training you

           21  received at both of those occasions?

           22       A.  I don't remember.  It's a long time ago.

           23       Q.  So it could be safety training; you just don't

           24  remember one way or the other?

           25       A.  No.  It's a long time ago.

                                                                     105



            1       Q.  So if someone says it was safety training, you

            2  wouldn't disagree with that?

            3       A.  You're probably right.  I just don't remember.

            4                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  I'll pass the witness.

            5  Thank you, sir.

            6                MR. BICKHAM:  Got some follow-up questions.

            7                         EXAMINATION

            8  BY MR. BICKHAM:

            9       Q.  Juan, do you remember being asked some

           10  questions about the number of months that you had

           11  therapy with Dr. Zicterman?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  And do you recall what your response was?

           14       A.  I said 10 -- 10 months, but I don't remember

           15  very well.  I'm not quite sure.

           16       Q.  All right.  I would like for you to count along

           17  with me as I read from Dr. Zicterman's billing records

           18  regarding the months that you had therapy.  May, 2018;

           19  June, 2018; July, 2018; August, 2018; September, 2018;

           20  October, 2018; November, 2018; February, 2018 -- excuse

           21  me -- 2019; and March, 2019?

           22                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; form.

           23       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  How many months is that?

           24                MR. NEWTON:  Same objection.

           25                THE WITNESS:  I didn't count them.

                                                                     106



            1       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  On my count, that's ten

            2  months.

            3                MR. NEWTON:  Form.

            4       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  Is that what you recall?

            5                MR. NEWTON:  Same objection.  Leading.

            6       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  You can --

            7                THE INTERPRETER:  Can I --

            8                MR. BICKHAM:  Yeah.  You can go ahead and

            9  ask the question.

           10                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           11       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  Also, there were some

           12  questions about whether you told any medical provider

           13  that you had fallen.  Do you remember that?

           14       A.  No.

           15       Q.  Do you remember when the other lawyer was

           16  asking you questions about whether you told any doctors

           17  you had fallen?

           18       A.  I don't remember.

           19       Q.  All right.  Well, I'm going to hand you a page

           20  of the records from Cypress Orthopedics, and if you

           21  could just read for me what is written in yellow.

           22                MR. NEWTON:  What date is it, Tom?

           23                MR. BICKHAM:  January 29th, 2019.  The

           24  highlighted portion.

           25                THE WITNESS:  I fell down at the time of

                                                                     107



            1  the explosion.

            2                MR. NEWTON:  May I see it, please?  Oh,

            3  it's in Spanish.

            4                MR. BICKHAM:  Yeah.

            5                MR. NEWTON:  Would you translate that for

            6  me?

            7                THE INTERPRETER:  Yes.  "Explain the

            8  accident.  I fell at the time of the explosion."

            9                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.

           10                MR. BICKHAM:  Thanks.

           11       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  You were also asked some

           12  questions about the results of the MRI of your knee.  Do

           13  you remember that?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  At least the way I understood it, the

           16  suggestion was made that the only thing that was found

           17  on your MRI was that you had a cyst.  The MRI that I'm

           18  looking at of your knee says ACL low grade sprain

           19  without evidence of tear.  Do you recall the doctor ever

           20  explaining that to you?

           21                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; form.  And what are

           22  you reading from and what date?

           23                MR. BICKHAM:  The MRI of the right knee on

           24  June 28th, 2018.

           25                MR. NEWTON:  And who is the provider?

                                                                     108



            1                MR. BICKHAM:  Opus MRI.

            2                MR. NEWTON:  June 28.

            3                MR. BICKHAM:  Yes.  Exam date, June 28,

            5       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  There's --

            6                THE INTERPRETER:  I got it.  I got it.

            7                MR. BICKHAM:  Okay.

            8                THE WITNESS:  No.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  All right.  The first

           10  reference in the -- in Dr. Bell's records that you were

           11  provided an exercise program is dated April 18th, 2019.

           12  Do you recall Dr. Bell going over an exercise program

           13  for you on April 18th, 2019?

           14       A.  He told me to perform them, but I didn't see

           15  them.

           16                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; form.

           17  Nonresponsive.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  Was it Dr. Bell that

           19  explained to you that you needed to do this home

           20  exercise program?

           21                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; form, leading.

           22                THE WITNESS:  Dr. Bell, no.  Dr. LeBaud,

           23  yes.  I don't remember which one of them.

           24       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  Okay.  In any event, one of

           25  the physicians explained to you that you needed to do

                                                                     109



            1  home exercises?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  You were also asked questions about whether you

            4  met with somebody in my office regarding your answers to

            5  some questions.

            6       A.  No.

            7       Q.  Do you recall that question -- those questions

            8  from the defense lawyer?

            9       A.  I don't know which one it is.

           10       Q.  Okay.  In any event, I also did a search of my

           11  calendar, and it says that on June 6th, 2019, at

           12  3:00 p.m. you and Martin met with my assistant, Maura

           13  Acosta, who is a bilingual clerk here.  Do you recall

           14  that meeting?

           15                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; form, leading.

           16                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  Okay.  You were also --

           18  question was posed to you that the only thing on the

           19  operative report was the fact that you had a Baker's

           20  cyst.  Do you remember that?  That question being asked

           21  by the defense lawyer?

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  Okay.  You had mentioned that you also recall

           24  the doctor saying there was something wrong underneath.

           25  Do you remember that?

                                                                     110



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  Okay.  The operative report that I have dated

            3  March 20th, 2019, has two findings.  One is the Baker's

            4  cyst, but then it also states that you had a chondral

            5  lesion medial femoral condyle of the right knee.

            6                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; form, leading.

            7       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  Could that be what the doctor

            8  was explaining to you was the second thing wrong with

            9  your knee, not just the Baker's cyst?

           10                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; form, leading.

           11                THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. BICKHAM)  All right.  Once one of the

           13  physicians explained to you that you needed to do the

           14  home exercises, did you do the home exercises?

           15       A.  Yes.

           16       Q.  And have you had a pretty good result from the

           17  surgery that was performed?

           18                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; form.

           19                THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I do have some

           20  discomfort.

           21                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; nonresponsive.

           22                MR. BICKHAM:  All right.  I'll pass the

           23  witness.  Nothing else.

           24                MR. NEWTON:  One just question to

           25  follow-up.

            1                     FURTHER EXAMINATION

            2  BY MR. NEWTON:

            3       Q.  The document that your lawyer showed you from

            4  Cypress Orthopedics -- Orthopedics, January 29, 2019.

            5                MR. NEWTON:  If you can find that again,

            6  Tom.

            7                MR. BICKHAM:  Yeah.

            8                MR. NEWTON:  Save some time.  Show that

            9  back to him.

           10                MR. BICKHAM:  Was that the one of the

           11  description of --

           12                MR. NEWTON:  Yeah.  In Spanish.

           13                MR. BICKHAM:  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I got

           14  that.  It's actually the only document that he filled

           15  out of when the incident took place.  Here you go.

           16                MR. NEWTON:  Could I get a copy of this

           17  or --

           18                MR. BICKHAM:  Yeah.  Of course.

           19                MR. NEWTON:  Let's get a copy of it.  Can I

           20  mark this, have this marked as exhibit?

           21                MR. BICKHAM:  Yes, yes.  And then I'll put

           22  my copy back in here.

           23                MR. NEWTON:  Cool.

           24                (Exhibit 1017 marked.)

           25       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Arredondo, let me show you

                                                                     112



            1  what's been marked as Exhibit 1017 to your deposition.

            2  You see the highlighted part that your lawyer asked you

            3  about a minute ago?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  And this is -- apparently is an excerpt from

            6  your records from Cypress Orthopedics.  You see the

            7  language there in Spanish, the wording there in Spanish?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  Is that your handwriting, or is that someone

           10  else's?

           11       A.  That's mine.

           12       Q.  Okay.  And it says:  "I fell at time of the

           13  explosion."

           14                Is that correct?

           15       A.  Yes.

           16       Q.  It doesn't say anywhere on that piece of paper

           17  that you fell down the ladder of a scaffold, does it,

           18  sir?

           19       A.  I -- I didn't remember to write it down at that

           20  time.

           21                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; nonresponsive.

           22       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  It doesn't say there -- this

           23  your handwriting -- that you fell down the ladder of a

           24  scaffold, does it?

           25       A.  It doesn't say so, but just -- I didn't

                                                                     113



            1  remember to write it down.

            2                MR. NEWTON:  Objection to the nonresponsive

            3  portion of the answer.

            4                Thank you.  I pass the witness.

            5                MR. BICKHAM:  Nothing further.

            6                MR. NEWTON:  Thank you, sir.  We're done.

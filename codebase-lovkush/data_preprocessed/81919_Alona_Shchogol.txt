           16          Q.       Could you please state your full

           17    name for the record.

           18          A.       Alona Shchogol.

           19          Q.       Good morning, Ms. Shchogol.  My

           20    name is Michael Schlagnhaufer.  I represent

           21    Kelly O' Donnell in a lawsuit you brought

           22    against her regarding an accident on October

           23    31, 2017.  Is that your understanding?

           24          A.       Correct.  Yes.

           25          Q.       Okay.  I'm here to take your

                                                               6



            1    deposition today.  Have you ever been part of a

            2    deposition before?

            3          A.       No.

            4          Q.       Just do me a favor and first,

            5    you want to make sure you keep all of your

            6    answers verbal.  Yes and no rather than

            7    gestures or uh-uh and uh-uh and things like

            8    that.  Okay?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       Is English your first language?

           11          A.       No.

           12          Q.       What is your first language?

           13          A.       Russian.

           14          Q.       Russian?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       But you seem extraordinarily

           17    fluent with almost no accent.  You're able to

           18    understand me and communicate in English fine?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       You don't need a Russian

           21    interpreter or anything like that?

           22          A.       No.

           23          Q.       So to that end and sort of along

           24    that line, if you don't understand one of my

           25    questions today, make sure you tell me that.

            1          A.       Okay.

            2          Q.       Ask me to rephrase, clarify, or

            3    repeat it until you do understand what I'm

            4    asking you.

            5          A.       Okay.

            6          Q.       I don't intend to try and trick

            7    you, but sometimes I know and understand what

            8    question I'm asking, but it's not quite as

            9    clear when it comes out of my mouth.  Fair?

           10          A.       Fair.

           11          Q.       If at any point you remember

           12    something from a previous question that you

           13    wanted to add or you wanted to correct an

           14    answer you did before, just tell me that and we

           15    can do that.  Okay?

           16          A.       Okay.

           17          Q.       Have you had an opportunity to

           18    speak with your attorney today before this

           19    deposition?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       Do you need to speak to him at

           22    all right now before we start?

           23          A.       No.

           24          Q.       Okay.  What's your date of

           25    birth?

                                                               31



            1          Q.       Do these appear to be from the

            2    scene of the accident?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       The ones marked P-2 and P-3,

            5    that's your vehicle?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       And P-2, can you describe the

           16    there was a separation here (indicating).  This

           18    way it used to open.

           19          Q.       Okay.  Just so I make sure that

           20    I'm seeing what you're describing and the

           21    record is clear, you're kind of indicating that

           22    the bumper looks like it's detached somewhat

           23    from the panel above it.  Is that fair to say?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       Okay.  And you're saying that

            5    vehicle from the accident that is not shown in

            6    those photos?

            8          form.  Only because it may call for an

            9          expert opinion on things you may not be

           10          able to see unless the car was on a lift.

         24         Q.  I'm showing you a document that

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - direc6



          1    we've had the court reporter mark as

          2    D-Margolies-1.  Can you identify that for

          3    me?

          4         A.  That's my C.V.

          5         Q.  And is that a complete and

          6    accurate copy of your C.V.?

          7         A.  Yes, it is.

          8         Q.  Could you briefly describe for the

          9    Judge your education.

         10         A.  I went to college at Emory

         11    University in Atlanta for four years.  Then

         12    I came back to Philadelphia, where I'm

         13    from, and I did four years of medical

         14    school at Temple University.  I did a

         15    one-year medical internship at the

         16    University of Pennsylvania, a three-year

         17    neurology residency at the University of

         18    Pennsylvania, and then a one-year

         19    neuromuscular fellowship also at Penn.

         20         Q.  Are you Board Certified?

         21         A.  Yes, I am.

         22         Q.  And in what area?

         23         A.  Neurology.

         24         Q.  And since when have you held

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - direc7



          1    that?

          2         A.  Since 2000.

          3         Q.  Could you briefly describe for the

          4    Judge your clinical practice?

          5         A.  Sure.  I have an office practice

          6    that I'm at Monday through Friday where I

          7    see out patients, and then typically once a

          8    week and then about once every fourth

          9    weekend, I cover the hospital so I,

         10    obviously, see the more acute and sicker

         11    patients.

         12         Q.  If I were to ask you additional

         13    questions as it pertains to your education,

         14    your scholastic efforts, your practice,

         15    would your testimony be consistent with

         16    what you've set forth in your Curriculum

         17    Vitae?

         18         A.  Yes.

         19         Q.  Without getting any into specifics

         20    yet, did you perform an independent

         21    neurological evaluation concerning Christy

         22    Daccardi, the Claimant in this case?

         23         A.  Yes, I did.

         24               MR. BUCILLA:  And at this

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - direc8



          1         time, I'm going to ask that the

          2         C.V. be attached to the

          3         transcript, and I move for its

          4         admission.

          5               And I would offer the

          6         Doctor to testify as one of the

          7         Employer's experts in this

          8         matter subject to any questions

          9         that Mr. Kenny has on

         10         qualifications at this time.

         11               MR. KENNY:  I don't have

         12         any questions for the Doctor on

         13         qualifications, and I don't have

         14         any objection to attaching the

         15         C.V. as well.  Thanks.

         16    BY MR. BUCILLA:

         17         Q.  Doctor, your evaluation of Ms.

         18    Daccardi, on specifically what date did

         19    that occur?

         20         A.  October 3rd, 2018.

         21         Q.  On October 3rd of 2018, did you

         22    receive a history from Ms. Daccardi?

         23         A.  Yes I did.

         24         Q.  Could you describe that history

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - direc9



          1    for the Judge, please?

          2         A.  Sure.  She said that about

          3    15 months earlier, so July 8th, 2017, she

          4    was involved in an accident.  She said that

          5    she was a restaurant manager, and she was

          6    walking between rooms when she slipped on a

          7    rug and fell onto her right side.  She said

          8    that she hit her head and her shoulder, and

          9    then landed on her butt.

         10             She said that she blacked out for

         11    a brief period of time, meaning that she

         12    had lost consciousness.  She reported that

         13    when she came to, she was sort of helped up

         14    by coworkers and was taken to an Urgent

         15    Care center.  She thought at that time that

         16    she was suffering from headaches,

         17    dizziness, nausea, vomiting and imbalance.

         18    She said she was diagnosed as having a

         19    concussion and was sent to a concussion

         20    specialist, who then sent her for different

         21    modalities of treatment, and she was given

         22    different medications for the symptoms that

         23    she had.

         24             In addition, she said that she had

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire10



          1    musculoskeletal injuries on top of her

          2    concussion.  She went to the Einstein

          3    Neuroscience Center where she was evaluated

          4    by a psychiatrist.  She was evaluated by an

          5    another concussion specialist and again

          6    received more types of therapy.  She said

          7    that after her fall, she began to

          8    experience headaches.

          9             She said that she really didn't

         10    have a significant history of headaches,

         11    and after her fall, she developed headaches

         12    which had not improved at all.  So, in the

         13    15 months between her accident and me

         14    seeing her, her headaches had not improved.

         15    She said that with the headaches, she can

         16    experience symptoms like nausea, and that

         17    bright lights and loud noises bother her.

         18    She also reported that following her

         19    injury, she had imbalance, and her

         20    imbalance had only improved about

         21    30 percent.

         22             Next she said that she had

         23    cognitive problems, so she had difficulty

         24    with her memory, maintaining her attention,

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire11



          1    concentration, and up to ten times a day,

          2    she would completely forget what she was

          3    doing.  Unusually, she reported that her

          4    cognition was actually getting worse.  I

          5    asked her if she had received any sort of

          6    formal cognitive or neuropsychological

          7    evaluation or therapy, and she didn't think

          8    that she had had any.

          9             I asked her, you know, did she

         10    think it was unusual that some of her

         11    symptoms were actually getting worse, and

         12    she said that she didn't really have an

         13    explanation for why that would occur.  She

         14    knew concussions typically get better, and

         15    she had said usually more on the sooner

         16    side than the later side.  But now, here we

         17    were 15 months out, and her memory and

         18    cognition were getting worse.  And, again,

         19    she couldn't explain sort of that

         20    inconsistency.

         21             She also reported that she

         22    developed tinnitus or ringing in her ears,

         23    and she said that too had been getting

         24    worse.  Again, there was no explanation how

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire12



          1    that could be getting worse, and she hadn't

          2    been evaluated by an ears, nose and throat

          3    doctor.

          4             I had asked her if she had been

          5    involved in any other accidents, and she

          6    said that when she was 14, she got thrown

          7    off of a horse, hit her head and had a

          8    concussion for about three months.  And in

          9    1986, she had a car accident, and while she

         10    did hit her face, she didn't think she had

         11    a concussion at that time.

         12         Q.  Did she tell you about any other

         13    more recent injuries besides this work

         14    injury?

         15         A.  No, she did not.

         16         Q.  Did you receive any sort of past

         17    surgical history?

         18         A.  Yes.  So from a medical

         19    perspective, she said that she didn't have

         20    any long medical problems, but that she had

         21    had two surgeries.  One was an

         22    appendectomy, and the other was back

         23    surgery to her lumbar spine in 1993.

         24         Q.  Did you receive a social history?

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire13



          1         A.  Yes.  She said that she was single

          2    and had one child.  She denied any history

          3    of drinking, smoking or drug use, and she

          4    had not returned to work in those

          5    15 months.

          6         Q.  On October 3rd, 2018, did you

          7    perform a physical examination?

          8         A.  Yes, I did.

          9         Q.  Could you describe that for the

         10    Judge, please?

         11         A.  Sure.  So the whole purpose of a

         12    neurologic evaluation is to assess the

         13    brain, the spine and the nerves, so we

         14    evaluate someone's cognition.  While we

         15    don't do a formal neuropsychological

         16    evaluation, there's obviously not enough

         17    time.  We assess someone's thinking, their

         18    language.

         19             Next we move on to the cranial

         20    nerve examination where we evaluate the

         21    nerves that control your vision, your eye

         22    movements, your facial movements, the

         23    movement of your mouth and tongue.

         24             Next we go on to a motor

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire14



          1    examination where we evaluate someone's

          2    power, the strength in their arms and legs.

          3    We do a sensory examination where we look

          4    at the sensation to different modalities

          5    like touch and temperature, vibration.

          6             Next we check someone's ability to

          7    move their arms and legs in a coordinated

          8    fashion.  We have someone walk, and we

          9    evaluate their gait.  And then we finish up

         10    with the reflexes.  We take good old reflex

         11    hammer and check the reflexes in the arms

         12    and legs, and her evaluation was pretty

         13    unremarkable.  There's no evidence on her

         14    exam that she had any injury to her brain

         15    or spine, or nerves.

         16         Q.  As part of your evaluation, did

         17    you have records available for your

         18    review?

         19         A.  Yes, I did.

         20         Q.  And did you have available the

         21    Judge's decision from December 12th, 2017,

         22    Doctor?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  You mentioned previously, a moment

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire15



          1    ago, that her physical neurologic

          2    examination was unremarkable.  Were there

          3    any objective findings on your examination

          4    of ongoing concussion?

          5         A.  No, there weren't.

          6         Q.  As part of the records you had

          7    available for your review, did they include

          8    preinjury records from December 2016 from

          9    Jefferson Urgent Care?

         10         A.  Yes.

         11         Q.  Did they include records for three

         12    dates of service from PA Internal Medicine

         13    & Geriatrics?

         14         A.  Yes.

         15         Q.  Did they include records from Bryn

         16    Mawr Hospital Emergency Room on March 24th,

         17    2017, Doctor?

         18         A.  Yes.

         19         Q.  From Aria 3B Orthopaedics from

         20    May 2017?

         19         A.  Yes, I did.

         20         Q.  Any studies concerning the head or

         21    brain?

         22         A.  Yes.  There was an MRI of the

         23    brain from August 8th of 2017.

         24         Q.  And what did you glean upon your

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire18



          1    review of the August 8, 2017 MRI of the

          2    brain?

          3         A.  That was normal.  There was a

          4    single white spot, which is normal.  As an

          5    individual ages, it's what we would

          6    consider an incidental finding of no

          7    significance, not related to trauma, and

          8    asymptomatic.

          9         Q.  What did you glean upon your

         10    review of the records from Jefferson Urgent

         11    Care?

         12         A.  Those records indicated that prior

         13    to this occurrence, she had a history of

         14    spine injury and surgery, as well as

         15    anxiety and depression.

         16         Q.  What did you glean upon your

         17    review of the records from Doctors

         18    Express Narberth from July 8 and July 10,

         19    2017?

         20         A.  So she initially presented, you

         21    know, after her accident, and at that time,

         22    they were the first doctors that evaluated

         23    her.  She denied any loss of consciousness.

         24    She denied any cognitive problems like

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire19



          1    trouble with her memory.  She said that she

          2    fell and hit her head, and had dizziness,

          3    nausea and imbalance.

          4             They did a review of systems where

          5    they asked her a lot of other question, and

          6    it was normal.  And her examination was

          7    normal.  Again, those are the first doctors

          8    that she sees, and she's denying at that

          9    time any loss of consciousness or cognitive

         10    issues.

         11         Q.  What did you glean upon your

         12    review from the records from her primary

         13    care physician at PA Internal Medicine &

         14    Geriatrics?

         15         A.  Those records indicated that she

         16    had a history of not only chronic back --

         17    chronic back pain, she was a chronic pain

         18    patient who was taking medications well

         19    before this.  She also had a history of

         20    headaches which had preceded this accident,

         21    and that she had been involved in a slip

         22    and fall, which she did not disclose to me.

         23               MR. KENNY:  Can you give

         24         an offer of proof of when the

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire20



          1         slip and fall happened?  Do you

          2         know?

          3               You're talking about a

          4         slip and fall that happened

          5         before the accident.  I'd just

          6         like an offer of proof.  When is

          7         that?

          8               THE DOCTOR:  I think that --

          9               MR. BUCILLA:  From the

         10         Doctor or from me?

         11               MR. KENNY:  Any of you.

         12         You're saying there's a slip and

         13         fall before the work accident.

         14         Can you give a date?

         15               MR. BUCILLA:  The slip and

         16         fall is from March 24th, 2017,

         17         consistent with the Claimant's

         18         testimony on Page 14 of her

         19         transcript where she said she

         20         did --

         21               MR. KENNY:  Okay.  Thank

         22         you.

         23    BY MR. BUCILLA:

         24         Q.  Doctor, what did you glean upon

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire21



          1    your review of the report from Jefferson

          2    Concussion Center from September 11th,

          3    2017?

          4         A.  So that was another report in

          5    which she documented that there was no loss

          6    of consciousness, and that she did have

          7    these symptoms of headache, nausea and

          8    ringing in her ears.  And that, otherwise,

          9    her history and exam were benign.

         10         Q.  What did you glean upon your

         11    review of the records available from

         12    Princeton Brain and Spine?

         13         A.  So they had been treating her for

         14    some time for chronic pain dating back to a

         15    motor vehicle accident that occurred in

         16    what they said was 2003.  They said that

         17    she was involved in this accident, and that

         18    she, again, initially reported that she did

         19    not loss consciousness.  And that she had

         20    numerous subjective complaints such as

         21    headaches; bright lights and loud noises

         22    bothered her; memory loss and dizziness.

         23             She was receiving different

         24    modalities of therapy, and then later in

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire22



          1    other records, it reported that she had a

          2    history of not only chronic pain, but she

          3    had a history of migraine headaches.  She

          4    had a history of multiple mood issues

          5    including depression.  She had

          6    posttraumatic stress disorder.

          7             And, then, now her story was

          8    changing, and she said she did loss

          9    consciousness.  So in realtime, it appeared

         10    the medical records documented that

         11    initially, she said she did not lose

         12    consciousness, did not have any cognitive

         13    issues.  Then, with time, it was unclear if

         14    she lost consciousness, and now she's

         15    saying she did lose consciousness.

         16             She also had the history of prior

         17    drug abuse, which she had denied to me, and

         18    she had a history of numerous psychosocial

         19    stressors in her life.

         20         Q.  What did you glean upon your

         21    review of the records from Mid Atlantic

         22    Concussion Alliance?

         23         A.  So they evaluated her for

         24    approximately one year, and those medical

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire23



          1    records were interesting in that many of

          2    her symptoms in those records were

          3    documented as continually improving as they

          4    saw her.  And some of the symptoms that she

          5    reported had actually resolved, when she

          6    told me that really nothing was improving.

          7             I think the only thing that she

          8    told me that was a little bit better was

          9    her imbalance, but her headaches had not

         10    improved.  Her cognitive dysfunction was

         11    actually getting worse, and the ringing in

         12    her ears were getting worse.

         13             Those medical records also

         14    indicated that she was receiving different

         15    types of medications for treatment and

         16    different modalities of therapy, and, you

         17    know, they were also using very, sort of,

         18    crude tests for cognitive functioning,

         19    what's called an "Impact Test."  If someone

         20    really is worried about someone's

         21    cognition, often they'll be sent for a

         22    formal neuropsychological evaluation and

         23    have formal cognitive therapy.  Impact

         24    testing is really just sort of a screen

          1    typically used for individuals who play

          2    sports.

          3         Q.  And as part of your review of Dr.

          4    Kamen's records, did you have, within

          5    those, any records from Dr. Watanabe as of

          6    your evaluation?

          7         A.  Yes.  Those medical records

          8    indicated that she was actually sleeping

          9    quite well --

         10               MR. KENNY:  Can we just

         11         put a date for the record, and

         12         who is the doctor, again,

         13         Watanabe?

         14               THE DOCTOR:  Watanabe,

         15         W-a-t-a-n-a-b-e.

         16               MR. KENNY:  So it's not in

         17         his report?

         18               THE DOCTOR:  It was

         19         included in the Kamen records.

         20               MR. BUCILLA:  On Number

         21         16.

         22               MR. KENNY:  Oh, Dr.

         23         Kamen's records.  Okay.

         24               THE DOCTOR:  So that date

          1         was June 20th, 2018, I believe.

          2    BY MR. BUCILLA:

          3         Q.  And what did you glean concerning

          4    just the history portion of the records

          5    from June 20, 2018?  What was Claimant

          6    reporting in terms of her activity level to

          7    Dr. Watanabe at that point in time?

          8         A.  She reported that she was getting

          9    a lot of sleep, between seven and

         10    seven-and-a-half hours of sleep, without

         11    interruption, and that she was waking up

         12    feeling well rested.  She said that she was

         13    active, you know, cooking, walking her

         14    dogs, doing yard work, and she said that

         15    she was cleaning her grandmother's house

         16    out.  And she was active again, going to

         17    stores, cooking, going to Doctor's

         18    appointments.

         19             She said that she had recently

         20    visited her family in California and was

         21    considering moving there long-term in what

         22    she considered about six months from that

         23    point.  She was, again, fixing up her

         24    grandmothers house because she was planning

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire26



          1    on selling it and, again, moving from

          2    Philadelphia to California.

          3         Q.  Doctor, based upon the history

          4    that you received from Ms. Daccardi, your

          5    review of records, the MRI of the brain,

          6    your examination from October 3rd, 2018,

          7    can you tell the Judge what was your

          8    diagnosis?

          9         A.  My diagnosis was that, you know,

         10    if she indeed fell and hit her head,

         11    whether she did or didn't lose

         12    consciousness, it was certainly possible

         13    that she had a concussion.

         14         Q.  Did you have an opinion as of

         15    October 3rd, 2018, to within a reasonable

         16    degree of medical certainty, as to whether

         17    she had fully recovered from the concussion

         18    sustained at work in July of 2017?

         19         A.  Yes.  I did think she recovered

         20    fully.

         21         Q.  Do you have an opinion as to

         22    whether she had any ongoing work

         23    restrictions relative to her head injury

         24    from July of 2017?

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire27



          1         A.  No.  I don't think she required

          2    any testing or treatment, or had any

          3    restrictions.

          4         Q.  Did she require any further

          5    medical treatment at all, did you have an

          6    opinion, as of October 2018?

          7         A.  No more treatment.

          8         Q.  Briefly, for the Judge, just

          9    explain why was it your opinion that she

         10    had fully recovered from any concussion

         11    sustained from this work accident?

         12         A.  Well, to begin with, a concussion

         13    is like the vast majority of traumatic

         14    injuries which gradually improve with time.

         15    She's an individual who literally slipped

         16    and fell, and hit her head at work.  We

         17    know that these types of concussions

         18    improve.  Just like an ankle sprain over a

         19    short period of time, some people get

         20    better within a few days, and some people,

         21    it takes a few weeks, maybe a few months.

         22    But certainly at 16 months, the natural

         23    history of a concussion is that she would

         24    be better.

          1             In addition, all of the testing

          2    that she had was objectively normal, and

          3    her physical examination was completely

          4    normal.

          5             Next, all of the medical records

          6    sort of documented that her condition, as

          7    we would expect, was not only slowly

          8    improving, but her activity level was one

          9    that you would expect in an individual who

         10    had recovered.  She was performing all of

         11    her, what we call, activities of daily

         12    living.  She's washing, dressing, cooking,

         13    cleaning, managing her finances, driving,

         14    going to doctors appointments.  Not only

         15    that, she's probably being more active than

         16    most people.  She's cleaning her

         17    grandmother's home.  She's planning to move

         18    to California.

         19             So, it was my opinion that, you

         20    know, she had fully recovered, and no more

         21    testing or treatment was needed.

         22         Q.  Since your evaluation, have you

         23    had the chance to review additional

         24    occupational therapy notes from August of

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire29



          1    2018?

          2         A.  Yes.

          3         Q.  And what did you glean upon your

          4    review of the occupational therapy records

          5    from August of 2018?

          6         A.  Well, there's a record from August

          7    21st of 2018 which reported that she had

          8    met her cognitive goals, and that she had

          9    had strategies to manage her symptoms.  And

         10    that she had improved and was able to

         11    handle any sort of stress and challenges

         12    that would come her way, and she was given

         13    resources for her to, essentially, return

         14    to work.  And that they didn't think that

         15    additional treatment was indicated.

         16         Q.  Did that report cause you to alter

         17    any of the opinions that you came to on

         18    October 3rd, 2018?

         19         A.  No.  It just further supported the

         20    fact that the people who were treating her

         21    felt like she was making improvements, and

         22    she didn't require additional treatment.

         23    And she could go back to sort of being

         24    active.

          1         Q.  Since your evaluation, have you

          2    had the chance to review any updated

          3    reports for any visits of Dr. Watanabe?

          4         A.  Yes, I did.

          5         Q.  And what was the date of service?

          6         A.  That was March 6th of this year,

          7    2019.

          8         Q.  And in terms of the history she

          9    provided Dr. Watanabe on March 6th of

         10    2019, what did you glean upon review of

         11    the history in terms of her activity

         12    level?

         13         A.  So this report indicated that

         14    there were numerous other inconsistencies

         15    regarding what she told me and what was

         16    documented in many of her other medical

         17    records.  And, then, in this medical

         18    record, first he reported that she had a

         19    history of significant migraines.  She

         20    reported to me that there was no

         21    significant history of headaches, and she

         22    actually indicated that the headaches she

         23    was experiencing now were nowhere near as

         24    severe as the headaches she had had with

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire31



          1    her migraines in the past.

          2             She also indicated that she had a

          3    history of multiple concussions when, with

          4    me, she reported that she had only had one

          5    concussion.  With me, again, she had said

          6    that she was sort of blacked out for a

          7    short period of time, and, again, she had

          8    told many other doctors that she didn't

          9    lose consciousness.  She told this doctor

         10    that she had lost consciousness for

         11    45 seconds.  That is a long time to be out

         12    cold.

         13             And then she reported that she

         14    actually drove to the Urgent Care center.

         15    She had told me that she required -- she

         16    was basically taken to the Urgent Care

         17    center.  You know, if an individual has

         18    head trauma and loses consciousness for

         19    45 seconds, it would be extremely unusual

         20    for that person to drive themselves to

         21    the emergency room or an Urgent Care

         22    center.

         23             Next, he reported sort of this

         24    back history of her having been abused as a

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire32



          1    child, and suffering from post-traumatic

          2    stress disorder --

          3         Q.  I don't want to get into, really,

          4    any mental problems.  If you could, just

          5    kind of cover the concussion-related

          6    symptoms, please.

          7         A.  Sure.  He had mentioned the horse

          8    injury that I had talked about, and that

          9    was sort of the beginning of her chronic

         10    pain requiring her to be on chronic pain

         11    medications.  This also indicated that she

         12    had been involved in a severe car accident

         13    in which her vehicle rolled over.

         14             Finally, the records indicated

         15    that her pain was actually doing much

         16    better.  She reported that her pain was

         17    well controlled, and she was weaning off a

         18    lot of her medications.  She said that she

         19    was still getting pain medications from a

         20    Dr. Amann who she had only seen once, but

         21    was sending multiple pain medications to

         22    her home, and she was, basically,

         23    stockpiling different boxes of medications

         24    like Gabapentin, which is a pain

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire33



          1    medication, Baclofen, which is a muscle

          2    relaxant, different types of patches and

          3    creams.

          4             The medical records also indicated

          5    that she was doing better with her memory

          6    and her cognition, and she had recently

          7    been on a vacation.  She was reluctant to

          8    try certain medications that had been

          9    prescribed to her because she was concerned

         10    that they would have an impact on her

         11    sexual drive.

         12             And then she also reported that

         13    she was going back and forth to California

         14    every few months, and she was hoping that

         15    she would move there once she was more

         16    financially stable.  And that she was

         17    involved in a Workman's Compensation case,

         18    and that she wanted that to settle.  She

         19    noted that she had already had a job set up

         20    in San Diego for once she was able to move

         21    to California.

         22             And, then, last she said that she

         23    had a new relationship with someone in

         24    Colorado, and she had traveled to Colorado

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire34



          1    as well.

          2         Q.  And I just want to be clear,

          3    because you indicated a moment ago that she

          4    wanted her Workers' Compensation case to

          5    settle, but could you read the actual words

          6    from the history portion of the report

          7    because I want to make sure the right

          8    context is in the record?

          9         A.  Sure.  "She reports she has been

         10    traveling to and from California every few

         11    months to be with her -- but ultimately

         12    hopes to be able to move there once she is

         13    able to do so financially and once her

         14    Workman's Comp case has settled, noting

         15    that she has a job already lined up in an

         16    office setting in San Diego."

         17         Q.  Doctor, does this cause you to

         18    change your full recovery opinion from

         19    October 3rd, 2018, approximately

         20    five months before this visit to Dr.

         21    Watanabe?

         22         A.  No.  And, again, like I said, with

         23    the other records, it just gives sort of

         24    more evidence that she indeed probably has

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire35



          1    recovered.  She is extremely active.  She's

          2    traveling.  She's doing all these things.

          3    She has a job already t'd up.  Obviously an

          4    individual who is having cognitive

          5    complaints and physical complaints that she

          6    believes limits her ability to work would

          7    not have sought a job and have a job lined

          8    up in the coming months.

          9             His report also indicated that

         10    under, later, his assessment and plan, when

         11    it says she has a history of concussion, he

         12    reported that he suspected that her

         13    residual postconcussive symptoms are

         14    probably more related to her mood.  And,

         15    again, that would agree with what I'm

         16    saying, that I think she's fully recovered

         17    from her concussion, and that's no longer

         18    an issue.

         19         Q.  As you're sitting here today now,

         20    does it remain your opinion that she is

         21    fully recovered from the concussion head

         22    injury she sustained from this incident?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  And you're not offering any

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - dire36



          1    opinions today concerning orthopedic

          2    injuries, concerning the shoulder, lumbar

          3    spine, neck and so forth, Doctor?

          4         A.  Correct.  I'm not.

          5         Q.  Your opinions today are limited to

          6    her head injury?

          7         A.  Yes.

          8         Q.  Have all the opinions you've

          9    expressed today been made to within a

         10    reasonable degree of medical certainty?

         11         A.  Yes.

         12               MR. BUCILLA:  I don't have

         13         any further questions.

         14               MR. KENNY:  Great.

         16         Q.  Good evening, Doctor.  My name is

         17    Patrick Kenny.  I've just got a few

         18    questions for you.

         19             The opinions you rendered today

         20    are based on history that you obtained from

         21    Ms. Daccardi, all the medical records that

         22    you articulated you reviewed and your exam

         23    of her; is that correct?

         24         A.  Yes.

          1         Q.  And as Counsel pointed out, you

          2    performed a neurological IME of her back on

          3    October 3rd, 2018; is that correct?

          4         A.  Yes.

          5         Q.  Okay.  It's coming up on about

          6    almost a year ago, correct?

          7         A.  That's correct.

          8         Q.  Okay.  When you were testifying

          9    today on direct examination, it's fair to

         10    say you were relying on your report,

         11    correct?

         12         A.  Yes.

         13         Q.  Okay.  You don't have any

         14    firsthand recollection of Ms. Daccardi,

         15    correct?

         16         A.  I mean, there are some parts of

         17    her story that certainly stand out just

         18    because it's somewhat an unusual story, but

         19    I can't see her exactly in my mind's eye,

         20    if that's what you mean.

         21         Q.  Okay.  How many patients do you

         22    see in a given week?

         23         A.  Probably close to a hundred if I'm

         24    not on call.

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro39



          1         Q.  Okay.  And where is your clinical

          2    practice located?

          3         A.  I'm at Lankenau Hospital, but I

          4    have a satellite office in Broomall, where

          5    I'm once a week.

          6         Q.  How many IMEs do you do in a

          7    particular week?

          8         A.  So I come here to ExamWorks every

          9    other half Wednesday, so two half days a

         10    month, I will see a maximum of three IMEs.

         11    And sometimes it's zero, and sometimes it's

         12    three.

         13         Q.  Okay.  And since you've seen her

         14    almost a year ago, is it fair to say you're

         15    not aware of her clinical condition

         16    currently, meaning you haven't clinically

         17    examined her since almost a year ago,

         18    correct?

         19         A.  Correct.

         20         Q.  Okay.  You are aware that she was

         21    involved in this accident on July 8th,

         22    2017, correct?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  And it's your diagnosis she did

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro40



          1    sustain a concussion as a result of this

          2    accident?

          3         A.  That's certainly possible.

          4         Q.  Well, I'm asking you to make an

          5    opinion within a reasonable degree of

          6    medical certainty if she sustained a

          7    concussion.

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  Okay.  And you would agree that

         10    the mechanism of injury that she told you

         11    about, falling down and hitting her head on

         12    a wall, that would be consistent with

         13    someone that could sustain a concussion,

         14    correct?

         15         A.  Mild concussion, certainly.  Yes.

         16         Q.  She reported to you -- I know you

         17    want back and forth a lot on direct about

         18    whether or not there was loss of

         19    consciousness or not, but she told you she

         20    "blacked out for just a brief period,"

         21    quote; that's what she told you, correct?

         22         A.  Yes.

         23         Q.  Okay.  She told you that,

         24    initially, when she went to Urgent Care,

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro41



          1    her symptoms were headaches, dizziness,

          2    nausea, vomiting and imbalance, correct?

          3         A.  Yes.

          4         Q.  And you would agree, as a

          5    neurologist, those are all symptoms of

          6    someone that sustained a concussion,

          7    correct?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  Okay.  You're not aware of any new

         10    injuries or accidents to her head since

         11    July 8, 2017, correct?

         12         A.  No, I'm not.

         13         Q.  Okay.  Did you read her

         14    deposition transcript dated March 15th,

         15    2019?

         16         A.  I skimmed through portions of it.

         17         Q.  What is your understanding of

         18    what she had to do in her preinjury

         19    position?

         20         A.  My understanding was that she was

         21    a manager, and that she, basically, could

         22    have to do anything.  So, obviously, a

         23    manager is sort of higher up in the food

         24    chain, but if someone were to call in sick,

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro42



          1    she could have to do anything from loading

          2    to cleaning to serving, to doing the

          3    cashier, so pretty much anything that is

          4    could be required of someone that works the

          5    restaurant.

          6         Q.  Multitasking a restaurant manager

          7    job, would you agree with that?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  Do you know how long she's been

         10    doing that for?

         11         A.  I don't remember off the top of my

         12    head.

         13         Q.  Okay.  You then documented on

         14    Page 2 of your report, correct me if I'm

         15    wrong, that after the fall, she told you

         16    what her symptoms were immediately at the

         17    time she went to Urgent Care, and then she

         18    also began to develop headaches, correct?

         19         A.  Yes.

         20         Q.  Okay.  And she told you that

         21    those headaches were daily; is that

         22    correct?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  Okay.  And now she's telling you

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro43



          1    that they're three times a week; is that

          2    correct?

          3         A.  No.  She, I think, had a headache

          4    every day.

          5         Q.  Okay.

          6         A.  Three times a week, it was a mild

          7    headache, but four times a week, it was a

          8    severe headache.

          9         Q.  Okay.  And she described to you

         10    how stress, driving, bright lights, loud

         11    noises all trigger headaches, correct?

         12         A.  Yes.

         13         Q.  Those are all symptoms that

         14    represent someone that could have

         15    posttraumatic headaches, correct?

         16         A.  Well, certainly that's possible,

         17    but that would then be a sort of a

         18    different diagnosis, whether it's a

         19    concussive headache or a posttraumatic

         20    headache.

         21         Q.  Okay.  She also told you that she

         22    has trouble or difficulty maintaining

         23    attention, and she has some concentration

         24    issues, correct?

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro44



          1         A.  Yes.

          2         Q.  And if I understand your testimony

          3    correctly, that kind of developed a little

          4    bit later on after her July 8, 2017 work

          5    injury, correct?

          6         A.  You're saying that she told me

          7    that that started later?

          8         Q.  Yeah.  Maybe I just misunderstood

          9    you.

         10         A.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I think

         11    she said that just after her fall, she had

         12    cognitive problems.

         13         Q.  Okay.

         14         A.  I don't remember there being a

         15    delay in that.

         16         Q.  Okay.  Now, you did perform a

         17    neurological examination, correct?

         18         A.  Yes.

         19         Q.  Okay.  And you talked about on

         20    direct that when you do that, you do a

         21    cranial nerve examination; is that

         22    correct?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  You do a motor exam examination;

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro45



          1    that's also correct?

          2         A.  Yes.

          3         Q.  And a sensory examination,

          4    correct?

          5         A.  Yes.

          6         Q.  Okay.  And you documented all of

          7    those tests and the results in that one

          8    paragraph on Page 3; is that correct?

          9         A.  Correct.

         10         Q.  Okay.  And it was your testimony

         11    today, based on that clinical examination,

         12    that she had, in essence, a normal --

         13    normal findings, no objective findings for

         14    the brain, the spine, or the nerves,

         15    correct?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17         Q.  Okay.  And you also stated that

         18    the MRI of the brain was normal, correct?

         19         A.  That's correct.

         20         Q.  Did you review the films or just

         21    the report of that MRI of the brain?

         22         A.  Just the report.

         23         Q.  Okay.  And you would agree,

         24    Doctor, as a neurologist, that you can have

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro46



          1    a normal MRI of the brain, and you can have

          2    a normal clinical neurologic examination,

          3    and still suffer from postconcussion

          4    syndrome and posttraumatic headaches; is

          5    that correct?

          6         A.  That is correct, yes.

          7         Q.  Now, you wrote in your report that

          8    you felt that -- I don't want to -- it's

          9    your opinion that "almost all people

         10    recover from concussions in two to

         11    four months of treatment, and beyond that

         12    is excessive."  You document that in your

         13    report, correct?

         14         A.  That's correct.

         15         Q.  Okay.  You actually make the

         16    analogy that it's similar to recovering

         17    from a right ankle sprain; is that

         18    correct?

         19         A.  That's correct.

         20         Q.  And that's your opinion, that

         21    almost all people recover in two to

         22    four months from a concussion?

         23         A.  Well, I think what I'm referring

         24    to is in this case.  There's obviously

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro47



          1    different types of concussions people have,

          2    and there's different histories people

          3    have.

          4             So if someone were to fall off a

          5    building 50 feet from the air and hit their

          6    head, that's considered a traumatic brain

          7    injury.  And if someone were to be on a

          8    motor cycle and be ejected at 70 miles an

          9    lower, hit a tree, that could also be a

         10    traumatic brain injury and a concussion.

         11    So there's different degrees of

         12    everything.

         13         Q.  Okay.

         14         A.  When someone slips and falls, and

         15    hits their head on the ground, that type of

         16    concussion is certainly what we would

         17    consider self-limited, and, again,

         18    recovery would be expected in a few weeks

         19    to months.

         20             The analogy with the ankle is

         21    right if I'm playing basketball, and I

         22    twist my ankle, it would get better in a

         23    short period of time.  If I jumped off a

         24    building and broke my ankle, and fractured

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro48



          1    it into 20 different pieces, that would

          2    obviously be different, and the recovery

          3    would be longer.

          4         Q.  Okay.  And you've obvious treated

          5    patients who had concussions and

          6    posttraumatic concussions that last

          7    four months, correct, depending on the

          8    circumstances?

          9         A.  Yes.

         10         Q.  Okay.  And as you stated, it's

         11    expected, but it's really patient-specific

         12    how they recover; is that a fair statement?

         13         A.  Yes, again, within a reasonable

         14    amount of time.  I mean, I see people all

         15    the time who are referred to me because

         16    their stories don't make sense to either

         17    their primary care doctor or a rehab

         18    doctor, or a sports medicine doctor, or an

         19    orthopedic doctor; people who have had

         20    concussive symptoms for longer than what

         21    would be expected and coming to me for a

         22    second opinion because the story doesn't

         23    make any sense.

         24         Q.  Now, you went in detail through

                          Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - cro49



          1    the medical records that you reviewed, and

          2    I'm just going to briefly go over a few

          3    things.  You talked about the Express

          4    Narberth records that are listed on Page

          5    5?

          6         A.  Yes.

          7         Q.  Okay.  She -- this was shortly

          8    after the accident, actually, the first

          9    three days.  She reported dizziness,

         10    nausea and imbalance at that time,

         11    correct?

         12         A.  Yes.

         13         Q.  And those physicians actually

         14    diagnosed her with a concussion, correct?

         15         A.  That's correct.

         16         Q.  Okay.  And then she also went to

         17    the facility Mid Atlantic Concussion

         18    Alliance, correct?

         19         A.  Yes.

         20         Q.  And she had, actually, therapy for

         21    her concussion symptoms, is that correct,

         22    to your knowledge?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  Do you know what type of therapy

          1    she had?

          2         A.  Well, I believe the majority

          3    was -- I thought it was vestibular, sort of

          4    dealing with her balance.

          5         Q.  Okay.  She went to the Jefferson

          6    Concussion Center in September of 2017,

          7    correct?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  Now, we're still two months after

         10    the work accident, still reporting

         11    headaches, nausea, tinnitus,

         12    t-i-n-n-i-t-u-s; is that correct?

         13         A.  Yes.

         14         Q.  Okay.  And she was also doing

         15    therapy there as well, correct?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17         Q.  So she's still doing therapy two

         18    months or so after the work accident; is

         19    that correct?

         20         A.  Yes.

         21         Q.  Okay.  And, again, she does go to

         22    see the Princeton Brain & Spine, and she's

         23    still reporting dizziness, memory problems

         24    and photophobia; is that correct?

          1         A.  Yes.

          2         Q.  Okay.  And that's also through

          3    December of 2017, correct?

          4         A.  Yes.

          5         Q.  So that's about four months after

          6    the work accident, correct?

          7         A.  Correct.

          8         Q.  All these complaints that she was

          9    having regarding the dizziness, the

         10    headaches, the nausea, those are all

         11    consistent with those providers shortly

         12    after the work accident, correct?

         13         A.  That's correct.

         14         Q.  Okay.  You're not aware of any

         15    light duty work being offered to her; is

         16    that accurate?

         17         A.  I'm not aware of that, no.

         18               MR. BUCILLA:  You're

         19         referring to the Employer?

         20               MR. KENNY:  Yes.  I'm

         21         sorry.

         22    BY MR. KENNY:

         23         Q.  You're not --

         24         A.  No, I'm not.

          1         Q.  All right.

          2               MR. KENNY:  That's all I

          3         have thanks, Doctor.

          7    BY MR. BUCILLA:

          8         Q.  Just briefly in follow-up,

          9    Doctor.

         10         A.  Sure.

         11         Q.  On cross, you went into this

         12    discussion about analogies between head

         13    injuries and ankle injuries.  Were your

         14    opinion concerning that some sort of

         15    consideration of the mechanism of injury

         16    that Ms. Daccardi had; is that what you

         17    were trying to explain?

         18         A.  Yes.  That's correct.

         19         Q.  You mentioned a number of

         20    diagnoses apart from concussion, so we have

         21    to cover those now.

         22             Posttraumatic headaches was

         23    mentioned on cross, and traumatic brain

         24    injury was mentioned on cross.  Did you

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - redi53ct



          1    assign either of those diagnoses to her

          2    work incident in this case?

          3         A.  No.  Although, by medical

          4    definition, a concussion is often used

          5    synonymously with a mild traumatic brain

          6    injury, so those are essentially the same

          7    thing.  I didn't use it in my report

          8    anywhere, but those are the same thing.

          9    That's different than someone who had a

         10    moderate or severe traumatic brain injury,

         11    which we are not talking about here.

         12         Q.  And just to make sure I understood

         13    you correctly, when you say mild traumatic

         14    brain injury, is your diagnosis of a

         15    concussion inclusive of mild traumatic

         16    brain injury, then?

         17         A.  I didn't put it anywhere in my

         18    report, but if you read medical literature,

         19    those two things are the same thing.  So,

         20    you could say someone has a headache and

         21    head pain.  The words in medicine are the

         22    same with all types of guidelines.

         23    Concussion and mild traumatic brain injury

         24    are the same thing.

          1         Q.  If we were to assume that the

          2    Judge were to find in this case that she

          3    did have a mild traumatic brain injury with

          4    respect to this date of injury, do you have

          5    an opinion based on the information you had

          6    available to you in October of 2018 as to

          7    whether she had fully recovered at that

          8    point in time from any mild traumatic brain

          9    injury sustained?

         10         A.  Definitely recovered, yes.  Same

         11    exactly thing.

         12         Q.  Did you assign any posttraumatic

         13    headache diagnosis to this incident?

         14         A.  No.  So now we're just getting

         15    into language, but if someone hits their

         16    head and has headaches, usually you call

         17    that a posttraumatic headache.  If they

         18    have a concussion with headaches, usually

         19    the headaches fall under the concussion

         20    umbrella, so usually you don't say it's a

         21    posttraumatic headache.  But, again, we're

         22    just sort of splitting hairs here.

         23             You could also say that, you know,

         24    headaches are a part of concussion, so I

                         Lucas Z. Margolies, M.D. - redi55ct



          1    think she recovered from all of those

          2    things.

          3         Q.  And is that opinion to within a

          4    reason a reasonable degree of medical

          5    certainty?

          6         A.  Absolutely.

          7               MR. BUCILLA:  No further

          8         questions.

          9               MR. KENNY:  Okay.  Great.

         10         I have nothing further.  Thank

         11         you.

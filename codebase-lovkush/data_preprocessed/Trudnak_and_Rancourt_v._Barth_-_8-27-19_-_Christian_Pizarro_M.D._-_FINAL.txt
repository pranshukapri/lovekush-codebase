          1      will now be sworn in.

          2              CHRISTIAN PIZARRO, M.D.,

          3             the deponent herein, having first

          4             been duly sworn on oath, was

          5             examined and testified as follows:

          6                     EXAMINATION

          7    BY MR. ZAKEOSIAN:

          8        Q.    Good afternoon, Doctor.  We met a

          9      few minutes ago.

         10                  I am taking your deposition

         11      today, and I am going to assume that I

         12      don't need to give you instructions on

         13      testifying at a deposition.  Am I correct?

         14        A.    Right.

         15        Q.    If we need to straighten anything

         16      out, we'll do it along the way.

         17                  Your title here is the Chief of

         18      the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery?

         19        A.    Correct.

         20        Q.    And you're an M.D., correct?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    And you're an employee of

         23      duPont/Nemours?

         24        A.    Correct.


                                                          5


          1        Q.    Did you review any records in

          2      preparation for your deposition today?

          3        A.    I just looked at my operative

          4      report.

          5        Q.    And from what date?

          6        A.    I believe they're in March 2014.

          7        Q.    Well, I have one that I'm going to

          8      show you from the 27th.  That's your

          9      original --

         10        A.    Operative report?

         11        Q.    -- procedure, right.  And then the

         12      second one is from the 29th, which was when

         13      you were called emergently in.  Okay?

         14        A.    Okay.

         15        Q.    So aside from the records that you

         16      reviewed, do you have any recollection of

         17      Lily Lynn Trudnak and recollection of

         18      events that occurred on March 29th when you

         19      were called in emergently?

         20        A.    Some.

         21        Q.    Some.  Okay.  All right.

         22                  What do you recall about it?

         23        A.    This was a patient with tetralogy

         24      of Fallot and some respiratory issues who


                                                          6


          1      came from Connecticut Children's Hospital.

          2      And I remember receiving a phone call from

          3      a physician who used to be a trainee here

          4      stating that they had this complex case,

          5      that it was, you know, turning to sort of

          6      an unmanageable situation for them.

          7                  And the baby had several

          8      cardiac arrests and hypoxic episodes and

          9      was paralyzed, and they had a very

         10      difficult time providing adequate

         11      ventilation.

         12                  And the patient had tetralogy

         13      of Fallot that needed to have repair, and

         14      so the expertise, seemingly after a

         15      conversation, of that institution was that

         16      was not present there and that they were

         17      seeking for the opportunity to get care

         18      somewhere else.

         19        Q.    Okay.  And she was admitted to

         20      duPont specifically for the cardiac

         21      surgery, as I recall.  Is that correct?

         22        A.    I believe so.

         23        Q.    Okay.  What was her condition like

         24      preoperatively as far as her neurologic


                                                          7


          1      picture?  Do you recall?

          2        A.    Hard to say considering that this

          3      is a patient who is mechanically

          4      ventilated, sedated.  It's a newborn, and

          5      therefore besides gross motor movements and

          6      opening eyes, certainly not -- I wouldn't

          7      be able to give you more information than

          8      that.

          9        Q.    Okay.  Understood.

         10                  I want you to look at your

         11      report of the 27th.  And I will find that

         12      for you.  Unfortunately I didn't bring -- I

         13      should have brought a separate mouse for

         14      you.

         15        A.    Now, you control this, or I do?

         16        Q.    I control.

         17        A.    Okay.

         18        Q.    But next time I do this I'm going

         19      to bring a mouse for my deponent so they

         20      can do that.

         21                  So this is the beginning of

         22      your operative report, and can you see it?

         23        A.    Yeah.

         24        Q.    Okay.  So this is the report you


                                                          8


          1      were referring to, the first document that

          2      you reviewed.  Is that correct?

          3        A.    Correct.

          4        Q.    Okay.  So the report speaks for

          5      itself.  For the record, this is Bates

          6      No. 152, and it continues.  It's a report

          7      signed by Dr. Christian Pizarro, and it's

          8      of a procedure dated 3/27/2014.  The note

          9      was submitted or signed or filed, it looks

         10      like at the top left, at 4/7/2014.  And it

         11      describes an operation that occurred on

         12      March 27, 2014.

         13                  In the category under surgeon

         14      and assistant, you're listed as the

         15      surgeon.  There's a Dr. Glenn Pelletier

         16      listed.  Who is Dr. Pelletier?

         17        A.    He's another cardiothoracic surgeon

         18      who works here.

         19        Q.    Okay.  He's full-time here?

         20        A.    Yes.

         21        Q.    Okay.  And Edward Woodford I had

         22      the pleasure of meeting a week or two ago.

         23      He is a physician assistant that works with

         24      your department regularly.  Is that


                                                          9


          1      correct?

          2        A.    Correct.

          3        Q.    And John Ostrowski was the

          4      anesthesiologist, correct?

          5        A.    I believe so.

          6        Q.    Okay.  That's what's listed here.

          7        A.    Yeah.

          8        Q.    All right.  And you've had the

          9      opportunity to review this report.  Was

         10      there any particular difficulty -- and I'm

         11      putting it in a layperson's term.  I don't

         12      pretend to have the expertise that you have

         13      in the ins and outs of intricate surgery

         14      like this.  But was this a procedure that

         15      went pretty much as you expected it to go?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    Okay.  No particular problems with

         18      this surgery per se, correct?

         19        A.    No.  I would say that, yeah, things

         20      went according to plan.  The patient had,

         21      you know, a good anatomic repair, and it

         22      seems like cardiac function was good and

         23      there were no issues to the point that we

         24      closed the chest.  Any time we will have a


                                                         10


          1      concern, we'll leave the chest open.

          2        Q.    Right.

          3        A.    And so, yeah, no.

          4        Q.    Okay.  And it's also mentioned in

          5      here sort of in the middle of the page I'm

          6      showing there that there was assistance of

          7      Dr. Baffa.  I understand that Dr. Baffa is

          8      an intensivist, cardiology intensivist.  Is

          9      that correct?

         10        A.    No.

         11        Q.    What is Dr. Baffa's specialty?

         12        A.    She's a cardiologist who has

         13      special training in imaging, so she's the

         14      person who helped with the assessment of my

         15      echocardiogram at the end of the procedure.

         16        Q.    Okay.  And that was an epicardial

         17      echocardiogram, correct?

         18        A.    Yes.

         19        Q.    Baby's esophagus was too small to

         20      pass the scope?

         21        A.    Well, there was a concern about the

         22      size of the baby as well as the fact that

         23      the airway was questionable, and therefore

         24      we didn't want to add any potential


                                                         11


          1      encumbering, you know, issue associated

          2      with that.  So, you know, a probe is

          3      generally not designed for patients of this

          4      size, so they tend to be oversized, and

          5      that's a problem.

          6        Q.    And if I may, what was your

          7      understanding of the airway problem that

          8      this baby had?

          9        A.    Well, the baby received a

         10      tracheostomy at the previous institution

         11      because of the difficulties that they had

         12      in spite of that.  The patient did have

         13      several episodes when it was important,

         14      desaturation that led to arrest, and

         15      therefore that was part of the issue is the

         16      cardiac defect was the respiratory problem,

         17      anatomic problem.

         18                  And therefore when the patient

         19      came we evaluated that, you know, anew and

         20      we established that obviously the

         21      tracheostomy provided a good access to the

         22      airway and that the airway in fact were not

         23      all that small.

         24                  And the patient at the time had


                                                         12


          1      an annoying, you know, infection with

          2      Serratia, which is a Gram-negative organism

          3      that makes -- obviously could aggravate

          4      matters, and that was, you know, being

          5      treated.

          6                  But we thought that considering

          7      the ability to ventilate effectively, the

          8      presence of a concurrent infectious

          9      inflammatory process in the airway, it

         10      certainly would not be, you know, an

         11      absolute mandate to try to tackle the

         12      cardiac defect and the airway surgery at

         13      the same time considering the fact that

         14      that combination certainly has far

         15      important morbidity, mortality, and risk

         16      compared to just the isolated cardiac

         17      surgery.

         18                  So we thought that that was

         19      certainly not something that we should try

         20      to address at that particular time.

         21        Q.    Understood.  And you note that the

         22      area, actually the area of her trachea,

         23      cross-sectional area had increased over

         24      time.  Is that correct?  You said there


                                                         13


          1      was, I think in the sixth line from the

          2      bottom or seventh line, significant

          3      increase in size compared to the previous

          4      study from seven weeks before?

          5        A.    Seemingly.

          6        Q.    Right.  And you then went to the

          7      trouble in your history here of explaining

          8      particularly, I think as you stated, why

          9      you did not want to do any particular

         10      tracheal intervention as far as a tracheal

         11      reconstruction at that time, the same time

         12      that you were performing the cardiac

         13      surgery, but that you would rather reassess

         14      that at a later date.  Is that correct?

         15        A.    Correct.

         16        Q.    Okay.  All right.

         17                  So moving on, what -- I know

         18      the reason, but what is the reason that in

         19      this procedure and in other cardiac

         20      procedures where patients come to the

         21      operating room with a tracheostomy and they

         22      need a median sternotomy, what's the reason

         23      that the tracheostomy tube is removed at

         24      that time?


                                                         14


          1        A.    Well, generally speaking it's

          2      severalfold, but importantly you want to,

          3      A, have the anesthesiologist get direct

          4      access to the airway, which would be in the

          5      face, correct?

          6        Q.    Correct.

          7        A.    And therefore easier than, you

          8      know, below the chin, particularly in a

          9      patient who is about 50 centimeters long.

         10      So that goes without saying.

         11                  The second is the fact that

         12      ideally you want to -- you know, there is a

         13      risk of contamination and deep-seated

         14      mediastinal wound infection every time you

         15      have a contaminated source, you know,

         16      immediately adjacent to the sternotomy.

         17                  So ideally you want to see if

         18      you could create some form of a barrier to

         19      separate those two, and so it's impossible

         20      to do with a tracheostomy in place.

         21                  And therefore generally we will

         22      just take the tracheostomy out, if feasible

         23      intubate a patient, you know, orally or

         24      nasotracheally, you know, from above, and


                                                         15


          1      then seal this and then prep the sternum --

          2      I mean the chest where the sternotomy is

          3      going to take place.  So --

          4        Q.    To your knowledge was there any

          5      difficulty on the part of the

          6      anesthesiologist in exchanging the tubes?

          7        A.    I have no recollection.

          8        Q.    Okay.  So then --

          9        A.    It wasn't brought up to me, but I

         10      have no idea.

         11        Q.    Okay.  Is that something if there

         12      was a problem that you would have noted in

         13      your -- put in your operative note?

         14        A.    Not in my note, but it would be

         15      probably noted by the anesthesiologist, I

         16      would imagine.

         17        Q.    Fair enough.

         18                  At some point then

         19      postoperatively a tracheostomy patient with

         20      need for a tracheostomy is going to have a

         21      tracheostomy tube reinserted.  Is that

         22      correct?

         23        A.    Yeah.

         24        Q.    Do you have or is there at duPont


                                                         16


          1      here -- I'll do this separately.  Is there

          2      at duPont any policy, procedure, or

          3      protocol for how long after the initial

          4      cardiac operation one should wait before

          5      reinserting the tracheostomy?

          6        A.    I'm not sure of a written policy.

          7      I think that in general as a medical

          8      guideline we operate, you know, under the

          9      principle that generally if all is well,

         10      within, you know, 24 to 48 hours we will

         11      reinsert a tracheostomy considering the

         12      fact that it's amazing how quickly a

         13      tracheostomy orifice will close down.

         14                  And then once that starts

         15      happening and you're trying to dilate and

         16      put this foreign body there again, there is

         17      possibility of bleeding, et cetera, et

         18      cetera, and that's the last thing we want,

         19      is blood in the airway, particularly in

         20      someone who has these kind of, you know,

         21      issues.

         22                  So I would say the norm is

         23      probably 48 hours, you know, give or take.

         24        Q.    I think you said maybe even as


                                                         17


          1      early as 24.  Is that correct?

          2        A.    If everything is well, yeah.

          3        Q.    Well, I looked at the date involved

          4      here.  The surgery was on 3/27.  That was a

          5      Thursday.

          6        A.    Okay.

          7        Q.    The procedure that we're concerned

          8      with where you were called in emergently

          9      was on the 29th, which was a Saturday.

         10        A.    Okay.

         11        Q.    Is that a usual thing here at

         12      duPont for -- in a patient like this who

         13      needs a tracheostomy exchange, to do it on

         14      a Saturday?

         15        A.    It wouldn't be unusual.

         16        Q.    Were you aware that it was going to

         17      take place in this case, in Lily Lynn

         18      Trudnak's case, that Dr. Barth was going to

         19      do it on a Saturday?

         20        A.    I believe so.

         21        Q.    And you said you -- would you have

         22      an objection to waiting another couple of

         23      days until a Monday if that were necessary?

         24        A.    I wouldn't see a reason to wait.


                                                         18


          1        Q.    Okay.  But would it cause a

          2      problem?

          3        A.    Well, it's hard to -- it's hard to

          4      know.  You know, I've seen trachs close in,

          5      you know, less than 72 hours or just about

          6      where it's been difficult to reinsert, you

          7      know, the tube again.  So yeah, we

          8      generally don't go there.

          9        Q.    Okay.  All right.  So who

         10      determined when the tracheostomy was going

         11      to be changed?  Was that your

         12      determination, or was that Dr. Barth?

         13        A.    I think it was probably a

         14      discussion.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16        A.    I mean, I don't have a specific

         17      recollection of that, but generally

         18      speaking that's the way it will go.

         19                  We will talk with the person

         20      who -- or the team that would generally be

         21      doing that, which would include ENT,

         22      anesthesiologist, and, you know, people in

         23      the ICU and surgeon and said everything

         24      looks good, we should go ahead and do this.


                                                         19


          1      That's generally the way this goes.

          2        Q.    And were you aware that it was

          3      going to be done that Saturday?

          4        A.    I believe so because -- yeah, I

          5      believe so because I believe I was on call

          6      that weekend.

          7        Q.    Okay.  So when you're on call, you

          8      don't stay in the hospital.  Is that

          9      correct?

         10        A.    No.  Unless there's something that

         11      requires my attention.

         12        Q.    How are you notified if there's an

         13      emergency that you have to attend to?

         14        A.    I generally get called.

         15        Q.    Telephone?

         16        A.    Telephone, beeper.  Generally,

         17      yeah, telephone or beeper, direct call.

         18        Q.    On a weekend -- I understand that

         19      there's a full team that needs to be

         20      assembled to do a cardiothoracic operation,

         21      and you have -- there's a special dedicated

         22      cardiothoracic team here including

         23      nurses --

         24        A.    Yeah.


                                                         20


          1        Q.    -- and physician assistant and

          2      perfusionist and so forth.

          3                  What's the availability of that

          4      team, to your knowledge, on the weekend?

          5      Are they here at the hospital, or are they

          6      on call remotely?

          7        A.    No.  The vast majority are on call

          8      within I would say, you know, 15 minutes.

          9        Q.    Okay.  And that was my next

         10      question.  Is there sort of a distance or a

         11      time limit?

         12        A.    I mean, most folks, if you looked

         13      at them, we're incredibly close.  I live

         14      eight minutes away.  The perfusionist is

         15      probably ten.  The scrub nurse is five.  So

         16      yeah, we're pretty close.

         17        Q.    And do you recall where you were

         18      when you got the notification you were

         19      needed that day?

         20        A.    No.  Most likely home, but no, I

         21      don't recall specifically.

         22        Q.    Do you recall how long it took you

         23      to come in?

         24        A.    Nothing.  I mean, I was here in


                                                         21


          1      really -- the time I got the call until --

          2      it would have been certainly less than ten

          3      minutes.

          4        Q.    Do you recall who notified you, who

          5      called you?

          6        A.    No.

          7        Q.    And do you know what information

          8      you were given, anything as to why you were

          9      needed?

         10        A.    My recollection was Baby Trudnak,

         11      they were doing the trach change and they

         12      had difficulty and --

         13        Q.    I'll go to that part.

         14        A.    -- they need you to come in

         15      emergently.  That's all.  And then that was

         16      it.  I was on my way.

         17        Q.    That is -- I have now in front of

         18      you your note from that day, the 29th,

         19      which is Bates No. 157 --

         20        A.    Yeah.

         21        Q.    -- and, for the record, continues

         22      to 158.

         23        A.    Yeah.

         24        Q.    So we can refer to that if you need


                                                         22


          1      to.

          2                  Did you proceed immediately to

          3      OR 1 when you got here?

          4        A.    Yes.

          5        Q.    Okay.  And who was -- do you recall

          6      who was already in the operating room when

          7      you got there?

          8        A.    I believe that a scrub nurse of

          9      cardiac and a perfusionist and Dr. Barth

         10      and one of our anesthesiologists and a

         11      number of other people who I don't know who

         12      they are, but I remember other people.

         13        Q.    Okay.  The record reflects that

         14      that was Dr. Seshachar.  Everybody refers

         15      to him, I'm learning, as Dr. Abhaya.

         16        A.    Abhaya, yeah.

         17        Q.    Does that refresh your memory?  Was

         18      it Dr. Abhaya who was there?

         19        A.    Yes.

         20        Q.    And what was going on when you came

         21      in?

         22        A.    I think they were doing cardiac

         23      compressions.  I'm not entirely -- I think

         24      they were doing cardiac compressions, and


                                                         23


          1      they were still talking about the airway.

          2      I'm not entirely sure.  You know, when I

          3      came in, I see that they're doing cardiac

          4      compressions, and then I just went on to do

          5      what I do.

          6        Q.    Okay.

          7        A.    And so I'm not really looking

          8      around what else is happening.  And at the

          9      time my job was to make sure we could get

         10      the chest open and if need be put the

         11      patient on ECMO.  And so people are getting

         12      things ready.  We're opening the chest.

         13                  And then basically the baby

         14      had, you know, return of circulation and we

         15      didn't put the patient on ECMO.

         16        Q.    And fair to say in order to open

         17      the chest, you would have that same concern

         18      with the tracheostomy, if a tracheostomy

         19      goes in, you would need to have an

         20      endotracheal tube placed?

         21        A.    Not really.  If you're in that

         22      scenario, then it's like a different -- a

         23      different sense of priorities.

         24        Q.    Do you remember whether there was a


                                                         24


          1      tracheostomy in the field, tracheostomy

          2      tube or not?

          3        A.    I don't recall.

          4        Q.    And I've had some testimony from

          5      Mr. Woodford --

          6        A.    Yeah.

          7        Q.    -- that when he arrived you were

          8      already there.

          9        A.    Okay.

         10        Q.    You were gowned, and you instructed

         11      him don't worry about scrubbing or changing

         12      into scrub clothes, just put on a gown.

         13        A.    Yeah.

         14        Q.    Is that consistent with your

         15      recollection?

         16        A.    Probably.

         17        Q.    Is that what you likely did

         18      yourself?

         19        A.    If someone is dead, just about,

         20      yes.

         21        Q.    And who else was with you at the

         22      table during your part of this procedure?

         23        A.    Probably a scrub nurse to my right

         24      and someone in front of me.  You tell me


                                                         25


          1      it's Woodford.

          2        Q.    Woodford, yeah.

          3        A.    Then it's probably Woodford.

          4        Q.    Okay.  And where was Dr. Barth when

          5      you arrived?  Do you recall?

          6        A.    He was in the room.

          7        Q.    Okay.

          8        A.    Because I remember having two or

          9      three words with him, but I don't know

         10      specifically.  I remember sort of like the

         11      voice and then what we exchanged.

         12        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember not

         13      necessarily the words but sort of the gist,

         14      the essence of what it was that you

         15      exchanged at that time as far as

         16      information about the patient?

         17        A.    Basically we took the patient to

         18      get the trach changed and things, you know,

         19      deteriorated and the baby arrested.  And I

         20      think the endotracheal tube was in place by

         21      then.  That part I'm not entirely clear.

         22        Q.    Fair enough.  Fair enough.

         23                  Did you ever learn or did you

         24      get information at that time or sometime


                                                         26


          1      later how long she had been in arrest by

          2      the time that you arrived?

          3        A.    A few minutes.  I don't have the

          4      specifics.

          5        Q.    Okay.  And when you opened the

          6      chest --

          7        A.    Yeah.

          8        Q.    -- did you find anything

          9      structurally amiss or disturbed from your

         10      prior surgery?  Was everything in place and

         11      as you expected it to be?

         12        A.    Yeah.  I mean, I'm just reading.

         13      But my recollection is that, to your

         14      question, is no, I didn't find anything

         15      unusual.  Then reading my note seems like

         16      the obvious things that you looked at,

         17      there was nothing out of the ordinary.

         18        Q.    She was -- when the chest was open,

         19      however, there was no cardiac activity at

         20      that point, correct?

         21        A.    Seemingly, yes.

         22        Q.    And you performed direct massage of

         23      the heart at that time?

         24        A.    That's what is written, yeah.


                                                         27


          1        Q.    And following that within how long

          2      would you say it took for the spontaneous

          3      activity of the heart to return?

          4        A.    Oh, very shortly because normally

          5      if we open the chest and there is no

          6      activity and we don't get it going, we

          7      cannulate right away.  And that happens

          8      generally in a period of five minutes, and

          9      so this has got to be less than five.

         10        Q.    And Mr. Duncan, the perfusionist

         11      that I deposed --

         12        A.    Yes.

         13        Q.    -- said there's always a bypass

         14      apparatus primed --

         15        A.    Ready to go.

         16        Q.    -- set up and ready to go.

         17        A.    You got it.

         18        Q.    And that oddly enough the room in

         19      which it is is actually right off --

         20        A.    Adjacent, yes, sir.

         21        Q.    Which is -- Room 1 I understand is

         22      not the usual room that you operate in.  Is

         23      that correct?

         24        A.    No.  Correct.


                                                         28


          1        Q.    But in this case it was right next

          2      door if they needed it?

          3        A.    Well, let me just correct that.

          4      It's a room where we commonly do cardiac

          5      procedures.  But usually we reserve another

          6      room for open cardiac surgery.  So if there

          7      is an emergency, then we use that room, an

          8      emergency that requires open cardiac

          9      surgery like an aortic dissection or

         10      something like that.

         11        Q.    So then in your note you say the

         12      sternum was left open.  Just can you

         13      explain for me why you decided to leave the

         14      sternum open at that time?

         15        A.    I generally do as a precaution in

         16      anyone who has arrested.  I don't know how

         17      they're going to behave, and that would

         18      expedite, you know, us getting back and do

         19      what we need to do.

         20        Q.    Okay.  Fair enough.

         21        A.    So yeah.

         22        Q.    And then you brought her back for

         23      closure the next day, I think.  Let me see

         24      if I can get that.


                                                         29


          1        A.    Okay.  Yeah, closure.

          2        Q.    Looks like -- there we go.

          3        A.    Woodford was there.

          4        Q.    Woodford was there, and

          5      Dr. Seshachar was there again, correct?

          6        A.    Yeah.

          7        Q.    And I'm looking at, for the record,

          8      that note starts on page 158, Bates

          9      No. 158.

         10                  You stated in there -- you can

         11      see my highlighting.  Okay?  I didn't mean

         12      for you to see that, but it's okay for you

         13      to see that.

         14                  It says postoperative recovery

         15      has been excellent.  You meant that in

         16      terms of her cardiac status.  Is that

         17      correct?

         18        A.    Yeah.

         19        Q.    Did you have any knowledge at that

         20      time about any other -- any injury she had

         21      experienced due to her cardiac arrest?

         22                  MR. BALAGUER:  Objection to the

         23      form of the question.

         24                  You can answer.


                                                         30


          1        A.    I think that the reason why we left

          2      the sternum open is to make sure that her

          3      hemodynamics would be sound and they would

          4      not be an issue, and that would allow us a

          5      period of observation.  So after that has

          6      taken place and everything seems fine, then

          7      we proceeded with the sternal closure.

          8                  Now, regarding your question,

          9      it's impossible really for anyone to say

         10      what kind of morbidity she could have

         11      suffered from this particular event

         12      considering that she's had multiple events

         13      that were more profound than this in the

         14      previous hospitalization.  So it would be

         15      really impossible to say, okay, here is the

         16      causality for this.

         17                  All we know at this particular

         18      time is that circulation is good, there is

         19      no evidence of any organ dysfunction, liver

         20      function's normal, patient is making urine,

         21      and the renal function is normal and there

         22      is no other evidence that would make us

         23      believe that circulation remains

         24      vulnerable.  So we closed the chest.


                                                         31


          1        Q.    Now, in the -- following that

          2      closure --

          3        A.    Yeah.

          4        Q.    And I'm going to go down to the

          5      next day, I think it was, or two days,

          6      three days.  Two days later.

          7        A.    Yeah.

          8        Q.    On the 1st of April Dr. Richard

          9      Schmidt -- do you know Dr. Schmidt?

         10        A.    He's one of the ENT specialists,

         11      yes, sir.

         12        Q.    Dr. Schmidt then brought Lily back

         13      to the operating room.  This is his note.

         14      I don't expect you to be familiar with it,

         15      but I'll represent to you that they did a

         16      direct laryngoscopy --

         17        A.    Yeah.

         18        Q.    -- bronchoscopy --

         19        A.    Yeah.

         20        Q.    -- and were able to exchange the

         21      endotracheal tube for a tracheostomy tube.

         22      Is that your understanding?

         23        A.    Based on the document, yes.

         24        Q.    Okay.  Do you know why it was


                                                         32


          1      Dr. Schmidt and not Dr. Barth who brought

          2      the patient back?

          3        A.    I have no idea.  Maybe he was on

          4      call, meaning the services structure their

          5      work differently, some people in the OR

          6      some people do consults, et cetera.  I have

          7      no idea.

          8        Q.    So fair to say that you did not

          9      specifically request him to do this part of

         10      the procedure?

         11        A.    Oh, no.  No.

         12        Q.    And then you continued.  She did,

         13      from my understanding from the hemodynamic

         14      standpoint, then, she did well after this.

         15      Is that correct?

         16        A.    Yes, that's my recollection.

         17        Q.    Okay.  And we're going to skip way

         18      ahead --

         19        A.    Yeah.

         20        Q.    -- to the next time that you --

         21        A.    I mean, mind you, this patient is

         22      VACTERL, correct?

         23        Q.    She's VACTERL.

         24        A.    So -- association.  So that brings,


                                                         33


          1      you know, a host of different medical

          2      issues, and no surprising the patient

          3      remained, you know, in the hospital for an

          4      extended period of time.

          5        Q.    Absolutely.

          6        A.    Yes.

          7        Q.    Absolutely.  And my understanding

          8      is that then in October, October 16th to be

          9      specific, and I'll find that page.

         10        A.    Yeah.

         11        Q.    You then brought her back.  You

         12      were involved along with Dr. Schmidt in

         13      revising her trachea or reconstructing her

         14      trachea, correct?

         15        A.    Yeah.

         16        Q.    And -- I hope I don't make you

         17      dizzy moving these page like that.

         18                  So tracheal stenosis.  This is

         19      Dr. Schmidt's report.  I don't expect you

         20      to be familiar with that.  But here we have

         21      your report.

         22        A.    Yeah.

         23        Q.    And did you review this in

         24      preparation for today as well?


                                                         34


          1        A.    A piece of it.

          2        Q.    Okay.  I'll represent to you that

          3      Dr. Schmidt says that this was a sleeve

          4      reconstruction.  Any reason that you and

          5      Dr. Schmidt selected that procedure?

          6        A.    You mean sliding?

          7        Q.    Sliding.

          8        A.    Sleeve and sliding are two

          9      different operations.

         10        Q.    Are they different?  Then I

         11      misspoke.

         12        A.    Very different.

         13        Q.    So this is a sliding

         14      reconstruction.

         15        A.    Yes.

         16        Q.    And explain for me, because I'm not

         17      familiar with it, explain for me what --

         18        A.    Sliding?

         19        Q.    -- what the sliding consists of.

         20        A.    The sliding consists in the fact

         21      that you basically transect the trachea --

         22        Q.    Right.

         23        A.    -- and open, you know, one end

         24      anteriorly and the other end posteriorly,


                                                         35


          1      and then you slide one on top of the other.

          2      So you effectively shorten the trachea, but

          3      you widen it.

          4        Q.    Understood.

          5        A.    The advantage of that is that it

          6      doesn't use any foreign material.

          7        Q.    Right.

          8        A.    It has the possibility and

          9      potential for growth.

         10        Q.    And it doesn't interrupt the

         11      vasculature?

         12        A.    And it doesn't -- well, any surgery

         13      in the trachea doesn't, I mean, must not

         14      interrupt the vasculature, otherwise you've

         15      got a brig problem on your hands.

         16        Q.    You could have necrosis, correct.

         17      Okay.

         18                  And did that procedure go well

         19      as far as your recollection is concerned?

         20        A.    Yes.

         21        Q.    And then after that did you

         22      continue to follow Lily?  I'm going to

         23      refer to her as Lily, Baby Rancourt.

         24        A.    I mean, I will speak with a parent.

          1      I mean, after the recovery from this part,

          2      you know, of reconstruction and whatnot,

          3      the care was largely driven by a host of

          4      other medical issues, and so I would not be

          5      the primary person coordinating that and

          6      would not -- but I would certainly touch

          7      base and visit with the parents,

          8      particularly when they're in the step-down

          9      unit, just to see how things are going

         10      until the time that she was discharged.

         11        Q.    After her discharge did she come

         12      back down to see you again?

         13        A.    I don't recall that.  And that

         14      would be unusual because she spent years,

         15      such a long time, then by now, everything

         16      that has to be cleared after a surgical

         17      reconstruction has the clear, and you're

         18      pretty much healed.  And so it would be

         19      rather unusual for someone to spend, you

         20      know, several months in the hospital.

         21        Q.    You would expect she would need

         22      cardiology follow-up, though.  Is that

         23      correct?

         24        A.    Yes.


                                                         37


          1        Q.    Did you have any recommendation

          2      that you gave the Trudnaks for who to

          3      follow up with when they got back to

          4      Connecticut?

          5        A.    I think that we had a conversation

          6      when they were here as to who would be the

          7      point person in cardiology.  And I think

          8      that generally the way this will work is

          9      that that individual would, you know, make

         10      a call as to who should be the person for

         11      them to follow with up there.

         12        Q.    You meant --

         13        A.    I don't recall making a

         14      recommendation.

         15        Q.    You meant the point person here?

         16        A.    The point person here will connect

         17      with the person there.

         18        Q.    Got it.  Gotcha.

         19                  And have you had any contact

         20      with the family or with the patient since

         21      she was discharged?

         22        A.    I don't recall.  Certainly not in

         23      the recent past, but no, I don't recall.

         24        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Now I'm going to


                                                         38


          1      ask you some questions, I just want to know

          2      any conversations that you remember having

          3      with other persons about the incidents on

          4      3/29, about the emergency case.  And in

          5      this I don't want to know anything that you

          6      discussed with your attorney, obviously,

          7      but for other physicians that you worked

          8      with, any of the nurses, any of the staff.

          9                  First off, did you have any

         10      discussion with Dr. Seshachar, either

         11      during or after the case, that you recall?

         12        A.    I don't really have a specific

         13      recollection about a conversation.

         14        Q.    Okay.

         15        A.    I am pretty sure, though, that we

         16      had a peer review during our, you know,

         17      review of cases that we commonly and

         18      routinely do on Thursdays.

         19        Q.    Okay.  I don't want to know

         20      anything about what went on at that peer

         21      review.

         22        A.    No.  And I don't recall what went

         23      on there, but I'm sure that she made that

         24      list and a conversation, you know, was had


                                                         39


          1      about the events, the entire episode of

          2      care, the beginning surgery, the second

          3      surgery, the fact that, you know, there was

          4      this, you know, event in between.  I'm sure

          5      this is -- that's routine.

          6        Q.    Did you have any conversation --

          7      what I'm looking for is any conversations

          8      that you may have had with any other care

          9      providers or any other persons outside of

         10      the peer review process itself, outside of

         11      that meeting, or outside of your

         12      conversations with your counsel.

         13        A.    I have no recollection of that.  I

         14      can't really tell you anything because I

         15      just don't remember.

         16        Q.    Do you remember anybody from risk

         17      management or hospital administration

         18      approaching you and asking you about this

         19      case?

         20        A.    I don't.  I don't remember.  I

         21      don't think so, but I have no certainty.

         22        Q.    Do you remember, getting back to

         23      the case.  I'm sorry to jump around.

         24        A.    Yeah.


                                                         40


          1        Q.    While you were in the operating

          2      room we know that there was an

          3      anesthesiologist there, Dr. Seshachar.

          4        A.    Yeah.

          5        Q.    And you and your team were there.

          6        A.    Yeah.

          7        Q.    Do you recall any of the

          8      cardiologists or intensivists being there,

          9      anybody like Dr. Baffa or any of the

         10      intensive care people?

         11        A.    Perhaps the person who was on call

         12      in the intensive care unit that Saturday,

         13      as you said, but that would be an

         14      assumption.

         15        Q.    Okay.

         16        A.    Yeah.

         17                  MR. ZAKEOSIAN:  Okay.  Doctor,

         18      those are all the questions I have for you

         19      today.

         20                  THE WITNESS:  Great.

         21                  MR. ZAKEOSIAN:  All right?

         22                  THE WITNESS:  Super.

         23                  MR. BALAGUER:  I don't have any

         24      questions.

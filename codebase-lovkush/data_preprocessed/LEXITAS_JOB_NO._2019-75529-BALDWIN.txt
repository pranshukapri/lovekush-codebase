           20           DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. BALDWIN

           21   Q.  Good morning again, sir.

           22   A.  Good morning.

           23   Q.  We just met off the record.  My name is

           24       Carleigh Baldwin, and I represent Claire Mello in
                                                                        5




            1       the lawsuit that she filed against G. Greene

            2       Construction Company, Incorporated.  Could you,

            3       please, state your name for the record.

            4   A.  Peter DeSisto.

            5   Q.  Could you spell your last name.

            6   A.  D-E capital S-I-S-T-O.

            7   Q.  Say it one more time.

            8   A.  D-E capital S-I-S-T-O.

            9   Q.  Got it.  Mr. DeSisto, I am here to take your

           10       deposition today.  I'll go over a couple of basic

           11       ground rules just for the court reporter's sake.

           12       I'll just ask you to let me finish my question

           13       before you respond.  And I'll give you the same

           14       courtesy, let you finish your answer.  If you

           15       don't understand any of my questions, let me

           16       know, and I will be happy to repeat or rephrase

           17       them.  If you need to take a break at any time,

           18       that's fine; but I'll just ask you to answer the

           19       last question posed to you before we go off the

           20       record.

           21   A.  Sure.

           22   Q.  Mr. DeSisto, are you currently employed?

           23   A.  Yes.

           24   Q.  Where do you currently work?
                                                                        6




            1   A.  With G. Greene Construction.

            2   Q.  What's your job title there?

            3   A.  I am the site operations manager.

            4   Q.  Help me understand, sir, the structure of

            5       G. Greene Construction, who do you report to?

            6   A.  I report directly to Bob Greene, the owner.

            7   Q.  Anyone else above you before Bob Greene?

            8   A.  No.

            9   Q.  Do you have lateral --

           10   A.  -- yes.

           11   Q.  -- managers?

           12   A.  Yes.

           13   Q.  Who are those?

           14   A.  Kevin Krauss, Richard Shearns.

           15   Q.  Richard, I'm sorry, who?

           16   A.  Shearns.  And Biagio DiTullio, B-I-A-G-I-O,

           17       D-I-T-U-L-L-I-O.

           18   Q.  And what is Kevin Krauss's position?

           19   A.  He is vice president of big operations, I think,

           20       is his official title.

           21   Q.  How about Richard Shearns, what's his title?

           22   A.  He's the project executive.

           23   Q.  And Biagio?

           24   A.  Same, project executive.
                                                                        7




            1   Q.  How many employees does G. Greene Construction

            2       Company have?

            3   A.  Between 100, 150, I believe.

            4   Q.  And I don't need to know every employee that

            5       works there, but what sort of positions do those

            6       employees fill?

            7   A.  So, there's the office staff, obviously, which is

            8       probably 40 to 50.  And then there's probably a

            9       hundred plus of field, whether it be laborers,

           10       operators, carpenters, superintendents.

           11   Q.  How many jobs -- is it just fair for the record

           12       if I say Greene, that we're talking about

           13       G. Greene Construction?

           14   A.  Yes.

           15   Q.  How many jobs does Greene have at any one time?

           16   A.  I mean, it could range from 10 to, could be up to

           17       30.

           18   Q.  That's on average?

           19   A.  That's on average, mm-hmm.

           20              MS. BALDWIN: Before we get into it too

           21       deep, I want to mark the deposition notice.

           22              (Deposition Notice marked as Exhibit 1 for

           23       Identification.)

           24   Q.  Mr. DeSisto, I'm handing you what has been marked
                                                                        8




            1       as Exhibit No. 1.  This is the Notice of

            2       Deposition that was sent to your attorneys.  I

            3       just ask you to turn to the appendix to the

            4       Notice of Deposition located on Page 2 of Exhibit

            5       No. 1.  And, sir, are you the person with the

            6       most knowledge in regards to Topic No. 1 listed

            7       on Appendix A?

            8   A.  Yes.

            9   Q.  And are you the person with the most knowledge

           10       from preconstruction as to the topics listed

           11       under No. 2 of Appendix A?

           12   A.  Yes.

           13   Q.  Are you the person with the most knowledge as to

           14       Topic No. 3 on Appendix A?

           15   A.  Yes.

           16   Q.  Did you bring any documents with you today, sir?

           17   A.  I did not, no.  Oh, I'm sorry, I just brought the

           18       deposition notice.

           19   A.  Fair enough.

           20   Q.  In your role as site operations manager, what are

           21       your job responsibilities?

           22   A.  So, G. Greene has two separate divisions or site

           23       and civil operations and a building component,

           24       and I run the site and civil operations.
                                                                        9




            1   Q.  What does that mean, site and civil operations?

            2   A.  Civil construction site work, utility

            3       construction is what our main work is.

            4   Q.  And you said there's another building component's

            5       department?

            6   A.  Yes.  There's a separate -- there's a separate

            7       division that just does building work.

            8   Q.  And that literally means the interior of the

            9       building?

           10   A.  Interiors of buildings, mm-hmm.

           11   Q.  And so, you oversee the site and civil division?

           12   A.  Yes.

           13   Q.  What are your responsibilities within that

           14       division?

           15   A.  So, basically, I run the operations, review

           16       estimates, delegate different projects for

           17       different project managers, and, you know, just

           18       set up crews and delegate the work.

           19   Q.  So, a job comes into the office, how does it --

           20       how is it assigned?

           21              MS. BYRON: Objection.  You can answer.

           22   A.  So, we would -- if it was a bid job, our

           23       Estimating Department would get it.  They would

           24       bid it.  If we were fortunate enough to get it,
                                                                       10




            1       we would get a contract, and we just go do it.

            2   Q.  Take me through what it means to go through it.

            3   A.  Go through?

            4   Q.  Go through with it.

            5   A.  We would buy materials and procure subs and then

            6       set up whatever crews are going to go do the work

            7       itself, set up a project manager who is going to

            8       run the job itself, and then we mobilize crews

            9       and equipment to go do the work.

           10   Q.  Turning to the project, kind of, at issue in this

           11       case, a sidewalk in the 1500 area of Hyde Park

           12       Avenue, is that fair?

           13   A.  Yes.

           14   Q.  Was that a bid job?

           15   A.  It was not, no.

           16   Q.  Did Greene Construction have a contract with

           17       anyone to prepare the sidewalk in that area?

           18   A.  No.

           19   Q.  How did Greene Construction come to undertake the

           20       work at issue in this case?

           21   A.  So, the sidewalk as it sat in the existing

           22       sidewalk was in disrepair.  The city didn't --

           23       wasn't on their agenda to get fixed or -- so, we

           24       -- the city allowed us to repair the sidewalk.

           16       Park Ave. address, what is that space utilized

           17       for?

           18   A.  Just for equipment, storage, materials.

           19   Q.  Is there an address for that storage facility?

            7   Q.  When did you first start utilizing the Hyde Park

            9   A.  I don't know what the exact date is.

           10   Q.  How long has Greene Construction been around?

           11              MS. BYRON: Been around?

           12              MS. BALDWIN: Been around, yeah.

           13   A.  I believe 53 years or 54 years.  I know we just

           17   Q.  Have you always been a site operations manager?

           18   A.  No, I worked my way through the ranks.  I started

           19       as a superintendent and worked as a project

           20       manager for a while.

           21   Q.  What did you do before you were working for

           22       Greene Construction?

                                                                       13




            1   A.  Steven Ando Paull Contracting out of West

            5   Q.  What was your position there?

            6   A.  It was project manager.

            7   Q.  Just very briefly, take me through your

            8       educational background.

            9   A.  Graduated high school, went to Wentworth

           10       Institute, graduated 4 years with a Civil

           11       Engineering Degree.

           12   Q.  Any other education or training that you've

           13       received?

           14   A.  No.

           15   Q.  Any licenses or certificates that you hold?

           16   A.  No, other than safety, OSHA 40 licenses, first

           17       aid and whatnot.

           18   Q.  You mentioned OSHA, what's the OSHA certification

           19       that you have?

           20   A.  It's a 40-hour -- it's a 40-hour safety course is

           21       what it is.

           22   Q.  When did you first obtain that?

           23   A.  Honestly, I don't know.  It's been a while.

           24   Q.  Do you have to recertify?
                                                                       14




            1   A.  No.

            2   Q.  That was just a one time thing that you did?

            3   A.  Mm-hmm.

            4   Q.  Was it more than 5 years ago?

            5   A.  Yes.

            6   Q.  More than 10 years ago?

            7   A.  Probably.

            8   Q.  Have you taken any OSHA training courses since

            9       you first took that 40-hour certification?

           10   A.  There's a Haz -- what they call a Haz -- they

           11       call it Hazwoper.  It's a 10-hour hazardous

           12       material.

           13   Q.  Turning back to the property over at 1591 Hyde

           14       Park Ave., who was the project manager or project

           15       superintendent for that project?

           16   A.  I was actually.

           17   Q.  Were you both?  I'm sorry, that was a bad

           18       question.

           19   A.  Yeah, I guess I was both.

           20   Q.  Who else was working on that job?

           21   A.  We had foremen, a couple of different foremen and

           22       laborers.

           23   Q.  Did Greene Construction keep records of who was

           24       working on that job site while it was under
                                                                       15




            1       construction?

            2   A.  Other than payroll, I don't think so.

            3   Q.  Would the payroll records indicate what job an

            4       employee was assigned to?

            5   A.  I believe so.

            6   Q.  So, if I was a laborer and I was working on the

            7       Hyde Park Ave. construction of the sidewalk, the

            8       payroll records would indicate that I was

            9       assigned for X number of days to that job?

           10   A.  Possibly, yes.

           11   Q.  Do you have a specific recollection of any of the

           12       foremen or laborers that were working on that

           13       project?

           14   A.  I don't.  It was -- it could have been a number

           15       of different people at that point.

           16   Q.  So, what are the job responsibilities of a site

           17       superintendent?

           18   A.  It would be to perform the work and just get the

           19       work done.

           20   Q.  Okay.  Are they responsible for supervising any

           21       employees?

           22   A.  Yes.

           23   Q.  Who are they supervising?

           24   A.  Foremen, laborers and operators.
                                                                       16




            1   Q.  And what are the job responsibilities for the

            2       foremen?

            3   A.  Foremen would actually perform the work with a

            4       laborer and an operator.

            5   Q.  Do they have any supervisory role?

            6   A.  Other than leading the crew, no.

            7   Q.  And then, what are the job responsibilities of

            8       the laborers and operators?

            9   A.  They would work under a foreman as directed.

           10   Q.  When did the sidewalk project -- is it fair if we

           11       call it the sidewalk project?

           12   A.  Sure.

           13   Q.  When did the sidewalk project begin?

           14   A.  I want to say it was Spring of 2018, I think, or

           15       '17.  I don't know.  I'm not sure, to be honest

           16       with you.  The years run into each other.  Sorry.

           17   Q.  That's all right.  Was construction happening on

           18       that project every day?

           19   A.  No.

           20   Q.  When did the project complete?

           21   A.  It would have been June of the same year.

           22   Q.  Could you take me through what exactly, what the

           23       work was that was going to be done?

           24   A.  The existing sidewalk was removed.  We installed
                                                                       17




            1       granite curbing, installed gravel behind the curb

            2       and then poured concrete sidewalks.

            3   Q.  Going back for just a moment.  The project

            4       manager, what are the job responsibilities of a

            5       project manager?

            6   A.  He would procure materials and/or subcontractors

            7       if they were needed on the job.

            8   Q.  Were any subcontractors utilized --

            9   A.  -- no.

           10   Q.  -- in the sidewalk project at issue in this case?

           11   A.  No.

           12   Q.  Do you have any records of the progress of the

           13       work that was being done on the sidewalk, what

           14       days, what work was completed?

           15   A.  I believe we do have some photos, yeah.

           16   Q.  So, the first thing to be done was to remove the

           17       existing sidewalk, correct?

           18   A.  Mm-hmm.

           19   Q.  Is that a yes?

           20   A.  Yes, I'm sorry.

           21   Q.  What kind of sidewalk existed prior to the

           22       removal?

           23   A.  It was all asphalt.

           24   Q.  How long did it take to remove all of the
                                                                       18




            1       asphalt?

            2   A.  Probably a couple of days.

            3   Q.  And then the granite curbs were installed?

            4   A.  Yes.

            5   Q.  Did you procure the granite curbs?

            6   A.  We did.

            7   Q.  Did you personally procure --

            8   A.  -- I did.

            9   Q.  -- the granite curbs?

           10   A.  I did, yes.

           11              MS. BYRON: Wait until she finishes.  It

           12       will make it easier for the court reporter.

           13   Q.  And as I said before, the unh-unh, all your

           14       answers have to be verbal today.

           15   A.  Yeah.

           16              MS. BYRON: Everybody does that all the

           17       time.

           18   Q.  How long did the installation of the granite

           19       curbs take?

           20   A.  Offhand, I don't know the exact days; but my best

           21       recollection, probably a couple or three days.

           22   Q.  How many employees of Greene Construction did you

           23       have working on this project on average,

           24       including laborers and operators?
                                                                       19




            1   A.  Again, I can't be certain, but I would -- to the

            2       best of my recollection, be three.  Three or

            3       four.

            4   Q.  Who decides how many employees are required for a

            5       job?

            6   A.  I would.

            7   Q.  Knowing what this job entails, how many employees

            8       would you request for this?

            9   A.  Three to four.

           10   Q.  And you don't recall who those three to four

           11       individuals were?

           12   A.  It changed quite often.

           13   Q.  Would you get a new crew every day?

           14   A.  No, it wouldn't be every day.

           15   Q.  How often would the crews change?

           16   A.  Maybe weekly, depending on our other, whatever

           17       work we have going on.

           18   Q.  Does Greene Construction utilize a punch card

           19       system, some sort of a time clock?

           20              MS. BYRON: Objection as to form.

           21   A.  No, they don't, no.

           22   Q.  How are your employees paid?

           23   A.  Weekly.

           24   Q.  How do you know what hours they worked or what
                                                                       20




            1       jobs they worked on?

            2   A.  So, we have -- right now, I'm not sure when it

            3       went -- we actually instituted it, but right now,

            4       we have it electronically.

            5   Q.  So, did they have to clock in somewhere?

            6   A.  We don't clock in.  The foreman or superintendent

            7       would put their hours in at the end of the week.

            8   Q.  So, is the foreman or the project manager keeping

            9       track of the hours of the employees that are

           10       working on a specific site?

           11   A.  Yes.  I'm sorry, yes.

           12   Q.  Is there some sort of a form that he has to turn

           13       in or --

           14   A.  We previously used just an Excel file that they

           15       would fill out, do their hours for the week.

           16       Like I said, now it's electronic.

           17   Q.  Okay.

           18   A.  But they just fill in their daily hours that they

           19       work.

           20   Q.  So, if I'm a laborer and I go work eight hours on

           21       a project, it's just going to reflect that I

           22       worked eight hours?

           23   A.  Correct.

           24   Q.  Are there any records kept anywhere what
                                                                       21




            1       employees are assigned to what jobs?

            2   A.  I would believe so, yes.

            3   Q.  So, if you were to go back to Greene

            4       Construction, where would you look for that

            5       information?

            6   A.  I would have to talk to the payroll manager or

            7       department, whatever.

            8   Q.  Sure.  And just to be clear, I'm asking if you

            9       were to go back and look to see what employees

           10       were assigned to the sidewalk project at Hyde

           11       Park Avenue, is that information that you could

           12       find?

           13   A.  I would say yes.

           14   Q.  Who's responsible for hiring new employees?

           15              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           16   A.  For the site and civil division, I would.

           17   Q.  And when you hire a new employee, be it a laborer

           18       or an operator, one of the crew, do they go

           19       through any specific training?

           20   A.  Other than making sure they have at least an

           21       OSHA-10 training.  If they do not, we provide it.

           22       Other than that, no.

           23   Q.  Does Greene Construction have an employee

           24       handbook?
                                                                       22




            1   A.  Yes.

            2   Q.  What's contained in that employee handbook?

            3              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            4   A.  I guess it would be anything the employees --

            5       anything the employees need to know about their

            6       company.

            7   Q.  I'm sorry, I don't have a copy, so I'm just

            8       trying to figure out what it contains, if you

            9       know.

           10   A.  Honestly, I can't tell you.  It's been so long

           11       since I read it.  I can't remember exactly what's

           12       in it specifically.

           13   Q.  Are there any policies and procedures of Greene

           14       Construction contained in the employee handbook?

           15   A.  I would imagine so, yes.

           16   Q.  When new employees are hired, you mentioned

           17       something about an OSHA-10 training?

           18   A.  Yes.

           19   Q.  What is that?

           20   A.  That's similar to the OSHA 40, only it's 10

           21       hours.

           22   Q.  What kind of things are covered in an OSHA-10

           23       training?

           24   A.  It's very general.  It would be proper PPE, hard
                                                                       23




            1       hats, safety glasses, gloves, things like that.

            2   Q.  What does PPE stand for?

            3   A.  I knew you were going to ask me that.  Personal

            4       protective equipment.

            5   Q.  Is there anything covered in that OSHA-10

            6       training about job site safety?

            7   A.  I do not believe so, but I'm not a hundred

            8       percent sure.

            9   Q.  Does Greene Construction provide any training

           10       about job site safety?

           11   A.  Well, we have policies.

           12   Q.  What are Greene's policies regarding job site

           13       safety?

           14              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           15   A.  I mean, there's a number of different safety

           16       protocols, whether it be trenching, even as far

           17       as driving.  I mean, there's different --

           18   Q.  Are those procedures contained in one document

           19       that's provided to employees?

           20   A.  I believe so.  Yes.

           21   Q.  What's the title of that document?

           22   A.  I believe it's in the -- honestly, I don't recall

           23       what it's -- we have a safety manual, yes.  So,

           24       probably be the safety manual, I would assume.
                                                                       24




            1   Q.  And I know you don't have it in front of you, but

            2       what sort of things are covered in the safety

            3       manual?

            4              MS. BYRON: Objection.  Do you know?

            5   A.  It runs a gamut from, again, excavation to

            6       anything with building, people would have also,

            7       as far as scaffolding, tying off if you're up so

            8       many feet in the air.  It's a complete manual.

            9   Q.  Does the manual cover sidewalk repairs?

           10   A.  I'm not sure if it's specific on that.

           11   Q.  Does it cover sidewalk closures?

           12   A.  I'm not sure if it's specific on that.

           13   Q.  When was the last time you looked at the safety

           14       manual?

           15              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           16   A.  Could be 6 months.

           17   Q.  Who's responsible for safety on the job site?

           18              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           19   A.  Day-to-day safety?

           20   Q.  Yes.

           21   A.  So, it's the superintendent or the foreman.

           22   Q.  So, on the Hyde Park Ave. Sidewalk Project, who

           23       is responsible for safety on that job site?

           24   A.  Would be the foreman that was working there at
                                                                       25




            1       the time.

            2   Q.  And you don't recall who the foreman was for this

            3       Hyde Park Sidewalk Project?

            4   A.  Not off the top of my head, no.

            5   Q.  What sort of safety precautions were put into

            6       place during construction on the Hyde Park

            7       Sidewalk Project?

            8              MS. BYRON: Objection.  Go ahead.

            9   A.  So, day-to-day, we had signage up.  While we were

           10       working, we would detour pedestrian traffic

           11       across the sidewalk to the other side of the

           12       street, detour pedestrian traffic to the other

           13       side.  We had barrels, cones.

           14   Q.  So, while you were working, you said you would

           15       detour pedestrian traffic across the street?

           16   A.  Mm-hmm.

           17   Q.  How would you do that?

           18   A.  Again, signage at either end of the project and

           19       then barricades, barrels.

           20   Q.  And who was responsible for ensuring that the

           21       signage and the barrels and the other items you

           22       discussed were in place?

           23   A.  It would have been the -- day-to-day, it would

           24       have been the foreman who was there.
                                                                       26




            1   Q.  Is anyone checking to make sure that it's done

            2       properly?

            3              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            4   A.  Yeah, I mean there were different, you know,

            5       whether it's our safety officer or even myself

            6       that might be out there at one point or another.

            7       It wasn't specifically a regimented check, I

            8       guess.

            9   Q.  What's a safety officer?

           10   A.  He's in charge of the safety for the company.

           11   Q.  Who is that?

           12   A.  His name is John Downy.

           13   Q.  What are John's responsibilities as the safety

           14       officer --

           15              MS. BYRON: -- objection.

           16   Q.  -- if you know?

           17              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           18   A.  All I know is, he's in charge of safety for the

           19       company, yes.

           20   Q.  Was John Downy the safety officer in May of 2017?

           21   A.  I believe he was.

           22   Q.  Is John still employed with the company?

           23   A.  Yes, he is.

           24   Q.  I'm sorry, I should have asked you this earlier;
                                                                       27




            1       have you ever given a deposition before?

            2   A.  I have not.  I'm sure it shows.

            3   Q.  Have you ever testified in court before?

            4   A.  No, I have not.

            5   Q.  Aside from your attorney, did you speak to anyone

            6       prior to coming here today regarding your

            7       deposition?

            8   A.  No.

            9   Q.  Did you review any documents in anticipation of

           10       your deposition here today?

           11   A.  No.

           12   Q.  And you don't recall when Greene Construction

           13       first began utilizing the space on Hyde Park

           14       Ave., correct?

           15   A.  The exact date, I'm not sure.

           16   Q.  Do you know about what time they started leasing

           17       that property?

           18   A.  Probably would have been around the time that

           19       construction -- that we were working on the

           20       sidewalk.

           21   Q.  Did you have to obtain any building permits for

           22       the sidewalk project?

           23   A.  No building permit was required.  We did get a

           24       public works excavation permit.
                                                                       28




            1   Q.  Did you receive written permission from the city

            2       to work on the sidewalk?

            3   A.  As part of the permit process, yeah.

            4   Q.  Did any city inspector come to observe the

            5       project at any point before its completion?

            6   A.  Not that I'm aware of.

            7   Q.  Did the project receive any citations for any

            8       reason during construction?

            9   A.  Not that I'm aware of.

           10   Q.  I would like to show you some photos.

           11              (Photographs marked as Exhibit 2 for

           12       Identification.)

           13   Q.  Handing you what has been marked as Exhibit 2.

           14       It's a package of photographs labeled A through

           15       M.  I ask you to take a look at those; and once

           16       you're done reviewing them, I have some

           17       questions.

           18   A.  All set.

           19   Q.  Starting with Page A of Exhibit No. 2, do you

           20       recognize what's shown in that photograph?

           21   A.  I do.

           22   Q.  Can you tell me what it is?

           23   A.  It is one of the entrances to the property.

           24   Q.  And to be fair, there's a time date stamp on the
                                                                       29




            1       bottom of this photograph, do you see that?

            2   A.  Yes, I do.

            3   Q.  And that says May 28th, 2017?

            4   A.  It does.

            5   Q.  Does this photograph accurately show the property

            6       located at 1591 Hyde Park Ave.?

            7   A.  It does.

            8   Q.  Looking at Page B of Exhibit No. 2, do you

            9       recognize what's shown in that photograph?

           10   A.  I do.

           11   Q.  Can you tell me what it is?

           12   A.  It is the same driveway to the property.

           13   Q.  Now, in this photograph is a cone and some

           14       caution tape on one side of the sidewalk, is that

           15       fair?

           16   A.  It is, yes.

           17   Q.  And also, I can represent this full pack of

           18       photographs is from the same date stamp.  Some of

           19       the date stamps are more visible than the others;

           20       but is this a fair and accurate representation of

           21       how the project, the Hyde Park Sidewalk Project

           22       looked on May 28th, 2017?

           23              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           24   A.  I would say so.
                                                                       30




            1   Q.  Is this a safe way to leave a work or job site?

            2              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            3   A.  We're supposed to leave ramps at the end of where

            4       the new concrete stops.  So, if we put gravel in,

            5       'cause it's a temporary ramp, because we're

            6       eventually going to be doing that driveway, so

            7       that's what we did there.

            8   Q.  So, you can see the driveway is still paved with

            9       asphalt, is that fair to say?

           10   A.  Yes, it is.

           11   Q.  And down at the bottom of the photograph and

           12       towards the top of the photograph, there are new

           13       sidewalks, is that correct?

           14   A.  That's correct.

           15   Q.  Did Greene Construction install those new

           16       sidewalks?

           17   A.  We did.

           18   Q.  And I believe from your testimony, the plan was

           19       to complete the sidewalk across the driveway?

           20   A.  That is correct, yes.

           21   Q.  So, is your testimony that gravel was installed

           22       in between the new concrete and the paved

           23       asphalt?

           24   A.  Yes.
                                                                       31




            1   Q.  Is there a reason that a ramp wasn't utilized to

            2       cover that gravel that you had installed?

            3              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            4   A.  Normally, we would -- again, if it's long term,

            5       we would put a ramp in.  If it's short term,

            6       which this was, we would just put gravel in,

            7       which is acceptable.  And as long as it's put in

            8       correctly, it creates a ramp, so it doesn't

            9       create trip hazards.

           10   Q.  What does it mean to be put in correctly?

           11              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           12   A.  Install the gravel and compact it.

           13   Q.  And turn to photo number or letter c of Exhibit

           14       No. 2.  Do you recognize what's shown in this

           15       photograph?

           16   A.  I do.

           17   Q.  Can you tell me what it is?

           18   A.  Same driveway.

           19   Q.  Is there a reason that there's only a cone and

           20       caution tape on one side of the driveway?

           21   A.  I can't answer that.  I don't know the answer to

           22       that question.

           23   Q.  Who is in charge of putting the barrel and the

           24       caution tape out?
                                                                       32




            1   A.  It would have been the foreman.

            2   Q.  Who we don't know?

            3   A.  Yup.

            4   Q.  Where is your office located?

            5   A.  Allston.

            6   Q.  During the time that this project was under way,

            7       how many times did you visit the job site?

            8   A.  Possibly once a day.

            9   Q.  Do you have a specific recollection of being

           10       there once a day?

           11   A.  It happens to be on my way home, so I would stop

           12       probably towards the end of the day or early

           13       morning, depending on which way I was going at

           14       the time.

           15   Q.  So, you drive down Hyde Park Ave. past this

           16       sidewalk on your way home?

           17   A.  Some days.  Like I said, it depended on what I

           18       was doing in the afternoon, but yes, or early

           19       morning.

           20   Q.  Looking at Exhibit No. C, do you take any issue

           21       with how this job site was left?

           22              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           23   A.  No.

           24   Q.  So, if you were driving home and you observed the
                                                                       33




            1       job site in this condition, that would be fine?

            2   A.  If the ramps were installed, then yeah.

            3   Q.  Turning to Page D of Exhibit No. 2.  Do you

            4       recognize what's shown in this photograph?

            5   A.  Same driveway, yes.

            6   Q.  It's not real clear, so let's continue on.  Do

            7       you recognize what's shown in Page No. E of

            8       Exhibit 2?

            9   A.  I do.

           10   Q.  Could you tell me what it is?

           11   A.  Same driveway.

           12   Q.  This shows one of the edges of the sidewalk with

           13       the gravel starting after the finished sidewalk

           14       ends.  Do you see any issues with the way that

           15       the gravel was installed in this photograph?

           16              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           17   A.  The ramp was put in.  It looks like there were a

           18       couple of edges, but there was, obviously, gravel

           19       put in to create a ramp.

           20   Q.  Are there any documents or any guidelines as to

           21       how these gravel ramps are to be installed?

           22              MS. BYRON: Objection.  Maintained by

           23       Greene?

           24   A.  I don't believe so.
                                                                       34




            1              MS. BALDWIN: Yes.

            2   A.  They're temporary ramps, so no.

            3   Q.  Who would be the people or persons putting this

            4       gravel down and compacting it?

            5   A.  It would be whichever crew was there at the time.

            6   Q.  And would anyone be making sure that the ramp was

            7       sufficiently adjacent to the sidewalk?

            8              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            9   A.  It would be the crew that was there that

           10       particular day.

           11   Q.  All right.  Looking at Page F of Exhibit No. 2,

           12       do you recognize what's shown in that photograph?

           13   A.  I do.

           14   Q.  Where does the crew get the gravel from to create

           15       a ramp?

           16   A.  We purchase it.

           17   Q.  Does Page F of Exhibit No. 2 show gravel that was

           18       purchased in order to create a ramp?

           19   A.  I would say yes.

           20   Q.  Where would you purchase this gravel from?

           21   A.  We have a number of different vendors that we buy

           22       gravel from.

           23   Q.  And the project manager would be in charge of

           24       purchasing, correct?
                                                                       35




            1   A.  A quantity of that size is pretty much determined

            2       by the foreman on the job to send the truck to

            3       wherever he might, whichever is convenient at the

            4       time, I would think.

            5   Q.  Okay.  So, it's your testimony that the ramps

            6       between the finished sidewalk and the driveway

            7       were filled temporarily with purchased gravel

            8       that was procured offsite?

            9              MS. BYRON: Objection to form.  Go ahead.

           10   A.  That's the best of my recollection, yes.

           11   Q.  Does that look like purchased gravel?

           12              MS. BYRON: Objection.  Asked and answered.

           13   A.  Yeah.  It's a recycled product.

           14   Q.  Turning to Page G of Exhibit No. 2.  Do you

           15       recognize what is shown in that photograph?

           16   A.  I do.

           17   Q.  And what is shown in that photograph?

           18   A.  It's the same sidewalk and same driveway.

           19   Q.  Do you see any issue with the ramps that we've

           20       been discussing in this photograph?

           21              MS. BYRON: Objection.  Asked and answered.

           22   A.  No.

           23   Q.  Is it acceptable to leave edges, as you described

           24       them earlier --
                                                                       36




            1              MS. BYRON: -- objection.

            2   Q.  -- exposed?

            3   A.  No.

            4   Q.  Would you consider those exposed edges shown in

            5       Exhibit No. G a tripping hazard?

            6              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            7   A.  I wouldn't, but someone else might.

            8   Q.  Do you think that the job site as it's been left

            9       and depicted in Exhibit 2, Page G is an

           10       acceptable way to leave that job site?

           11              MR. BYRON: Objection.  Again, he answered

           12       this.

           13   A.  Yeah.

           14   Q.  Turning to Page H.  Page I, do you recognize

           15       what's shown in that photograph?

           16   A.  I do.

           17   Q.  What is that?

           18   A.  That's the property across the street from the

           19       job.

           20   Q.  Okay.  And Page J?

           21   A.  The same.

           22   Q.  Page K, do you recognize what's shown in that

           23       photograph?

           24   A.  I do.
                                                                       37




            1   Q.  Can you tell me what it is?

            2   A.  It is a barrel, safety barrel, drum.

            3   Q.  And Greene Construction's logo is on that barrel,

            4       correct?

            5   A.  It is.

            6   Q.  Does Greene Construction own all the cones and

            7       safety materials that they install on job sites?

            8   A.  We own some.  We don't own -- we do rent at

            9       times.

           10   Q.  Okay.  Where are those cones and barrels stored?

           11   A.  At our Hyde Park property.

           12   Q.  So, all the cones and barrels that Greene does

           13       own are stored at that Hyde Park facility?

           14   A.  Unless they're being utilized somewhere else.

           15   Q.  And Page L?

           16   A.  Recognize it.

           17   Q.  Can you tell me what it is?

           18   A.  Same property.

           19   Q.  Okay.

           20              (Photographs marked as Exhibit 3 for

           21       Identification.)

           22              MS. BALDWIN: She found these later.

           23       They'll be in our document production.

           24              MS. BYRON: Okay.  Do they have that?
                                                                       38




            1              MS. BALDWIN: Yes, they do.

            2              MS. BYRON: The first page isn't super

            3       visible, but the second page has a date stamp of

            4       July 1st, 2017.

            5   Q.  All right.  I'll just ask you to take a look at

            6       Exhibit No. 3 for me and let me know once you've

            7       taken a look at those photographs, Mr. DeSisto.

            8   A.  Okay.

            9   Q.  Do you recognize the area that's shown in those

           10       photographs?

           11   A.  I do.

           12   Q.  Can you tell me, what is it?

           13   A.  Same driveway.

           14   Q.  Is there a reason why there are multiple cones

           15       shown in this area, as well as the sidewalk

           16       closure sign, where there wasn't in the previous

           17       set of photographs that we looked at?

           18   A.  My assumption would be, we had just poured the

           19       driveway.

           20   Q.  So, fair to say that that driveway was poured

           21       around July 1st, 2017?

           22   A.  Would have been poured in June, but yeah.

           23   Q.  That's fair.  How long would you leave cones like

           24       this after you've poured the concrete?
                                                                       39




            1   A.  For a driveway, probably five days or so.

            2   Q.  Do you recall when the gravel ramps were

            3       initially installed?

            4   A.  I do not.  Datewise, I do not.

            5   Q.  Fair to say, they were in existence around May

            6       28th, 2017?

            7   A.  I think it's fair to say that.

            8   Q.  And is it fair to say that the concrete wasn't

            9       poured until about a month later?

           10   A.  I think it's fair to say that.

           11   Q.  Would those gravel ramps still be considered

           12       temporary if they were there for over a month?

           13              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           14   A.  Yes.

           15   Q.  If they were there for a month, was anyone

           16       checking to make sure that they hadn't eroded or

           17       washed away?

           18   A.  I would imagine so, yeah.

           19   Q.  Who would be responsible for checking and

           20       maintaining those ramps?

           21   A.  Again, could have been a number of different

           22       people, myself or -- depending on if we had a

           23       crew there, it would be the crew that was there

           24       doing other, whatever other things we were doing
                                                                       40




            1       at the time.

            2   Q.  Would there be any records created that the ramps

            3       were checked or filled again?

            4   A.  No.

            5   Q.  Would there be a Purchase Agreement for the

            6       gravel?

            7              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            8   A.  No.

            9   Q.  So, the foreman decides that you need gravel, and

           10       he sends a truck to go pick it up.  It's paid

           11       for, and there's no receipt of that gravel

           12       purchase anywhere?

           13   A.  I would say there's a receipt for the gravel,

           14       yes.

           15   Q.  Okay.  And that would be a receipt that's kept in

           16       the business records of Greene Construction?

           17   A.  I would imagine so.

           18   Q.  Do you have a memory of purchasing the gravel?

           19   A.  I can't say that I do.

           20              (Sidewalk and Bike Lane Closure Management

           21       Plan marked as Exhibit 4 for Identification.)

           22   Q.  All set?

           23   A.  Yes.

           24   Q.  Do you recognize that document?
                                                                       41




            1   A.  I do.

            2   Q.  Could you tell me what it is?

            3   A.  It is a Sidewalk and Bike Lane Closure Management

            4       Plan.

            5   Q.  Do you know who created this document?

            6   A.  Specifically, I do not.

            7   Q.  Is it part of a larger document?

            8   A.  I believe so.

            9   Q.  What document is it a larger part?

           10   A.  I believe it's part of our safety manual.

           11   Q.  Do you know that it's part of the safety manual?

           12   A.  I do not, no.  I don't know a hundred percent.

           13   Q.  If you wanted to access this, where would you go

           14       for it?

           15   A.  I would probably start in the safety manual.  If

           16       it's not, I would talk to the safety officer.

           17   Q.  In the first sentence, I want to direct your

           18       attention to the first sentence here.  It says

           19       "When work requires sidewalk/curb replacement or

           20       road work that blocks bike lanes, G. Greene

           21       ensures that the correct plans are put into place

           22       to move any pedestrian, car or bike traffic past

           23       the work zone safely."  Did I read that

           24       correctly?
                                                                       42




            1   A.  Yes, ma'am.

            2   Q.  And the next sentence contains an acronym MUTDC,

            3       do you know what that stands for?

            4   A.  Manual of Uniform Traffic Devices.  I'm not sure

            5       what the C -- maybe it's code.  I'm not a hundred

            6       percent sure.

            7   Q.  And are you familiar with those codes?

            8   A.  I know of them, yes.

            9   Q.  Jumping down to the fourth sentence here that

           10       begins "Any work that involves sidewalk closure

           11       will be indicated by signs, a clear and safe path

           12       around the work zone or if it's needed, is

           13       provided to the nearest crosswalk."  Did I read

           14       that correctly?

           15   A.  You did.

           16   Q.  You mentioned earlier that while construction was

           17       ongoing on the Hyde Park Sidewalk Project,

           18       pedestrian traffic was diverted across the

           19       street, is that right?

           20   A.  Yes.

           21   Q.  How was the pedestrian traffic diverted across

           22       the street?

           23   A.  Signs and barrels, I would guess.

           24   Q.  I don't want you to guess.
                                                                       43




            1   A.  Okay.

            2   Q.  Do you know how it was diverted?

            3   A.  I know we had signs up, and I know we had barrels

            4       up; and at various times, we had a police detail,

            5       I'm sure, but I don't know that for a fact.

            6   Q.  Would you consider the cone and barrel shown in

            7       Exhibit No. 2 -- or excuse me, the barrel and the

            8       caution tape shown in Exhibit No. 2 as a sidewalk

            9       closure?

           10              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           11   A.  No.

           12   Q.  Why does the caution tape run across the

           13       sidewalk?

           14   A.  I can't answer that.  I don't know.

           15   Q.  Do you know what the purpose of putting the cone

           16       and the caution tape there was?

           17   A.  I can only speculate.

           18   Q.  I don't want you to speculate.  Do you know?

           19   A.  I don't know.

           20   Q.  Jumping down, the fourth line from the top here

           21       -- from the bottom, it begins "Any excavations

           22       that are left open will be plated entirely by

           23       steel plates, and all edges will have compacted

           24       cold patch asphalt to ensure there is no tripping
                                                                       44




            1       hazards for pedestrians or bikes."  Would the

            2       sidewalk area that we've been discussing that's

            3       depicted in Exhibit No. 2 where the gravel was

            4       installed be considered an excavation?

            5   A.  Yes, it's an excavation, yes.

            6   Q.  Was there a reason why steel plates weren't

            7       utilized here?

            8   A.  Steel plates are utilized mainly for trenching

            9       operations.  We don't use steel plates usually

           10       for temporary transitions.

           11   Q.  What besides gravel do you use -- strike that

           12       whole thing.  What other things besides gravel do

           13       you use for temporary transitions, if anything?

           14   A.  Depending on what was required by a particular

           15       owner or who we were working for.  I mean, it

           16       could be anything from temporary asphalt to cold

           17       patch, which is a cold asphalt.

           18   Q.  Okay.  Were any restrictions placed on Greene

           19       Construction by the City of Boston as to what

           20       could or should be used for a temporary

           21       transition from the Hyde Park Sidewalk Project?

           22   A.  I don't believe so.

           23   Q.  You had the whole range of options was available

           24       to you?
                                                                       45




            1   A.  Yes.

            2   Q.  But you chose compacted gravel?

            3   A.  Yes.

            4   Q.  Why?

            5              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            6   A.  I can't answer that.  I mean, I don't know at

            7       this point.

            8   Q.  Who chose compacted gravel?

            9   A.  Specifically, I don't know.

           10   Q.  But you were the project superintendent?

           11   A.  Yes.

           12   Q.  And the project manager?

           13   A.  Yes.

           14   Q.  Who is Thomas Bettle?

           15   A.  He is the -- I believe his official title is CFO.

           16              (Answers to Interrogatories marked as

           17       Exhibit 5 for Identification.)

           18   Q.  Handing you what has been marked as Exhibit No.

           19       5, have you ever seen this document before?

           20   A.  Not in its entirety, no.

           21   Q.  Turning to the second to last page here, there is

           22       a signature that's Thomas Bettle, member of

           23       Greene Construction Company, answered these

           24       interrogatories, do you see that?
                                                                       46




            1              MS. BYRON: Page 10.

            2   A.  Yes.

            3   Q.  Did you provide Mr. Bettle with any assistance in

            4       answering these questions?  You can take your

            5       time to look through them.

            6   A.  Yeah.  I honestly do not recall whether he asked

            7       me any of these questions or not.

            8   Q.  Okay.  Going back to the -- that's fine, you can

            9       set that aside.  If you don't recall, that's

           10       okay.  Going back to the gravel ramps for a

           11       moment; what's the most expensive option for

           12       temporary ramps?

           13              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           14   A.  It would depend on the material.  I would assume

           15       it would be asphalt.

           16   Q.  What's the least expensive option for temporary

           17       ramps?

           18              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           19   A.  Using nothing.

           20   Q.  Say that again?

           21   A.  Using nothing.

           22   Q.  Okay.  If you were going to use something, what

           23       would the least expensive option be?

           24              MS. BYRON: Objection.
                                                                       47




            1   A.  Probably gravel.

            2   Q.  Aside from -- I don't want to know about

            3       anything, any discussions you had with your

            4       attorneys.  When was the first time you learned

            5       about Ms. Mello's fall?

            6              MS. BYRON: Again, I know she said it, but

            7       make sure that any conversation that we have had,

            8       just don't talk about those.

            9   A.  I know the company received a notice at one

           10       point, I'm just not sure when it was.  I don't

           11       know the exact date.

           12   Q.  Were there any discussions -- obviously, again

           13       setting aside any conversations that you had with

           14       your attorney -- about the circumstances of

           15       Ms. Mello's fall?

           16   A.  Internally at the company?

           17   Q.  Yes.

           18   A.  Again, I don't -- I have no recollection, but I'm

           19       guessing, yes, we probably discussed it at one

           20       point.

           21   Q.  Were you a part of those discussions as the

           22       project superintendent for that project?

           23   A.  I would imagine so.

           24   Q.  And you don't recall the outcome of those
                                                                       48




            1       conversations?

            2   A.  Honestly, I do not, no.

            3   Q.  Were there any changes that were implemented by

            4       Greene Construction after learning of Ms. Mello's

            5       fall?

            6              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            7   A.  No.

            8   Q.  So, nothing changed in the way the ramps were

            9       installed after Ms. Mello's fall?

           10              MS. BYRON: Objection.

           11   A.  I don't recall that we did anything differently.

           12       I'm not even sure what the date was that we

           13       received notice.

           14   Q.  Okay.  Looking at Page B of Exhibit No. 2, do you

           15       see that there's a piece of wood in that

           16       photograph?

           17   A.  I do.

           18   Q.  Do you have any idea where that wood came from?

           19   A.  I do not.

           20   Q.  Is there a reason that that wood is there?  Is it

           21       somehow structurally part of the ramp?

           22   A.  I don't believe it is.

           23   Q.  And again, you think that this is a perfectly

           24       fine way to leave the job construction site?
                                                                       49




            1              MS. BYRON: Objection.  Asked and answered.

            2   A.  Yes.

            3              (Photograph marked as Exhibit 6 for

            4       Identification.)

            5   Q.  Handing you what has been marked as Exhibit No.

            6       6.  Do you recognize what's shown in this

            7       photograph?

            8   A.  I do, yes.

            9   Q.  There is some writing, and this came from Google.

           10       So, do you see Hyde Park Ave. as shown down the

           11       center of the photograph?

           12   A.  I do.

           13   Q.  There's a small red icon, and that's 1591 Hyde

           14       Park Avenue?

           15   A.  Yes, it is.

           16   Q.  Is this parking lot to the left of the left side

           17       of Hyde Park Avenue, is that the Greene

           18       Construction Storage facility?

           19   A.  I believe it is, yup.

           20   Q.  And there's a light gray sidewalk that runs from

           21       about an inch above the 1591 marker down to right

           22       around where it says J&K Auto Repair, is that

           23       about right?

           24   A.  Yes.
                                                                       50




            1   Q.  Is that the sidewalk that was the subject of the

            2       Hyde Park construction project that we've been

            3       talking about?

            4   A.  Yes, it is.

            5   Q.  That is my only question for you.  And that's a

            6       fair and accurate representation of the aerial

            7       view of the sidewalk project?

            8              MS. BYRON: Objection.  We just don't know

            9       when this is from.

           10              MS. BALDWIN: That is from 2019.

           11              MS. BYRON: Oh.

           12              MS. BALDWIN: Down at the bottom here.

           13              MS. BYRON: I can't see that.

           14              MS. BALDWIN: It says Map 2019.

           15   Q.  And that would have been when the project was

           16       completed, several years after, correct?

           17   A.  Yup.

           18   Q.  Okay.  Are there any other employees of Greene

           19       Construction who are responsible for safety?

           20              MS. BYRON: Objection.  Other than?

           21   A.  Other than --

           22   Q.  -- John Downy, the safety officer.

           23   A.  We have a new safety who just recently was hired.

           24   Q.  A new safety director?
                                                                       51




            1   A.  Not director.  He's a safety officer, I guess.

            2   Q.  How many safety officers does Greene Construction

            3       employ?

            4   A.  Two at this point.

            5   Q.  Has it always had two, or is the new --

            6   A.  -- no.

            7   Q.  -- officer --

            8   A.  -- sorry.  Sorry about that.

            9   Q.  Has it always had two, or was it just one prior

           10       to the hiring of this new employee?

           11   A.  It was just one prior to hiring him.

           12   Q.  Why did Greene decide to employ another safety

           13       officer, if you know?

           14   A.  It's a matter of volume and the amount of work we

           15       were doing at the time, we decided to hire

           16       another.

           17   Q.  When you said John Downy is the safety officer in

           18       charge of safety, can you be any more specific

           19       than that?

           20   A.  Not really.  I mean safety officer in charge of

           21       safety.

           22   Q.  If employees of Greene Construction do something

           23       that is unsafe on the job site, are they

           24       disciplined for it?
                                                                       52




            1              MS. BYRON: Objection.  If you know.

            2   A.  No.

            3   Q.  If employees of Greene Construction leave job

            4       sites in an unsafe condition, are they

            5       disciplined?

            6              MS. BYRON: Objection.

            7   A.  They're spoken to.

            8   Q.  By who?

            9   A.  Depends on who is in charge of the project.

           10   Q.  Would it be the project superintendent?

           11   A.  Could be.

           12   Q.  So, for the Hyde Park Sidewalk Project, that

           13       would have been you?

           14   A.  Yes.

           15   Q.  Did you speak to any of the staff of Greene

           16       Construction about the way the Hyde Park Sidewalk

           17       Project was left at any point during

           18       construction?

           19              MS. BYRON: Objection.  Go ahead.

           20   A.  I'm sure we spoke.  I don't recall having a

           21       specific conversation with anybody regarding --

           22   Q.  Would there be a record anywhere of when you

           23       speak to an employee about leaving a job site in

           24       an unsafe condition?
                                                                       53




            1              MS. BYRON: Objection.  And I don't think he

            2       testified that he spoke with somebody about

            3       leaving the job site in an unsafe condition.

            4              MS. BALDWIN: I apologize.  I will ask it

            5       again a different way.

            6   Q.  During your time as site superintendent for the

            7       Hyde Park Sidewalk Project, did you ever speak to

            8       any of the staff of Greene Construction that was

            9       working on that project about leaving the job

           10       site in an unsafe condition?

           11   A.  I have no -- I did not, not specifically on that

           12       project.

           13   Q.  Do you keep employee files, personnel files?

           14   A.  I would guess that -- I don't know specifically,

           15       but I would guess that the company has employee

           16       files, yes.

           17   Q.  So, if employees were disciplined for any reason,

           18       that would be recorded in their personnel file?

           19   A.  Yes.

           20   Q.  Those are all the questions I have for you.

           21              MS. BYRON: I'm not going to ask you any

           22       questions.

           24       11:20 a.m.)

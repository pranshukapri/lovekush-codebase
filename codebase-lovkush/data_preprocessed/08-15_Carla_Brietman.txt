          11   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          12   Q.     Good morning, Mrs. Brietman.

          13   A.     Good morning.

          14   Q.     My name is Karleen Krenicky.  I represent Mr. Orner

          15   in the lawsuit you have filed against him for the car

          16   accident that happened back on May 24th of 2018.  Before

          17   get into everything, do you agree that's the date that

          18   brings us here?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     You just sat through his deposition.  Yours will be

          21   similar except that I have to ask you a little bit more

          22   information about your background and also the injuries

          23   that you're claiming, okay?

          24   A.     I understand.

          25   Q.     Ian is our court reporter.  He is typing down
                                                                      5



           1   everything everyone in the room says, so only one of us

           2   can talk at a time, and all of your answers have to be out

           3   loud.

           4                  It's very important that if you don't

           5   understand something I'm asking you, that you let me know,

           6   because if you answer my questions, I will assume you

           7   heard them, you understood them, and that is what you are

           8   answering.  Is that fair?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     I don't want you to guess.  If you don't know

          11   something or you don't remember something, that's

          12   perfectly fine.  Just tell me.  But if you can estimate or

          13   approximate, just do your best to do so, okay?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     Just let us know that you're giving an estimate or

          16   an approximation.

          17   A.     I understand.

          18   Q.     You took an oath to tell the truth.  Do you have

          19   that understanding?

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     Are you under the influence of any medicine,

          22   substance, anything like that --

          23   A.     No, I'm not.

          24   Q.      -- that would affect your ability to answer my

          25   questions here today?
                                                                      6



           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     Do you need any more time to speak to your attorney

           3   before we get started?

           4   A.     No, I don't.

           5   Q.     Is it okay if we get started?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Wonderful.  Can you state your full name.

           8   A.     Carla Dawn Brietman.

           9   Q.     D-A-W-N?

          10   A.     D-A-W-N.

          11   Q.     And it's my understanding Brietman's your married

          12   name, correct?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     What was your maiden name?

          15   A.     Kirshner, K-I-R-S-H-N-E-R.

          16   Q.     And how old are you today?

          17   A.     65.

          18   Q.     I have to ask.  And your birthdate, I have as 6/8;

          19   is that correct?

          20   A.     6/8/54, yes.

          21   Q.     And what is your current address?

          22   A.     1230 Fairview Avenue, Havertown, PA 19083.

          23   Q.     How long have you lived there?

          24   A.     Over 30 years, less than 40.

          25   Q.     Safe to say you lived there on the day of this
                                                                      7



           1   accident?

           2   A.     Yes, I did.

           3   Q.     And who lives there with you?

           4   A.     Frank Brietman.

           5   Q.     Does anyone else live there with you?

           6   A.     Not at this moment.

           7   Q.     Did anyone else live there with you back in May of

           8   2018?

           9   A.     No.

          10   Q.     Do you have kids?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     How many?

          13   A.     Three.

          14   Q.     Are they all out of the house now?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     All right.

          17   A.     Thankfully.

          18   Q.     Any grandchildren?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     How many?

          21   A.     One.

          22   Q.     Do you have any childcare responsibilities for your

          23   grandchild?

          24   A.     Not at the moment.

          25   Q.     Did you used to babysit?
                                                                      8



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     The fact that you no longer babysit your

           3   grandchild, does that have anything to do with this

           4   accident?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     How old is your grandchild?

           7   A.     He is -- he was born last March, so that makes

           8   him -- how old does that make him?

           9   Q.     Around 18 months?

          10   A.     Yeah, probably, around like 17, 18 months.

          11   Q.     And you said "grandson"?

          12   A.     Grandson.

          13   Q.     And when did you stop watching him?

          14   A.     I stopped watching him early June -- late May,

          15   early June.

          16   Q.     Of 2018?

          17   A.     Of 2018, yes.

          18   Q.     And why did you stop?

          19   A.     Because I could no longer drive.  They live in the

          20   Poconos, so I could no longer drive that distance, nor was

          21   I able to pick the baby up and to put him down.

          22   Q.     This might seem silly, but why could you no longer

          23   drive?

          24   A.     I could no longer drive long distances, because of

          25   pain in my hip and left side and down to my glutes and
                                                                      9



           1   leg.

           2   Q.     And why --

           3   A.     So it was uncomfortable driving.

           4   Q.     And why could you not pick the baby up?

           5   A.     Because of the pain in my back and my glute and

           6   my -- my -- my hip.

           7   Q.     So the baby was born in March of '18.  From March

           8   of '18 'til around June of '18, when you stopped doing it,

           9   how often were you babysitting?

          10   A.     I tried to get there -- I'm off on Tuesdays from

          11   work, so I would try to get there as often as I could, at

          12   least every other Tuesday.  Sometimes, every Tuesday.

          13   Q.     It's my understanding that you had an accident in

          14   November of 2017.  Is that accurate?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     And that was an injury to your left shoulder and

          17   your neck, accurate?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     Did -- did your left shoulder or neck injury have

          20   any impact on your ability to hold your grandchild or

          21   watch your grandchild?

          22   A.     No.  He was just born in March, so he was not

          23   heavy.  So no, it did not.

          24   Q.     And when you tried to watch him and babysit him,

          25   the neck and the shoulder did not bother you?
                                                                     10



           1   A.     They were an issue, but I was able to work around

           2   it because it was my left arm.  And, like I said, he was

           3   an infant at that time, so, obviously, he wasn't as heavy

           4   as he is now.

           5   Q.     Let me rephrase the question.  So when you tried,

           6   after this accident, in June, let's say --

           7   A.     Oh, okay.

           8   Q.     -- to go back and watch him, did the neck or

           9   shoulder impact your ability to hold him?

          10   A.     I wasn't able to go back to see him after the

          11   accident.  So it's a hard question to answer, because I

          12   didn't -- I no longer went there to babysit him.

          13   Q.     So you didn't try?

          14   A.     I didn't even try, 'cause I couldn't drive the --

          15   the distance to get there.

          16   Q.     Did any medical provider tell you not to drive long

          17   distances after the accident with my client?

          18   A.     No.

          19   Q.     So -- oh.  How far did you go in school?

          20   A.     I graduated college.

          21   Q.     So you have a bachelor's degree?

          22   A.     Yes, I do.

          23   Q.     And I believe, from your answers to

          24   interrogatories, that's from Penn?

          25   A.     Yes, it is.
                                                                     11



           1   Q.     And where did you go to high school?

           2   A.     Meyers High School in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

           3   Q.     So you moved down to this area for school --

           4   college?

           5   A.     Yes, I did.

           6   Q.     And you've lived in this general area since?

           7   A.     I actually had -- after college, I went to New York

           8   for about two years, and then I moved back to this area.

           9   Q.     And you are employed, I believe, at an art gallery.

          10   Is that accurate?

          11   A.     Yes, Merritt Gallery.

          12   Q.     How long have you worked there?

          13   A.     Twenty years.

          14   Q.     And your job title?

          15   A.     I am the directer.

          16   Q.     What does the directer of an art gallery do?

          17   A.     The director of the art gallery works with clients,

          18   shows artwork, takes artwork out to clients' homes, makes

          19   sure that everybody else that is working there is doing

          20   their job.  I also do a lot of framing and help hang the

          21   gallery so that it looks wonderful.  I make -- make sure

          22   everybody is just doing their job, pretty much.

          23   Q.     Did you have any trouble doing your job after the

          24   accident?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     12



           1   Q.     What trouble did you have?

           2   A.     So after the accident, once again, there were -- we

           3   took a van out to show artwork.  It was difficult for me

           4   to drive the van.  It was difficult for me to get in and

           5   out of the van, but to drive the van was difficult.

           6                  The other part of my job is:  You would,

           7   you know, greet the client, show them around the gallery.

           8   And part of what I did was show them artwork.  A lot of

           9   the artwork is hanging already on the walls, but a lot of

          10   the artwork is put away in what we call "bins."  They're

          11   slots.  And these pieces can be as big as 60 by 60 and as

          12   small as 10 by 10s.

          13                  So we have all different sizes of artwork,

          14   most of it was on canvas.  A lot of it is framed.  And

          15   then, the paper pieces, we usually framed.  So imagine the

          16   difference in weight.

          17                  So my job was to show the artwork to the

          18   clients and then get an idea of what they were looking at,

          19   spend time on my computer, finding other pieces, make an

          20   appointment with the client.  You're then bringing the

          21   artwork to the clients' homes.  That was my job.  That's

          22   pretty much in a nutshell, and also making sure everybody

          23   was doing what they're supposed to be doing.

          24   Q.     And what was hard for you?

          25   A.     So after the accident, I was no -- I -- I couldn't
                                                                     13



           1   pull the artwork out of the bins, because of -- every time

           2   I did, it hurt my back.  I wasn't able to pick up even the

           3   smallest pieces to show them, because it would hurt my

           4   back.

           5                  I had to -- usually, I was able to go on a

           6   lot of these appointments with just me and my installer to

           7   show the artwork.  I couldn't even pick up the lightest

           8   pieces.  So I have -- now have my assistant go with me on

           9   every single appointment.

          10                  On the weekends, I don't have an assistant,

          11   so I hired a part-time worker to come in on Saturdays to

          12   help pull out the artwork and show the artwork to the

          13   clients and then put it away.  So manual labor, I need

          14   help with.

          15   Q.     A couple questions about that.  So how heavy is the

          16   heaviest piece of art, would you say?  And I understand

          17   you're not weighing it, but if you could approximate for

          18   me.

          19   A.     Probably -- I mean we have pieces that are close to

          20   a hundred pounds, which I never lifted.

          21   Q.     What weight would you say you were comfortable

          22   lifting before May 24th of 2018?

          23   A.     First of all, the word "lift."  I was pulling.

          24   Q.     I'm sorry.  Okay.

          25   A.     Okay?  So when you're showing things in the bin,
                                                                     14



           1   there are some things that are on top that you would have

           2   to lift down, but those were always usually the lighter

           3   pieces that weren't framed.  On the bottom are the bigger.

           4   So I could pull out large pieces 'cause you're just really

           5   just pulling them.  So I could pull out large -- large

           6   pieces.

           7   Q.     The hundred-pound pieces?

           8   A.     No.  That, I could not pull out.  Let's say 50 and

           9   under.

          10   Q.     And from the date of your November, 2017 accident

          11   until May of 2018, were you still pulling out the 50

          12   pounds and under?

          13   A.     With my -- my right arm.  I -- if I could pull it

          14   out with my right arm, I was able to do that.

          15   Q.     And when did you hire this part-time worker?

          16   A.     I don't -- after I did a lot of complaining to the

          17   owners.  I don't remember the exact date.  I wish I could

          18   remember.  I don't remember.  I'd like to say like --

          19   she's been working with us for six months.  I don't

          20   remember.

          21                  Before her, I always have somebody working

          22   in the gallery with me on Saturdays, so I would get them

          23   to do it.  But like I said, it just didn't seem fair that

          24   I was asking somebody who's a salesperson to do my

          25   lifting.
                                                                     15



           1   Q.     So less than a year since you've hired the

           2   assistant?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     I'm sorry.  I guess I should say "part-time worker

           5   for Saturdays," to clarify.

           6   A.     Yeah.  She's -- she's purely part-time.

           7   Q.     And she only works Saturdays?

           8   A.     She only works Saturdays.

           9   Q.     Did any of your medical providers put a restriction

          10   on you for that pulling or lifting?  Did anyone tell you

          11   not to do it?

          12   A.     No.  I think they let me use my common sense.

          13   Q.     And I mean did you discuss that physical part of

          14   your job with your treating providers?

          15   A.     Yes.  And one of the doctors gave me, which was

          16   helpful, this belt that you can really tighten up so that

          17   when you are doing things, it doesn't hurt as much.  It

          18   just tightens things up.  Even just walking up and down

          19   the steps, it would help me, because I would get zings.

          20   So that would help keep it all, I guess, contained so it

          21   didn't hurt as much.

          22   Q.     And which doctor gave you that belt?

          23   A.     Dr. Walsh.

          24   Q.     That's Dr. Walsh at Premier, right?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     16



           1   Q.     And when did you get that belt?

           2   A.     See, you're asking somebody who just doesn't

           3   remember dates.  I don't remember.

           4   Q.     Are you able to say -- I mean I'm not looking for a

           5   specific date, but a time frame.

           6   A.     Probably within the first three months, I would --

           7   I would guess, I started complaining about it hurting to

           8   do things.  And she gave me the belt.  It could have been

           9   even earlier.  I don't remember.

          10   Q.     Any other problems doing your job that we haven't

          11   discussed?

          12   A.     It's very hard for me to sit for long periods of

          13   time.  It's hard sitting here right now.  So that's an

          14   issue.  So I then got a standing desk.  So I sit part of

          15   the time.  I stand part of the time.

          16                  I also get up and move as often as I can,

          17   which means walking around the block, things like that,

          18   because that helps me being able to continue working that

          19   day.  I come in later because I exercise every morning for

          20   an hour.  And by "exercise," I mean stretching.

          21                  I also -- when I've had enough and I just

          22   can't take it anymore, I've been leaving work early.  I'm

          23   usually supposed to be there 'til 6:00.  I am not always

          24   there 'til 6:00.

          25   Q.     Who is your boss?
                                                                     17



           1   A.     Her name is Merritt Miller.

           2   Q.     Is she in Havertown?

           3   A.     No, she's not.  She is in the Baltimore gallery.

           4   Q.     Have you discussed your limitations with her?

           5   A.     She knows.  And she is -- she was the one that

           6   said, "Let's hire another person.  Come and go as you

           7   please.  Here's your standing desk."  I'm now fighting for

           8   a new chair.  Yeah.

           9   Q.     Are you making -- according to your

          10   interrogatories, you're not.  Are you claiming you missed

          11   any -- or lost any money at work?

          12   A.     I have not been doing as well as I have in the

          13   past.  So it's a -- it's a purely commissioned job.  I get

          14   a base, but most of my money is made through commission.

          15   Q.     So in your answers to interrogatories, which were

          16   those written questions, you stated you were not making a

          17   wage loss claim.  Is that accurate?

          18   A.     The reason why I say that is it's not definitive

          19   as -- as -- as definitive as you're making it.  If you

          20   have a bad summer, and then you're -- no one is gonna be

          21   making as much money.  It's really about -- I mean our

          22   economy is doing well, but everybody is scared to be

          23   spending money.

          24                  People aren't buying artwork.  The housing

          25   market is tanking.  People aren't buying artwork.  So
                                                                     18



           1   that's why I answer that the way it is.  I can't

           2   definitively say, "It's because of the accident," but I'm

           3   not as productive because of the accident.

           4   Q.     So are you going to be at -- if we go to court, and

           5   maybe Mr. Gallagher can clarify it --

           6                  THE WITNESS:  Maybe you can clarify.

           7                  MR. GALLAGHER:  We're not making a wage

           8   loss claim.

           9                  MS. KRENICKY:  Thank you.

          10                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  'Cause that's -- I

          11   mean yeah.

          12   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          13   Q.     Okay.  That's fine.  We won't --

          14   A.     I mean it's -- it's affecting my job, but it's --

          15   Q.     It's hard to say if it's actually affecting your

          16   wages.

          17   A.     Thank you.

          18   Q.     Understood.  Okay.  So did we cover all of your

          19   limitations at work?

          20   A.     That I can't do my job well, yes.

          21   Q.     Okay.  Well, no.  I just want to make sure you've

          22   had an opportunity to tell me all aspects of your job that

          23   have been affected.  So if there's anything else that we

          24   haven't --

          25   A.     I think I've covered pretty much -- yeah, I can't
                                                                     19



           1   do it as well, pretty much.

           2   Q.     Got it.  Got it.  All right.  Do you -- well,

           3   strike that.  That's your only employment, correct?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     And --

           6   A.     I'm judge of elections.  Does that count?  I don't

           7   get really paid for it.

           8                  MS. KRENICKY:  Off the record.

           9                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

          10   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          11   Q.     How long have you had that position?

          12   A.     I have had the position -- so when did I run?  The

          13   last election.  So since then.  So when was that, two

          14   years ago?  Two years.

          15   Q.     '17?

          16   A.     Yeah.  So you start in '18.  Yeah.

          17   Q.     Okay.  And --

          18   A.     So I -- yeah.  So I was able to do it once.  And

          19   then, the next time we had -- we had it, I --

          20   Q.     So May of 2018 -- I'm sorry.  Yeah.  It's --

          21   A.     It was May of 2018, I was able to uphold my duties.

          22   Q.     And then, the November, 2018 election --

          23   A.     I couldn't.

          24   Q.     And then, what about the primary this past May?

          25   A.     I could not.
                                                                     20



           1   Q.     And what were the repercussions, if any, of that?

           2   A.     Repercussions?

           3   Q.     What were the repercussions of that, the fact that

           4   you said that you couldn't do it?  What -- did someone

           5   else have to do it?  Did --

           6   A.     I had to -- I had to find people.

           7   Q.     And I mean are you planning on resigning from that

           8   position?

           9   A.     I keep on being an optimist and hoping I will feel

          10   better.  So I just keep -- I keep on thinking:  Oh, in six

          11   weeks, I'll be fine.  It just hasn't happened.

          12   Q.     And -- and why are you unable to do it?

          13   A.     Because it's a concrete floor, and sitting for long

          14   periods of times bothers me very much.  So then, I would

          15   start walking around, and the only thing to walk around

          16   there is on concrete floor and the parking lot.

          17                  So there's really -- and there was no place

          18   for me to like lay down and do all of my stretches so that

          19   I can get through the day.  It's a long day.  There was no

          20   place to do that, and you really can't just leave for long

          21   periods of time to take a rest.  So that's why I haven't

          22   been able to do it.  It's too painful.

          23   Q.     And how long of a term is that?

          24   A.     It's four years.

          25   Q.     So you won't be up for reelection, then, until '21?

           8   Q.     At Premier?  He's your family doctor?

           9   A.     No, not Dr. Walsh.  My god.  Dr. Haab.  And she's

          10   not -- she is with Main Line Health.

          11   Q.     How long has she been your PCP?

          12   A.     Probably, three, four years.

          13   Q.     Who did you see before her?

          14   A.     I don't remember.

          15   Q.     Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions

          16   or illnesses that you see her for on a regular basis?

          17   A.     I don't see her for a chronic condition.

          18   Q.     Do you just go to her if you have the flu or

          19   something like that, or why do you go see her?

          20   A.     I get my yearly checkups.

          21   Q.     And you have health insurance?

          22   A.     Yes, I do, through my husband.  Oh.  No.  No.  I'm

          23   lying.  I'm sorry.  Medicare.

          24   Q.     You have Medicare now, okay.

          25                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Don't say, "I'm lying."
                                                                     22

           4                  MR. GALLAGHER:  You made a mistake.

           5                  THE WITNESS:  I made a mistake.  I'm on

          13   you're shaking your head.

          14   A.     No.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  No.  It was my left

          17   Q.     So just to clarify, did you aggravate anything in

          22   A.     So yes.

          23   Q.     And your left shoulder, did you have any increased

          25   accident?
                                                                     25



           1   A.     Yes, a little bit.  I was being treated at a

           2   physical therapy place at the time of this accident, so I

           3   was being treated for my neck and shoulder at the time.

           4   Q.     And that was from your November of '17 accident?

           5   A.     Yes, it was.

           6   Q.     When was the last time you had physical therapy for

           7   your neck and your shoulder before the accident with my

           8   client?

           9   A.     May I ask a question?

          10   Q.     You can ask for clarification.  And if you have a

          11   question, you should probably ask your attorney.  But if

          12   you need --

          13   A.     What day of the week was the accident?  'Cause I --

          14   I forget.  Was it a Thursday?  Was it a Friday?  I don't

          15   remember.

          16   Q.     So we can --

          17   A.     'Cause I went to physical therapy three times a

          18   week.  So it happened, I had physical therapy three times

          19   a week -- Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays -- for my neck

          20   and shoulder.

          21                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Let's put it this way.  You

          22   mind if I --

          23                  Did you have physical therapy for your neck

          24   and your left shoulder within several --

          25                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.
                                                                     26



           1                  MR. GALLAGHER:  -- days -- hold on.

           2                  THE WITNESS:  Oh.

           3                  MR. GALLAGHER:  -- within several days of

           4   the May 24th, 2018 accident?

           5                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           6                  MR. GALLAGHER:  There you go.

           7                  MS. KRENICKY:  Okay.  Wonderful.

           8   BY MS. KRENICKY:

           9   Q.     Did you return to physical therapy for your neck

          10   and your left shoulder within a week of this accident?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Did you report being in this accident to your

          13   therapist?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     Where were you going to physical therapy for your

          16   neck and your shoulder?

          17   A.     It's right next-door to Premier Ortho, so I think

          18   it's called Premier Physical Therapy.

          19   Q.     It's my understanding, just from some of the

          20   records, you also had therapy for this accident, on the

          21   injuries you're claiming from this accident --

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     -- there as well, correct?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     We'll get into it in a little bit more detail, but
                                                                     27



           1   were you having days when you'd go to Premier that were

           2   just for your neck and shoulder and then days you were

           3   going to Premier Physical Therapy just for your lower back

           4   issues?

           5   A.     We doubled up.

           6   Q.     So it was all at the same time?

           7   A.     It was all at the same time.

           8   Q.     Before this accident of May of 2018, did you ever

           9   have lower back pain?

          10   A.     Nothing to really complain about.  Not in -- I mean

          11   when I used to menstruate, you get lower -- but, you know,

          12   that kind of thing.

          13   Q.     Sure.

          14   A.     So no, not really, not -- not -- no.

          15   Q.     So my next question was going to be:  Within a year

          16   of the accident in May of 2018, did you complain of lower

          17   back pain to any medical provider?  So this accident

          18   happened May 24th, 2018.

          19   A.     Right.

          20   Q.     So from May 24th of 2017 until the day of the

          21   accident, did you go to any doctor, chiropractor,

          22   therapist with lower back pain complaints?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     Before this accident, did you ever injure your left

          25   hip?
                                                                     28



           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     And before this accident, did you ever have any

           3   left hip pain?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     And before this accident, did you ever complain of

           6   any left hip pain --

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     -- to any medical provider?

           9   A.     No.

          10   Q.     Before this accident, had you ever injured your

          11   left glute?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     Before this accident, again, May of 2018, had you

          14   ever complained of any left glute pain to any medical

          15   provider?

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.     Before this accident in May of 2018, did you ever

          18   have any pain going into your left leg?

          19   A.     No.

          20   Q.     And before May of 2018, had you ever injured your

          21   left leg in any way?

          22   A.     No.

          23   Q.     And before May of 2018, had you ever complained of

          24   any pain going into your left leg to any medical provider?

          25   A.     No.
                                                                     29



           1   Q.     The day before the accident with my client, your

           2   neck pain -- let's say zero is no pain at all, ten is the

           3   worst pain you've ever had in your life.  How -- what

           4   would you say your pain level was on your -- in your neck

           5   the day before the accident with my client?

           6   A.     Probably -- can you repeat the question.

           7   Q.     Sure.  So zero is like you're totally fine.

           8   There's nothing wrong.  Ten is the worst pain you've ever

           9   had in your life.  The day before the accident with my

          10   client, are you able to articulate using that scale what

          11   level of pain your neck was in?

          12   A.     It's a difficult question to answer.  What happened

          13   was I had -- I had limitations of motion.  So if I was

          14   just like this at that point, you know, I was fine.  It's

          15   when I would be -- I didn't have full -- you know what I'm

          16   saying?  I didn't have full range of motion with my neck.

          17                  So there were certain things that you would

          18   be doing that would hurt you because, you know, you'd be

          19   looking to this side or this side, and your neck would

          20   start hurting.  So, like I said, it's a difficult question

          21   because it's -- it wasn't constant pain at that point with

          22   my neck.

          23   Q.     Had your neck pain improved since November of 2017

          24   to May of 2018?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     30



           1   Q.     Had it gotten better?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     Okay.

           4   A.     It had improved.  It had not gotten a hundred

           5   percent.

           6   Q.     Understood.  And the same question for the left

           7   shoulder, had it improved since the November, 2017

           8   accident?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     And then, after the accident with my client, what

          11   changed in your neck and left shoulder?

          12   A.     More with my neck just got sore.

          13   Q.     And how -- for how long after this accident would

          14   you say your neck was sore?

          15   A.     My neck is still sore.

          16   Q.     So your neck has not improved at all since the May

          17   of 2018 accident?

          18   A.     No.  That's not -- that's not -- it -- my neck is

          19   still sore, but it's not -- I do my own stretches and

          20   stuff for it, and I can -- I can live fine.  I'm able to

          21   get through the day.  So yes, it has improved.

          22   Q.     Is your range of motion still affected in your

          23   neck?

          24   A.     At times, yes.

          25   Q.     And then, your shoulder, do you still have pain in
                                                                     31



           1   the left shoulder?

           2   A.     At times.  Not as frequently.

           3   Q.     How often?

           4   A.     I do stretches on that too, so I would say less

           5   than on my neck.  So I wish I could say -- how often?  Not

           6   that often.

           7   Q.     I mean are we talking once a week?  Are we talking

           8   once a day?  For some people, "not that often" means

           9   different things, so...

          10   A.     For me, "not that often" means that every once in a

          11   while, I'll do something and I'll realize:  Oh, that hurt

          12   my shoulder.  That's how -- it's not frequent.  But I can

          13   clarify that, also, I'm doing a whole lot less with my

          14   neck and shoulder now because I no longer lift anything.

          15   So it's hard to really give you a true answer, 'cause I

          16   don't use my neck and shoulder.

          17   Q.     All right.  Let's talk about the accident itself,

          18   okay?  It's my understanding it happened at Bon Air and

          19   Grand.  Is that accurate?

          20   A.     That's accurate.

          21   Q.     How close to the -- is that to your house?

          22   A.     Not far at all.  I -- I wish I could tell -- you go

          23   down a -- I could walk it in about two minutes, three

          24   minutes.  It's very close to my home.

          25   Q.     And you're familiar with this intersection?
                                                                     32



           1   A.     Very.

           2   Q.     Is it controlled by stop signs?

           3   A.     Yes, it is.

           4   Q.     And where were you going when this happened?

           5   A.     I was going home.

           6   Q.     From?

           7   A.     Work.

           8   Q.     And what time of day did this happen?

           9   A.     In the evening.  It would be sometime like -- I

          10   was -- I was thinking it was more like 6:00 o'clock, 6:15,

          11   somewhere around that vicinity.

          12   Q.     Was it still daylight?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     What was the weather like?

          15   A.     Clear.

          16   Q.     Before this accident, it's my understanding -- did

          17   you drive past my client's parked truck before the

          18   accident happened?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     And did you -- was it stopped or moving when you

          21   drove past it?

          22   A.     It was stopped.

          23   Q.     Was he in it?

          24   A.     I don't recall.

          25   Q.     Did anything draw your attention to it as you drove
                                                                     33



           1   past it?

           2   A.     Other than it seemed like it was parked in the

           3   wrong spot.

           4   Q.     Why do you say that?

           5   A.     Because he was parked -- you should be parking -- I

           6   always thought that you should be parking with the -- with

           7   the way traffic is going, and he was parked against

           8   traffic.

           9   Q.     Gotcha.

          10   A.     So I -- yes, it -- I saw it.  And I thought, You're

          11   parked in the wrong spot.

          12   Q.     How did the accident happen?

          13   A.     I was stopped at a stop sign.  I was looking in my

          14   rearview mirror, and I saw this truck coming at me.  I

          15   tensed up, you know, started beeping the horn and

          16   screaming, "Stop.  Stop.  Stop."  He didn't stop.

          17   Q.     Why were you looking in your rearview mirror?

          18   A.     I always look in my rearview mirror.  I'm one of

          19   those people who looks to both sides.  When I'm at a stop

          20   sign, I'm -- I look to the right, I look to the left, I

          21   look forward, and I look in my rearview mirror every time

          22   I stop at a stop sign.  I mean I just -- that's a habit.

          23   Q.     When you were stopped at the stop sign, were there

          24   any other cars also stopped at the stop sign?

          25   A.     Not that I saw, no.
                                                                     34



           1   Q.     When you saw the truck coming at you, is there any

           2   reason why you didn't pull forward from the stop sign?

           3   A.     It was -- it was -- happened too fast.  No.  So

           4   there's no reason why I didn't pull forward.

           5   Q.     I mean there was no traffic or person or something

           6   that prevented --

           7   A.     No.  It just happened too fast.  It -- it -- it was

           8   a surprise.

           9   Q.     How long had you been at a stop when the accident

          10   happened?

          11   A.     I want to say three or four seconds.  I usually

          12   count -- you know, you just let your car come back to a

          13   rest, and then you proceed, is what I was taught in

          14   driving school.

          15   Q.     And your vehicle was at a complete stop when the

          16   impact occurred?

          17   A.     Complete stop.

          18   Q.     Do you have any way of estimating or knowing the

          19   speed of my client's vehicle?

          20   A.     I have no way of estimating.

          21   Q.     What part of his vehicle contacted your vehicle?

          22   A.     His back smashed into my back.

          23   Q.     Back bumper?

          24   A.     Back bumper hit into the back of my car.

          25   Q.     Would you say he hit a -- was it like a
                                                                     35



           1   corner-to-corner or was it center-to-center?  Are you able

           2   to say?

           3   A.     I'm not able to say.  I don't -- I -- I don't know.

           4   Q.     What happened to your body inside the car when the

           5   accident happened, when the impact occurred?

           6   A.     I went forward.  I went backward.  I had my -- my

           7   right foot, obviously, slammed on the -- the brake.

           8   'Cause I knew what was happening.  I guess I completely

           9   just tensed up, knowing it was gonna happen.

          10   Q.     And did any part of your body hit anything inside

          11   the car?

          12   A.     The -- it, you know, jolts forward and then hits

          13   the back of your seat.

          14   Q.     Did you hit your head?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     Were you wearing your seat belt?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Did any airbags go off in your car?

          19   A.     No.

          20   Q.     Did the impact push your car in any direction?

          21   A.     Pushed it forward.

          22   Q.     How far?

          23   A.     Feet.  A few feet.

          24   Q.     Did you get pushed into the intersection?

          25   A.     A little bit.
                                                                     36



           1   Q.     After the impact occurred -- well, strike that.

           2   What did the impact feel like to you?

           3   A.     It felt like I was hit by a car.

           4   Q.     So -- so are you able to say:  Was it a hard

           5   impact, a medium impact, a light --

           6   A.     It seemed like a very hard impact.

           7   Q.     And the other vehicle involved, it was a pickup

           8   truck, correct?

           9   A.     Yes, it was, red.

          10   Q.     Were you able to get out of the vehicle after the

          11   impact?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     At that point, what did you do?

          14   A.     I yelled.

          15   Q.     What?

          16   A.     "Didn't you see me?" at the top of my lungs.

          17   Q.     And where was my client when you yelled that?

          18   A.     He was sort of sauntering out of the truck like --

          19   you know?

          20   Q.     So he was out of the truck at that point?

          21   A.     He got out of the truck, yeah.

          22   Q.     And did he respond to you?

          23   A.     He sort of looked at the truck.  And I was yelling

          24   at him.  And he said he didn't see me.  And then, I recall

          25   that his rearview, you know, on that side of the car, I
                                                                     37



           1   don't think there was a mirror in there.

           2   Q.     You mean on the -- the passenger side door?

           3   A.     Passenger side, yeah.  I don't recall seeing a

           4   mirror.  And I think I said to him, "You don't have a

           5   mirror.  How could" -- you know, I was just yelling him.

           6   Q.     Okay.  And --

           7   A.     And then he just looked at the cars and just walked

           8   back into his house.

           9   Q.     At the point when you're having this back and forth

          10   with him, were the cars still touching?

          11   A.     Yes.  Well, no.  So it -- no.  I'm -- I'm wrong.

          12   He hit me and then he pulled forward.  And that's when I

          13   got out.  So he -- he hit me, and then he pulled forward.

          14   And that's when the bumper and everything came off my

          15   car -- or parts of it -- parts of my car came off.

          16   Q.     And were you out of the car when he pulled forward?

          17   A.     I don't believe I was.

          18   Q.     You think you were still in the car?

          19   A.     I think I was still in the car.

          20   Q.     Did you have --

          21   A.     I'm trying to remember that, because I was

          22   screaming and yelling at him.  I don't -- I have to tell

          23   you I don't remember.

          24   Q.     If -- if he were to say that he pulled forward

          25   after the initial impact, and you were out of the car at
                                                                     38



           1   that point, would you have any reason to disagree with

           2   him?

           3   A.     Yes, because I didn't understand why he was pulling

           4   off my bumper.  Like he -- like he was hooked onto me, and

           5   he started going forward, and I knew he was pulling off

           6   that bumper.  I think I was still in my car.  But once

           7   again, it happened so fast, and you're in shock that you

           8   don't expect it.  I can't a hundred percent tell you.

           9   Q.     That's fine.  Were you able to observe what damage

          10   was done to your vehicle before he pulled forward?

          11   A.     No.

          12   Q.     In looking at pictures of your vehicle, I'm --

          13   you've seen some since, correct?

          14   A.     Not -- yeah.  I really haven't looked too hard at

          15   my vehicle, no.  I looked very hard at my vehicle after

          16   the accident, but no, not the pictures.

          17   Q.     So when you were looking at the vehicle, was that

          18   at that -- at the scene?

          19   A.     It was at the scene, because what happened was:  He

          20   pulled forward -- which is why I think I was still in my

          21   car -- he pulled forward and started pulling off the back

          22   of my car.

          23   Q.     And when you -- when the back of your car was being

          24   pulled off, was your car in park at that point?

          25   A.     See, this is why I said, "I don't remember,"
                                                                     39



           1   because it might be that I had still had my foot on the

           2   brake while he was pulling forward and taking part of the

           3   car with him.  I -- I -- I wish I could remember more

           4   clearly.  I don't.

           5   Q.     That's okay.  When he pulled forward and the bumper

           6   was pulled off, did anything else happen to your body

           7   inside the vehicle?

           8   A.     Not that I know of.

           9   Q.     I will just show you two photographs that we will

          10   mark as P-1 and P-2.

          11                  (Exhibits P-1 and P-2 marked for

          12   identification.)

          13   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          14   Q.     So I'll show you two photos we marked as P-1 and

          15   P-2.  Does that show your vehicle after this accident,

          16   first of all?

          17   A.     Uh-huh.

          18   Q.     "Yes"?

          19   A.     Uh-huh.

          20   Q.     You have to say "yes."

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     I know.  It's okay.  Everyone does it.  And the --

          23   it -- it appears that your rear bumper is detached.  Is

          24   that accurate?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     40



           1   Q.     The detaching of the bumper, do you know:  Did that

           2   occur when he pulled forward?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     And that did not occur until he pulled forward?

           5   A.     I don't believe so.  But I can't -- once again, I

           6   didn't -- but I think it's because he -- he got hooked

           7   onto the back of my car and pulled forward, and that's how

           8   it happened, I believe.

           9   Q.     Did you take any pictures at the scene?

          10   A.     No, I don't believe I did.

          13   Q.     Did you have your phone with you at the time?

          14   A.     Yes, I did.

          15   Q.     Did you make phone calls at the scene?

          16   A.     I called my husband and I believe I called the

          17   police.

          18   Q.     And did the police come?

          19   A.     Yes, they did.

          20   Q.     Did your husband come?

          21   A.     Yes, he did.

          22   Q.     Did my -- or did your husband talk to my client?

          23   A.     I don't know.

          24   Q.     Did you see my client taking any photos?

          25   A.     No, I did not.
                                                                     41



           1   Q.     Did you see my client making any phone calls?

           2   A.     No, I did not.

           3   Q.     How long did it take the police to get there?

           4   A.     Maybe five, ten minutes.

           5   Q.     Did an ambulance come?

           6   A.     No, they did not.

           7   Q.     Were you in pain at that point?

           8   A.     I was in shock at that point.  So I -- really, I

           9   just -- I was going on adrenaline.

          10   Q.     Did you request medical attention?

          11   A.     No, I did not.

          12   Q.     Is there a reason you did not request medical

          13   attention?

          14   A.     'Cause I'm a martyr.  No.  Because I just -- no.  I

          15   didn't think that there was -- it was necessary at the

          16   time.  Like I said, I was running on just anger and

          17   adrenaline.

          18   Q.     Did you observe if there was damage to my client's

          19   truck?

          20   A.     I didn't notice.

          21   Q.     You did?

          22   A.     I didn't notice if there was.

          23   Q.     So you can't say one way or the other?

          24   A.     I cannot say if -- one way or the other.

          25   Q.     Was there anything in the bed of my client's truck?
                                                                     42



           1   A.     I don't know.

           2   Q.     What did you tell the police?  Anything different

           3   than what we've talked --

           4   A.     What I already told you, he backed into me.

           5   Q.     Did you -- are you -- do you know if anyone got a

           6   ticket?

           7   A.     I don't know.  I know I did not.  I have no idea if

           8   he did.

           9   Q.     How did you leave the scene?

          10   A.     My husband came, and he -- I had -- I drove the car

          11   down to my house, which, like I said, is yards, and

          12   dragging the bumper along with me.  Or he might have

          13   driven the car.  Like I said, I don't remember.  My

          14   husband might have driven the car down, and I sat in the

          15   passenger seat.  I don't remember.

          16   Q.     But your car was drivable?

          17   A.     My car was not really drivable, because literally

          18   sparks were -- it was -- the bumper at that point was

          19   dragging on the ground, and sparks were coming -- so no,

          20   it was not -- it was not truly drivable.  We just wanted

          21   to get it to our driveway, which was not that far away.

          22   Q.     Was it towed to the shop?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     When is the first time after the accident you felt

          25   pain?
                                                                     43



           1   A.     I was uncomfortable sleeping that night, and I

           2   started noticing that my back was bothering me.  I was

           3   going to PT for my neck and just mentioned it.  I think I

           4   mentioned to them my back was bothering me, is there

           5   things that I can do to make it feel better?  And it just

           6   started progressively getting worse and worse.

           7   Q.     Do you know when you went to PT after the accident?

           8   A.     No.

           9   Q.     Did you ever go to the emergency room?

          10   A.     No.

          11   Q.     Any reason you didn't go to the ER?

          12   A.     'Cause I'm a martyr.

          13   Q.     Okay.  I mean did you talk to your --

          14   A.     No.  I really -- like I said, no, I was not.  There

          15   was nothing broken.  I wasn't bleeding.

          16   Q.     Did you call your primary care doctor about this?

          17   A.     No, I did not.

          18   Q.     Any reason why not?

          19   A.     I didn't think it was gonna be as bad as it was.

          20   Q.     When you first went to PT after the accident for

          21   your neck and your shoulder, did the therapist tell you to

          22   do anything specifically for your back?

          23   A.     They started showing me stretches and exercises for

          24   my back.  I can't tell you the time frame.  I don't

          25   remember.
                                                                     44



           1   Q.     Did they tell you you would need a new prescription

           2   to get treatment on a new body part?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     So did you have to go somewhere and get that?

           5   A.     Yes.  I probably went to the same people, which was

           6   the Premier -- yeah.

           7   Q.     Dr. Walsh?

           8   A.     Dr. Walsh.

           9   Q.     Just looking at the records that I was provided, it

          10   looks like the first time you went there for your back was

          11   June the 6th.  Does that sound right to you?

          12   A.     That sounds probably pretty close.

          13   Q.     When you went in June of 2018 about a week or so

          14   after this accident, did you tell Dr. Walsh that you had

          15   had back pain for several months?

          16   A.     I don't recall.

          17   Q.     Is it accurate that you had had back pain for

          18   several months when you first went to see him in June of

          19   2018?

          20   A.     I really wish I can -- I mean I know I was going

          21   him -- for him for my neck and my shoulder.  I don't

          22   recall if I was -- I don't recall.

          23   Q.     Do you recall if you told Dr. Walsh that you might

          24   have hurt your back moving clothing?

          25   A.     I could have said something, I just don't remember.
                                                                     45



           1   I mean I change clothes every season, so yeah.

           2   Q.     Do you have a recollection in the spring of 2018 of

           3   hurting your back whilst changing out the clothing?

           4   A.     I don't have a -- I don't recall that, but I'm not

           5   saying it didn't happen.

           6   Q.     It looks like you then went back to Dr. Walsh two

           7   to three weeks later, and he gave you an injection to your

           8   back.  Is that accurate?

           9   A.     If that's what it says.  I don't -- I don't -- I

          10   mean I don't -- I don't remember when things were done.

          11   Q.     Did you have an injection to your back?

          12   A.     Yes, I've had injections to my back.

          13   Q.     How many injections have you had to your back?

          14   A.     A number of them.  I don't remember how many.

          15   Q.     When is the last time you went to Dr. Walsh for

          16   your back?

          17   A.     A few months ago.  I've switched to another doctor.

          18   Q.     Well, first of all, who is the other doctor?

          19   A.     Dr. Roy Lerman.

          20   Q.     Lerman.  And where is Dr. Lerman?

          21   A.     He is -- the office that I go to is at 2 Bala.

          22   Q.     And why did you change doctors?

          23   A.     Because I wasn't getting any relief.  New eyes.

          24   Q.     Did Dr. Lerman ever give you injections or only Dr.

          25   Walsh?
                                                                     46



           1   A.     I just had one in my SI joint about eight days ago.

           2   Q.     From Lerman?

           3   A.     From Lerman.

           4   Q.     Do you know how many injections Walsh gave you?

           5   A.     So Walsh did a number of different things.  He did

           6   dry needling.  And then he sent me to a place in

           7   Havertown, another Premier place.  And there, I had two

           8   procedures, and I believe both were injections.

           9                  I don't know the names of the injections,

          10   but one was done under, I think, fluoroscopy.  And then,

          11   another one was done also.  And the -- the doctor's -- it

          12   was a woman there that did it.  I can figure out the name.

          13   I don't remember her name.

          14   Q.     But it was someone affiliated with Premier?

          15   A.     But it was someone affiliated with Premier, yes.

          16                  MS. KRENICKY:  I don't have all those

          17   records.  I only have some Premier records, 'cause the

          18   last record I have from Premier is from August of '18.

          19                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Well, we're following up

          20   with records as well.

          21                  MS. KRENICKY:  Okay.

          22                  MR. GALLAGHER:  And we just -- we should

          23   have by now sent authorization to Lerman.

          24                  MS. KRENICKY:  Well, but I'm also saying I

          25   don't think I have complete Premier records either.
                                                                     47



           1                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Yeah.  When I was --

           2                  We can go off the record.

           3                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

           4   BY MS. KRENICKY:

           5   Q.     The -- we were talking off the record.  Your

           6   attorney mentioned that you may have had epidural

           7   injections.  Does that sound familiar to you?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     And those were the -- that was the procedure you

          10   were talking about under fluoroscopic guidance?

          11   A.     I -- like I said, I know Dr. Walsh did some things.

          12   And then I went to this woman that's also in Premier, and

          13   that was done under fluoroscopy or something.

          14   Q.     Did those procedures help your pain at all?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     Did they make it worse?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Just it was --

          19   A.     A wash.

          20   Q.      -- like nothing had happened?  Okay.  The

          21   procedures, the -- the injections that you were having,

          22   did they hurt, the actually procedure?  Was that painful?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     And were you able to drive yourself to and from

          25   those appointments?
                                                                     48



           1   A.     Yes.  It's right in Havertown, so very close to my

           2   home.

           3   Q.     But not -- you didn't need someone to come and

           4   bring you or --

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.      -- anything like that?  Okay.  And are you still

           7   actively having physical therapy?

           8   A.     No.

           9   Q.     When is the last time you had physical therapy?

          10   A.     So I had physical therapy through, I want to say --

          11   I want to say January, February.  I should know this, but

          12   I don't.  And then, what I did is I switched to -- because

          13   I was getting no relief.  The problem with physical

          14   therapy:  It wasn't working.

          15                  So I started going to a place up in Malvern

          16   called the Barnes' Myofascial Release Treatment.  And I

          17   went there I think it was two to three times a week.  And

          18   they worked on, I guess, the myofascial part of my

          19   injuries.  And I did get some relief from that, the first

          20   thing that really gave me relief, not to the point that

          21   I'm pain-free, but made it tolerable.  And they also

          22   taught me there a lot of stretches and exercises and

          23   things to do with pressure points to be able to treat

          24   myself.

          25   Q.     When did you first go to the Barnes' Myofascial
                                                                     49



           1   Release place?

           2   A.     I would like to say it was early January or

           3   February.

           4   Q.     Of this year?

           5   A.     Of this year.

           6   Q.     And when is the last time you went to Barnes'?

           7   A.     The last time was when they stopped taking my

           8   insurance.  It's very expensive.  And so that, I think --

           9   I think I treated there for three months.

          10   Q.     All right.  So which insurance was paying for you

          11   to go to Barnes'?

          12   A.     I guess my car.

          13   Q.     Your car insurance was?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     Okay.  Did you --

          16   A.     They do -- they do not take regular health

          17   insurance.  They, you know -- or I would have continued

          18   using them.

          19   Q.     Did you get a letter?  Did they tell you that they

          20   wouldn't pay for it anymore?

          21   A.     Yeah.  I got some kind of letter that they had to

          22   do something and submit to somewhere, and that's not

          23   something that they do.  It was very odd, but -- 'cause I

          24   then went back again.  "Well, can't you do this?"  Because

          25   it was really helping me.  And they could not.
                                                                     50



           1   Q.     And who referred you to Barnes'?

           2   A.     I found out about that place because my closest

           3   friend's sister has bad pain issues, and she ended up

           4   there.  She lives in -- she lives in like the Allentown

           5   area.  She's the one that ended up there.

           6                  And I had known -- I've known -- I mean my

           7   friend Jane has been my friend since we were 18, and she

           8   kept on saying, "You should try it.  You should try it.

           9   You should try it.  So nothing else was working.  Give it

          10   a" -- "give it a whirl."

          11   Q.     So then, they told you they couldn't take you

          12   anymore.  Then, is that when you started seeing Dr. Lerner

          13   -- Lerman?

          14   A.     No.  I just started seeing Dr. Lerman just -- so I

          15   was continuing to see Walsh to see if there was anything

          16   else that could be done.  And he still gave me a couple

          17   more injections and, I think, a couple more dry needling.

          18   They don't work for me.

          19                  So at that point, I had purchased Barnes'

          20   book and started doing a lot of self-help at home.  So I

          21   spend every morning of my life, about an hour to an hour

          22   and a half, doing stretches and exercises according to

          23   their philosophy.  And I also do it every single evening.

          24   During the day at work, I stop what I'm doing when I'm in

          25   pain, and I go and do that.  It does give me relief, but
                                                                     51



           1   it doesn't last.

           2   Q.     Is there equipment with that stretching?

           3   A.     Yeah, there is a -- sort of.  You use -- they have

           4   like a ball that you do things with.  They have this thing

           5   called a nolarola that gets into the myofascial to put

           6   pressure on it.  So -- so by "equipment," no, but there

           7   are things.

           8                  There's something that you use to -- to

           9   help with your SI joint by putting your legs up a wall.

          10   There are things that you do, and it actually does give me

          11   a little bit of relief.  But it -- like I said, it doesn't

          12   last.

          13   Q.     So you stopped going to Barnes'.  You continued --

          14   A.     'Cause they fired me.

          15   Q.     You kept seeing Dr. Walsh then after --

          16   A.     I kept -- I continued seeing Dr. Walsh.  And like I

          17   said, I started doing more of my own in-home -- trying to

          18   -- yes.

          19   Q.     How often were you seeing Dr. Walsh in the

          20   beginning of 2019?

          21   A.     I saw him fairly often, 'cause I was still going

          22   through PT there, you know, which was right next-door.  So

          23   he couldn't give me -- there was a time period between

          24   injections that he could do.  So, you know, we'd make an

          25   appointment.  I could see him again in the next whatever
                                                                     52



           1   time, and then I'd make an appointment.  I don't know the

           2   actual time.

           3   Q.     Was there ever a period of time greater than a

           4   month that you didn't see any doctor or medical provider

           5   in 2019?

           6   A.     There might have been, but there's never been a

           7   time where I haven't been addressing this.  There's not a

           8   day.

           9   Q.     I --

          10   A.     But as far as a medical provider, I think with

          11   Walsh, when you give an injection, the kind that he was

          12   giving me, you have to wait maybe four, five, six weeks to

          13   get the next one.  So the answer would be yes, I would

          14   probably not go back in four weeks if I couldn't get --

          15   have him do something.

          16   Q.     And then, you stopped seeing Walsh.  How much time

          17   passed from when you stopped seeing Walsh to when you

          18   started seeing Lerman?

          19   A.     I don't know.  I forget.  I'd have to look up my

          20   last time I, you know -- I'd have to look at records.  I

          21   have no idea.

          22   Q.     Besides Dr. Walsh, Dr. Lerman, the Barnes' Center,

          23   and the physical therapy you received, have you gotten

          24   treatment from any other medical provider for this

          25   accident?
                                                                     53



           1   A.     Other than the place that I told you that -- the

           2   Premier place that did the fluoroscope.  That was a

           3   totally different doctor.  Even though it's the same

           4   practice, it was a totally different, you know, doctor

           5   there.

           6   Q.     Right.  But those are -- those are the only medical

           7   providers you've seen for this, correct?

           8   A.     Those are -- yes.

           9   Q.     Did you receive any diagnostic testing after this

          10   accident?  MRIs, for example.

          11   A.     I had an MRI.

          12   Q.     Of what body parts?

          13   A.     My spine.

          14   Q.     So just looking at the records, it looks like, in

          15   July of 2018, you had an MRI of your lower back.  Is that

          16   accurate?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     And then, you also had an MRI of your hips.  Is

          19   that accurate?

          20   A.     I guess so.

          21   Q.     Did anyone discuss the findings of those two

          22   studies with you?

          23   A.     Recently, Dr. Lerman showed me my MRI of my spine.

          24   Q.     And what did he explain to you?

          25   A.     I have a couple of bulging discs, but other than
                                                                     54



           1   that, I think he -- I don't think there's anything

           2   remarkable.

           3   Q.     Had you ever had an MRI of your spine before this

           4   accident?

           5   A.     I don't recall.

           6   Q.     Did you have any --

           7                  MR. GALLAGHER:  In your low back.

           8                  MS. KRENICKY:  Sorry.  She said "the

           9   spine," so I -- I was using her word.  But --

          10                  THE WITNESS:  I don't recall.

          11   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          12   Q.     Okay.  Did you have any MRI for your 2017 accident?

          13   A.     Good question.  I -- there's -- I don't recall.

          14   Q.     And how many times did you have an MRI of your

          15   spine, as you described it?

          16   A.     I believe once.

          17   Q.     Just once, okay.  Do you have any upcoming MRIs?

          18   Did anyone tell you you'd need a new one?

          19   A.     No, no one has said that.

          20   Q.     Have you ever heard of the term "EMG" as a test?

          21   Does that sound familiar to you?

          22   A.     I have heard of the test.

          23   Q.     Where they put --

          24   A.     I think -- I think Dr. Walsh was telling me about

          25   it, something about with the nerves.  And they -- but
                                                                     55



           1   apparently, it's very painful, and they've been -- he was

           2   avoiding doing that.

           3   Q.     So did you ever have that test?

           4   A.     No, I did not, to my knowledge.  I don't remember.

           5   I would remember that, though, if it's painful, so no.

           6   Q.     Do you still have the pain going into your left

           7   leg?

           8   A.     On and off, not all the time.

           9   Q.     How often do you have it?

          10   A.     A moderate amount.  Like right now, I have it.

          11   Sitting here -- sitting for long periods of time, it --

          12   it -- it's worse.

          13   Q.     Do you need to take a break?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     Okay.

          16                  MS. KRENICKY:  Let's take a break.

          17                  (Recess was taken from 12:04 p.m. to 12:08

          18   p.m.)

          19   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          20   Q.     When is the first time after the accident you felt

          21   the pain going into your leg?

          22   A.     You know, my -- my back -- my lower back, my glutes

          23   were bothering me.  It was like all intertwined with each

          24   other.  I can't separate:  Oh, it was my back first, and

          25   then it became going down my leg, and then it -- I can't
                                                                     56



           1   say that.  It sort of was like just happening, and I was

           2   noticing:  Oh, this is bothering me and this is bothering

           3   me, that kind of thing.

           4   Q.     So just based on what you said before, would you

           5   say, then, it was within a day or two of the accident?

           6   A.     Yeah, probably.  It was -- it wasn't -- it was the

           7   kind of thing that it was bothering me, and -- and you

           8   think in your head:  Oh, that's gonna go away.  You really

           9   do.  You just think:  Oh, within a week or two, I'll be

          10   fine.

          11   Q.     But so then, just to clarify, I mean you can't

          12   separate the leg pain from the back pain to the glute

          13   pain, but I believe you said you started to feel pain

          14   about a day later?

          15   A.     Yeah, I started feeling pain, but I can't tell you

          16   it was specifically one more than the other.

          17   Q.     Okay.

          18   A.     Okay?

          19   Q.     Yup.  And as we sit here today, how often do you

          20   have the back pain?

          21   A.     All the time.

          22   Q.     That is constant?

          23   A.     By -- by "back pain," I'm talking about all the

          24   pain.  I'm talking about lower back.  I'm talking about

          25   hip.  I'm talking about going into -- back in here,
                                                                     57



           1   into -- shooting down my glute.  So I have it -- it's with

           2   me all the time.

           3   Q.     And how far down your leg, when you get the leg

           4   pain, does it go?

           5   A.     It depends on the day.  It depends on what I'm

           6   doing, but it can go all the way down into my ankle, and

           7   it can be just as little bit like right over here.

           8   Q.     Your upper thigh?

           9   A.     It can be up to my thigh.  It can also go all the

          10   way down my -- the back of my leg.

          11   Q.     Okay.  Oh.  I know.  It looks like you did go see a

          12   Corey Kirshner, a chiropractor.

          13   A.     Yeah.  Yeah.

          14   Q.     Is that someone you're related to?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     'Cause you mentioned Kirshner was your maiden name.

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Who is Corey --

          19   A.     So my -- so my brother Corey is a chiropractor.  So

          20   I was complaining to him about my pain.  And because

          21   chiropractors believe that they are the cure-all of all,

          22   he said, "Come and see me," which it was problematic for

          23   me because it was very difficult for me to drive.

          24                  But he lives in Allentown.  And I went to

          25   see him a few times, going with cruise control, to go and
                                                                     58



           1   see him to see if he could do anything at all.  And then,

           2   I realized it was a waste of my time, so I supposed going.

           3   Q.     It looks like you went seven times?

           4   A.     Yeah.

           5   Q.     All right.  And he just did some manipulations?

           6   A.     He did a -- manipulations.  And he's the one that

           7   gave me a TENS unit to use and did a couple of other kind

           8   of things that he does that -- you know, I made fun of him

           9   that it's hocus-pocus, you know?

          10   Q.     Had you ever treated with your brother before this

          11   accident?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     And other than those seven visits, have you been

          14   back?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     And the TENS unit he gave you, do you use it?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Do you still have it?

          19   A.     Yeah, I do.

          20   Q.     All right.  Did you ever use it?

          21   A.     Yes, I did.

          22   Q.     For how long?

          23   A.     Probably on and off for like three weeks.

          24   Q.     And that would have been in the summer --

          25   A.     Yeah.
                                                                     59



           1   Q.     -- fall of '18?

           2   A.     Yeah.

           3   Q.     All right.  The belt you mentioned --

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     -- how often do you use that?

           6   A.     I used that on a pretty regular basis.  Probably

           7   until, I want to say, that January, February, I was using

           8   it.  As I was getting pain, I would use the belt.

           9                  Once I started going to the myofascial

          10   place, the -- the -- I would get the shooting pain down

          11   my -- my back.  And once I started going to the myofascial

          12   place, that shooting pain wasn't as bad.  So I didn't need

          13   to, you know -- the chiropractor, I didn't need as -- I

          14   just, you know -- it -- it was the kind of thing that they

          15   -- I -- at that myofascial place, they taught me a lot of

          16   things to do that were helpful.

          17   Q.     So you haven't used the belt since --

          18   A.     So --

          19   Q.     -- you went to the myofascial place?

          20   A.     No.  I would use it on and off when things would

          21   get bad, but I would not use it as frequently.

          22   Q.     How -- when is the last time you used the belt?

          23   A.     Probably a month or so ago.  I keep it at the

          24   gallery.  You know, when I need it, I -- I put it on.  But

          25   now that I have all the help that I have, I don't seem to
                                                                     60



           1   need it as much.

           2   Q.     Any other equipment or devices given to you after

           3   this accident?

           4   A.     My brother gave me one other thing.  I can't tell

           5   you what it was, and since it did nothing, I didn't use

           6   it.  I don't know what it was.  He did give me one other

           7   something or another.

           8   Q.     Did anyone ever prescribe you any pain medication?

           9   A.     So here's the issue with pain medication:  I have

          10   Crohn's disease.  I can take nothing but Tylenol.  Tylenol

          11   does nothing.

          12                  So all of the usual suspects -- so I have

          13   been given a prescription for Flexeril.  Flexeril does

          14   help a bit at night.  I don't like the way it makes me

          15   feel, and I don't like the way it -- I feel so foggy in

          16   the morning.  So I try as best as I can to use that as

          17   little at possible.

          18                  I was also given a prescription for

          19   Vicodin.  I still have that.  I try to -- once again, I'll

          20   use that if I am flying somewhere or I need to be in a car

          21   for a very long period of time or it's an incredibly bad

          22   day.  I try not to -- I'm not a painkiller person.

          23   Q.     Who prescribed the Flexeril?

          24   A.     Flexeril was Walsh.

          25   Q.     And what about the Vicodin?
                                                                     61



           1   A.     The new doctor, Lerman.

           2   Q.     Any other medicines prescribed?

           3   A.     For my back, no.  That's it.

           4   Q.     Did you get different medicine for your neck and

           5   shoulder?

           6   A.     Oh, no.  No.  No.  I'm on medicines.

           7   Q.     Oh.

           8   A.     I'm on a bunch of other -- I have Crohn's

           9   disease --

          10   Q.     Right.

          11   A.     So I'm on a ton of medicine.

          12   Q.     Who do you see for your Crohn's?

          13   A.     I see Kaufman, Dr. Kaufman at -- at -- at Main

          14   Line, at Lankenau.

          15   Q.     At Lankenau.  And when were you diagnosed with

          16   that?

          17   A.     I was 16.

          18   Q.     Oh, for -- you've -- pretty much lifelong?

          19   A.     Lifelong.

          20   Q.     What are the symptoms of your Crohn's?

          21   A.     Copious amount of deliria and some pain, intestinal

          22   pain.

          23   Q.     And did you ever get back pain related to that?

          24   A.     Never.

          25   Q.     And as long as you eat what you need to eat --
                                                                     62



           1   A.     I'm gluten-free and I'm a very clean eater, other

           2   than coffee and sugar.

           3   Q.     Got it.  So but it's -- it's controlled by your

           4   diet?

           5   A.     It's -- no.  It's controlled by my medication.  And

           6   I have a -- a very strict diet, yes.  It doesn't control

           7   it.  It makes me feel better.  It makes me less sick.

           8   Q.     Any other illnesses?

           9   A.     No.

          10   Q.     As a result of this accident, is there anything

          11   that you 100 percent cannot do, not that it causes you

          12   difficulty or pain, but that you cannot do it?

          13   A.     So you don't mean like lifting?

          14   Q.     Well --

          15   A.     'Cause I cannot lift.

          16   Q.     So we had talked earlier.  I mean you can lift some

          17   things with the belt, but you choose not to, correct?

          18   A.     No.  I can't -- I -- even with the belt, I was not

          19   lifting.  What it does is walking.  The -- what the belt

          20   helped me with is literally going up and down stairs and

          21   walking and being able to get through the day.  I did not

          22   help me lift.

          23   Q.     So you cannot lift at all?

          24   A.     I can't lift at all.

          25   Q.     What is the -- give me an example of an item that
                                                                     63



           1   you can carry without issue.

           2   A.     Okay.  So I went from a big-ass -- oh.

           3                  MR. GALLAGHER:  It's all right.

           4   BY MS. KRENICKY:

           5   Q.     That's okay.

           6   A.     A big bag --

           7   Q.     Yeah.

           8   A.     -- to I purchased that because I can't lift or

           9   carry for a long period of time a regular purse.

          10   Q.     So you bought a cross-body --

          11   A.     I bought a cross-body, and there are many times I

          12   carry it like this.

          13   Q.     You're -- you're -- just 'cause the record, we have

          14   to --

          15   A.     Okay.  I'm cradling it so that I don't have the

          16   weight.

          17   Q.     Okay.

          18   A.     So that -- so that's something I mean I -- repeat

          19   the question that was all of ten seconds ago.

          20   Q.     That's okay.  So I'm just trying to get an idea of

          21   things you can --

          22   A.     Can lift.

          23   Q.     I mean obviously, you're able to pick up a coffee

          24   cup.  I --

          25   A.     I'm able to pick up things like a coffee cup.  I'm
                                                                     64



           1   able to kneel down in front of a washing machine and take

           2   the stuff that's from the washing machine into the dryer,

           3   little bits.  I can't take a basket of -- pick up a basket

           4   of clothes.  I've stopped actually doing laundry because

           5   of that.

           6                  I'm trying to think of what can I

           7   actually -- I could pick up paper.  I --

           8                  MR. GALLAGHER:  No.  Let me ask you this

           9   question, if you don't mind:  What's the heaviest weight

          10   you think you can pick up from the ground and carry and

          11   hold?

          12                  THE WITNESS:  I haven't tried, but I would

          13   think like three pounds, four pounds.  I don't know.

          14   How -- how heavy is that bag?

          15                  MR. GALLAGHER:  I don't know.  What about a

          16   gallon of milk?  Could you pick up a gallon of milk and --

          17                  THE WITNESS:  I can pick up a --

          18                  MR. GALLAGHER:  -- and carry it --

          19                  THE WITNESS:  -- bag.

          20                  MR. GALLAGHER:  -- and walk around with it?

          21                  THE WITNESS:  No, probably not.

          22   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          23   Q.     So if you went to the grocery store, for example,

          24   and you went to the back of the store, and you got milk,

          25   could you carry it to the cash register, or would you need
                                                                     65



           1   to put it in a cart and push it?

           2   A.     Not a gallon.  It would -- that would bother me.

           3   But a quart, absolutely.  I can pick up a quart.

           4   Q.     All right.  So other than lifting, are there any

           5   other things that you cannot do?

           6   A.     Sleeping is very difficult.  I -- I can sleep.

           7                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Listen -- listen to her

           8   question, okay?

           9                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  The things that --

          10                  MR. GALLAGHER:  She's saying -- you --

          11   obviously, you sleep or you'd be dead.

          12                  THE WITNESS:  Right.

          13                  MR. GALLAGHER:  So what cannot -- what can

          14   you not do at all, you've stopped doing because you

          15   physically cannot do it?

          16                  THE WITNESS:  Lifting is probably the major

          17   thing, anything that has to do with -- with anything

          18   that's gonna pull on my -- my lower back.  So I cannot

          19   lift.  I could do most other things, you know, walk, sit,

          20   things like that, yes.

          21   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          22   Q.     Did you have any issues with lifting from your

          23   November, 2017 accident?

          24   A.     Yes, I did.

          25   Q.     Did the amount of weight that you could lift change
                                                                     66



           1   after the accident with my client?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     Could you have carried a gallon of milk --

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.      -- after the November, 2017 accident but before

           6   the accident with my client?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     All right.  The accident in November of 2017, just

           9   generally -- like we don't need to get into the specifics

          10   like the streets or anything -- but like what happened in

          11   that accident?  Were you rear-ended?  Was it a head-on

          12   collision?  Was it a T-bone?

          13   A.     So what happened on that accident is we were

          14   driving.  I think it was I-95 or 76 in New Jersey.  I was

          15   in a company van, and I believe it was an 18-wheeler hit

          16   our van.

          17   Q.     You guys got rear-ended?

          18   A.     We got rear-ended.

          19   Q.     All right.  And were you taken by ambulance?

          20   A.     No, I was not.

          21   Q.     Did you go to the emergency room for that accident?

          22   A.     No, I did not.

          23   Q.     Is -- the only place you went was Premier for that

          24   accident?

          25   A.     And the -- and a -- a chiropractor place.
                                                                     67



           1   Q.     Not your brother?

           2   A.     Not my brother.

           3   Q.     What was the chiropractor place?

           4   A.     I would have to get you the name.  It's on -- I

           5   think it's like 947 Haverford Road.  I mean I could tell

           6   you exactly where it is.  I just can't remember the name.

           7   Q.     It's on Haverford Road and what?

           8   A.     Haverford.  It's just literally on Haverford Road.

           9   Q.     Okay.  Mid-block somewhere?

          10   A.     Yeah, mid-block on Haverford Road.

          11   Q.     All right.  Was that a Workers' Compensation

          12   doctor?

          13   A.     Yes, it was.

          14   Q.     Or chiropractor, I should say.

          15   A.     Yeah, it was.

          16   Q.     All right.

          17   A.     Can I get back to the other question also?  I've --

          18   I -- when you said about as far as lifting and stuff from

          19   that -- this particular accident, my right side was fine.

          20   It was my left that was -- that was injured.

          21                  So I was -- and I'm right-handed.  So I was

          22   able to do a fair amount because I'm right-handed, but

          23   things that I would need both was where the issue laid --

          24   was -- was.  So, yes.  Could I pick up milk?  I'm

          25   right-handed.  Yes, I could pick up milk.
                                                                     68



           1   Q.     I understand.  Is your Workers' Compensation

           2   resolved?

           3   A.     Not that I know of, no.  No?  No, it's not.  No.

           4                  MR. GALLAGHER:  We can go off the record.

           5                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

           6   BY MS. KRENICKY:

           7   Q.     Did you give a deposition related to the November,

           8   2017 accident?

           9   A.     No.

          10   Q.     Do you have one scheduled?

          11   A.     No.

          12                  MR. GALLAGHER:  It's not in suit.

          13                  MS. KRENICKY:  Got it.

          14   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          15   Q.     Any other car accidents besides this one and the

          16   one in November of 2017?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     In the past five years, have you been to an

          19   emergency room for any reason?

          20   A.     Not that I can recall.

          21   Q.     I saw something in your --

          22                  MR. GALLAGHER:  What about -- hold on.

          23   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          24   Q.     -- records that you fell and broke your elbow.

          25   A.     Oh, yeah.  I --
                                                                     69



           1   Q.     Did you go to the ER for that?

           2   A.     Yeah.  I -- I -- I absolutely did, yes.  That was

           3   in -- when we were hiking out West.  I'm trying to forget

           4   that whole thing.  Yes.  We were hiking, and I tripped and

           5   broke my elbow.

           6   Q.     So that --

           7   A.     Yes.  And I went to the emergency room in Seattle,

           8   and then I came back here and went to a doctor.

           9   Q.     Who did you treat with for the elbow?

          10   A.     You're asking me names I don't remember.

          11   Q.     Do you know where?

          12   A.     My elbow, I probably -- I don't remember.  I

          13   really, truly don't remember.

          14   Q.     It wasn't Premier?

          15                  MR. GALLAGHER:  You know the name of the

          16   facility?

          17                  THE WITNESS:  I'm telling you I'm being

          18   honest.  I -- I don't know why I don't remember this.  I

          19   did break my elbow, and it -- oh.  I know exactly where it

          20   was, Rothman.  I'm sitting here like:  I don't remember.

          21   Yes, I do.  I went to Rothman.

          22   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          23   Q.     And that happened in the summer of '17, so about a

          24   year before this --

          25   A.     Oh, please.  If I couldn't remember Rothman, do you
                                                                     70



           1   really think I'd remember the date of that?  I don't

           2   remember.  I would have to go look at my pictures of when

           3   we were out in Seattle and out that -- that area, and then

           4   it would come to me.

           5   Q.     Any other broken bones, anything like that in your

           6   life?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     And any other emergency room visits in the past

           9   five years?

          10   A.     Not that I can recall.

          11   Q.     Going back to your limitations from this accident,

          12   so we were talking about absolutes, right? you absolutely

          13   cannot do's, and that was the lifting.

          14   A.     Lifting.

          15   Q.     Now we're gonna get into the things that cause you

          16   difficulty and pain, okay?  So you started to mention

          17   sleeping.

          18   A.     Sleeping is an issue.

          19   Q.     Tell me about that.

          20   A.     Sleep -- well, first of all, I was never a back

          21   sleeper.  I can't sleep on my -- either side at this

          22   point, because it causes pain on my left side.  So I can't

          23   sleep on left side.  I have to sleep flat on my back.

          24                  It's uncomfortable sleeping flat on my

          25   back, so then I went and got something to put underneath
                                                                     71



           1   my knees and also something to put underneath my neck so

           2   that it makes it a little bit more comfortable.  I was

           3   taking the Flexeril so that I could fall asleep.  I

           4   stopped taking the Flexeril, because it makes me wonky in

           5   the morning, and I hated the way it made me feel.

           6                  I do try to take Tylenol.  It doesn't work.

           7   I mean Tylenol just doesn't seem to work for me.  I stay

           8   up quite late and watch TV and read and eventually fall

           9   asleep.  And I do wake up in the middle of the night and

          10   have to get up and walk around and things like that.  And

          11   then, I go back to bed.  So my sleep is interrupted.

          12   Q.     And have you discussed that with any doctors?

          13   A.     No.  I just am dealing with it.

          14   Q.     And any other activities that have been affected by

          15   this accident?

          16   A.     Any other activities?  Yeah.  I used to do a ton of

          17   hiking.  I can no longer hike at all.  I have not driven

          18   any but -- anywhere but local since this accident, which

          19   means that I have to wait for my husband to take me to see

          20   the baby.

          21                  I have a friend who lives down the shore.

          22   I just can't drive that far.  I mean I -- I would like to

          23   be able to do that, and I haven't been able to do that

          24   yet.  So driving.

          25                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Well, hold on a sec.  Are
                                                                     72



           1   these -- these are sounding like absolutes, meaning you

           2   can't do it at all.  You said, "I can't hike anymore.  I

           3   can't" --

           4                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  So --

           5                  MR. GALLAGHER:  -- "drive long distances

           6   anymore."  She asked you about absolutes.  You named one

           7   thing, lifting.  Are these absolutes or --

           8                  THE WITNESS:  Oh.  So --

           9                  MR. GALLAGHER:  -- you can do them but you

          10   have difficulty doing them?

          11                  THE WITNESS:  I have difficulty.  So

          12   absolutes, other than lifting -- thank you for clarifying

          13   that -- other than anything that's gonna involve any back,

          14   I can't -- which is basically lifting.  I would say that's

          15   probably it.

          16   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          17   Q.     So then, let me just clarify.  So the hiking, for

          18   example, you can do it.  It just hurts.  Or you don't do

          19   it at all?

          20   A.     I don't do it at all.

          21   Q.     So that's an absolute, correct?

          22   A.     Okay.  Well, then I -- then, that is an absolute.

          23   Yes, I do not hike.

          24   Q.     All right.  When is the last time you hiked?

          25   A.     The last time I hiked was -- I think it was the
                                                                     73



           1   same year as this accident.  We went to Patagonia.

           2   Q.     When was that?

           3   A.     I'd have to look at my -- I'd have to look at my

           4   phone.  Patagonia was -- like I -- obviously, dates aren't

           5   my thing.  It wasn't last year.  It was the year before.

           6   The year before, January.

           7   Q.     You went in January of 2018?

           8   A.     I believe it -- or I went in January of 2018, I

           9   believe, yeah.

          10   Q.     So after the rear-ending by the 18-wheeler --

          11   A.     I believe that's -- yeah.  I think that was then.

          12   Q.     -- you went hiking in Patagonia?

          13   A.     Yeah.

          14   Q.     Did you have any issues hiking in Patagonia --

          15   A.     I wore a sling and things like that for my arm, you

          16   know?  But other than -- my legs were fine, and I used a

          17   stick.  So no, it was fine.

          18   Q.     Did you try to hike at all since this accident?

          19   A.     Because it's hard for me to even get up steps, the

          20   answer is no, I have not tried to hike.

          21   Q.     The only reason I'm asking:  There was something in

          22   your records that you were going to Canada in June of '18

          23   --

          24   A.     And I did go.

          25   Q.     Okay.  So you got to Canada --
                                                                     74



           1   A.     And I did not go hiking.

           2   Q.     What did you do?

           3   A.     I went to the spa.  They would give -- so "hiking"

           4   to me means going uphill.  To me, that means -- that's

           5   what it means.  So what I would do is we would go on like

           6   alternate-kinds of hikes.

           7   Q.     So you went on --

           8   A.     On flat, like around --

           9   Q.     -- flat walks?

          10   A.     Flat -- a flat walk, yes, things like that.

          11   Q.     How long are the flat walks?

          12   A.     There weren't long, like let's say a mile.

          13   Q.     Were you able to go on the flat walk in Canada in

          14   June or July of '18?

          15   A.     I was able to go on flat walks in Canada, yes.

          16   Q.     And have you gone on any other flat walks since?

          17   A.     As a matter of fact, flat walking is helpful.  It's

          18   the one thing that gives me a little bit of relief.  So

          19   walking to -- walking, for me, is actually therapeutic.

          20   Q.     How long are you able to walk without issue?

          21   A.     I usually walk -- the longest I've walked is

          22   probably a mile.  The tops has been a mile and a half on

          23   flat ground.

          24   Q.     Driving long distances, you said you --

          25   A.     I haven't tried it, I have to tell you.  I have not
                                                                     75



           1   driven a long distance since this has happened.

           2   Q.     And what do you consider to be long?

           3   A.     Anywhere further than the mall from my house and

           4   other than Havertown.

           5   Q.     Meaning King of Prussia?

           6   A.     Like King of Prussia.  I just don't drive very far.

           7   Like I said, I did drive to Allentown to see my brother --

           8   Q.     Right.

           9   A.     -- using cruise control, so...

          10   Q.     Is that the furthest you got to --

          11   A.     I think that's the furthest I've been to.

          12   Q.     -- Allentown?  Okay.  And you're able to sit in the

          13   car.  You just don't want to drive.  Is that accurate?

          14   A.     I'm able to sit in the car, but even that, we take

          15   breaks.  And I like being on -- long drives are not the

          16   best.

          17   Q.     Did any doctor tell you not to drive a long

          18   distance?

          19   A.     Nobody has told me not to drive a long distance.

          20   But for me to drive just from home to work, I need -- I

          21   use a back pillow in every one of my cars.  And I only

          22   have one, but Frank has a car, and -- no.  I have a

          23   company van.  So I always use a back pillow.

          24                  And I have this ball that I got from -- I

          25   was like looking for a ball.  I got this ball from -- from
                                                                     76



           1   the myofascial place, and I keep that in my car.  And

           2   sometimes if I'm having issues, I'll put the ball back in

           3   here, and it helps.  So that's what I mean that they have

           4   shown me ways to be able to do more.

           5   Q.     Anything else that causes you difficulty?

           6   A.     Sitting.

           7   Q.     How long can you sit without issue?

           8   A.     Half an hour.

           9   Q.     Anything else?

          10   A.     So lifting, sitting, sleeping.  Anything else that

          11   causes me issues?  Working.

          12   Q.     We talked about that, yeah.

          13   A.     Yeah.  Life.  I'm kidding.

          14   Q.     Well --

          15   A.     Yeah.

          16   Q.     -- let me ask -- let me put it to you this way:

          17   This is your time to tell me how this accident affected

          18   your life, right?  So that's why we're here.  Is --

          19   A.     So it has --

          20   Q.     -- is there anything else that I should know about

          21   how this affected your life?

          22   A.     It has -- it has affected every part of my life.

          23   My relationship with my husband, I mean we have division

          24   of labor in our home.  I have not been able to uphold my

          25   division of labor, which is, you know, go to the
                                                                     77



           1   supermarket, take the packages into the house, doing the

           2   laundry.  He's doing all of that.  Cleaning my house, I

           3   cannot do, pushing a vacuum cleaner.  So those kinds of

           4   things are impossible.

           5                  Going to a movie sometimes is problematic.

           6   I mean I have been able to go to -- I don't -- I -- but

           7   I'd have to be dying to see the movie, and I'd bring my

           8   back pillow and my ball.  And I go to a place that is a

           9   lounge, you know, those fantastic stadium seating.

          10                  I'm not able to hike with him.  That's

          11   something we did every single weekend.  Now I'm not able

          12   to do that at all anymore.  He now goes hiking on

          13   Saturdays instead of Sundays.  I work Saturdays.

          14                  Watching TV together.  I can't sit on the

          15   couch with him.  I lay on a yoga mat every day of my life

          16   to watch TV.  So my relationship with Frank, I'm sure he's

          17   annoyed with me.

          18                  So my -- my baby, I'm not able to pick up

          19   my own grandchild.

          20                  MS. KRENICKY:  Let's take a minute.

          21                  THE WITNESS:  Every single moment of my

          22   life, I'm reminded of this.  I'm sitting here

          23   uncomfortable.

          24                  Frank and I like to travel together.  We

          25   were supposed to go to Vietnam, and I kept on thinking:
                                                                     78



           1   I'm gonna be better.  I'm gonna be better.  I'm gonna be

           2   better.  I wasn't better.  Couldn't go to Vietnam.

           3                  I mean I don't -- when he says, "When do

           4   you want to go on the next trip?" I don't even want to

           5   plan a next trip.

           6                  MS. KRENICKY:  Do you want to take a

           7   minute?  Are you okay?

           8                  THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.

           9                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Let's take five minutes.

          10                  (Recess was taken from 12:33 p.m. to 12:35

          11   p.m.)

          12                  THE WITNESS:  It has changed everything

          13   about my life.  I was very active.  I went to the gym all

          14   the time.  I went -- was out with my friends all -- you

          15   know, I have friends.  We would go do things.

          16                  I used -- I have a friend who lives down

          17   the shore and haven't driven to the shore to see her.  And

          18   she's -- invites me all the time.  Because I can't -- I'm

          19   scared to drive that far.  I don't know if I'm gonna be

          20   able to drive that far.  I haven't -- I haven't attempted

          21   it.

          22                  You know, I had, you know, a strong group

          23   of friends that we would go out to dinner all the time.

          24   After working all day, it takes so much just to get

          25   through work, I don't have a social life anymore.  So my
                                                                     79



           1   friendships, I mean it's -- it's unfortunately has

           2   affected everything.  I want it to be over.  And I've done

           3   everything I could to fix it, and I'm just not able to.

           4   Q.     Would you say that the accident with my client was

           5   worse than the accident in November of '17?

           6   A.     It's -- it's an interesting question.  The -- the

           7   accident in November of '17, when I was hit by the truck,

           8   yes, my -- my neck -- and I got a frozen shoulder.  But --

           9   but through exercises and things like that and because

          10   of the -- yes, it was my left side, but I'm

          11   right-handed -- I saw progression of -- I kept on getting

          12   better.

          13   Q.     Right.

          14   A.     The -- so I think this has been a lot worse.  So

          15   instead of an acute problem -- I had an acute problem with

          16   that accident.  Yes, I still have some issues with my

          17   neck, but I was able to go through what I needed to go

          18   through to get my life back.  And because it was my left

          19   side and I'm right-handed, there were a lot of things I

          20   was able to do.

          21                  I was -- if I didn't move, it didn't hurt.

          22   I'm sitting here, talking to you.  My back is killing me.

          23   By "back," I mean that whole area.  I don't --

          24   Q.     Sure.  I understand.

          25   A.     So --
                                                                     80



           1   Q.     You mean the whole area.

           2   A.     -- instead of saying "my glutes."  But it's

           3   never -- I don't have a moment of I feel good.  I just

           4   don't have it anymore.

           5                  So it's gone from an acute problem, which I

           6   think can be solved, to a chronic problem that I can't

           7   believe I have a chronic condition.  I deal with one with

           8   Crohn's.  I can deal with that.  I'm very good at dealing

           9   with things.  This has changed my life in every facet.

          10   Q.     Any other specific activities or anything that you

          11   want me to know about?  I mean I know you're saying

          12   "everything," but --

          13   A.     Like I said, you know, sitting, going out to

          14   dinner, going to a movie, hiking, going to sleep at night.

          15                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Other than what you've said

          16   already.

          17                  THE WITNESS:  I'm trying to think.  I mean

          18   it's like -- like I said, work.  Every part of my life has

          19   been affected.  I can't say anything more specific.

          20                  MR. GALLAGHER:  What she's getting at --

          21   and I'm not being facetious here -- is like you said

          22   "everything" and "life," and you got specific, but, you

          23   know, horseback riding.  You know, any --

          24                  THE WITNESS:  But I never -- but I never --

          25                  MR. GALLAGHER:  I know.  I'm being -- I am
                                                                     81



           1   being facetious, I guess.  But like she wants to know:  Is

           2   there any -- like a specific thing?  You're -- you were a

           3   ballroom dancer.  Now you don't do that.

           4                  MS. KRENICKY:  Right.

           5                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Is there anything like that

           6   that you want to be specific about and let her know today

           7   before you leave here?  So I think you've covered,

           8   essentially, everything.

           9                  THE WITNESS:  Specifically, I think I've

          10   named a -- a bunch of specifics.

          11   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          12   Q.     And then, just to clarify, you do have ongoing

          13   appointments with Dr. Lerman?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     And when is your next one?

          16   A.     I have a call-in to him, actually, today to let him

          17   know if the last injection worked, which, so far, it has

          18   not.

          19   Q.     It has not, okay.  And do you -- okay.  That's

          20   fine.

          21   A.     I don't know what he's doing next.

          22   Q.     Do -- and do you use social media, any Facebook,

          23   Instagram?

          24   A.     Not really.

          25   Q.     Do you have accounts?
                                                                     82



           1   A.     I look at it, but I don't never -- I'll

           2   like everything.  I'll like something but very

           3   infrequently.  No, so I do not -- I look at it.

           4   Q.     So you have an account?

           5   A.     I have an account.

           6   Q.     And did you post anything on there about this

           7   accident or how this has affected your life?

           8   A.     No.

           9   Q.     And as Mr. Gallagher asked my client, I have to ask

          10   everyone.  Please don't be offended.  In the past ten

          11   years, have you been convicted of or pled guilty to any

          12   crimes involving dishonesty, for example, theft, forgery,

          13   perjury, anything like that?

          14   A.     No.

          15                  MS. KRENICKY:  We are finished.  Thank you

          16   very much for your time.

          17                  (Witness excused.)

          18                  (Deposition ended at 12:40 p.m.)

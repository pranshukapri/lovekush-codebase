 2  BY MS. CORBETT:

 3      Q.   Good morning, Doctor.

 4      A.   Good morning.

 5      Q.   As I already introduced myself, I am       

 6  Jillian Corbett and I represent Terea Thornton.  

 7           Would you please introduce yourself to the jury 

 8  this morning.

 9      A.   My name is Dr. Louis Olegario.  I'm one of the 

10  physicians from DNA Advanced Pain Treatment Center.

11      Q.   And we're here today to take your testimony on 

12  behalf of Ms. Thornton regarding your evaluation of her 

13  that was performed at my request and also your treatment 

14  of her following a September 1, 2016 motor vehicle 

15  accident.  

16           But before we do all of that, I need to ask you a 

17  few questions about your background and qualifications as 

18  an expert witness.  So what type of doctor are you?

19      A.   So I'm -- I did finish my residency training in 

20  physical medicine and rehabilitation, and then I did a 

21  fellowship for interventional pain management.

22      Q.   And are you licensed to practice medicine in the 

23  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania?

24      A.   Yes, I am.

25      Q.   Would you explain for us a little bit what 


                                                               6

 1  interventional pain management is.  

 2      A.   So for interventional pain management what we do 

 3  with that is we treat a lot of chronic pain patients.  

 4  That's including after back or neck surgeries or any motor 

 5  vehicular accident, any trauma, cancer patients.  We do 

 6  treatments such as injections, medications, physical 

 7  therapy.

 8      Q.   And could you explain for us a little bit what 

 9  physical medicine is?

10      A.   So physical medicine and rehabilitation, being -- 

11  that's why we call ourselves a physiatrist.  So we -- 

12  physiatrists we treat a lot of neurological problems, such 

13  as a stroke patients, trauma -- traumatic brain injury, 

14  spinal cord injury patients, even with musculoskeletal 

15  problem, any kind of chronic pain problems too.

16      Q.   And how long have you been a doctor?  

17      A.   I have been licensed here in Pennsylvania since 

18  2003.

19      Q.   And could you describe for the jury the process 

20  of how you became a doctor?  

21      A.   So becoming a doctor you have to have a 

22  bachelor's degree, a four-year bachelor's degree, and then 

23  a four years also in proper medical school, which I did 

24  finish my medical school in the Philippines, and I did one 

25  year of post graduate internship out there and then took 


                                                               7

 1  my Philippines board before coming here.  Here in the 

 2  states you have to pass USMLE I and II before you can 

 3  start doing your residency training and then pass the 

 4  USMLE III is when you can -- you are eligible to take 

 5  your specialty board.

 6      Q.   And Doctor, you mentioned going to medical 

 7  school in the Philippines.  Are you from the Philippines?

 8      A.   Yes, I am.

 9      Q.   And you also mentioned taking boards.  Are you 

10  board certified in Pennsylvania?

11      A.   Yes, I am.

12      Q.   How did you become board certified?

13      A.   So board certification for physical medicine and 

14  rehabilitation you have to have four years of residency 

15  training, so one year in general surgery as an 

16  internship, visiting SUNY Downstate, Brooklyn, New York.  

17  Then I did my three years of residency training in 

18  physical medicine and rehabilitation in Kingsbrook Jewish 

19  Medical Center.  It's also in Brooklyn, New York.

20      Q.   And Doctor, are you also board certified in 

21  interventional pain management?  

22      A.   Yes, I am.  After taking that one year of 

23  interventional pain fellowship, then that's where you are 

24  eligible to take the pain management exams.

25      Q.   And are you board certified in any other states?


                                                               8

 1      A.   I have license in the State of Florida and some 

 2  inactive license in New York and New Jersey.

 3      Q.   And Doctor, what does it mean when a license is 

 4  inactive?

 5      A.   What it means there is like, you know, since 

 6  you're not practicing there actively, you can just put on 

 7  hold all of those requirements that they need so you don't 

 8  have to do that until like, you know, you try to practice 

 9  in that state, then you can actively fulfill all of those 

10  requirements.

11      Q.   And have you ever been qualified to testify as an 

12  expert in Allegheny County?

13      A.   Yes, I am.

14      Q.   Doctor, could you look at this exhibit that I 

15  have marked as A in front of you?  Could you please 

16  identify that document?

17           (Olegario Exhibit A was marked for 

18  identification.)

19      A.   Yes.  This is my recent curriculum vitae.

20      Q.   And would you tell the jury about any type of 

21  positions and professional associations you have.  

22      A.   Yes.  I am a member of Pittsburgh Pain Society as 

23  well as Washington Pain Society and a member of 

24  Pennsylvania Medical Society, American Academy of Physical 

25  Medicine and Rehabilitation as well as American Board of 


                                                               9

 1  Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.  And I do some 

 2  teaching also with some students who comes.  These are 

 3  nursing students from the University of Pittsburgh who 

 4  comes to our office where we teach them what we do in the 

 5  office.  We do teach them the anatomy, the injections 

 6  that we do, the surgery that we do in our practice.

 7      Q.   And Doctor, you talked a little bit about being 

 8  from DNA Pain Management.  So let's talk about your 

 9  current practice.  What do you do on a daily basis?  

10      A.   In my daily basis it really depends, because 

11  sometimes I'm in the office, sometimes I'm in the surgery 

12  center or hospitals.  So when I'm in the office, I do see 

13  patients, around 35 patients.  These are all including 

14  follow-ups, new patients, as well as injections.  And 

15  then if I am in the surgery center or in the hospitals, a 

16  lot of those procedures are patients needs sedations, 

17  because they are scared of needles, as well as surgical 

18  cases like spinal cord stimulator, Morphine pumps, 

19  kyphoplasty and all of the surgeries that we do under 

20  sedations.  So that's what we do in the hospital or 

21  surgery center.

22      Q.   And Doctor, what types of procedures -- or what 

23  type of procedures do you perform?

24      A.   So basically we do all of the joint injections.  

25  I do all of the epidurals, cervical, thoracic, lumbar.  I 


                                                               10

 1  do sacroiliac injections, facet or a medial nerve branch 

 2  block from cervical, thoracic, and lumbar.  I do 

 3  kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty.  We do provocative discogram, 

 4  spinal cord stimulator trial as well as the implants and 

 5  Morphine pumps.

 6      Q.   And Doctor, do you treat patients who have 

 7  suffered a trauma, a physical trauma?

 8      A.   Yes, I do.

 9      Q.   And as part of your practice do you review 

10  medical diagnostic tests?

11      A.   Yes, I do.

12      Q.   And does your practice include diagnosing 

13  patients and projecting their future treatment?

14      A.   Yes.

15      Q.   Are you familiar with the costs associated with 

16  future treatment?

17      A.   Yes, I am.

18      Q.   And how are you familiar with those costs?

19      A.   This is just based on my clinical experience.  

20           MS. CORBETT:  Thank you, Doctor.  At this time 

21  I'm going to allow opposing counsel to ask questions about 

22  your qualifications, and I would move to enter Exhibit A.  

23           MR. BORSUK:  No objection.

11      Q.   And the other certification you have is for pain 

12  management?

13      A.   That is correct.

15           MS. CORBETT:  Thank you.  At this time I would 

16  offer Dr. Olegario as an expert in interventional pain 

17  management and physical medicine and rehabilitation.  

18           MR. BORSUK:  No objection.

23  to take your testimony on behalf of Ms. Thornton who you 

24  have treated and also evaluated at the request of my 

25  office related to her treatment following her accident on

 2           So during this testimony, I'm going to ask you

                                                               14

 1  injuries associated with this accident before your 

 2  evaluation at the request of my office?

 3      A.   Yes.

 4      Q.   And when you saw Ms. Thornton to treat her, did 

 5  you perform a physical exam?

 6      A.   Yes, I did.

 7      Q.   And when you also saw her to prepare this report, 

 8  did you perform another physical exam?  

 9      A.   Yes, I did.

10      Q.   In a moment I'm going to ask you to work -- walk 

11  the jury through your physical exam.  But before I do 

12  that, I would like to know prior to your examination of 

13  Ms. Thornton, did you have an opportunity to review any 

14  treatment records regarding her care?

15      A.   Yes.

16      Q.   And what were those?

17      A.   So I did review her magnetic resonance imaging of 

18  her cervical and lumbar spine.  I did -- I do have some 

19  records also from Dr. Holding about the patient's 

20  electrodiagnostic study results and from her chiropractor, 

21  from Dr. Petrarca, and some of the notes that was given to 

22  me from Mercy Hospital.

23      Q.   And Doctor, the records from Mercy Hospital, were 

24  those given to you by my office at a later date?

25      A.   Yes.


                                                               15

 1      Q.   And did any of those change the opinions that you 

 2  gave in your report?

 3      A.   No.

 4      Q.   Doctor, you had mentioned some diagnostic tests 

 5  that you reviewed.  And what were those tests?

 6      A.   So MRI of her cervical and lumbar spine as well 

 7  as the electrodiagnostic studies of her upper and lower 

 8  extremities.

 9      Q.   And Doctor, what did the MRIs show?

10      A.   The MRI of her cervical spine it shows normal 

11  results, and then the MRI of her cervical results are 

12  normal.

13      Q.   And Doctor, what does an MRI image show?

14      A.   Um --

15      Q.   What is it -- I'm sorry.  That was a bad 

16  question.  What is it -- what is the test taken for or 

17  what is an MRI, rather?

18      A.   So MRI stands as magnetic resonance imaging.  

19  What it does it uses powerful magnets and radio waves.  

20  With the help of the computer, it can generate all of this 

21  films.  It doesn't emit any radiation in comparisons to 

22  x-rays and CAT scans.  It's a very safe procedure, a very 

23  thorough test.

24      Q.   And you had mentioned also an EMG test.  What is 

25  an EMG?


                                                               16

 1      A.   EMG is really electrodiagnostic studies.  It 

 2  involves two portions which is the first one is the nerve 

 3  conduction studies and that one is a needle 

 4  electromyography.  So nerve conduction study, so it will 

 5  tell us if there is any nerve pathology, and then the 

 6  needle EMG it will show if the nerve pathology is an acute 

 7  or a chronic.  So it's how the muscle responds to any 

 8  nerve stimulus.

 9      Q.   And so what is the difference in what an EMG 

10  tests and what an MRI tests?

11      A.   So MRI the way we see the MRI it easily 

12  represents the anatomy of the problem.  So it will show us 

13  if there is any anatomical problems of the spine or in the 

14  subcutaneous tissue or in the spinal cord.  In comparisons 

15  to electromyog --electrodiagnostic studies, it's more on 

16  the function of like where the nerve coming from the neck 

17  down to the arms, if there is any problems on the way from 

18  the neck down.  So it's more on the physiological side.

19      Q.   And what did the EMGs taken of Ms. Thornton 

20  reveal?

21      A.   She has two electrodiagnostic studies.  Her 

22  lumbar electrodiagnostic study shows no evidence of lumbar 

23  radiculopathy or peripheral nerve entrapment, and her 

24  cervical, her upper extremities, electrodiagnostic study 

25  shows cervical radiculopathy involving bilateral C5-C6 and 


                                                               17

 1  right C6-C7 nerve roots.

 2      Q.   And Doctor, we can keep talking about cervical 

 3  and lumbar.  Could you tell us what the cervical spine is 

 4  or what part that is?

 5      A.   Cervical is mainly the neck area, so it is 

 6  composed of a seven vertebra bone.

 7      Q.   And what about the lumbar?

 8      A.   Lumbar is in our lower portion of the spine.

 9      Q.   And you kind of discussed that radiculopathy was 

10  found in the cervical spine of Ms. Thornton.  What is 

11  radiculopathy.

12      A.   So radiculopathy are when there are some nerve 

13  pathology that causes some pain from the neck down to 

14  their hands, their arms, their fingers, shooting pain, 

15  aching pain, or like an electric type of pain.

16      Q.   And Doctor, is it fully necessary for an MRI and 

17  an EMG to both show results or be abnormal for there to be 

18  radiculopathy in a patient?

19      A.   No, not necessarily.

20      Q.   And how is it that they can be different?

21      A.   So first and foremost it's like, you know, those 

22  diagnostic studies are just -- it's just going to help the 

23  providers.  It's really basically the history and physical 

24  is what's most important.  And some of these tests it 

25  could be negative, but it doesn't mean that the patient 


                                                               18

 1  doesn't have the problem.

 2      Q.   And how does radiculopathy occur?

 3      A.   So radiculopathy once there is a nerve type of 

 4  problem that's coming from the cervical spine and it 

 5  manifest in the -- in their arms, forearms or in their 

 6  fingers.

 7      Q.   And how can it be caused from trauma, if it can?  

 8      A.   So what it does it involves when there are some 

 9  nerve damage or any irritations from the nerve root that 

10  it can cause inflammation, and those inflammation is the 

11  one that is really causing all of this pain that it 

12  radiates down to their hands and fingers.

13      Q.   And in addition to these diagnostic studies and 

14  the other records that you told us you reviewed, did you, 

15  I believe you said you did, do a physical exam of 

16  Ms. Thornton?

17      A.   Yes.

18      Q.   And what did that reveal?

19      A.   So Ms. Thornton's cervical spine the range of 

20  motion is decreased in all directions, especially on 

21  cervical extension and flexion and also lateral rotation.  

22  She had some tenderness on both trapezius, the left 

23  shoulder area, and pain going down to her forearm and arm.

24      Q.   And did your examination of her match the results 

25  of the objective testing?


                                                               19

 1      A.   Yes, it did.  

 2      Q.   After examining Ms. Thornton, reviewing her 

 3  records, studies and images referenced in your report, did 

 4  you find any injuries?

 5      A.   Yes.

 6      Q.   And what were those?

 7      A.   That Ms. Thornton has a cervical radiculopathy as 

 8  well as her facet injury as a result of the motor 

 9  vehicular accident on September 1, 2016.

10      Q.   And when you first saw her for treatment, was she 

11  still suffering from pain from the accident?

12      A.   Yes, she was.

13      Q.   And was that about a year after the accident that 

14  you first saw her?

15      A.   That is correct.

16      Q.   Is that typical for pain management?

17      A.   It's really not unusual.  A lot of our patients 

18  since we treat chronic pain, a lot of them they refer to 

19  us six months to a year or even two years after like when 

20  their pain persist.  That's why we mainly treat chronic 

21  pain problems.  

22      Q.   And what does chronic mean?

23      A.   Chronic means like, you know, when -- I mean, 

24  there is three stages; there is an acute, subacute, and a 

25  chronic.  So acute is within three months -- within a 


                                                               20

 1  month, and then subacute is within three months of the 

 2  problem, and then three months after that it becomes 

 3  chronic, and that's when the problems persist, and then 

 4  that's when we start seeing all of this patient.

 5      Q.   And after reviewing the records and examining 

 6  Ms. Thornton, I believe it was in September of 2017, what 

 7  did you decide to do for her treatment-wise?

 8      A.   So after my evaluation with her, since her pain 

 9  is mainly in the cervical spine down to her arms, so we 

10  discussed doing a cervical epidural steroid injections.

11      Q.   And was one of those eventually performed?

12      A.   Yes.

13      Q.   And what is a cervical epidural steroid 

14  injection?

15      A.   So cervical epidural steroid injection usually 

16  what I usually tells my patients is it's basically exactly 

17  the same when women gives birth, so it's an epidural 

18  injection.  So the only difference is I use is an x-ray 

19  machine to guide my needle, and then I use steroids 

20  instead of the pain medication where these women -- the 

21  pregnant women gets.  So steroids is a very good       

22  anti-inflammatory medications.  It relieves the 

23  inflammations around the nerve root sheath, and once the 

24  inflammation subsides, then the pain coming from the neck 

25  down to their arm starts getting better.


                                                               21

 1      Q.   And Doctor, did you see Ms. Thornton 

 2  again at a later date?

 3      A.   Yes, I did.

 4      Q.   And did she report to you whether or not 

 5  her injection had helped?

 6      A.   According to Ms. Thornton, she said it's 

 7  a hundred percent relief from the injections.

 8      Q.   And how long does relief from an 

 9  injection typically last?

10      A.   It really depends from patient to 

11  patient, so it depends how bad the problem is 

12  also.  It could last from months to even a year.  

13      Q.   And Doctor, after reviewing all of the 

14  diagnostic records and your own examination and 

15  also the prior records from the Rehab Center and 

16  UPMC, do you have an opinion to a reasonable 

17  degree of medical certainty what injuries 

18  Ms. Thornton suffered as a result of the motor 

19  vehicle accident of September 1st of 2016?

20      A.   Yes.

21      Q.   And what is that opinion?

22      A.   That Ms. Thornton has a cervical 

23  radiculopathy involving bilateral C5-6 and right 

24  C6-C7 nerve roots as well as cervical facet 

25  injury.


                                                               22

 1      Q.   And how can that occur in a motor vehicle 

 2  collision?

 3      A.   So usually when you get hit from behind, it could 

 4  damage the -- some of the cervical facet joints.  It could 

 5  cause some inflammation, and also it could irritate where 

 6  the nerve root also comes out in the cervical foramen and 

 7  it can irritate that nerve root there, because they are 

 8  very sensitive to any kind of pressure.

 9      Q.   And Doctor, what is your prognosis for 

10  Ms. Thornton?  

11      A.   Ms. Thornton's prognosis is guarded.

12      Q.   What does that mean?

13      A.   So guarded means like, you know, Ms. Thornton 

14  might need more injections down the road, as well as 

15  frequent follow-up just to make sure like, you know, it 

16  improves her quality of life.

17      Q.   And did you make any recommendations about any 

18  future medication treatment for Ms. Thornton?

19      A.   Yes.

20      Q.   And what were those?

21      A.   My recommendations for her is we can repeat the 

22  cervical epidural steroid injections.  Usually, as per my 

23  discussion with the patient, we usually do between three 

24  injections in a year.

25      Q.   And how long does someone typically need these 


                                                               23

 1  injections?

 2      A.   Usually there is no really specific time limit 

 3  but it can be undetermined.  Like, you know, it depends 

 4  how bad the problem and if it persists.

 5      Q.   And Doctor, would Ms. Thornton's age have 

 6  anything to do with her ability to recover or her 

 7  injuries?

 8      A.   It's going to be hard for her, because like, you 

 9  know, once you have a chronic problem, it's going to be 

10  there.  There will be times that her pain is going to be 

11  worse no matter what she's going to do.

12      Q.   And Doctor, you have performed cervical epidural 

13  steroid injections, as we discussed.  Could you estimate 

14  the cost of that treatment?

15      A.   The injection usually cost between $850 to 1,100 

16  per injection.

17      Q.   And are those cost projections based on your 

18  experience in a clinical outpatient and surgical setting?

19      A.   Yes.

20      Q.   Are your opinions about Ms. Thornton's future 

21  treatment held to a reasonable degree of medical 

22  probability?

23      A.   Yes.

24      Q.   And you have reviewed multiple treatment records 

25  for Ms. Thornton.  Do you have an opinion as to the 


                                                               24

 1  reasonableness and necessity of all of the treatment that 

 2  she has had to date?

 3      A.   Yes.

 4      Q.   And what is that?

 5      A.   That all of the treatment that Ms. Thornton 

 6  received up to this times are reasonable.

 7      Q.   And finally, Doctor, have you given all of your 

 8  opinions today to a reasonable degree of medical 

 9  certainty?

10      A.   Yes.

11           MS. CORBETT:  I would offer Dr. Olegario on 

12  cross.  

13                     CROSS-EXAMINATION

14  BY MR. BORSUK:

15      Q.   Good morning, Doctor.  I have a few questions I 

16  would just like to go over before we get into your 

17  reports.  You are a doctor for -- in layman's terms, you 

18  are a doctor for pain management; correct?

19      A.   Yes.

20      Q.   We can agree that pain generally is a matter is 

21  subjective?

22      A.   It's subjective, and then it could -- we try to 

23  incorporate with our physical findings.

24      Q.   Understood.  But there is no, for lack of a 

25  better phrase, painometer like there is so that you check 


                                                               25

 1  your heart rate or something like that; correct?  

 2      A.   That is correct.

 3      Q.   Doctor, in reviewing your report of November 13, 

 4  2018, did you personally write this report, sir?

 5      A.   Yes.

 6      Q.   Every aspect of it?

 7      A.   Uh-huh.

 8      Q.   Okay.  In your report and during your testimony 

 9  here, you make several statements regarding the 

10  plaintiff's position in the vehicle, wearing a seat belt 

11  and where the accident actually occurred as to the 

12  contact.  This information was provided to you by the 

13  plaintiff; correct?

14      A.   With the patients, yes.  

15      Q.   Okay.  And -- but you never saw the vehicle that 

16  was involved in the accident?

17      A.   The picture of the accident?

18      Q.   Yes.

19      A.   No.

20      Q.   And you never went to the scene of the accident?

21      A.   That is correct.

22      Q.   And at the time of this report you never saw the 

23  hospital records; correct?

24      A.   That is correct.

25      Q.   Do you remember when exactly you first saw the 


                                                               26

 1  hospital records?  

 2      A.   It was just sent to me last week.

 3      Q.   Okay.  So when you physically examined the 

 4  patient, Ms. Thornton, you still had not seen the hospital 

 5  records; correct?

 6      A.   At that time there is none.

 7      Q.   Okay.  Doctor, I want to go a little bit into the 

 8  medical records of Ms. Thornton and if you need to look 

 9  through your file to follow along.  It appear that her 

10  first chiropractic visit was on October 4, 2016.  Is that 

11  correct?  

12      A.   That is correct.

13      Q.   Okay.  And her next visit wasn't until January 

14  2017, three months later?

15      A.   From the chiropractor?  

16      Q.   From her first chiropractic.  

17      A.   I think she was seen every two days.

18      Q.   Every two days?

19      A.   Yes.  She has October 4th and October 6th.  Is 

20  that what you are asking?  

21      Q.   Yes; that's what I'm asking.

22      A.   Yeah.

23      Q.   So she was going every time?  

24      A.   Yes.  I think two to three times a week.

25      Q.   To the chiropractor?  


                                                               27

 1      A.   That is correct.

 2      Q.   Okay.  According to Ms. Thornton's records, 

 3  medical records, she was prescribed some pain medicine -- 

 4  medication; is that correct?  

 5      A.   She was given Ibuprofen which is a nonsteroidal 

 6  anti-inflammatory medication.

 7      Q.   Anything else other than the Ibuprofen?  

 8      A.   As far as I know, I think she was given also a 

 9  muscle relaxer, Flexeril.

10      Q.   Did she tell you if she ever took that 

11  prescription?

12      A.   Those are the prescription that was given to her 

13  when she went to emergency -- emergent -- Mercy ER.

14      Q.   And did -- Doctor, I will re-ask my question.  

15  Did she ever inform you if she took that medication?

16      A.   She did take the Ibuprofen.

17      Q.   The Ibuprofen.  But the muscle relaxer?  

18      A.   She didn't really mention that, but it was just 

19  in the records.

20      Q.   For someone who is suffering from the pain as she 

21  describes is it common to not take a muscle relaxer that 

22  has been prescribed to you?

23      A.   I do see a lot of patients that, you know, a lot 

24  of -- some of them they're not really pill takers because 

25  of the side effects, so it depends.  I do encounter a lot 


                                                               28

 1  of those.

 2      Q.   Doctor, you examined her on September 19, 2017; 

 3  correct?  

 4      A.   That is correct.

 5      Q.   And that is the first time you examined her?

 6      A.   That is correct.

 7      Q.   Did you examine her any time after that?  

 8      A.   The next time I did see her is October of 2018, 

 9  October 31st.

10      Q.   October 31st?

11      A.   That is correct.

12      Q.   We'll go back to the September 2017.  But  

13  October 20 -- or 31st, 2018 did you do a full physical 

14  examination?

15      A.   Yes, I did.

16      Q.   On September -- in September 2017 that was more 

17  than a year after the accident; correct?

18      A.   That is correct.

19      Q.   Okay.  And you reviewed all of her medical 

20  records?  

21      A.   I did.

22      Q.   And in those medical records there was an MRI 

23  that was taken of her lower lumbar back in February of 

24  2017?

25      A.   Yes.


                                                               29

 1      Q.   And that came back negative?

 2      A.   That's correct.

 3      Q.   But plaintiff at that time had been complaining 

 4  about her lower lumbar pain; correct?

 5      A.   She was.  She was.

 6      Q.   So the MRI came back negative and then an EMG was 

 7  also taken, correct, of the lower lumbar?

 8      A.   The lower extremities, yes.

 9      Q.   And that came back as negative as well?

10      A.   That's correct.

11      Q.   Doctor, is there any explanation as to why she 

12  was complaining of pain, although those two tests came 

13  back negative?

14      A.   Oh, yes.  I mean, from my experience in working 

15  as a pain physician for 16 years and even a physiatrist, I 

16  do encounter a lot of patients who are complaining and all 

17  of the tests were negative.  But as I do in my practice, I 

18  usually rely on my history and physical and all of these 

19  tests will just -- will only confirm my diagnosis, but I 

20  do encounter a lot of those.

21      Q.   They confirm your diagnosis.  And so, Doctor, can 

22  I ask then for your diagnosis, is your diagnosis that she 

23  is not suffering in her lower lumbar?

24      A.   In the lower back at that time -- okay.  When I 

25  did see the patient initially, she was complaining more of 


                                                               30

 1  her cervical spine, so I didn't really address her lumbar 

 2  spine.  But she did tell me, though, that she was having 

 3  pain in the lower back, but her neck pain was worse.  So 

 4  we try to explain to the patient that we will like to 

 5  concentrate in the area where is the worst problem.  So at 

 6  the time it was her cervical spine, so -- and in fact, it 

 7  was in my notes from my October of 2018 when she was 

 8  saying that she was complaining of her lower back, but I 

 9  don't have her records at the time, so I was trying to get 

10  her records and review the records, but her initial visit 

11  is more on the cervical spine.

12      Q.   So as I -- let me understand then, Doctor.

13      A.   Uh-huh.

14      Q.   In September of 2017 she complained -- I 

15  understand the cervical spine issue and you examined her 

16  for that, but she also complained of the lumbar, pain in 

17  her lower lumbar.  So you did not examine her?

18      A.   I did examine her.

19      Q.   Okay.  And what was your diagnosis from the 

20  examination in regard to her lower lumbar in September 

21  2017?

22      A.   At that time I don't have any diagnosis.  That's  

23  because, as I said, like, you know, she was complaining 

24  more on the cervical spine.  So I just defer for my 

25  impression at the time, but I was just discussing with the 


                                                               31

 1  patient that since her cervical spine is what's causing 

 2  her problem, so we will try to concentrate in that area 

 3  until her next office visit.  Then we can -- if the pain 

 4  in the lower back persist.  That's how I do it and then we 

 5  will just reevaluate and do any procedures if -- whatever 

 6  procedures we can do.

 7      Q.   So you examined her but did not make a diagnosis 

 8  on her lower lumbar?

 9      A.   Yes.

10      Q.   Even though you reviewed her records -- and back 

11  in February when she took the MRI, she complained of the 

12  lower lumbar was the greater issue?

13      A.   I think at that time I don't have, if I'm not 

14  mistaken, I don't have the records from the lower back.  I 

15  have mainly the cervical.

16      Q.   Okay.  So when you examined her in September of 

17  2017, you didn't have the MRI and the EMG of her lower 

18  lumbar?  

19      A.   I don't think so because it was -- I put that in 

20  off notes in her last office visit in October that I need 

21  to get her MRI for her lumbar spine as well as her EMG.  

22  So it means to say I don't have that in our files.

23      Q.   Did you ever obtain those documents -- you 

24  obtained those documents prior to the report; correct? 

25      A.   Yes.  I think after I did see the patient, yes, 


                                                               32

 1  after I have -- I have -- before I did this narrative 

 2  report.  That is correct.

 3      Q.   And you reviewed the EMG and MRI of her lower 

 4  lumbar?  

 5      A.   Yes, I did.

 6      Q.   And you saw that she was complaining 

 7  predominately of her lower lumbar, not of her cervical 

 8  back in February of 2017?  

 9      A.   No.  No.  2018.

10      Q.   What's 2018?

11      A.   The October.  That's where she was complaining 

12  more of the lower back.

13      Q.   I understand.  I understand, Doctor.  But if you 

14  look through the medical records, she was complaining of 

15  her lower lumbar more so in February 2017.  That's why an 

16  EMG and MRI was taken of it.

17      A.   Yes, but when I saw her in September of 2017, her 

18  pain is more on the cervical spine.  I mean, they -- it 

19  really depends.  Like sometimes when patients involved in 

20  a motor vehicular accident, if it involves both the lower 

21  back and the neck, there are some days that that one area 

22  is worse than the other area.  So -- but when I saw her in 

23  September, it was more on her cervical spine, so that's 

24  why we try to concentrate treating her cervical area than 

25  the lower back.


                                                               33

 1      Q.   So when you treat, you wouldn't treat both, even 

 2  though as you have just demonstrated to me today that in a 

 3  vehicular accident where there is a collision that a 

 4  patient could be suffering from cervical and lower lumbar, 

 5  and she explained both to you.  You only treat her for the 

 6  cervical?  

 7      A.   Yeah.  I mean, because -- first is we inject 

 8  steroids, so we don't want to load patients with steroids, 

 9  you know.  So -- and I usually ask the patient like, you 

10  know, where is the worst problem, is the cervical or lower 

11  back.  We usually do that, and at the time it was her 

12  cervical spine that was causing her most of her problems, 

13  so that's why we -- that's why I did the cervical epidural 

14  injections instead of the lower back.

15      Q.   Now, then you said you then saw her on     

16  October 31, 2018, the second time; correct?  

17      A.   That is correct.

18      Q.   And there you stated there was a lower lumbar?  

19      A.   At that time, yes, she was complaining more of 

20  her lower back.

21      Q.   More than her cervical?

22      A.   At that time, yes. 

23      Q.   Okay.  So in October of 2018 she was having more 

24  lower back, lower lumbar issues than her cervical spine in 

25  her neck?


                                                               34

 1      A.   Yes.  When I saw her, she was complaining more of 

 2  that.

 3      Q.   In October of 2018, did you ask her whether her 

 4  pain in her cervical spine was more or less than when you 

 5  had last seen her?

 6      A.   At the time -- let me see.  Her pain level was 5.  

 7  She was telling me it helps her but pain starts coming 

 8  back.

 9      Q.   Pain starts coming back.  I'm sorry.  Can you --

10      A.   Pain starts coming back in her cervical spine 

11  down to her arms and forearms into her hands.

12      Q.   Okay.  Now, why would -- what is your diagnostics 

13  for the pain that is going from her neck down into her 

14  hands, Doctor?

15      A.   I had her as cervical radiculopathy as well as a 

16  facet injury.

17      Q.   And that's based off of the EMG of her cervical 

18  spine?

19      A.   Based on the EMG as well as my history and 

20  physical exam.

21      Q.   Okay.  And that EMG -- and the report in regards 

22  to that EMG comes from Dr. Holding, dated August 30, 2017; 

23  correct?

24      A.   I'm sorry.  Which day again?

25      Q.   August 30, 2017.  


                                                               35

 1      A.   Yes.

 2      Q.   Okay.  And that was just -- and that was right 

 3  before you first physically examined Ms. Thornton?

 4      A.   Yes.

 5      Q.   In that report from Dr. Holding it stated that 

 6  she also suffered from mild bilateral carpal tunnel 

 7  syndrome, affecting sensory only the first digit.

 8      A.   Yes.

 9      Q.   What does that mean, Doctor?

10      A.   So carpal tunnel is usually around the wrist 

11  area, and then you manifest symptoms down to your fingers 

12  and index middle and half of your ring finger.

13      Q.   All right.  And how is carpal tunnel caused?

14      A.   Carpal tunnel sometimes it could -- it could 

15  affect a lot of ways, as long as it does pinch the medial 

16  nerve -- the median nerve.

17      Q.   Doctor, are the effects of carpal tunnel and 

18  radiculopathy, cervical radiculopathy, similar?  

19      A.   Not necessarily.

20      Q.   Well, in this instance, Doctor, since the 

21  plaintiff has complained of tingling or pain that would 

22  travel down through her fingers, that type of cervical 

23  radiculopathy, would that be similar to carpal tunnel 

24  syndrome?

25      A.   No, it's not, but here's the thing.


                                                               36

 1      Q.   How is it not?

 2      A.   If you look at the muscle -- I was just 

 3  looking at the EMG testing that was done by 

 4  Dr. Holding.  She did put some in some of the 

 5  muscles which is supplied by this nerve.  Okay?  

 6  And the median nerve it's basically around the 

 7  wrist area, and the cervical radiculopathy it 

 8  comes from the neck.  So there are some testing 

 9  that you can really try to differentiate between 

10  a radiculopathy and a peripheral neuropathy which 

11  is the carpal tunnel.

12      Q.   Okay.  Doctor, you and I can both agree 

13  that Dr. Holding did recognize there is carpal 

14  tunnel in plaintiff?

15      A.   There is in the sensory only.  So what 

16  does it mean?  Sensory is just the nerve 

17  conduction studies.  Nothing happened with the 

18  needle electromyography.

19      Q.   Okay.  And can you explain?  What do you 

20  mean by sensory only?  

21      A.   Sensory is the nerve conduction studies.

22      Q.   Yes.

23      A.   So when you -- the way you do it like 

24  you know, you feel some shocking in there.  And 

25  if it is positive, they try to record all of 


                                                               37

 1  this, and if it is positive, that's just mild, because 

 2  they have to combine that with the motor which is the 

 3  needle electromyography and then that becomes more 

 4  severe.

 5      Q.   Now, the MRI came back for the cervical spine as 

 6  negative.  And as I believe you explained, Doctor, that 

 7  an MRI represents or shows, it use magnets and 

 8  radio waves, and shows the status of the nerve, in this 

 9  case, in the neck, correct, in the spinal cord?

10      A.   It's more on the anatomy that causes some 

11  pathology around the cervical spine area.

12      Q.   What do you mean by anatomy surrounding the 

13  pathology -- or with the pathology?

14      A.   Anatomy means like, you know, let's say what's 

15  causing the problem from the cervical spinal area, from 

16  the nerve, the facet joint, even up to the spinal cord 

17  and even the muscle tissue too.  So it can detect all of 

18  those.

19      Q.   Is it common for there to be a divergence 

20  between the MRI and the EMG?  

21      A.   I'm sorry?  

22      Q.   Is it common for there to be a divergence 

23  between an MRI and EMG in a diagnosis?

24      A.   Yeah.  I mean, it could happen.  I mean, it 

25  could go both ways.


                                                               38

 1      Q.   I understand it could.  But is it common, 

 2  Doctor? 

 3      A.   I'm not so sure if it was, the percentage-wise, 

 4  but yes.  I'm not sure.  I'm not pretty -- so sure if 

 5  it's common or not, but it could happen.

 6      Q.   Doctor, do you know if the plaintiff is 

 7  continuing to go to see a chiropractor?  

 8      A.   I think the last time when I saw her she was 

 9  mentioning that 2017 was the last time, so I don't think 

10  she was -- she's seeing this chiropractor again.

11      Q.   Doctor, is it in your opinion beneficial for her 

12  to continue to go see the chiropractor?

13      A.   If the chiropractor helps her, yes, it could be 

14  beneficial, because chronic pain it comes and goes.

15      Q.   All right.  And Doctor, you and I can both agree 

16  that the biggest proponent in recovering from an injury 

17  like this is seeing the medical professionals that you 

18  have been told to go see; correct?

19      A.   Yes.

20      Q.   Do you know if she's taken any additional 

21  steroid injections, sir?

22      A.   Just per my recommendation the last time I saw 

23  her, that she has to make an appointment after reviewing 

24  all of her records.  Then that's where we can decide what 

25  kind of injections she's getting.


                                                               39

 1      Q.   So when was the last -- according to your 

 2  knowledge, when was the last time she took a steroid 

 3  injection?  

 4      A.   I just did one on her which is back in September 

 5  of 2017.

 6      Q.   Okay.  In 2017.  How frequently is she -- you 

 7  said about three a year; correct?

 8      A.   That is correct.

 9      Q.   And so she's then -- we are a year now.  In 2017 

10  we are two years; correct?  

11      A.   Yeah.  I mean, that's --

12      Q.   So she hasn't taken a steroid injection for two 

13  years?  

14      A.   Yes.  That's just based on my experience and 

15  that's just my recommendation.  So it's up to the 

16  patients to come and visit us again.  

17           MR. BORSUK:  All right.  I have no further 

18  questions.

19           MS. CORBETT:  Thank you.  Doctor, only a brief 

20  follow-up.

21                   REDIRECT EXAMINATION

22  BY MS. CORBETT:

23      Q.   We had talked about loading patients up with 

24  steroids, is how you had phrased it.  What are some of 

25  the side effects of the epidural steroid injections?


                                                               40

 1      A.   With the medication itself.  You know, I mean, 

 2  if you take a lot of steroids, it's not good for the 

 3  bones.  It can cause a lot of other problems also, and 

 4  also we have to ask if the patients are diabetic, because 

 5  sometimes their sugar goes up.  So we try not to load 

 6  with a lot of steroids and that's one of the reasons for 

 7  that, and also their adrenal glands, it could make some 

 8  problems with that also.

 9      Q.   And Doctor, did any of the questions by 

10  Mr. Borsuk change any of your opinions?

11      A.   No.

12           MS. CORBETT:  Thank you.  I don't have any 

13  further questions.

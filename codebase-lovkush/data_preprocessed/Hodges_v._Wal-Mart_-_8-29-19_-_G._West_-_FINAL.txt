0005
 1                       EXAMINATION
 2   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 3        Q    Mrs. West, we met off the record briefly,
 4   but for the record, my name is Jesse-Justin Cuevas.
 5   I represent the defendants in this case.
 6             And I'm going to refer to them
 7   collectively as Walmart.  Do you understand?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    So if I say "Walmart," I mean Walmart
10   Stores, Inc., Walmart Stores East, LP, and Walmart
11   Stores East, Inc., the named defendants.  Does that
12   make sense?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Please state your name for the record.
15        A    Gayla Howell West.
16        Q    And you are William Randolph West's wife,
17   correct?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    I understand that people called him
20   Randy.  Do you mind if I call him that, or would
21   you prefer Mr. West?
22        A    Randy's fine.  He would like that.
23        Q    I'm sorry that your husband was injured,
24   and I'm deeply sorry for your loss.  I really
25   appreciate you taking the time today to be here and
0006
 1   answer questions, and I understand that this may be
 2   difficult at times.
 3             Mrs. West, what is your current home
 4   address?
 5        A    63-A Myrtle Island Road, Bluffton.
 6        Q    For how long have you lived there?
 7        A    Four months, something like that.  I
 8   can't --
 9        Q    Do you remember the month of when you
10   moved there?
11        A    I think it was May, but I'm not real
12   sure.
13        Q    All right.  That's fine.  Have you been
14   deposed before, Mrs. West?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Okay.  How many times?
17        A    Once.
18        Q    And when was the last time, or that first
19   time that you were deposed?
20        A    This year sometime.  I can't remember.
21        Q    What was the nature of the case?
22        A    I don't know how to say it.  It was
23   Randy's estate against me, I guess is how you say
24   it.
25        Q    Okay.  And do you know the name of the
0007
 1   case?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    Do you have a copy of the transcript from
 4   your deposition?
 5        A    I do not.  Well, I do on my phone, so I
 6   guess I do.
 7        Q    Okay.  So you would be the best person to
 8   get in contact with, or your attorney, to get a
 9   copy of that transcript?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Have you ever testified in a court of law
12   or in an administrative proceeding under oath
13   before?
14        A    No.
15        Q    Okay.  But you understand that today
16   you're testifying under the penalty of perjury?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    And that even though there's not a judge
19   or a jury in this room, the testimony is the same
20   as if you were testifying before a judge or a jury
21   in a court of law, right?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    Can you think of any reason why you'd be
24   unable to give your full and honest testimony
25   today?
0008
 1        A    No, can't think of any reason.
 2        Q    So you're not under the influence of any
 3   medications that would prevent you from testifying
 4   fully and accurately today?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    Any drugs or alcohol?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    And do you have any medical conditions
 9   that might interfere with your ability to testify
10   truthfully and accurately today?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Okay.  A few ground rules, even though
13   you've been deposed this year.
14        A    Okay.
15        Q    As you know, there's a court reporter
16   here, so she's transcribing what we say, and for
17   that reason, it's important that we try not to talk
18   over each other.  I'm going to ask you to wait
19   until I finish my question fully before you answer.
20        A    Okay.
21        Q    And I will do the same -- and I will try
22   to do the same for you.  Does that make sense?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Okay.  Similarly, try to use yes/no
25   answers rather than nodding your head or shaking
0009
 1   your head or uh-huh/huh-uh.  That way it's easier
 2   for the court reporter to take down what we're
 3   saying.  Does that make sense?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    And there will be times when your
 6   attorney will object to a question.  That preserves
 7   the ability for them to challenge that testimony
 8   later.  But unless your attorney asks you or
 9   instructs you not to answer the question, you still
10   have to respond.  Does that make sense?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Okay.  Last, but not least, if you need
13   to take a break, we'll take a break.  We'll try to
14   take a break every hour or so anyway, but if you
15   need one, just let me know.  All I ask is that if
16   there's a question pending, that you answer the
17   question before you take a break.
18        A    Okay.
19        Q    Okay.  Along those same lines, you need
20   to ask me, not your attorney, if you don't
21   understand a question or if you need any
22   explanation of words or documents, things of that
23   nature.
24        A    Okay.
25        Q    If you don't tell me that you don't
0010
 1   understand, I'm going to assume that you do.  Does
 2   that make sense?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Did you do anything to prepare for
 5   today's deposition?
 6        A    I talked with my attorney.
 7        Q    Okay.  So you spoke with an attorney.
 8   Which attorney did you speak to?
 9        A    Dale Akins.
10        Q    And for how long did you meet?
11        A    About 30 minutes.
12        Q    When was that?
13        A    Yesterday afternoon.
14        Q    Did you meet here at the office?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Okay.  Did you review any documents to
17   prepare for today's deposition?
18        A    No.
19        Q    Okay.  So did you talk to anybody else
20   other than your counsel about the deposition today?
21        A    No.
22        Q    Okay.  I'd like to learn a little bit
23   more about you.  What's your date of birth?
24        A    September 12th, 1965.
25        Q    Okay.  I know a lady never tells, but
0011
 1   that makes you 54.  Is that right?
 2        A    I'll be 54.
 3        Q    All right.  Almost, right.
 4        A    Yeah.
 5        Q    My math is not so good.
 6        A    Don't make me 54 yet.
 7        Q    And where are you from, Mrs. West?
 8        A    Originally from Vidalia, Georgia.
 9        Q    Okay.  Where did you grow up?
10        A    Around that area, Johnson Corner,
11   Vidalia, Lyons.
12        Q    And when did you first move to Bluffton,
13   South Carolina?
14        A    Almost three years ago.
15        Q    Okay.  What brought you to -- what
16   brought you here?
17        A    Randy.
18        Q    Do you have any children, Mrs. West?
19        A    No.
20        Q    I want to talk a little bit about your
21   family background.  And I'm sorry to start off with
22   a sad memory, but I understand that your father
23   died in a fire-related incident.  Is that right?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    When did that happen?
0012
 1        A    2012.
 2        Q    And where was it?
 3        A    At his house.
 4        Q    Where is that?
 5        A    Oh, I'm sorry.  In Johnson Corner.  It's
 6   out in the country.
 7        Q    Okay.  And that's Georgia?
 8        A    Yes, Georgia.
 9        Q    Do you know what started the fire?
10        A    We're not real sure.  We thought that he
11   had -- he was working on a piece of big machinery,
12   and he was welding something on there, and he
13   forgot to turn the welder machine off, and when he
14   went to beating it down again, it sparked a fire
15   and consumed him -- or hit him.
16        Q    Was your father a welder?
17        A    No, not -- but he was self-taught.
18        Q    Okay.  Were you a witness to the
19   accident?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Were there any witnesses?
22        A    No.  My stepmother came out and found
23   him.
24        Q    I'm very sorry to hear about that.
25             Do you know -- it sounds like I know the
0013
 1   answer, but I'm going to ask anyway.  Do you know
 2   whether that accident involved any portable plastic
 3   fuel containers?
 4        A    I don't know.
 5        Q    Okay.  Do you know whether the accident
 6   involved gasoline?
 7        A    No.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.
 8        Q    Is there anything else that you can tell
 9   me about the incident that you haven't told me
10   about already?  No?
11        A    I don't know what you are looking for,
12   but --
13        Q    I'm just looking for whatever you know,
14   if there's anything else you know or recall hearing
15   about the incident that you haven't already told
16   me, so just let me know what that is.
17        A    Nothing.
18        Q    What's your stepmother's name?
19        A    Janice Howell.
20        Q    Where does she live currently?
21        A    At the same place that they lived in in
22   Johnson Corner.
23        Q    Mrs. West, what's your highest level of
24   education?
25        A    I have a diploma in accounts payable, and
0014
 1   I'm a phlebotomist.
 2        Q    Oh, wow.  I want to walk through your
 3   educational background a little bit briefly.
 4        A    Okay.
 5        Q    So you graduated from high school?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    And which high school did you graduate
 8   from?
 9        A    Reidsville High School.
10        Q    And is that in the Johnson Corner area of
11   Georgia?
12        A    It's in Reidsville, Georgia.
13        Q    Okay.  What year did you graduate high
14   school?
15        A    1983.
16        Q    Did you graduate from college?
17        A    Just a technical school.  I also
18   graduated with a diploma in 1983.
19        Q    1983?
20        A    With accounting.
21        Q    And is that an associates degree?
22        A    No.  They just called it a one-year
23   diploma back then.
24        Q    All right.  Where did you -- what
25   institution did you attend to get that one-year
0015
 1   diploma?
 2        A    Swainsboro Technical School in
 3   Swainsboro, Georgia.
 4        Q    All right.  Do you have any other
 5   postgraduate certifications?
 6        A    Just the phlebotomy.
 7        Q    Nothing else that you can think of that
 8   requires a special training or class to receive?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Do you currently work, Mrs. West?
11        A    I do.
12        Q    Where do you work?
13        A    In the warehouse at Spartina 449 in
14   Bluffton.
15        Q    What's your job title?
16        A    I am -- they call us pickers.  I fulfill
17   orders.
18        Q    Okay.  When you say "fulfill orders,"
19   what kind of orders are you fulfilling?
20        A    They make purses, bags, clothing.  I have
21   an order in my hand.  I have to go pick it, get it.
22        Q    Well, I hope you get a discount on some
23   bags.
24             Were you married when you were married to
25   Randy -- I'm sorry.  Were you working when you
0016
 1   were -- when you were married to Randy?
 2        A    Not at the time.
 3        Q    Okay.  So when was the last time that
 4   you -- strike that.
 5             When did you first start working in this
 6   warehouse?
 7        A    After Randy's death.
 8        Q    So November?
 9        A    It's March something.
10        Q    Okay.  So March of this year?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    And in between Randy's death and March of
13   this year, what did you do to support yourself
14   financially?
15        A    While I was married to Randy?
16        Q    In between his death and March, when you
17   started working at the warehouse, what was your
18   source of income?
19        A    He had -- people actually gave me money.
20        Q    And did you have any other sources of
21   income?
22        A    No.
23        Q    So you weren't married (sic) when you
24   were married to Randy.  What about before you were
25   married to Randy, did you work then?
0017
 1        A    I did.
 2        Q    And what did you do then?
 3        A    I was, gosh, I guess you call it office
 4   manager.
 5        Q    Where did you work?
 6        A    I can't recall the name of it now.
 7   Stephens Trucking Company.
 8        Q    And was that in Bluffton?
 9        A    In Lyons.
10        Q    In Lyons.  How long were you an office
11   manager at that place?
12        A    Unfortunately, only about two months.
13        Q    And before that, what did you do?
14        A    I worked at a drugstore.  I was -- I
15   helped the lady that -- people came in and bought
16   wheelchairs and things like that.
17        Q    Okay.  And that was also in Georgia?
18        A    Yes, Lyons, Georgia.
19        Q    And how long were you working at that
20   drugstore?
21        A    About a year and a half.
22        Q    Do you have any favorite hobbies,
23   Mrs. West?
24        A    I like to read and -- not right now, no,
25   I don't.
0018
 1        Q    Okay.  What do you like to read?
 2        A    Mysteries.
 3        Q    I want to talk to you a little bit about
 4   your relationship with Randy and a little bit about
 5   Randy himself.  And I understand that this might
 6   bring back some memories, so we're going to go at
 7   your pace.  Fair enough?
 8        A    Okay.  Thank you.
 9        Q    When did you first meet Randy?
10        A    2016, and it was -- I don't remember the
11   exact date.  It was about four or five months
12   before we got married.
13        Q    Okay.  Do you remember what time of year
14   it was when you met him?
15        A    No.
16        Q    Where did you meet him?
17        A    At -- it's called Red Wagon Market.  Him
18   and his partner had just bought it.
19        Q    Okay.  His business partner?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    And who was his business partner?
22        A    I can't recall that right now.
23        Q    Okay.  Was it a man?  A woman?
24        A    Man.
25        Q    Did this business partner work with Randy
0019
 1   in other --
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    -- ventures?
 4             Tell me what you -- maybe it'll come back
 5   to you when we're talking, and if it does, please
 6   let me know what his name was.
 7        A    Okay.
 8        Q    So Randy and his partner had just
 9   purchased this building?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Is it a building?  And is there a
12   business inside the building?
13        A    Yes.  It's antiques.  People go in and
14   rent booths.
15        Q    I love antiques.
16             So you and Randy got married four or five
17   months after you met.  When did you guys get
18   married?
19        A    October 1st, 2016.
20        Q    Did you and Randy live together before
21   you got married?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    So tell me a little bit about your
24   courtship.  Did you move to Bluffton immediately?
25   Was it after some time?  Tell me a little bit about
0020
 1   that.
 2        A    It was probably about a month before we
 3   got married is when I moved in.
 4        Q    Okay.  So you knew him for about four or
 5   five months before you got married, right?
 6        A    Yes.  I'm sorry.
 7        Q    It's okay.  And you moved in about a
 8   month before you got married?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    So the two of you lived together for, you
11   know, over -- a little over two years before the
12   incident occurred, right?
13        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
14        Q    Randy had grown children when you met?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    And he has two daughters.  Is that right?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Shellie West Hodges and Leigh West Brown.
19   Is that right?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Did Randy have any other children that
22   you knew of?
23        A    No.
24        Q    And you are aware that Shellie is the
25   named plaintiff in this lawsuit, correct?
0021
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    She represents your husband's estate.  Is
 3   that right?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Do you have a good relationship with
 6   Shellie?
 7             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 8             THE WITNESS:  No.
 9   BY MS. CUEVAS:
10        Q    Do you have a good relationship with
11   Leigh?
12             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
13             THE WITNESS:  I did one time, at one
14        time.
15   BY MS. CUEVAS:
16        Q    You did at one time.  When did you have a
17   good relationship with Leigh?
18        A    Before Randy's death.
19        Q    Okay.  Before Randy's death, did you
20   always have -- from the time you met Leigh until
21   his death, you had a good relationship with her?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    What, in your opinion, changed your
24   relationship with her?
25        A    The estate thing that we're going
0022
 1   through.
 2        Q    So you mentioned before that the estate
 3   sued you.  Is that right?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Okay.  And the estate sued you.  Who was
 6   representing the estate, if you know?
 7        A    Shellie.
 8        Q    Shellie.  Leigh was not representing the
 9   estate?
10        A    Well, I don't know how to answer that.  I
11   don't know the legalities of that.
12        Q    But the lawsuit -- or the issues, the
13   disputes that have arisen around his estate is
14   what's changed your relationship with Leigh.  Is
15   that fair?
16        A    Yes, her towards me.
17        Q    Her towards you.  Okay.  But your
18   relationship with Shellie, you just answered the
19   question no when I asked.  Did you and Shellie ever
20   have a close relationship?
21        A    It wasn't really close.
22        Q    Okay.  Were you fond of her?
23        A    I liked her.
24        Q    Do you think she was fond of you?
25        A    No.
0023
 1        Q    Randy had a sister, Barbara West Judson.
 2   Is that right?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    And do you know where she lives?
 5        A    Somewhere in Georgia.
 6        Q    Fair enough.  Do you know how old she is?
 7        A    She's younger than Randy.  That's all I
 8   know.
 9        Q    Do you know how much younger she is than
10   Randy?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Did you get along well with Barbara?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Do you still get along well with Barbara?
15        A    I don't talk to her anymore because
16   they've cut contacts.
17        Q    When did -- when you say, "They've cut
18   contacts," who cut contacts?
19        A    Randy's family.
20        Q    Randy's family.  When did that happen?
21        A    The estate -- what did you call it?
22        Q    The lawsuit.
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Okay.  And before there was a lawsuit
25   formally, when did the disputes arise related to
0024
 1   the estate that led to the deterioration of your
 2   relationship with Randy's family?
 3        A    When I got a lawyer.
 4        Q    And when was that?
 5        A    I don't really remember.  It was
 6   probably -- I'm not sure.
 7        Q    Did you get a lawyer after Randy's
 8   accident?
 9        A    Oh, yes.
10        Q    Okay.  Was it this year?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    So it was not in November or December of
13   last year?
14        A    No.
15        Q    Do you know Barbara's son, Clifton
16   Vaughan?
17        A    I don't know him very well, but I've met
18   him.
19        Q    Do you know where he lives?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Do you know how old he is?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Do you know if he has a background in
24   public safety?
25        A    I don't know.
0025
 1        Q    Do you know if Randy has any other
 2   siblings other than Barbara?
 3        A    Not that I know of.
 4        Q    Okay.  Now, when was Randy born?  What
 5   was his birthday?
 6        A    January 17th.
 7        Q    Do you know what year?
 8        A    I can't recall that right now.
 9        Q    Do you know how old he was when the
10   accident happened?
11        A    70.
12        Q    70.  Almost 71, it sounds like.
13        A    Yeah.
14        Q    All right.  Where did Randy grow up?  Do
15   you know?
16        A    In Georgia somewhere.
17        Q    Do you know if it was near where you grew
18   up in Georgia?
19        A    It wasn't very far away, I know that, but
20   I can't remember the exact town or anything.
21        Q    Okay.  When you say it wasn't very far
22   away, a couple hours driving distance?  Half an
23   hour driving distance?  If you recall.
24        A    No, I don't recall.
25        Q    What did Randy do for work other than own
0026
 1   a building?
 2        A    He was a contractor.
 3        Q    And did he own his own business?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Do you know what the name of the business
 6   was?
 7        A    Randolph West Builders.
 8        Q    And do you know if that business is still
 9   operating?
10        A    No, I don't, because Shellie has control
11   of that.
12        Q    Okay.  When you and Randy were together
13   before the accident, how involved, on a day-to-day
14   basis, was Randy with the business, if you know?
15        A    Daily, every day.
16        Q    And did that mean every day he was going
17   to a job site, for example?
18        A    Yes, the majority of the time.
19        Q    Okay.  Did he spend a lot of time working
20   on the books or in an office?  Do you know?
21        A    No.  He hated paperwork.
22        Q    So he was out in the field?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Okay.  And you mentioned that Randy had a
25   business partner.  Was that business partner
0027
 1   involved in the contracting company?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    Okay.  Did he have a business partner in
 4   his contracting company --
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    -- that would work on the books?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    Okay.  Do you know how much money Randy
 9   made per year while you were together?
10        A    No.
11        Q    You didn't work when you were married to
12   Randy.  Were you financially dependent on him?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    But you don't know how much money he
15   actually made?
16        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
17        Q    Okay.  And you have no personal knowledge
18   of his income during your marriage?
19        A    I mean, he would tell me a job, he got
20   this for a job, but I didn't keep up with it.
21        Q    Okay.  Do you know whether you and Randy
22   filed taxes jointly or separately?
23        A    The first year I didn't sign, and I think
24   I signed the second year.
25        Q    Do you have copies of those tax returns?
0028
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Do you know who does?
 3        A    Probably Shellie.
 4        Q    Do you know who prepared those tax
 5   returns?
 6        A    I can't think of the place's name.
 7        Q    But you went to an outside place to have
 8   those prepared?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Like an H&R Block/Turbo Tax kind of
11   place?
12        A    No.  It's an actual place.
13        Q    It was an accountant?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Do you know where Randy's tax returns
16   from before your marriage are located?
17        A    Shellie probably has them if she -- I
18   have nothing of it anymore.
19        Q    I understand.  Was Randy a general
20   contractor when you met him?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Do you know how long that's what he did?
23        A    A long time.
24        Q    Do you know how long he owned his
25   business?
0029
 1        A    The general contracting?
 2        Q    Correct.
 3        A    A long time.
 4        Q    Okay.  You mentioned that Randy owned a
 5   building.  Do you know if he owned any other
 6   properties?
 7        A    He owned the Red Wagon.
 8        Q    And that's the building you were talking
 9   about before?
10        A    Yes.  That's in Lyons, Georgia.
11        Q    Do you know if he owned any residential
12   properties?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Any other commercial properties?
15        A    The Chamber of Commerce in Bluffton,
16   South Carolina.
17        Q    Is that a building?
18        A    Yes.
19             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Excuse me, Counsel.
20        I'm having technical difficulties.  Can we go
21        off the record real quick?
22             MS. CUEVAS:  Absolutely.
23             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at
24        10:24 a.m.
25                  (Off-the-record discussion.)
0030
 1             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  On the record at
 2        10:25 a.m.
 3   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 4        Q    When we went off the record, you were
 5   testifying about how the Chamber of Commerce is a
 6   building that Randy owns.
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    And is that here in Bluffton?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Do you know of any other buildings or
11   properties, other than the Red Wagon and the
12   Chamber of Commerce, that Randy owned during your
13   marriage?
14        A    He owns what we call the tree farm, and
15   it's property, and I forgot the name, but it's in
16   South Carolina.  I want to say it's 16 acres, but
17   I'm not sure.
18        Q    So is it -- the tree farm you call it, do
19   you know what it -- is that what it is actually
20   called?
21        A    They used to grow Christmas trees on it,
22   but now they're like, you know, sky-high.  They're
23   not worth anything.
24        Q    Nobody's chopping them down and putting
25   them in their living room.
0031
 1             Any other buildings that you can recall
 2   that Randy owned, or properties?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    Do you know if he had any other sources
 5   of income other than his business and his
 6   properties?
 7        A    No, other than the Red Wagon.  That had
 8   just settled out.  I mean, it had just gotten to
 9   where it was bringing in a little bit, not much.
10        Q    Okay.  So when you say, "Settled out,"
11   you mean it was just starting to kind of get out of
12   the red?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    You mentioned that Randy was out in the
15   field while you guys were together for work.  Over
16   the years that you were with Randy, did he work
17   more overtime or less overtime?  In other words,
18   was he as busy before the accident as he was when
19   you first met him?
20        A    Yes, same.
21        Q    So he didn't seem to be slowing down at
22   all?
23        A    No.
24        Q    Okay.  Did you and Randy ever talk about
25   retirement?
0032
 1        A    Once or twice, but he kept saying he was
 2   going to have to push it off.
 3        Q    Did he say why he was going to push it
 4   off?
 5        A    Because Shellie wanted a house.
 6        Q    Okay.  The house that Shellie wanted, was
 7   that related to the fire of her previous -- of her
 8   home?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Okay.  So she wanted a new house?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    And it seems a little bit like you didn't
13   agree with that decision not to retire so that
14   Shellie could have a house?  Am I getting that
15   right?
16        A    Say that again.  I'm sorry.
17        Q    Sure.  You took a long time to say
18   that --
19        A    I just didn't want to say anything
20   negative about Shellie, but it's the truth.
21        Q    Understood.  Well, I appreciate it.  I
22   want you to tell the truth today.
23             Did you agree with the idea of Randy
24   pushing off retirement so that Shellie could have a
25   house?
0033
 1        A    I wanted him to do what he wanted to do.
 2        Q    When you said that you and Randy talked
 3   about retirement once or twice, but he kept saying
 4   he would have to push it off, what were your
 5   long-term plans for retirement when you did talk
 6   about it?
 7        A    Selling the properties and living off
 8   that.
 9        Q    Did you guys want to stay here in
10   Bluffton?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Okay.  Did you want Randy to retire?
13        A    I would have loved for him to have
14   retired.
15        Q    I'm sorry.  Can you repeat that?
16        A    I would have loved for him to retire.  I
17   wanted him to be able to relax.
18        Q    He worked hard?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    You testified a little bit about how you
21   like to read and that other than that, you don't
22   really have any other hobbies currently.  What were
23   the hobbies that you had, other than reading, when
24   you had other hobbies?
25        A    I went to the movies, I went shopping,
0034
 1   not necessarily buying, but shopping, visit
 2   friends.
 3        Q    So is it your testimony that you don't go
 4   to the movies anymore?
 5        A    Not like I did.
 6        Q    What do you mean?
 7        A    I don't really have the desire to do
 8   anything anymore.
 9        Q    But you still like to read mystery
10   novels?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Okay.  Do you still visit with friends?
13        A    At church.
14        Q    Do you go to church every week?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Do you visit with your friends outside of
17   church ever?
18        A    I'm beginning to now.
19        Q    Things are starting to get a little bit
20   back to normal?
21        A    Yeah.
22        Q    I'm happy to hear that.
23             When Randy was alive, what did the two of
24   you like to do together?
25        A    We built things.
0035
 1        Q    What kind of things did you build?
 2        A    He made my dresser, he made my bed, he
 3   made two coffee tables, or we did.
 4        Q    What were your distinct roles in that
 5   building process?
 6        A    I came up with most of the ideas, and he
 7   kind of did them.
 8        Q    And he put them together?  Would you draw
 9   it out?
10        A    We did them together.  No, he would draw
11   them out.  He's better at drawing than me.
12        Q    Okay.  But you would work on them
13   together?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    So he would be building something, and
16   you might make a suggestion of what to do next.  Is
17   that fair?
18        A    Yes, or he would make a suggestion.  I
19   mean, we did it together.
20        Q    Okay.  Are you -- do you -- are you a
21   builder?
22        A    No.  I'm more of a crafty person.
23        Q    Okay.  I like to DIY myself, so I
24   understand that.
25             Mrs. West, I would like to talk to you
0036
 1   about your husband's accident, and I understand
 2   that this also may be difficult, so again, we'll
 3   take it at your pace, and please let me know if you
 4   need a moment.
 5        A    Okay.
 6        Q    The accident occurred on the morning of
 7   Sunday, November 18th, 2018.  Is that right?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    And it occurred at your and Randy's home?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    And that is at 8 Myrtle Island Road in
12   Bluffton?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    That property has recently been sold.  Is
15   that right?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    Do you know when the property sold?
18        A    No.  I wasn't informed.  All I was told,
19   that it was sold.
20        Q    Do you know when the property was put up
21   for sale?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Now, you testified earlier that you moved
24   into your new place in about May.  Were you in the
25   home at 8 Myrtle Island Road before you moved into
0037
 1   your current home?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    Okay.  So you lived there through about
 4   May?
 5        A    Yeah.
 6        Q    Give or take?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    Okay.  And you were not involved in the
 9   decision to sell the property?
10        A    They did go through my lawyer and say,
11   "This is what we are doing."
12        Q    Okay.  So I'm going to take a step back
13   before we get into any further details.  You've
14   talked a little bit about the dispute with Randy's
15   estate.  Is that lawsuit over?
16        A    No.
17        Q    I take it Shellie controls the estate?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    Do you know who was involved in the
20   decision to sell the home?
21        A    No.
22        Q    You have no idea who was involved in that
23   decision?
24        A    No.
25        Q    You were home on the morning of the
0038
 1   accident.  Is that right?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    And you were home when the accident
 4   occurred, right?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Was anyone else at the house with you and
 7   Randy that morning?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    How was Randy feeling that day, the
10   morning before the accident, or the morning of the
11   accident?
12        A    Fine.
13        Q    And the two of you had gone to Lyons the
14   night before --
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    -- the accident.  Is that right?
17             What time did you return to Bluffton that
18   evening?
19        A    It was at night sometime.
20        Q    After dark?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Do you remember Randy not feeling well
23   the morning of the accident?
24        A    I think he was tired, you know, just
25   normal tired, getting going tired, in the morning
0039
 1   tired.
 2        Q    Do you know if Randy drank any alcohol
 3   that morning before the accident occurred?
 4        A    No, he did not.
 5        Q    Take any medications that morning?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Any drugs or substances that morning?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    Okay.  What about you?  Did you drink any
10   alcohol that morning?
11        A    No.
12        Q    You weren't on any substances, medication
13   or otherwise?
14        A    No.
15        Q    No?
16        A    No.  I'm sorry.
17        Q    That's okay.  It's a little awkward.  I
18   understand.
19             So tell me about your morning that day.
20   What time did you wake up?
21        A    We usually got up around 6:00.  I'm not
22   exactly sure that morning, but --
23        Q    On a Sunday, 6:00 a.m.?
24        A    Yeah.  We were both early.
25        Q    I am impressed.
0040
 1             So was Randy awake when you woke up, or
 2   the two of you woke up together?
 3        A    He was awake before me.
 4        Q    Did you wake up to an alarm?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    You just naturally wake up around 6:00?
 7        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
 8             MR. WRAY:  We need you to give a verbal
 9        answer.
10             THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Sorry.
11   BY MS. CUEVAS:
12        Q    That's okay.
13             What is the first thing that you remember
14   doing when you woke up that morning?
15        A    Giving him a kiss.
16        Q    And what is the next thing that you
17   remember doing that morning?
18        A    Coffee.
19        Q    Getting coffee.  How do you take your
20   coffee?
21        A    With cream.
22        Q    All right.  Did you have one cup or two
23   that morning?
24        A    Two.
25        Q    Do you have two every morning?
0041
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Me too.
 3             What's the very next thing that you
 4   remember doing after you had your morning coffee?
 5        A    We sat down at the kitchen table, like we
 6   always do, and just chatted about whatever.
 7        Q    Okay.  So you woke up, you gave Randy a
 8   kiss, and did you go downstairs to get coffee?  Is
 9   your room on the same floor as the kitchen?
10        A    No.  It's downstairs.  I mean, the
11   bedroom's upstairs.
12        Q    So you went downstairs --
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    -- and got a cup of coffee?
15             Did you make your own cup of coffee?
16        A    No.  He already made it.
17        Q    And you and Randy sat at the kitchen
18   table, you said?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    For about how long did you sit at the
21   kitchen table?
22        A    I'm not exactly sure.  I mean, could have
23   been 30 minutes, could have been an hour.  I don't
24   remember.
25        Q    What did the two of you talk about?
0042
 1        A    Just kind of what he was going to do for
 2   the day, what I was going to do for the day, just
 3   nothing important, everything in general.
 4        Q    Do you remember what he was going to do
 5   for the day?
 6        A    He was going to burn the pile of wood or
 7   whatever was back there.
 8        Q    And what about you?
 9        A    I don't remember.
10        Q    Now, you mentioned that Randy was going
11   to burn the pile of wood?
12        A    I don't know if it was wood or -- burn
13   the pile is what he called it.  I don't know what
14   all was in it.
15        Q    Okay.  And we'll talk a little bit about
16   that later.
17        A    Okay.
18        Q    You and Randy were sitting in your
19   kitchen 30 minutes to an hour, the best you can
20   recall?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Okay.  So that gets you to what, about
23   7:00 or so?
24        A    I don't know.
25        Q    When you were talking with Randy in the
0043
 1   kitchen about what he was going to do that day,
 2   what happened next?
 3        A    We both went outside and talked for a few
 4   minutes on the deck, and then for some reason, I
 5   followed him halfway out the yard, and I told him I
 6   loved him, and he went on out to burn the pile.
 7        Q    And what did you do?
 8        A    I went back up the stairs to the deck and
 9   heard the boom.
10        Q    Okay.  So I want to break that down a
11   little bit.
12        A    Okay.
13        Q    How did you and Randy end up on your back
14   deck from the kitchen?
15        A    What do you mean?
16        Q    I mean, how did you go from the kitchen
17   to your back deck?
18        A    There's a kitchen, a little bar area, and
19   then a door to the deck.
20        Q    And the door, are those French doors?
21        A    I guess that's what you call them.
22   They're glass.
23        Q    Two doors that open up?
24        A    Yeah, but just one of them opened.
25        Q    Okay.  And you went out right to the back
0044
 1   deck right there?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    What were you wearing that day?  Do you
 4   remember?
 5        A    No, but I usually wore old shorts and
 6   T-shirt.
 7        Q    No reason to believe there was anything
 8   different that day?
 9        A    Huh-uh.
10        Q    What about Randy?  What was he -- what
11   did he have on?
12        A    Jeans and a T-shirt.
13        Q    Same as usual?
14        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
15             MS. CUEVAS:  I am going to mark as
16        Exhibit 1 an aerial map of the property.
17                  (Defendant's Exhibit 1, Aerial Map
18             of Property, was marked for
19             identification.)
20   BY MS. CUEVAS:
21        Q    Now, I understand this representation may
22   be a little crude, but does it accurately represent
23   the property as you remember it on the morning of
24   the accident, November 18th, 2018?
25        A    Somewhat.
0045
 1        Q    Somewhat.  When you say "somewhat," what
 2   is not accurate, other than perhaps the scale?
 3        A    Well, it's just the bushes are further
 4   over here.
 5        Q    Okay.  Can you describe, when you say,
 6   "Further over here," where you're pointing to and
 7   what you mean?
 8        A    What is that right there supposed to be?
 9        Q    So I will get to all of that.
10        A    Okay.
11        Q    So let's look first at the house.
12        A    Okay.
13        Q    Okay.  Does the placement of -- there's a
14   circle and sort of a rectangle outside what is a
15   brick area outside the deck?
16        A    Uh-huh.
17        Q    That circle is a fountain?
18        A    Uh-huh.
19        Q    And that rectangle is a little garden?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    And does that seem to be in the right
22   place --
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    -- relative to the deck or the porch?
25        A    Yes.
0046
 1        Q    Okay.  Now, there's a black-striped
 2   rectangle in between the garden and the back porch
 3   there in that depiction.  It represents a bench.
 4   And I will just explain to you that Walmart has
 5   received two different sets of photographs of the
 6   property, and in one set there is a bench, and in
 7   another set there does not appear to be a bench.
 8             On the morning of the accident, was there
 9   a bench where that rectangle black-striped object
10   is?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Okay.  What about the tree stump?
13   There's sort of a -- back in the backyard, if you
14   look towards the end of the graphic, there is a tan
15   graphic that looks like it's got sort of three
16   round -- not corners, but three rounded circles
17   next to the pile that you pointed out earlier, and
18   that is supposed to be a tree stump that was in
19   photos that we received.  Is that an accurate
20   representation or about the right placement of
21   where you remember there being a tree stump in the
22   yard?
23        A    I don't remember a tree stump, unless
24   Shellie and them cut a tree down.  There wasn't a
25   tree stump.
0047
 1        Q    Okay.  There's no tree stump in the
 2   backyard?
 3        A    That I remember.  I mean, I really
 4   don't --
 5        Q    Okay.  That's all right.
 6        A    There was a tree right there in that
 7   area.
 8        Q    So there was a tree next to -- now, to
 9   the left --
10        A    No.  It was further back.
11        Q    Okay.  So where the trees are currently
12   in the back --
13        A    There was a tree further up.
14        Q    Okay.  I'm going to have you -- I'm going
15   to give you a pen, and I'd like for you to point
16   with your finger where there was a tree that you
17   don't see it on this map.  Point with your finger
18   first.
19        A    Oh, sorry.
20        Q    That's all right.
21        A    (Witness complies.)
22        Q    And now if you wouldn't mind just writing
23   with a T, using the pen that I just put in front of
24   you --
25        A    That might be where it is.  I'm not very
0048
 1   good at distance.  I don't remember, I mean.
 2        Q    But there was a tree that was grown?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    And it's different from the trees that
 5   are sort of lining the fence?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    So there was a tree -- between let's say
 8   the middle of the yard and the fence that surrounds
 9   the property, there was a tree that was there?
10        A    Yeah.  There was a tree somewhere in
11   there.  I don't remember a stump.
12        Q    Okay.
13        A    I don't know if they had it cut down.  I
14   don't know.
15        Q    Well, why don't you cross out the tree
16   stump with the pen, since you don't remember it
17   being there.
18        A    (Witness complies.)
19        Q    And if you're having issues, I can give
20   you another one.
21             Now, to the left of that stump is the
22   burn pile.  Is that an accurate representation to
23   you of approximately where the burn pile is in your
24   yard?
25        A    No.  It's more behind these palm frondy
0049
 1   things, it's more over here, and these were a
 2   little bit bigger.
 3        Q    So the trees that are --
 4        A    We couldn't see it from our porch, or our
 5   deck.  We couldn't see the burn pile.
 6        Q    Okay.  And I'm going to ask you a little
 7   bit about that.
 8        A    Okay.
 9        Q    So in your recollection, the burn pile is
10   a little bit, if you're looking at this image, to
11   the left?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    Why don't you go ahead and put a circle
14   around where you recall the burn pile being.
15        A    (Witness complies.)
16        Q    And you can put an X through the burn
17   pile that's there.
18        A    (Witness complies.)
19        Q    And you recall the frond, the palm fronds
20   that you called them, being fuller?
21        A    Uh-huh.
22        Q    Okay.  Now, the two trees that are
23   depicted here near the burn pile that are -- or in
24   front of the burn pile in your drawing, is there a
25   shorter plant in between -- was there a shorter
0050
 1   plant in between those trees on the day of the
 2   accident that you can't see in this aerial image?
 3        A    Just the palm fronds.  Is that what
 4   you -- that's what I'm talking about, yeah.
 5        Q    Okay.  So there were two trees that went
 6   up, and then there was palm fronds sort of in
 7   between in the middle?
 8        A    Yeah, or all around the -- I forgot
 9   that's a tree.  There's palm fronds in there.
10        Q    That's all right.  But the tree you
11   recall being fuller?
12        A    No, the palm fronds.
13        Q    The palm fronds were fuller?
14        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
15        Q    Okay, all right.  On the day of the
16   accident, do you recall there being two canoes in
17   the backyard, or boats in the -- not the big boat
18   that I know Randy had, but sort of small --
19        A    He had two canoes.
20        Q    Two canoes, okay.  Again, I will
21   represent to you that in two different sets of
22   photos -- in one set of photos, there is one canoe,
23   and in other set of photos, there are two.
24             If you look at this graphic, the sort of
25   eye-shaped images, those are the canoes and where
0051
 1   they were located in a set of photos that we
 2   received.  Are where those two canoes are, to the
 3   best of your recollection, where they were on the
 4   day of the incident?
 5        A    I don't recall.  I don't recall.
 6        Q    But you do remember there being two?
 7        A    I know he had two, but I don't know if
 8   they were there.  I don't remember if they were
 9   there.
10        Q    Okay.  That's okay.  All right.  And I
11   want you to keep this in front of you, but I am
12   going to introduce as Exhibit 2 another aerial
13   version as Exhibit 2.  I'm going to put it down
14   here so that it's not blocking anything.
15                  (Defendant's Exhibit 2, Zoomed-In
16             Aerial View of Property, was marked for
17             identification.)
18   BY MS. CUEVAS:
19        Q    Now, this is the same image, but zoomed
20   in, just showing the house and an aerial image of
21   your home on that date.  Would you agree with me
22   that this is a zoomed-in depiction aerial view --
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    -- of the property that we just looked
25   at?
0052
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Thank you.  And does it accurately
 3   represent the property as you remember it on that
 4   day?
 5             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 6             THE WITNESS:  As far as I remember.
 7   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 8        Q    Do you see that blue octagon sort of
 9   shape on the porch?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Was there a sun umbrella on your back
12   porch?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Was it in that spot?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    And was that umbrella in the center of a
17   table?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    Were there chairs around the table?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    How many chairs?
22        A    It was either six or eight.  I can't
23   remember.
24        Q    And can you point with your finger where
25   those chairs were on the morning of the accident,
0053
 1   as far as you remember?
 2        A    Just around it.  I don't know.
 3        Q    Were the chairs usually underneath, sort
 4   of, you know, pushed in to the table?
 5        A    No.  There was one with its back up
 6   against the deck railing, and I think there was --
 7   I don't know.  They were moved around a lot, so I
 8   can't really remember.
 9        Q    Well, try to remember what you recall the
10   morning of the accident, where the chairs were on
11   the deck.
12        A    I wasn't paying attention to that.  I
13   don't remember.
14        Q    Okay.  Well, there was a chair, you said,
15   that was up against the deck, right?
16        A    Most of the time it was -- it's back
17   against the deck railing.
18        Q    And can you think of any reason why it
19   wouldn't have been there that morning?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Okay.  Would you draw a little circle
22   onto the map where you recall the chair being.
23        A    (Witness complies.)
24        Q    Okay.  And the other chairs, to the best
25   of your recollection, do you remember them, where
0054
 1   they were on that morning?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    All right.  So this graphic, would you
 4   agree that it also represents covered areas of the
 5   porch?
 6        A    This is covered, yes.
 7        Q    So you're looking at -- just for the
 8   record, this light gray rectangle that is next to
 9   what looks like wooden slats, a wooden porch, that
10   is a covered area --
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    -- of the back deck?  Okay.
13             And what about if you're looking at the
14   image, there is also a light gray rectangle, same
15   color, that's closer to you from the umbrella.  Is
16   that also a covered area?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Okay.  And are there pieces of furniture
19   that were on the deck on the morning of the
20   accident under those covered areas?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    What kinds of furniture did you have on
23   the deck?
24        A    Had two chairs and a -- I guess you call
25   it a couch, outdoor couch --
0055
 1        Q    And that was --
 2        A    And a coffee table.
 3        Q    A coffee table, a couch, and two chairs.
 4   And were those on the side of the porch where the
 5   big gray rectangle is?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    Could you point with your finger for me
 8   where the coffee table was.
 9        A    (Witness complies.)
10        Q    Okay.  Next time point with your finger
11   first, but that's all right.
12             Could you point with your finger where
13   the couch was.
14        A    Right there.
15        Q    Now you can draw it for me.
16        A    (Witness complies.)
17        Q    And then there were two chairs, you said,
18   and if you could not write yet, but just point.
19        A    There might have been four.
20        Q    There could have been four chairs?
21        A    Sometimes we moved them.
22        Q    On that morning, what do you recall?
23        A    Four.
24        Q    Okay.  And where were those four chairs?
25        A    One, two, three, four.
0056
 1        Q    You can go ahead and put little circles
 2   around right there where you put them.
 3        A    (Witness complies.)
 4        Q    And what about on the other side of the
 5   porch that was covered, was there any furniture on
 6   that side?
 7        A    A table and four chairs.
 8        Q    A table and four chairs.  Before you mark
 9   it with the pen, would you just tell me where they
10   were?
11        A    Table and four chairs.
12        Q    And that's in sort of the corner?
13        A    Yeah.
14        Q    Okay.  Why don't you go ahead and mark
15   the graphic.
16        A    (Witness complies.)
17        Q    And that circle that you made on the
18   inside, is that where the table was?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    Could you make that a square for me so I
21   can tell the difference.
22        A    (Witness complies.)
23        Q    I appreciate it.  Now, you said earlier
24   that you and Randy went out to the back porch.
25   Where were you?
0057
 1        A    On the deck.
 2        Q    You were on the deck where the wooden
 3   part is?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Okay.  Point, please, with your finger or
 6   with the pen, but not with the pen out, where you
 7   were on the deck that morning when you and Randy
 8   first went outside onto the porch.
 9        A    I don't know.  We just walked out here,
10   walked down the steps, and I came about right here.
11        Q    Okay.  So you didn't stop on the porch at
12   any point?
13        A    Huh-uh.
14        Q    Okay.  Why don't you with your -- one
15   more time with your finger show me, or with the
16   pen, but without the point out, how you walked out
17   into your backyard, from the porch to the backyard.
18        A    (Witness complies.)
19        Q    Okay.  So you walked out your kitchen?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Into that little bar area?
22        A    Uh-huh.
23        Q    And through the one door onto the back
24   porch?
25        A    Well, we might have come over here, or we
0058
 1   might have come over here, I don't remember, but we
 2   came out about right here.
 3        Q    All right.  So I'm going to break that
 4   down a little bit for us.  So if you would, please,
 5   just draw where you came -- just a line from your
 6   kitchen to when you first went out to your back
 7   porch, the best you remember.
 8        A    (Witness complies.)
 9        Q    Okay.  You can stop.
10             So you mentioned that you don't recall
11   whether you went down through the fountain or to
12   the left of the garden or to the right of the
13   fountain when you walked into your backyard, but do
14   you remember which set of stairs you took?
15        A    These.
16        Q    The main ones in the center.  Okay.
17             What were you and Randy doing while you
18   walked out onto the porch?
19        A    Chatting.
20        Q    Do you remember what you were talking
21   about?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Okay.  Do you remember if you were
24   holding anything?
25        A    No, we weren't.  We were not holding
0059
 1   anything.
 2        Q    So you already drank your coffee, you
 3   didn't have your coffee in your hand anymore?
 4        A    Huh-uh.
 5        Q    Okay.  And about how long did it take you
 6   to walk from your kitchen just to the outside, your
 7   back porch?
 8        A    A minute.
 9        Q    A minute.  All right.
10        A    Two.
11        Q    A minute or two?  Yes?
12        A    I don't recall.  I mean, I would be
13   guessing.
14        Q    Well, I'm entitled to your best answer.
15        A    A minute or two, I guess.
16        Q    Okay.  A minute or two.
17             Now, when you guys walked from your back
18   porch down the main steps in the front to that
19   brick part of -- the part that surrounds the porch,
20   did you guys stop at any point?
21        A    We stopped around somewhere in here.
22        Q    And you're pointing to where the --
23        A    The grassy area.
24        Q    The grassy area near the fountain and the
25   garden?
0060
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Okay.  Where, to the best of your
 3   recollection -- if you want, you can look at the
 4   bigger map if this smaller map does not sort of
 5   show where you were.  To the best of your
 6   recollection -- just point, don't mark -- where you
 7   and Randy stopped.
 8        A    Somewhere around in here.
 9        Q    Okay.  I would like for you to put a one
10   where you remember you were.
11        A    (Witness complies.)
12        Q    Okay.  Now, at that point when you
13   stopped, what could you see when you stopped right
14   there?  What direction were you facing?
15        A    I don't recall.  I don't remember.
16        Q    When you were walking, do you remember if
17   Randy was to your right or to your left?
18        A    My left.
19        Q    He was on your left-hand side.  So when
20   you stopped, was he also on your left?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Would you put a two where you remember
23   Randy standing.
24        A    (Witness complies.)
25        Q    Okay.  Now, when you were standing in
0061
 1   those -- in that place, about how long did you stop
 2   right there?
 3        A    A couple of seconds.
 4        Q    A couple of seconds.  Did you talk about
 5   anything specific while you were standing there?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Do you remember why the two of you
 8   stopped right there?
 9        A    Because I wasn't going any further.  I
10   just walked him out there halfway.
11        Q    Okay.  At that point when you stopped and
12   you weren't going to walk any further, did you say
13   anything to Randy?
14        A    Just told him I loved him.
15        Q    And did he say anything to you?
16        A    "Love you."
17        Q    Did he tell you that he was going to go
18   light the burn pile?
19        A    I don't -- I don't remember.  I really
20   don't.
21        Q    Okay.  Now, earlier you testified that
22   when the two of you were in your kitchen, you were
23   talking about what you were going to do that day,
24   right?
25        A    Uh-huh.
0062
 1        Q    Yes?
 2        A    Yes.  Sorry.
 3        Q    That's all right.  And he mentioned that
 4   he was going to light the burn pile?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    And that's when you were in your kitchen?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    When you were on your back porch
 9   walking --
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    -- did he again mention that he was going
12   to light the burn pile?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Okay.  And when you were standing in that
15   spot where you've marked, did he say anything about
16   lighting the burn pile?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Did you say anything to indicate to Randy
19   that you were not going to walk any further with
20   him into the backyard?
21        A    No.  I mean, he knew I had stuff I wanted
22   to do, so --
23        Q    What did you want to do that day?
24        A    I don't remember, but I know I did.
25        Q    Okay.  So you don't remember any
0063
 1   specifics about what the two of you were talking
 2   about --
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    -- while you walked from your kitchen
 5   into that spot --
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    -- on your yard?  No?  Okay.
 8             When you stood there with Randy, do you
 9   remember if you were facing him?
10        A    No, I don't remember.
11        Q    Do you remember if you were looking into
12   your yard, standing side by side?
13        A    No.
14        Q    So you don't remember anything about what
15   you could see when you were standing in that
16   location?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Do you keep a journal or anything like
19   that?
20        A    I did at one point, one time.
21        Q    When?
22        A    Before Randy passed.
23        Q    Okay.  Is there anything that you've
24   written down about what you and Randy talked about
25   that day before walking out into the yard?
0064
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    So there's nothing that you could consult
 3   to sort of make yourself remember better --
 4        A    Huh-uh.
 5        Q    -- what happened?
 6             Okay.  You said you stood in that
 7   location for a couple of seconds.  Is that right?
 8        A    Yes.  Sorry.
 9        Q    You told Randy you loved him?
10        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
11        Q    And then what happened?
12        A    He turned around to go towards the burn
13   pile, and I turned around to go up the steps to get
14   back in the house.
15        Q    Okay.  So at that point, he turned to go
16   walk further into the yard?
17        A    Or he went to leave, I mean.
18        Q    Okay.  Well, you said that he turned to
19   walk into the yard, and you turned to go into the
20   house, so then is it fair to say that the two of
21   you were looking at -- standing facing each other
22   when you were out in the yard?
23        A    Maybe we were.  I'm sure we were, I mean.
24        Q    Okay.  It's likely that you were looking
25   at each other?
0065
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Okay.  He walked toward the yard, and you
 3   turned around and walked back inside the house?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    No.
 6        A    I was going up towards the steps to the
 7   deck.
 8        Q    Okay.  Maybe I was unclear.  So you two
 9   were standing where you have marked one and two?
10        A    Uh-huh.
11        Q    He turned to walk toward the backyard?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    You turned to walk toward your house?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Okay.  And you took the -- which set of
16   stairs did you take back up?
17        A    The large ones.
18        Q    The large ones in the middle?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    Okay.  Did you stop on the deck anywhere
21   while you were walking back towards your home?
22             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
23             THE WITNESS:  I thought he said
24        something.  I'm sorry.
25             When I -- I stopped to turn around to

 1        look at just the yard, I don't know why, and
 2        then when I turned back around, I heard the
 3        boom.
 4   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 5        Q    Okay.  So where were you when you stopped
 6   to turn around and look at your yard again?
 7        A    On the deck.
 8        Q    Would you please write a three on the
 9   large zoomed-in map where you were.
10        A    Somewhere around here.
11        Q    Okay.  So you stopped there.  For about
12   how long did you stop there?
13        A    Just a second, just to turn around and
14   look.
15        Q    And when you turned around --
16        A    And when I turned back around, boom.
17        Q    Okay.  Before we get to the boom, you
18   were standing, and you were facing your house when
19   you got up onto the deck, correct?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    And then you turned to look outside onto
22   your yard, right?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Did you keep -- did you turn your whole
25   body around to look at your backyard?
0067
 1        A    I don't know.  I don't even know what
 2   made me turn around.  I'm assuming I did turn
 3   around.  I don't know.
 4        Q    So you don't remember turning around to
 5   look at your -- at your backyard?
 6        A    No.  I'm assuming I turned my whole body.
 7        Q    Okay.  So you think you turned your whole
 8   body around, not just looking over your shoulder?
 9        A    Yeah.
10        Q    Okay.  And you looked at the backyard.
11   For about how long did you turn and look at your
12   backyard?
13        A    Just scanned it, because sometimes I
14   would look to see what I needed to do in the yard,
15   because I did yard work.
16        Q    Okay.  So is that a couple seconds?
17        A    Yeah.
18        Q    Okay.  And then you turned back towards
19   your house?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Okay.  And were you walking toward your
22   house when you heard the boom?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Okay.  Which door were you going to go
25   into your house through?
0068
 1        A    The kitchen.
 2        Q    So you were at the three when you stopped
 3   and you turned around and you looked at your yard
 4   for a few seconds.  You turned back around towards
 5   your house?
 6        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
 7        Q    When you turned back around towards your
 8   house, did you immediately start walking, or did
 9   you stop where you were once you turned back around
10   before you started walking?
11             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
12             I'm objecting to the form of her
13        question.  You can still answer it if you
14        understand it.
15             MS. CUEVAS:  Thank you.
16   BY MS. CUEVAS:
17        Q    Let me see if I can ask the question in a
18   way that might be a little bit more clear to what
19   I'm asking.
20        A    Yes, please.
21        Q    You turned back around after you scanned
22   your yard.  Did you turn and walk at the same time?
23        A    I don't -- I don't recall.  I don't -- I
24   don't recall.  I really don't.
25        Q    Okay.  That's okay.  I'm just going to
0069
 1   ask what you do remember.
 2        A    Okay.
 3        Q    Okay.  So you turned back around, and you
 4   started to walk into your house through that open
 5   door that leads into the bar area and kitchen,
 6   right?
 7             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 8             THE WITNESS:  I didn't get there, but
 9        yes, I started going that way.
10   BY MS. CUEVAS:
11        Q    And so that's the direction that you were
12   walking in?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Okay.  Where were you -- point, don't
15   mark -- when you heard the boom?  Point, don't
16   mark, if you don't mind.
17        A    I couldn't have been there when I turned
18   around to look because that's kind of where I was
19   when I heard the boom.
20        Q    Okay.  So where the three is is about
21   where you were when you heard the boom?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    So where did you stop and turn around to
24   look at your property?
25        A    Around in here on the steps.
0070
 1        Q    So you remember being on the steps --
 2        A    Yeah.
 3        Q    -- when you turned around and looked at
 4   your property?
 5             What is it that you've just remembered to
 6   change your -- to change your recollection?
 7        A    Because I wasn't up in here when I heard
 8   it.  I was here.
 9        Q    So your testimony is that you were
10   standing on the wooden deck --
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    -- outside of the covered area --
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    -- of the house?
15        A    When I heard it.
16        Q    When you heard the boom.  Okay.
17             Point again to where you think that you
18   were when you stopped and you turned and looked at
19   your property.
20        A    Somewhere in here or here.
21        Q    So you were either on the brick ground?
22        A    Yeah.
23        Q    Or the stairs?
24        A    Yeah.
25        Q    The best that you can recall, were you on
0071
 1   the brick, were your feet on the brick, or were you
 2   standing on a staircase?
 3        A    On the brick, because I remember going up
 4   the stairs.  Yes, I was on the brick.
 5        Q    Okay.  So could you write "2.5" where you
 6   were on the brick.
 7        A    Sorry.
 8        Q    That's okay.  And if at any point you
 9   need to correct your testimony, you just tell me,
10   okay.
11        A    Okay.
12        Q    We want to understand what happened to
13   the best of your recollection.
14             Okay.  So you were standing on the brick
15   looking at your property.  What did you see from
16   where you were standing when you looked at the
17   yard?
18        A    I always looked at my garden.  There were
19   potted plants all through here.  I looked at all of
20   them.
21        Q    So you looked at the potted plants that
22   were on the brick?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    And it lined the brick?
25        A    Pretty much all the way around.
0072
 1        Q    All the way around the deck or just in
 2   that front area of the -- of the brick?
 3        A    Right in here, the brick area.
 4        Q    Okay.  Do you remember about how many
 5   potted plants there were?
 6        A    Six or seven.  I'm not sure, can't
 7   remember.
 8        Q    Okay.  And with the potted plants, did
 9   the potted plants go in front of the steps as well,
10   or were they on either side of the steps on the
11   brick?
12        A    There wasn't any on the side of the
13   steps, potted plants.
14        Q    Okay.  If you could point with your
15   finger or the pen without the ink out where the
16   potted plants were.
17        A    Let's see.  One, two -- that wasn't
18   there, so it'd be five -- somewhere in there.
19        Q    Okay.  Why don't you draw little circles
20   where you remember them being, to the best of your
21   recollection.
22        A    (Witness complies.)  I think.
23        Q    Okay.  So you stood where that
24   two-and-a-half, 2.5, is.  You looked at your
25   garden.  You looked at your plants.  Did you look
0073
 1   at anything else?
 2        A    Huh-uh.
 3        Q    From where you were standing, could you
 4   see Randy?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    So when you left where you were standing
 7   at one, and Randy was at two, Randy continued to
 8   walk into the yard.  And we'll talk in a second
 9   about what you did see.
10        A    Okay.
11        Q    You turned around, walked to the 2.5, and
12   by the time you got to the 2.5 and turned back
13   around, you could not see Randy?
14        A    No.
15        Q    No, you could not?
16        A    I could not see him.  I'm sorry.
17        Q    Okay.  When you were standing at the one,
18   and Randy was standing at the two, and you turned
19   to walk in towards the house, what, if anything, of
20   Randy could you see when he walked to the yard?
21        A    Say that again.  I'm sorry.
22        Q    Sure.  That's okay.  When you were
23   standing at the one, and Randy was standing at the
24   two, before you turned your back to the backyard,
25   did you see Randy walk toward the backyard?
0074
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    So you both turned, essentially, to walk
 3   in opposite directions at the same time?
 4        A    Yeah, basically.
 5        Q    And you couldn't see where Randy walked
 6   into the backyard?
 7             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 8             THE WITNESS:  I remember seeing his arm
 9        before I turned around.
10   BY MS. CUEVAS:
11        Q    Which arm?
12        A    I don't know, must have been his right
13   arm, around the bushes.
14        Q    Around the bushes?
15        A    Yes.  So he was already back there before
16   I moved.  I mean, I --
17        Q    So he was at the two, and you saw his
18   right arm before you turned around?
19        A    Uh-huh.
20        Q    From behind the bushes?
21        A    Well, it's like he came around when he
22   was walking around.
23        Q    Okay.  If you could, point with your
24   finger, not the -- not the actual ink, how he
25   walked from the two into the backyard.
0075
 1        A    Just right around here.
 2        Q    Okay.  Would you draw from the two to
 3   where you last saw him, before you turned around,
 4   with a line or, you know, what his path was as you
 5   recall?
 6             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 7             THE WITNESS:  These trees mess me up
 8        because I can't get around.
 9   BY MS. CUEVAS:
10        Q    Well, you can draw through the trees.
11        A    Okay.
12        Q    We know that the trees are an aerial
13   image of the tree, so --
14        A    I kind of saw his arm before it went
15   around.
16        Q    Okay.  Did you see him do anything?
17        A    No, because once he got past those palm
18   trees, you can't see anything.
19        Q    You can't see.  So that's when you were
20   standing at the one, and then you turned around,
21   and you walked to the brick where you were standing
22   at the two-and-a-half?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Okay.  And when you turned around at the
25   two-and-a-half, you could not see him?
0076
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Okay.  About how long did you stand at
 3   the one before you turned around to walk inside?
 4        A    I don't know.
 5        Q    Is Randy a fast walker?
 6        A    Yeah.  He walked everywhere fast.
 7        Q    But you were standing there long enough
 8   for him to walk into the yard and around the front
 9   of the palm fronds?
10        A    Uh-huh.
11        Q    Now, it sounds like in between those
12   trees that you said it's hard to draw and that
13   structure there at the end of the driveway, is
14   there space there for you to pass through?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Okay.  Do you recall was Randy under a
17   covered area of that structure?
18        A    No.
19        Q    No.  Okay.  So when you saw him, you saw
20   his right arm, because he walked back around the
21   tree facing where this canoe is in this image, not
22   necessarily where it was on the day of the
23   accident.  Is that right?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    Okay.  You stood at the two-and-a-half
0077
 1   for a few seconds, turned back inside -- toward the
 2   inside, walked up the stairs, and you were at the
 3   three when you heard the boom?
 4        A    Yeah, give or take.
 5        Q    When you say "give or take," we can --
 6        A    I know that I was on -- in the middle of
 7   the deck somewhere.
 8        Q    Okay.  When you heard the boom, take a
 9   moment and think about what you saw when you heard
10   the boom, not when you turned around or what you
11   did next, but when you heard the boom, what were
12   you looking at in your house or on your property?
13        A    This furniture, whatever, under the deck.
14        Q    Okay.  So you were facing the open area
15   of the deck?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    Okay.  So if I were to stand say where
18   the fountain is and look at the back deck, you were
19   profile, looking to the side?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Okay.  And that's when you heard the
22   boom?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    After you heard the boom, what did you do
25   next?
0078
 1        A    Turned around, and Randy was walking
 2   across the yard.
 3        Q    Okay.  So when you say "turned around,"
 4   you were facing the furniture under that covered
 5   portion of the deck.  Did you turn towards your
 6   left shoulder?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    Okay.  You turned towards your left
 9   shoulder.  Where was Randy when you first turned
10   and saw him in your yard?  If you could point with
11   your finger, not the ink, as to where he was.
12        A    He had run around here, so he was about
13   right here, give or take.  I don't know the
14   distance, I mean, but he was somewhere in here.
15        Q    So he was closer to you than the trees,
16   than those two trees that are right there?  Where
17   the palm fronds are, or palm frond is, he had
18   passed the palm fronds when you saw him?
19        A    Just a little.
20        Q    Just a little.  Would you please write a
21   four where you saw him.
22        A    (Witness complies.)
23        Q    Okay.  So that's where he was when you
24   first saw him.  And you said he was walking across
25   the yard?
0079
 1             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 2             THE WITNESS:  He wasn't really walking,
 3        he was running.
 4   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 5        Q    Okay.  In what direction was he running?
 6        A    Towards the house.  I kept yelling for
 7   him to lay down, roll over, and I was screaming,
 8   "Help me."
 9        Q    Okay.  When you turned around and looked
10   out into the yard and saw him and he was running,
11   how -- he was running towards the house.  About how
12   far had he run towards the house from where he was
13   when you first saw him before you yelled for him?
14        A    I don't know.
15        Q    Okay.  Did he get to the brick?
16        A    No.
17        Q    Okay.  Did he get very far past where he
18   was when he was running towards the house?
19             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
20             THE WITNESS:  He got around here
21        somewhere.  I don't know.
22   BY MS. CUEVAS:
23        Q    So he got pretty close to where the two
24   of you were standing before you turned to walk back
25   inside the house?
0080
 1             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 2             THE WITNESS:  I don't know.  I don't
 3        know.
 4   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 5        Q    Okay.  Well, you pointed to a location on
 6   the map to about where he got to.
 7             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 8             THE WITNESS:  I would be guessing.  I
 9        don't know.
10   BY MS. CUEVAS:
11        Q    You saw Randy running towards the house,
12   right?
13        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
14        Q    Okay.  The best of your recollection,
15   where did he run to, pointing with your finger?
16             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
17             THE WITNESS:  I don't know, somewhere in
18        here.
19   BY MS. CUEVAS:
20        Q    Why don't you, if you would feel better,
21   to circle the area about where you think that he
22   was at that time.
23        A    I don't know.
24        Q    Well, you pointed to some places on the
25   map where you believe that he was.
0081
 1             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form, if that
 2        was a question.
 3             MR. AKINS:  Yeah.  I object to the form
 4        as well.  She pointed to --
 5   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 6        Q    You've pointed to a few different places,
 7   so please write where you recall that he was when
 8   he was running toward the house.
 9             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
10             THE WITNESS:  I don't know.
11   BY MS. CUEVAS:
12        Q    And feel free to draw a circle around the
13   area where you best recall, and then we'll take a
14   break.
15        A    It could have been here.  It could have
16   been here.  I don't know.
17             MS. CUEVAS:  Okay.  Let's go ahead and
18        take a break.
19             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the end of
20        Media Number 1 in the deposition of Gayla
21        West.  We are off the record at 11:22 a.m.
22                  (A recess transpired.)
23             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the beginning
24        of Media Number 2 in the deposition of Gayla
25        West.  We are on the record at 11:34 a.m.
0082
 1   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 2        Q    Mrs. West, when we went off the record,
 3   we were talking about what happened after you heard
 4   the boom.
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Okay.  Now, before I get into some
 7   questions about what happened next, before the
 8   boom, did you see whether the burn pile was lit?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    When you turned back around, did you
11   notice that the burn pile was lit?
12        A    No.  I didn't pay any attention.  I was
13   mainly looking at the flowers and stuff down here.
14        Q    Okay.  So do you know of -- do you know
15   whether there was a fire in the backyard before the
16   accident actually happened?
17        A    That morning?
18        Q    Yes.
19        A    Oh, no, there wasn't one.
20        Q    There was not one, okay.  And did Randy
21   ever tell you that he was going to go light a fire
22   before you guys were together on the porch?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Okay.  But you don't know if he actually
25   lit the fire?
0083
 1        A    That morning?
 2        Q    That morning.
 3        A    I'm assuming he did, because it blew up,
 4   I mean.
 5        Q    Okay.  But you didn't -- you didn't see a
 6   fire actually burning before the boom?
 7        A    No, because the bushes.
 8        Q    Okay.  At any point after you woke up and
 9   before you and Randy went out onto the back porch,
10   did he at any point tell you that he went outside
11   and actually lit the fire?
12        A    No.
13        Q    Okay.  And was there a time in the
14   morning, before the two of you were in the kitchen
15   and then outside, where he would have had an
16   opportunity to go outside and light the burn pile?
17        A    He could have before I got down, I guess,
18   but why would he say he was going to go burn the
19   pile if he had already lit it?
20        Q    Well, I'm just asking if you know whether
21   he had already started a fire at any point.
22        A    Not that I know of.
23        Q    Okay.  Not that you know of.
24             So getting back to your hearing the boom,
25   you are at the spot marked Number 3, you're facing
0084
 1   the furniture under the covered area of the porch,
 2   correct?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Okay.  You hear the boom, and you turn to
 5   look at Randy, right?
 6        A    I just turned around to see what was
 7   going on.
 8        Q    And you saw Randy?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Okay.  And he was in or around the area
11   marked as Number 4 when you first saw him?
12        A    All this is guessing, but I guess.
13        Q    So the best of your recollection, he was
14   in the area slightly in front of the palm frond
15   trees in the backyard?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    What happened next after you turned
18   around and saw Randy running around in the
19   backyard?
20        A    I went running towards him.  He was
21   coming towards me.  And I kept yelling and
22   screaming, "Somebody help me.  Randy, get down on
23   the ground and roll over."  I freaked out.  I ran
24   into this little place, I don't know, to get
25   something to help him get the fire out, and I
0085
 1   grabbed a pillow, screaming the whole time,
 2   "Somebody help me."
 3        Q    Okay.  I'm going to break that down a
 4   little bit.  You went running towards Randy from
 5   where you were standing that's marked Number 3,
 6   correct?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    Okay.  About -- did you actually run to
 9   where he was located at the time, or did you just
10   run in that direction?
11        A    I was running towards him, and he was
12   coming towards me, and I don't know where we met
13   or -- I just kept saying, "Roll -- lay down and
14   roll over."  But then I ran out there.
15        Q    Okay.  So did the two of you actually
16   meet at some point in the yard, in the backyard,
17   before you ran to the structure at the end of the
18   driveway?
19        A    We were close, but we, you know --
20        Q    When you say "close," what do you mean?
21        A    I guess from me to you.  I don't know.
22   I'd be guessing.  I don't know.
23        Q    If you reached out your arm, could you
24   touch him when you were running towards each other
25   where you met in the yard?
0086
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Okay.  A yard or two away from one
 3   another?  Is that a fair assumption?
 4             MR. AKINS:  Object to the form.
 5             THE WITNESS:  It could be.  I would be
 6        guessing.
 7   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 8        Q    Okay.  Where were you in the yard when
 9   you stopped running toward Randy and decided to run
10   into the structure at the end of your driveway?  If
11   you could point to me -- point on the map for me.
12        A    Again, I would be guessing, but somewhere
13   maybe around in here or so.  I don't know.
14        Q    Somewhere in the middle of the yard?
15        A    Yeah.
16        Q    Were you past -- when I say "past," I
17   mean in the direction of the back of the yard --
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    -- in the direction of the burn pile.
20   Were you past the fountain?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    And were you even with those trees --
23   with the big tree that's on the side of the -- of
24   the property where the fence is?  There's some
25   trees that line there.
0087
 1        A    This?
 2        Q    Uh-huh.
 3        A    I don't know.  I wasn't paying attention
 4   to where I was running and when I -- I don't know.
 5        Q    Okay.  But you were past the fountain?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    And were you closer to the middle of your
 8   yard than the fence?
 9        A    This fence?
10        Q    Correct, the fence on the right.
11        A    I don't know.  I really don't.  I don't
12   know.
13        Q    When you ran towards Randy, which set of
14   stairs off of your porch did you take?
15        A    The big ones.
16        Q    The big ones.  Okay.  And you ran towards
17   Randy, and then you changed direction and ran to
18   the structure?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    About how long do you think you were
21   running towards him before you decided to go to the
22   structure?
23        A    I don't know.  Before I decided?
24        Q    Yeah.
25        A    I don't know.  I have no -- I have no
0088
 1   idea.  I can't recall that.  I don't --
 2        Q    Okay.  You ran into the structure?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    What part of the structure did you run
 5   to?  The front?  Was it the front of the structure?
 6        A    There's a side door over here.
 7        Q    And when you say -- is that near where
 8   the burn pile is or near where this covered area,
 9   the light gray square is?
10        A    It's all in that same area.  This is
11   throwing me off.  But it's not under the light
12   gray, it's a little bit over.
13        Q    Okay.  It's a little bit over maybe where
14   this medium gray color is?
15        A    Yeah.
16        Q    Okay.  Could you please draw a five
17   where -- about where you believe the door is.
18        A    Where the door is?
19        Q    Uh-huh.
20        A    (Witness complies.)
21        Q    Okay.  So you went into the structure,
22   and you said you were looking for something to put
23   the fire out with.  When you were inside the
24   structure, what did you do?
25        A    I picked up a pillow.
0089
 1        Q    From where was the pillow?
 2        A    On the couch sitting over here.
 3        Q    Okay.  Please draw where the couch is,
 4   maybe a rectangle where the couch is inside.
 5        A    (Witness complies.)
 6        Q    And was it a couch pillow that you
 7   grabbed?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Was it the actual cushion or a pillow
10   that goes on top of the couch?
11        A    Pillow that goes on top.
12        Q    So a decorative sort of pillow.  Yes?
13        A    Yes.  Sorry.
14        Q    You grabbed the pillow.  How did you exit
15   the structure?
16        A    Same way, out that way, the door.
17        Q    Okay.  And then when you ran back toward
18   Randy, is that where -- you ran back toward Randy?
19        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
20        Q    Yes?
21        A    Yes.  Sorry.
22        Q    When you ran back toward Randy, which
23   direction did you go?
24        A    Straight across.
25        Q    Straight across.  In front of -- and when
0090
 1   I say "in front of," I mean away from the back --
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    -- fence.  You ran in front of the tree
 4   and palm fronds there?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    What did you do next when you had this
 7   pillow in your hand?
 8        A    I never hit him with it because I thought
 9   it was going to hurt him.  I don't -- I just -- I
10   did nothing with it.  I'm screaming the whole time,
11   "Somebody please help me."
12             And at some point, the next-door neighbor
13   came over.  I don't remember how long it was.  And
14   at some point, this neighbor across the street over
15   here came over.  I don't know how long it took.
16        Q    Okay.  When you had the pillow, were you
17   holding it with both hands?
18        A    I don't remember.
19        Q    Okay.  Were you running?
20        A    With the pillow?
21        Q    With the pillow.
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    Okay.  When your neighbor, your first
24   neighbor, came over, which neighbor is that?
25        A    Jim Owens.
0091
 1        Q    Mr. Odum, possibly?
 2        A    Odum, yes, I'm sorry, Odum.
 3        Q    So at some point, Jim Odum came over?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    And he is the neighbor that lives on the
 6   other side of your driveway away from your house.
 7   Is that right?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Okay.  Is there a fence there?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Okay.  Where were you when you first saw
12   Jim?
13        A    I don't remember.  I don't recall.
14        Q    But were you in your backyard?
15        A    Yes, in my backyard.
16        Q    So you were running with the pillow, and
17   you were yelling for help?
18        A    The whole entire time, I was screaming
19   for help.
20        Q    And at some point, Mr. Odum appeared?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Where was Mr. Odum when you first saw
23   him?  You don't have to point on the map.  You can
24   just tell me.
25        A    I don't remember, I really don't.  It's
0092
 1   all a big blur.  I don't remember.
 2        Q    Okay.  Taking a step back, rewinding a
 3   little bit, when you first saw Randy after you
 4   turned around on your front -- on your back porch,
 5   you turned around and you saw him, and he was
 6   running toward you, did he have anything in his
 7   hands?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    Did you see a gas can on the property at
10   that time?
11             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
12             THE WITNESS:  There was always a gas can
13        sitting there on the -- where's the thing at?
14        It's somewhere in this area.
15   BY MS. CUEVAS:
16        Q    But when you were standing on your porch,
17   you said you couldn't see the burn pile?
18        A    No.
19        Q    So when you were standing on your back
20   porch and you turned around and you saw Randy,
21   could you see a gas can?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Okay.  And Randy wasn't holding anything?
24        A    Not that I remember, I don't.
25        Q    Okay.  Going back to when Mr. Odum came
0093
 1   to your house, do you remember if he was in your
 2   backyard with you when you first saw him?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    In the grass?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Okay.  And was that past the fountain?
 7   Closer to the burn pile than the house?
 8        A    I don't know.  I really don't.
 9        Q    Okay.  But Mr. Odum found you in the
10   backyard?
11        A    And Randy, yes.
12        Q    And Randy.  Were you standing with Randy
13   at that time?
14        A    To tell you the truth, I don't remember.
15   I remember also Tom, the other guy, coming in
16   sometime in there too.  I don't know when
17   everything happened.  I don't know the time frame.
18   I just know they were there finally.
19        Q    Okay.  And I understand this is extremely
20   traumatic, so I understand.  Thank you for going
21   through this with me.
22             When you were in your backyard and
23   Mr. Odum showed up, you were standing with Randy or
24   near Randy?
25        A    Near Randy.
0094
 1        Q    Near Randy.  About how far away from you
 2   was Randy?
 3        A    I don't -- I don't know.  I can't
 4   remember.
 5        Q    When you testified earlier, you mentioned
 6   that when the two of you ran toward one another
 7   before you went into the structure to get the
 8   pillow that you were maybe about as far away as we
 9   are right now, right?
10        A    Yes, but I'm still guessing.
11        Q    Okay.  When you were in the backyard with
12   Jim Odum, was Randy about the same distance away
13   from you as when you guys met in the yard before
14   you went into the structure?
15        A    I'm guessing, but I guess so.  I don't
16   know.
17        Q    What is the next thing you remember after
18   Jim met you in the backyard?
19        A    Tom came, and he said, "Get Gayla out of
20   here, get her out now," and Jim physically made me
21   go into the house.
22        Q    Okay.  As best as you can remember, did
23   Jim get to your house before Tom?
24        A    Yes, as best as I remember.
25        Q    And Tom lives where in relation to your
0095
 1   house?
 2        A    It's across the road that's right here,
 3   on the corner.
 4        Q    Okay.  Do you remember seeing Tom also in
 5   your backyard?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    So you did not see Tom at that -- when he
 8   first came over on your back porch?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    So Tom was in the yard with you and Jim
11   and Randy, correct?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    And Tom told Jim to get you out of there,
14   right?
15        A    Jim told me to call 911, and in the
16   meantime, they had gotten the water hose.  Tom got
17   the water hose, and they was trying to straighten
18   it out so that they could spray it on Randy.  I
19   dialed 911, and the operator, I told her where to
20   come, and she just started asking me all kind of
21   stupid questions, so I handed it to Jim.
22        Q    Okay.  I'm going to break that down a
23   bit.  You were with Jim in your backyard, and at
24   some point Tom also came into your backyard,
25   correct?
0096
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Now, you remember Tom saying, "Get Gayla
 3   out of here.  Get her out now."  Was that before
 4   Tom and Jim started to untangle the hose?
 5        A    It was after.
 6        Q    It was after?
 7        A    After they told -- and I dialed 911.  It
 8   was after that.
 9        Q    Okay.  So when Tom said, "Get Gayla out
10   of here," were the three of you standing in your
11   backyard, to the best of your recollection?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    Okay.  And how did you then get a phone?
14        A    I don't know.  I really don't.  I
15   don't -- that's a good question.  I don't know
16   where it came from.
17        Q    Okay.  Were you outside in the yard when
18   you called 911?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    Okay.  Do you remember going inside your
21   house to get a phone?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Okay.  So Jim or Tom got a phone for you?
24        A    Yeah.  I don't know, I really don't.  It
25   could have been mine.  I could have been walking
0097
 1   around with mine.  I don't -- I don't know.  I
 2   never thought about it, but I'm like where did I
 3   get the phone?
 4        Q    Do you remember if you were on a house
 5   phone, a landline phone --
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    -- or a cellphone?
 8        A    Cellphone.
 9        Q    Do you remember if you were on your
10   cellphone?
11        A    No, I don't remember.
12        Q    After Tom told Jim to get you out of the
13   area, you called 911 after that point?
14        A    I think it was before.
15        Q    Okay.
16        A    And they were untangling the ropes and
17   all that, and I was calling, and then he -- I got
18   on the line with an operator.
19        Q    Okay.  Before the operator, where were
20   Tom and Jim getting a hose from?
21        A    There's one right along in here.
22        Q    And that's the side of the driveway?
23        A    On -- yeah, on this side of the driveway
24   on the grass.
25        Q    On the grass.  Could you put an X where
0098
 1   the hose is?
 2        A    (Witness complies.)
 3        Q    Now, Tom and Jim were standing around the
 4   hose.  Is that fair?
 5        A    No.  They were with Randy wherever he
 6   was, but I guess Tom was trained enough, he
 7   immediately took action.
 8        Q    Okay.  When Tom took action, where was
 9   Jim?
10        A    I don't know.
11        Q    Was anyone with you?
12        A    I don't know.  All I remember is them
13   untangling it and trying to get it over there.  Tom
14   had the end of it going towards Randy, and Jim was
15   trying to untangle it.
16        Q    And when you say Jim was trying to
17   untangle the hose, was he walking with the hose and
18   trying to untangle it?
19        A    No, unwinding it.  Randy had it wound up
20   around the spigot thing.
21        Q    Okay.  So Jim was standing by the hose
22   and untangling it, unwinding it?
23        A    Yeah, unwinding it.
24        Q    Okay.  And Tom was walking it over to
25   Randy?
0099
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Where was Randy?
 3        A    I don't -- I don't know.
 4        Q    Well, you saw Tom walking the hose toward
 5   Randy, right?
 6        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
 7        Q    To the best of your recollection, where
 8   was he walking it to?
 9        A    Over in here somewhere.
10        Q    Okay.  Would you draw a circle around
11   that area?
12        A    Somewhere in here.
13        Q    Okay.  And when Tom was walking the hose
14   over to Randy, what was Randy doing?
15        A    I don't know.  I tried not to look at
16   him.
17        Q    Do you remember whether he was on the
18   ground or if he was moving?
19        A    To tell you the truth, I don't know,
20   because Tom told me later that he had to tackle
21   Randy, so I don't know if he was still up or down
22   when he tackled him.
23        Q    And we'll talk later about what Tom said.
24             For now, you were in the backyard.  Jim
25   was helping unwind the hose.  Tom was walking it
0100
 1   over to where Randy was.  You got a phone after --
 2   you were on the phone with 911 after the gentlemen
 3   were unwinding the hose.  Is that correct?
 4        A    I really don't remember.  I don't know.
 5   It's all jumbled in there together.  I just know I
 6   was on the phone at some point in there.  I don't
 7   remember.
 8        Q    When you got on the phone with 911, you
 9   testified that you gave the operator the address?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Do you remember anything else that you
12   told the operator before Jim got the phone?
13        A    That my husband -- there was a fire, and
14   my husband was burning, and we needed them there.
15        Q    Okay.  Now, where was the fire?
16        A    On Randy.
17        Q    On Randy.  Was there a fire in the burn
18   pile?
19        A    I don't know.  I didn't pay attention to
20   that.
21        Q    When you were on the phone with 911,
22   where were you?
23        A    Somewhere in the backyard.  I don't --
24        Q    Do you remember if you were on your
25   porch?
0101
 1        A    No, I wasn't.
 2        Q    You were not on the porch?
 3        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
 4        Q    Do you remember if you were standing on
 5   the brick?
 6        A    No.  As far as I remember, I was
 7   somewhere around the flower bed.
 8        Q    Around the flower bed.  Do you remember
 9   if you were between the flower bed and the porch?
10        A    No.
11        Q    But you were near the flower bed?
12        A    Yeah.
13        Q    When you were on the phone with 911, I
14   know you said you were trying not to look at Randy.
15   Do you remember what you were facing, what
16   direction you were facing?
17        A    I don't remember.  I just -- I don't
18   know.
19        Q    When you were on the phone with 911, were
20   you watching Jim and Tom with the hose still?
21        A    I didn't like watch them watch them.  I
22   just knew they were doing it.  I don't know if that
23   makes sense.  I mean, I didn't --
24        Q    So you weren't focusing on them with the
25   hose?
0102
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    But you could see them in the general
 3   area that you were looking?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Okay.  When you gave Jim the phone, were
 6   you outside?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    What were you -- what were you looking at
 9   at that time?
10        A    Jim, I mean.
11        Q    At Jim?
12        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
13        Q    Do you remember if he was standing across
14   from you, if you -- or to your side?
15        A    I don't know.  I don't --
16        Q    Okay.  When you gave Jim the phone, did
17   you stay outside?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    So you did not go back inside?
20        A    Not until Tom said, "Get her out of
21   here."
22        Q    Okay.  About how long do you think -- and
23   I understand that it's jumbled.  How long do you
24   think you were outside after the boom before you
25   went inside the house?
0103
 1        A    I don't know.  Felt like hours.
 2        Q    What is the last thing you remember
 3   seeing before you went inside your house?
 4        A    I don't remember.
 5        Q    You did see Jim and Tom untangling the
 6   hose and walking it over to Randy?
 7             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 8             THE WITNESS:  Yes.
 9   BY MS. CUEVAS:
10        Q    And you know, because Tom told you, that
11   Tom had to tackle Randy.  Is that right?
12        A    He told me weeks later.
13        Q    Okay.  When you were looking in your
14   backyard, were Tom and Jim in front of you, or did
15   you hear Tom say, "Get Gayla out of here" sort of
16   in your peripheral or behind you?
17             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
18             THE WITNESS:  I just heard him.  I mean,
19        I just heard him.  I don't know where it came
20        from.
21   BY MS. CUEVAS:
22        Q    So you didn't see Tom say that?
23        A    Huh-uh.
24        Q    You just heard him say that?
25        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
0104
 1        Q    Is that --
 2        A    Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yes.
 3        Q    Okay.  When Jim took you inside the
 4   house, where did -- which direction did you go
 5   inside the house from where you were standing?
 6        A    The same kitchen door.
 7        Q    So from where you were standing near the
 8   flower bed, did you walk up the center big stairs?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    And then you went under that covered
11   portion of the deck --
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    -- with the big gray rectangle?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    And you went in through the same door
16   towards the bar that leads into the kitchen?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Was Jim with you that whole time?
19        A    No.  He went back outside.  And a few
20   minutes later, I went back outside, because I
21   wanted to be with Randy, but he wouldn't let me.
22        Q    Did Jim walk you inside?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    How far inside did you go before you went
25   back outside?
0105
 1        A    To the kitchen.
 2        Q    Did you -- were you in the center of the
 3   kitchen, or you just got into the kitchen, and you
 4   turned back around?
 5        A    Just into the kitchen.  I stayed in the
 6   little bar area for a little while, and I said I
 7   want to be with Randy.
 8        Q    So when you were in the bar area, were
 9   you looking out the windows?
10        A    Yes, but not at Randy.
11        Q    What were you looking at?
12        A    Everything else, anything else.
13        Q    You said that you were in the bar area
14   for a little while?
15        A    I don't know how long.
16        Q    Okay.  A couple minutes?
17        A    Felt like hours.  I don't know.
18        Q    When you went from the bar area back
19   outside, how did you get back outside?
20        A    Through that same door.
21        Q    And where did you go when you went back
22   outside?
23        A    I tried to go down the steps, but Jim
24   caught me and held me there.
25        Q    So Jim caught you on the stairs?
0106
 1        A    Uh-huh.
 2        Q    Can you point to where you were on the
 3   stairs when Jim caught you?
 4        A    Right in here somewhere.
 5        Q    Okay.  Would you draw a six there for me,
 6   please.
 7        A    (Witness complies.)
 8        Q    And when Jim caught you there, what were
 9   you doing?
10        A    Crying, holding onto him.  He was
11   standing there, and I was holding onto his britches
12   leg, crying.
13        Q    So were you looking at where Randy was?
14        A    No.  He wouldn't let me.
15        Q    So Jim was blocking your view?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    So you were facing outward --
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    -- from the house?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    And Jim was facing you?
22        A    No.  He was facing his house.
23        Q    Okay.  And you were facing his chest or
24   outward into the back of your yard?
25        A    Chest was back of the -- back of the
0107
 1   yard.
 2        Q    Back of the yard.  So Jim was standing
 3   facing his house sideways, sort of?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Did you see Tom at that point?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Did you see a fire in your backyard at
 8   that point?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Did you see anything other than Jim?
11        A    No.  He wouldn't let me.
12        Q    Okay.  And how long did you stand there
13   with Jim?
14        A    I was sitting.  He was standing.
15        Q    Okay.  So you walked down those steps to
16   go toward Randy when Jim caught you?
17        A    I had gotten down to the second step.  He
18   caught me.  I sat on the first step.
19        Q    The top step?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    And Jim was standing, and you were
22   holding onto sort of his pants?
23        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)  And
24   his jacket, I mean.
25        Q    Was he wearing a jacket?
0108
 1        A    I don't know, whatever it was.  I just --
 2   whatever I could get.  I just -- didn't make any
 3   sense, but --
 4        Q    How long did you sit there?
 5        A    I don't know.
 6        Q    What is the next thing you remember?
 7        A    Some man came up, and I have no idea -- I
 8   don't remember who it was, but some man came up,
 9   just a neighbor or something.
10        Q    Was it a -- was it a neighbor?
11        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
12        Q    Yes?
13        A    Yes.  I'm sorry.
14        Q    Do you know which neighbor?
15        A    I can't remember.
16        Q    Do you remember where this neighbor lived
17   in relation to your house?
18        A    No.
19        Q    But it was a man?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    When the neighbor came up, did he come
22   onto the step with you?
23        A    No.  He just stayed down on the bricked
24   area and talked to Jim.
25        Q    What did they talk about?
0109
 1        A    I don't know.  I wasn't paying attention.
 2        Q    You were not able to really process what
 3   was happening?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    What is the next thing that you remember
 6   after your other neighbor was standing there with
 7   Jim?
 8        A    And I don't know all the time frames or
 9   anything like that, but the police came.  The fire
10   department and the ambulance, they came.
11        Q    Do you remember if the fire department or
12   the ambulance or the police came first?
13        A    No, I don't remember which one.
14        Q    Where were you when first responders
15   arrived?
16        A    Still sitting there in that same place.
17        Q    And where was Jim?
18        A    In that same place.
19        Q    And you still could not see anything?
20        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
21        Q    No?
22        A    No.  Sorry.
23        Q    After your neighbor arrived, do you
24   remember about how long he was there until some
25   first responder arrived?
0110
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    But you remember first responders being
 3   the ambulance, the fire department, and the
 4   sheriff's office, the police?
 5        A    I think -- I don't -- they could have
 6   been there, but I remember the fire department and
 7   the ambulance.
 8        Q    You only remember the fire department and
 9   the ambulance?
10        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
11        Q    Do you remember speaking with people from
12   the fire department or the ambulance?
13        A    I might have talked to them, but I don't
14   remember.  But I know I talked to the EMS lady.
15   She came and talked to me, the one that took Randy.
16        Q    Okay.  When the ambulance and the fire
17   department were there, what did you see of what
18   they were doing, if anything?
19        A    I didn't pay any attention to what they
20   were doing.  I was still out of it.
21        Q    So while the fire department and
22   ambulance were there, you were still sitting in the
23   same place that you were located?
24        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
25        Q    Would you point to where you were sitting
0111
 1   on Exhibit 2, the zoomed-in image.  Just point
 2   first.
 3        A    I thought that's Number 6.
 4        Q    That's where you said you were when Jim
 5   caught you.  Did you sit right there?
 6        A    Uh-huh, the whole time.
 7        Q    Okay.  So you did not move from that
 8   place?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    After the responders came and before you
11   spoke with the woman from the ambulance, did you
12   speak with anyone else in between that time?
13        A    Some neighbor women came, but I don't
14   remember what was said.  I don't remember.  I
15   remember Jim saying, "There needs to be a woman
16   here."
17        Q    Okay.  Do you remember was Jim still in
18   the same spot when he said that?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    And when your female neighbors came over,
21   do you remember how many there were?
22        A    I think there were two.
23        Q    And did they sit with you?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    Were they sitting -- where were they
0112
 1   sitting with you?
 2        A    They sat on my right side.
 3        Q    Both of them?
 4        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)  Randy
 5   had already been put in the ambulance.
 6        Q    Okay.  But you did not -- did you see
 7   Randy get put in the ambulance?
 8        A    Well, I saw the thing go by, but I didn't
 9   see the -- I didn't see him, but I saw the bed
10   thing, whatever it is.
11        Q    The stretcher?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    Okay.  Did you see anything that happened
14   when people were tending to Randy?
15        A    No.
16        Q    When your female neighbors came over, had
17   Randy already been taken in the stretcher across?
18        A    I don't remember.
19        Q    Okay.  The neighbors sat to your right
20   you said?
21        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
22        Q    Both of them?
23        A    As best as I can recall.
24        Q    What did you talk about with them?
25        A    All I remember is them saying, "He's
0113
 1   going to be okay.  He's going to be okay."
 2        Q    Do you remember saying anything to them
 3   about what you saw?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    Do you remember hearing from them
 6   anything about what happened?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    So from the time that Jim caught you on
 9   the stairs to when you sat down and your female
10   neighbors came over, did you see anything about
11   what Randy was doing?
12        A    You mean what was happening to Randy?
13        Q    Yes.
14        A    No.
15        Q    You didn't see what position Randy was
16   in?
17        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
18        Q    If someone was tending to him, you didn't
19   see that?
20        A    I knew that Tom was there, and I knew
21   that he used to be a fire -- fireman.  That's all I
22   knew.  And I knew when the ambulance and all that,
23   I knew they were tending to him.
24        Q    Okay.  But you did not see
25   specifically --
0114
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    -- what anyone was doing?
 3        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
 4        Q    Okay.  Did you hear anything that Randy
 5   said when he was with Tom?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Did you hear anything that Randy said
 8   when he was with the first responders?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Did you hear anything that anybody else
11   said when Randy was being tended to by Tom?
12        A    If I heard it, I didn't pay attention to
13   it.  I mean, I know it sounds weird.  It was like I
14   was in la la land or something.  It was all going
15   around -- on, and I didn't --
16        Q    You didn't process it?
17        A    Yeah.
18        Q    Okay.  Did you hear anything that the
19   first responders said when they were tending to
20   Randy?
21        A    I might have, but I don't remember
22   anything.
23        Q    Okay.  So if I were to ask you questions
24   about specifics about what anyone said -- Randy or
25   Tom or first responders -- you would not be able to
0115
 1   tell me anything that they said.  Is that right?
 2        A    I would not be able to.
 3        Q    Okay.  When Randy was moved across to the
 4   ambulance, you were still sitting in the same place
 5   on the step.  Is that right?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    And how did they move him?  Was it
 8   straight across to the driveway?
 9        A    Like an angle, yeah, pretty much.
10        Q    Can you sort of point to me, the best you
11   recall, where you saw the stretcher move in front
12   of you?
13        A    I think it was kind of like that.  Well,
14   I don't know.  I don't -- it seemed like it was at
15   an angle, but maybe it wasn't.  Maybe they went
16   across here.
17        Q    Okay.  The best you recall, it was an
18   angle?
19        A    Like an angle, but --
20        Q    Was it in front of the fountain?  Excuse
21   me.  In between the fountain and the back deck?
22        A    No.
23        Q    So was he moved in a stretcher, then,
24   behind the -- past the fountain and the flower bed
25   toward the backyard?
0116
 1        A    It seemed like it was more this way, but
 2   I don't know.
 3        Q    And just so that I understand, when you
 4   say, "This way," you mean it seemed like it was in
 5   between the area from the flower bed and the
 6   fountain --
 7        A    Yeah.
 8        Q    -- and the deck?
 9        A    It seemed that way, but it may not have
10   been.
11        Q    Okay.  What is the next thing that you
12   remember after Randy was taken on the stretcher
13   toward the ambulance?
14        A    The lady in the EMS came and talked to
15   me, told me where they're going to be taking him,
16   they would take good care of him, you know, and all
17   that kind of good stuff, that he was going to be
18   flown to Augusta, Georgia.
19        Q    Okay.  Were you still sitting when the
20   woman from the ambulance said that to you?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    And was she standing?
23        A    She kind of squatted down in front of me.
24        Q    Was she standing on a step squatting?
25        A    Yeah, like a squat on the steps.
0117
 1        Q    So she was not --
 2        A    Kneeling, like.
 3        Q    She kneeled down?
 4        A    Yeah.
 5        Q    And she was on the step, not the brick --
 6        A    Yeah.
 7        Q    -- the best you can recall?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Okay.  What words do you remember her
10   using when she spoke to you?
11        A    She told her name, she said where she was
12   from, that they were taking Ms. West -- Mr. West
13   to -- I don't remember where.  Then they were going
14   to take the helicopter to the burn unit in Augusta,
15   Georgia.
16        Q    Do you remember her name?
17        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
18   I've got it written down.
19        Q    Did you write down her name when you were
20   standing with her or sitting with her?
21        A    No.  I didn't have anything to write on
22   and --
23        Q    Do you know if anyone else was taking
24   notes while you were sitting there?
25        A    I don't know.
0118
 1        Q    After this woman from the ambulance spoke
 2   with you about where they were taking Randy, what
 3   is the next thing that you remember?
 4        A    I told her to please tell him that I
 5   loved him, she promised she would, and she left.
 6        Q    Okay.  When the ambulance left, were
 7   there still other responders at your house on the
 8   property?
 9        A    I guess.  I think they made me go in the
10   house, or they got me into the house, so I don't
11   remember who all was there.
12        Q    Do you remember who got you into the
13   house?
14        A    No.
15        Q    Do you remember if it was someone you
16   know?
17        A    I'm sure it was, but I really don't.  I
18   don't remember.
19        Q    Okay.  Do you remember if Jim stayed with
20   you?
21        A    I don't think he did.  He probably had
22   enough.
23        Q    Okay.  Do you remember if Tom stayed with
24   you?
25        A    I don't know what happened to Tom.  I
0119
 1   don't --
 2        Q    You do remember going into your house,
 3   though?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Do you remember how long you stayed
 6   outside after Randy --
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    -- was taken away in the ambulance?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Do you remember what you did with the
11   pillow that you had in your hand when you were
12   running toward Randy?
13        A    The last time I saw it, it was in the
14   yard.
15        Q    Where in the yard was it?
16        A    Just out there close to Randy somewhere.
17   I don't know.
18        Q    So in the general area where you have a
19   circle over there on that exhibit?
20        A    Somewhere in that circle.
21        Q    Yeah.  It was in that circle?
22        A    I'm assuming.  I don't know what I did
23   with it.
24        Q    But the last time you remember seeing it
25   that day?
0120
 1        A    Uh-huh.
 2        Q    Yes?
 3        A    Yes.  I'm sorry.
 4        Q    The pillow was in the yard?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    And it was in that general area where the
 7   circle is?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Did you, at any point while you were
10   sitting on the stairs before you went inside, take
11   a look at the yard and where things were?
12        A    No.
13        Q    Did you at any point see anything else
14   other than the pillow in your yard on that day
15   before you went inside the house?
16        A    No.  I didn't want to look.  Too many --
17   too much.
18        Q    Understood.  What is the next thing you
19   remember after you went inside the house?
20        A    I don't know.
21        Q    Do you remember what room you went into?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Do you remember, when you went inside the
24   house, if you went back into that -- the same way
25   that you had been going in and out of the house?
0121
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    So you went through the door under --
 3        A    In the kitchen.
 4        Q    Near the kitchen?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Okay.  Did anyone stay with you, you
 7   know, right there with you?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Who did?
10        A    I don't -- I don't remember.  I really
11   don't remember.  It's like a -- that may sound
12   stupid to you, but I don't remember.
13        Q    I don't think you sound stupid, I
14   promise.
15             Where was the first place that you went
16   after you went inside?  Did you leave your house at
17   any point that day?
18        A    I don't recall.  I don't recall if I did.
19        Q    So you went back in your house.  You
20   recall that someone was there with you.  Is that
21   right?
22        A    Yes.  Sorry.
23        Q    And do you remember speaking with any
24   other first responders at your house, other than
25   the woman from the ambulance?
0122
 1        A    I want to say some man came up and talked
 2   to me, but I don't remember who he was with.  I
 3   don't know if he was fire department.  I don't
 4   know.  But he looked official.  He had on a
 5   uniform.
 6        Q    Okay.  That was going to be my next
 7   question, if he was wearing a uniform.
 8             Do you remember anything -- what did
 9   he -- what did he look like?
10        A    He was tall, a little older.
11        Q    Did he have -- what color hair did he
12   have?
13        A    Brown with gray.
14        Q    And the woman from the ambulance that
15   spoke with you, what do you remember she looked
16   like?
17        A    I think she had brown hair.
18        Q    Do you remember if her hair was pulled up
19   or down?
20        A    No.
21        Q    The woman that spoke with you from the
22   ambulance, was she white?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    And the gentleman that spoke with you
25   later who was tall and older with brown and gray
0123
 1   hair, was he a white guy?
 2        A    White.
 3        Q    Is there anything else that you remember
 4   about the incident that you haven't told me yet?
 5        A    I remember smelling gas.
 6        Q    You remember smelling gas.  Did you at
 7   any point that morning see Randy with gasoline?
 8        A    No.  He was behind the bushes or the --
 9        Q    So you didn't see Randy pour gas on
10   anything?
11        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
12        Q    No?
13        A    No.  I'm sorry.  No.
14        Q    And you didn't see Randy light a fire?
15        A    No, but he did it all the time.
16        Q    And you didn't see Randy pour gas on the
17   fire?
18        A    No.
19        Q    And you didn't see Randy grab a can or a
20   container when he went out into the yard that
21   morning?
22        A    No, no.
23        Q    Is there anyone else that you spoke with
24   at your house that morning that you haven't told me
25   about?
0124
 1        A    At some point, Shellie came in, but she
 2   didn't really talk to me.
 3        Q    Okay.  Now, I'm sorry if I already asked
 4   you this.  When you were speaking to the gentleman
 5   who was in uniform, is that -- and that's the only
 6   other --
 7        A    That I remember.
 8        Q    That you remember that you spoke with?
 9        A    Yeah.
10        Q    Okay.  Do you remember what you spoke
11   with him about?
12        A    No, I don't remember.
13        Q    Do you remember if he told you anything
14   about Randy's accident?
15        A    He -- no, I don't remember.  I just
16   remember him coming up to me.
17        Q    Do you remember asking him any questions?
18        A    I don't think I had enough about me to
19   ask anything.
20        Q    Okay.  How long do you think you stayed
21   in your house after the accident?
22        A    I don't know.
23        Q    But at some point --
24        A    Are you talking about that day?
25        Q    That day.
0125
 1        A    I don't know.
 2        Q    But Shellie did come to the house?
 3        A    She came sometime while I was still
 4   sitting on the steps.
 5        Q    At some point while you were sitting on
 6   the steps, do you remember her being outside with
 7   you?
 8        A    Yes.  She came around the corner yelling,
 9   "What in the heck did he do?"
10        Q    Do you remember where he was -- where
11   Shellie was standing the last time you saw her in
12   the backyard?
13        A    Somewhere down here on the --
14        Q    On the brick?
15        A    Brick.
16        Q    Could you write with a seven about where
17   you remember seeing Shellie.
18        A    (Witness complies.)
19        Q    Now, you said that Shellie didn't really
20   talk to you?
21        A    No.
22        Q    Do you remember Shellie talking to
23   anybody else?
24        A    Yeah.  No, not really, but it's like I
25   said, I'm sure she did.  I don't want to put words
0126
 1   in anybody's mouth.  Never mind.  I don't know if
 2   she did or not.
 3        Q    Okay.  When I first asked if Shellie
 4   talked to anybody else, you sounded pretty
 5   confident when you said yeah.  Do you remember
 6   hearing Shellie speaking to other people?
 7        A    No.  That's why I said I can't say.  I
 8   didn't hear her say anything to anybody other than
 9   me, I mean, other than just in general to anybody
10   that would listen, "What did he do?"
11        Q    Okay.  Was Shellie standing there the
12   whole time that you were outside, as best as you
13   know?
14        A    I don't know.  I don't remember if she
15   went somewhere.  I don't know.
16        Q    After Shellie said, "What in the heck did
17   he do" and was standing in that spot where you've
18   drawn seven, do you remember seeing her anywhere
19   else?
20        A    No, but I wasn't paying attention either.
21        Q    Okay.  And you don't remember hearing her
22   say anything else?
23        A    No.
24        Q    When you went back inside the house, was
25   Shellie at any point with you inside the house that
0127
 1   you remember?
 2        A    I hate to say it, but I don't remember.
 3        Q    Mrs. West, did you go to Augusta that
 4   day?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Okay.  Do you remember how long you
 7   stayed in your house before you went to Augusta?
 8        A    No.  It was long enough for the two women
 9   to help me get packed and Shellie to get packed.
10        Q    So at some point after you went inside
11   the house, you spoke to the gentleman with the
12   uniform.  When did you get packed?  Was it while
13   responders were at your house, or was it after they
14   had left, best you can recall?
15        A    I don't know if they were gone or not, to
16   tell you the truth.  I know the ambulance was gone.
17   I don't know about the fire department or anything
18   like that because the ambulance went ahead and
19   left.
20        Q    Okay.  In between going to your house and
21   speaking with the gentleman in the uniform and
22   getting packed, is there anything else that you
23   remember?
24        A    No.
25        Q    You don't remember saying anything
0128
 1   specific to your neighbors?
 2        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
 3        Q    No?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    And you don't remember speaking
 6   specifically to Shellie before you got packed?
 7        A    I may -- yeah, I may have, but I don't
 8   remember what it is or anything.  I don't remember
 9   if I did or didn't, but I may have.
10        Q    Do you remember Shellie being inside with
11   you?
12        A    No.  She could have, but --
13        Q    When your neighbors helped you get ready,
14   get packed, did they walk with you back upstairs?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    And do you remember what you packed?
17        A    No.  I just -- I didn't even know what to
18   pack, so they said just put, you know, this and
19   this and this in there, literally helped me pack.
20        Q    Okay.  And do you remember if you were
21   putting things in the bag or if your neighbors were
22   putting things in the bag?
23        A    They were.
24        Q    Do you remember where you were?  You were
25   just standing or sitting?
0129
 1        A    I was in my closet.  I'd hold it up, and
 2   they'd say yes.  I'd give it to them.  They'd put
 3   it in the thing.
 4        Q    And do you remember about how long it
 5   took you to pack?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    At any point did you look at a phone or
 8   at a clock and see what time it was?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Did you have your phone on you at that
11   point?
12        A    No, I don't think so.
13        Q    Did you make any phone calls while you
14   were inside your house to anyone?
15        A    No.
16        Q    And did anyone call you, as far as you
17   know, when you were inside your house?
18        A    If they did, I don't remember.
19        Q    Okay.  After you packed, what happened
20   next?
21        A    Sometime in there, Shellie and her best
22   friend, they drove in a vehicle, and Shellie's son
23   drove me, and we headed towards the hospital in
24   Augusta.
25        Q    Okay.  Shellie and her best friend were
0130
 1   in a car that was different from the car you were
 2   in?
 3        A    Uh-huh, because one of them had to come
 4   back.  I can't remember.
 5        Q    When you say one of them had to come
 6   back, what do you mean?
 7        A    I can't remember if it was Shellie or her
 8   son, one of them had to come back, so there had to
 9   be two vehicles.
10        Q    Okay.  So either Shellie or her son
11   needed to come back to Bluffton --
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    -- after you went to Augusta?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Okay.  But just to be clear, Shellie had
16   not left the house and then come back before
17   everyone went to Augusta?
18        A    She went to pack and everything.  Is that
19   what you mean?
20        Q    So she did not pack at the house, at your
21   house?
22        A    No.  She packs at her house.
23        Q    At her house?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    How far away from your house was
0131
 1   Shellie's house at the time, if you know?
 2        A    It's kind of like two houses over.
 3        Q    Okay.  So Shellie could walk to your
 4   house?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Do you know if she walked to your house
 7   that day?
 8        A    I don't know.
 9        Q    Was Augusta, Georgia, the next place you
10   went?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    So you got in the car with Shellie's son?
13        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
14        Q    Yes?
15        A    Yes.  Sorry.
16        Q    How old is Shellie's son?
17        A    He was 16 at the time.
18        Q    What's his name?
19        A    Put me on the spot.  My mind just went
20   blank.  Ask me something else.
21        Q    Okay.  Well, you can tell me what his --
22   what his name was.
23             Is there anything else that you did at
24   your house after you packed before you got in the
25   car to go to Augusta that you remember?
0132
 1        A    They told me everything to do, asked me
 2   if I had my phone, asked me if I had money, asked
 3   me, you know --
 4        Q    And when you say, "They," who do you
 5   mean?
 6        A    The two women that were there.
 7        Q    The two neighbors?
 8        A    His name is Luc.
 9        Q    Okay.  Shellie's son's name is Luc?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Okay.  When the two neighbors -- do you
12   remember their names yet?
13        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
14        Q    No?
15        A    No.
16        Q    Okay.  When the two neighbors were asking
17   you if you had things that you needed and helping
18   you get ready, did you leave to go to Augusta
19   immediately after you packed?
20        A    It was somewhere -- I mean, I don't know
21   the time frame because it's all a big blur.
22        Q    But you don't remember doing anything
23   else specifically?
24        A    Oh, no, just that.
25        Q    So you packed, and then you left?
0133
 1        A    Yes.
 2             MS. CUEVAS:  Let's take a break.
 3             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at
 4        12:37 p.m.
 5                  (A recess transpired.)
 6             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This begins Media
 7        Number 3 in the deposition of Gayla West.  We
 8        are on the record at 12:49 p.m.
 9   BY MS. CUEVAS:
10        Q    Mrs. West, you said that the woman in the
11   ambulance told you that they were going to take
12   Randy to the burn center in Augusta?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Is that the Doctors Hospital in Augusta?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    And was that the only hospital where
17   Randy was treated, as far as you know?
18        A    As far as I know.
19        Q    Do you know any -- is there any reason
20   for you to believe that he was treated at any other
21   facility that day?
22        A    They said they were going to take him to
23   some other hospital, and I can't recall which one,
24   to stabilize him, but he was stable enough that
25   they just flew him on to Augusta.
0134
 1        Q    Okay.  So he -- as far as you know, he
 2   did not actually go to any other hospital?
 3        A    No, as far as I know.
 4        Q    Okay.  When you got in the car with Luc,
 5   do you know what time it was?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Did you look at the clock in the car at
 8   all?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    No?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Did you go straight to the hospital from
13   your house?
14        A    Yes, yes.
15        Q    Before you left your house, at any point,
16   did you see a gas can in your backyard?
17        A    I didn't pay attention.  That was the
18   last thing on my mind.
19        Q    So no, you did not see one?
20        A    No.
21        Q    How long did it take you to get to
22   Doctors Hospital?
23        A    I don't know.  I really don't.  I didn't
24   pay attention, and I didn't -- I don't know.
25        Q    Okay.
0135
 1        A    It could have taken six hours, or it
 2   could have -- felt like five days.
 3        Q    Fair enough.
 4        A    I didn't think I was ever going to get
 5   there.
 6        Q    Well, I will represent to you that I have
 7   Google mapped it, and it seems to be between two
 8   and three hours.
 9        A    That's all?
10        Q    Do you know if it was any longer or
11   shorter than that?
12        A    It could have been a little longer
13   because we had to stop.  We had to go to the
14   bathroom.
15        Q    Okay.  My next question was going to be
16   if you stopped anywhere while you were on your way
17   to Augusta.  Where did you stop?
18        A    I don't know.  They went the back way,
19   whatever way it was, the lady driving Shellie, some
20   little gas station in the middle of nowhere.
21        Q    Okay.  So your -- so Luc was following --
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    -- the car --
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    -- that Shellie and her friend were in?
0136
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    And they're the ones that needed to go to
 3   the bathroom?
 4        A    I did.
 5        Q    Okay.  You needed to stop to use the
 6   restroom, and they took you guys to a gas station
 7   somewhere?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Do you remember how long you were in the
10   car before that point?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Do you know what route you took?  You
13   said that the lady driving, they went the back way.
14        A    I don't know.  I probably couldn't take
15   you back there.
16        Q    Do you remember if you were on the
17   freeway?
18        A    It was not.
19        Q    Okay.  Do you know if you hit traffic on
20   the route?
21        A    No, I don't think we did.
22        Q    So you remember driving straight through?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Did you stop anywhere else other than
25   that one bathroom stop?
0137
 1        A    No, not that I recall.
 2        Q    Did you stop anywhere before you went to
 3   the hospital when you left your house?  In other
 4   words, when you got in the car with Luc, did you
 5   guys go straight toward the hospital, or did you
 6   have to stop at Shellie's house first?
 7        A    I don't know.  I don't remember.  It's
 8   funny, because I don't -- I don't know how we got
 9   even to -- how Shellie got over there, to her
10   friend's house.  I don't know.  I just remember
11   riding down the road following them.
12        Q    Okay.  As far as you know, you left from
13   your house --
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    -- in a car?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    And that was Luc's car, or the car that
18   Luc was driving?
19        A    Yes, yes.
20        Q    Okay.  And you don't know if you stopped
21   and went to Shellie's house or if you stopped and
22   went to Shellie's friend's house before hitting the
23   road to go to Augusta?
24        A    We had to have gone somewhere because --
25   I just don't remember, but I know that Shellie had
0138
 1   to be in that car.
 2        Q    Okay.  Was anyone else in the car with
 3   you?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    Luc and you drove to the hospital
 6   together?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    What did you do while you were in the
 9   car?
10        A    I called my sister-in-law, who is an RN,
11   to tell about Randy, and she talked to me for a few
12   minutes.  I called a couple other friends.  And I
13   made Luc talk to me so that I could keep mind off
14   as much as possible, and I cried.
15        Q    Okay.  When you called your
16   sister-in-law, do you remember if you used your
17   phone?
18        A    I'm assuming it was mine.
19        Q    Do you know if Luc has a phone?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Okay.  But you don't think it was his
22   phone?
23        A    No.
24        Q    You called your sister-in-law.  What did
25   you tell her?
0139
 1        A    About Randy's accident, that they were
 2   flying him to Augusta.
 3        Q    And when you say, "About his accident,"
 4   what did you tell your sister, as specifically --
 5   your sister-in-law, as specifically as you can
 6   remember?
 7        A    That Randy was burned.
 8        Q    That he was burned.  Did you tell her
 9   anything else?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Did she ask you anything else about the
12   accident?
13        A    No.  She's not that way.  She's a nurse,
14   so she just cut it.
15        Q    Okay.  When you said you called a few
16   friends, do you remember how many friends you
17   called?
18        A    Two or three.
19        Q    Do you remember who?
20        A    Telena and Beverly.
21        Q    Jelena and Beverly?
22        A    No, Telena, T-E-L-E-N-A.
23        Q    And what is Telena's last name?
24        A    Nesmith.
25        Q    And what about Beverly?
0140
 1        A    McLean.
 2        Q    Do you remember calling anybody else in
 3   the car?
 4        A    I may have, but I don't remember.
 5        Q    Do you remember getting any phone calls
 6   from anyone else?
 7        A    Telena may have called me back.  I don't
 8   know.
 9        Q    Do you remember speaking to anyone else
10   in the car other than Luc, your sister-in-law,
11   Beverly, and Telena?
12        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
13        Q    No?
14        A    No.  I may have, but I don't remember.
15        Q    And when you spoke with Telena, what did
16   you tell her?
17        A    Same thing, that Randy had gotten burned
18   really bad in an accident, and we're heading to
19   Augusta burn unit.  Everybody around there knows
20   what that is.
21        Q    Do you remember telling Telena anything
22   else about Randy's accident?
23        A    No.
24        Q    Do you remember if you told her about the
25   boom?  Do you remember if you told her about an
0141
 1   explosion?
 2        A    I was too upset to keep telling it over
 3   and over, so I just said, you know, pray, and so I
 4   didn't get into everything at that time.
 5        Q    Okay.  And what about with Beverly?
 6        A    Same thing.
 7        Q    And you -- strike that.
 8             Did Telena ask you any questions about
 9   what happened specifically?
10        A    She did, but I shut her off.  I'll tell
11   you later.  I can't -- I'm not talking about it.
12        Q    What about Beverly, did she ask
13   questions?
14        A    No.  She's my best friend, and she knew
15   that it was -- she would find out later.
16        Q    Did Luc ask you any questions about what
17   happened?
18        A    No.  I don't know why.  I guess he had
19   talked to his mom or something.  I don't know.  But
20   he didn't.  He mainly talked to me about his stuff,
21   like I asked him to.
22        Q    And when you say, "His stuff," you
23   mean --
24        A    Anything about him, what he's doing, what
25   he wants to do, where he wants to go to college,
0142
 1   anything.  I said, "I don't care.  Talk to me."
 2        Q    Do you remember anything else about the
 3   car ride to Augusta?
 4        A    That it seemed like it took an eternity.
 5        Q    When you got to the hospital, did you go
 6   straight inside, or did you park the car first?
 7        A    We parked the car.  We met.  We went
 8   inside.
 9        Q    When you say you met, you mean you met up
10   with Shellie and her friend?
11        A    Yeah, because they had to park somewhere
12   else.
13        Q    So you and Luc parked in a different area
14   than Shellie and her friend?
15        A    Just, you know, a couple of car rows
16   over.
17        Q    But it was the same parking lot?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    Do you remember how long it took you guys
20   to find a parking spot?
21        A    Just go in and park.
22        Q    So it wasn't so busy that you couldn't
23   find a spot?
24        A    Huh-uh.
25        Q    When you guys made your pit stop at the
0143
 1   gas station on the way to Augusta, did you speak
 2   with Shellie or her friend at that point?
 3        A    No.  I wanted to get in, get out, and
 4   keep moving.
 5        Q    Okay.  When you went into the hospital,
 6   what was the first thing that you did?
 7        A    We tried to find where Randy was, you
 8   know, put and all that kind of stuff.  We finally
 9   found him.  We couldn't see him at that time
10   because they had him in all that paraphernalia.
11   They wanted to talk to us first.
12        Q    Okay.  Do you remember if you had to
13   speak with hospital personnel to find out where
14   Randy was?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Okay.  Were you familiar otherwise with
17   this hospital?
18        A    No.
19        Q    Did you have to wait in the waiting room?
20        A    Not for very long, but yeah, we waited.
21        Q    So you went in and you spoke to someone
22   at the hospital.  Were you the one that was talking
23   to someone at the hospital to find out where Randy
24   was?
25        A    All of us.
0144
 1        Q    Were you all speaking to different
 2   people?
 3        A    No.  It was the same person.
 4        Q    And this is like a front desk lobby
 5   entrance?
 6        A    They got us up to the floor that he was
 7   on, and by that time, friends and family from that
 8   area were there in the -- in the waiting room.
 9        Q    And when you say, "They got us up to the
10   floor" --
11        A    The hospital personnel.
12        Q    Okay.  So you went -- you first went into
13   the hospital, you spoke to someone to find out
14   where to go?
15        A    I think so.
16        Q    Okay.  And then you went to the floor
17   where Randy was?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    And then you were directed to where his
20   room was, or were you told at that point that you
21   needed to wait?
22        A    We needed to wait, because they -- the
23   doctors wanted to talk to us.
24        Q    Okay.  Do you remember how long you
25   waited?
0145
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Do you remember if it was half an hour?
 3   An hour?
 4        A    I don't remember.
 5        Q    When you first got there with Luc and
 6   Shellie and her best friend, was there anyone else,
 7   friends and family, that you knew that was at the
 8   hospital at that time?
 9        A    I didn't know it until we got up to the
10   waiting room that they were there.
11        Q    There were other people there?
12        A    Uh-huh.
13        Q    And you were in a designated waiting
14   area?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    How many people were there that you knew
17   in the waiting area before you could go talk to
18   doctors?
19        A    There were about 20, and all of us went,
20   all the friends, Shellie, Leigh and I and her
21   sister -- I mean his sister.
22        Q    So Barbara was there?
23        A    Barbara was there.
24        Q    Shellie was there?
25        A    Yes.  And Leigh got there later.
0146
 1        Q    Leigh got there later.  Do you remember
 2   about how long after you got there?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    Were any other family members there?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    Is Shellie married?
 7        A    Now, there might be cousins and all that.
 8   I hadn't met all his family, but there might have
 9   been cousins and stuff like that, but I don't know
10   them, so I couldn't tell you who was who.
11        Q    Okay.  So there were a lot of people
12   there, most of whom you didn't know?
13        A    Yeah.
14        Q    Okay.  Of the people you knew, it was
15   Barbara, Shellie, Leigh, Luc.  Anyone else?
16        A    And then Shellie's husband came, Eric.
17        Q    Okay.  Who else?
18        A    My brother Scott, his wife Gail.
19        Q    And is that the sister-in-law that you
20   spoke to on the phone?
21        A    Yes.  And Beverly, my friend.
22        Q    Okay.  Does Shellie have any other
23   children?
24        A    Illa and Evybelle.
25        Q    Were they there?
0147
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Do you know why they were not there?
 3        A    I don't think she wanted them to come
 4   because it was so -- she didn't want them to see
 5   him, I guess.
 6        Q    Are they younger?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    Did you speak to anyone while you were in
 9   this area waiting to talk to doctors about Randy's
10   accident?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Do you remember hearing anyone say
13   anything about Randy's accident?
14        A    No.  They might have when I wasn't
15   around, but not when I was around.
16        Q    So when you were around, no one was
17   saying anything about the accident?
18        A    Huh-uh.
19        Q    No?
20        A    No.  I'm sorry.
21        Q    Okay.  Do you remember, of the people
22   that you knew in that waiting room, who got there
23   first or second after you?
24        A    They were all there.
25        Q    They were already all there?
0148
 1        A    Most of them were -- most of them were
 2   from Georgia anyway, they lived closer than we did,
 3   so --
 4        Q    So your brother Scott and his wife Gail,
 5   they were already there?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    And Beverly, was she already there?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Eric came later, though, I think you
10   said.  Is that right?
11        A    Yeah, but I don't remember how much later
12   or anything like that.
13        Q    That's okay.  But you had no
14   conversations with anyone about the accident?
15        A    Huh-uh.
16        Q    Okay.  Did doctors come into the waiting
17   room, or did you all go somewhere to talk to
18   doctors?
19        A    We went into another -- I don't know what
20   it was called.  Looked like a conference room.
21        Q    All of you?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    Do you remember which medical
24   professionals you spoke with?
25        A    There were three or four of them, and I
0149
 1   thought it was his main doctor, but I can't
 2   remember.
 3        Q    Okay.  Do you remember if it was a man
 4   and a woman?  Three men?  Tell me about the people
 5   that you remember.
 6        A    I think it was all men, but I can't --
 7        Q    And you remember there being three or
 8   four?
 9        A    Yeah.
10        Q    And that was in the conference room area?
11        A    Yeah.  It's like this kind of table in
12   one area and then on the other.  I don't know what
13   it was for.  Didn't have hardly anything in it, and
14   that's where we all stood.
15        Q    Okay.  Were you sitting in that room, or
16   were you standing?
17        A    Standing.
18        Q    What did the doctors tell you at that
19   time?
20        A    That there was no hope for Randy.
21        Q    Do you remember anything else specific
22   that the doctors told you at that time?
23        A    I don't recall everything, but he said
24   that they could try to keep him alive, but
25   eventually, he would lose his kidneys, lose all
0150
 1   kind of functions, bodily functions.  He would
 2   never be the same again.  The only thing that was
 3   keeping him alive was the breathing thing.
 4        Q    And was there one person talking?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    But there were about three or four
 7   present?
 8        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
 9        Q    Yes?
10        A    Yes.  Sorry.
11        Q    And when they said -- when -- the person
12   who was talking, was that a man?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    And was he a doctor?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    So when the doctor told you that they
17   could keep him alive, but all of this would happen,
18   and he would eventually deteriorate, did they mean
19   that they could keep him alive -- do you know if
20   they meant that they could keep him alive in the
21   hospital for some time or that they could keep him
22   alive and he could go home, but eventually, these
23   consequences would come up?
24        A    I don't know all the -- not legal, but --
25        Q    All the technical medical stuff?
0151
 1        A    Yeah.  But they made it sound like there
 2   wouldn't be any functioning of hardly anything
 3   and -- I don't know.  That's it.
 4        Q    Did you all then go in to see Randy, or
 5   did you guys stay in the conference room and ask
 6   questions or continue talking to the doctors?
 7        A    I think a couple people asked questions,
 8   but I don't remember what they were.  I don't
 9   remember what the doctor said or anything like
10   that.  They let us go see him.  We had to dress
11   from head to toe in those white things.  We had to
12   wear masks.  Because at that time, they were still
13   hoping, but then they told us, you know, there's
14   no -- really, we got to talking about it, and he
15   wouldn't have liked to live like that.  He would
16   have been having -- somebody would have had to take
17   care of him the whole time the rest of his life.
18   So somebody sat us down and said, "You can let him
19   go."
20        Q    I appreciate you telling me about all of
21   this, and I know that this is difficult, so we'll
22   continue to go at your pace.  I only have a few
23   more questions about that.
24             You said that a couple people you think
25   probably asked some questions when you guys were in
0152
 1   the room?
 2        A    They may have.
 3        Q    You don't -- do you remember who?
 4        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
 5        Q    No?
 6        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
 7        Q    No?
 8        A    No.  Sorry.
 9        Q    Then you all went as a group in to see
10   Randy.  Is that right?
11        A    No.  They would only let a couple at a
12   time at that time.
13        Q    And were you -- did you go first?
14        A    I think it was me and Shellie and Leigh.
15   They let the three of us go in.
16        Q    And the three of you went in together?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Okay.  Was Randy alert at that time?
19        A    No.  He had the tube in his mouth.  They
20   had him wrapped except for right around here.  They
21   told us he may be able to hear us.  Every time we
22   said something, he would breathe real hard, so
23   we're hoping he heard us.
24             And then when they took us back in the --
25   the three of us back into the little area and
0153
 1   talked to us about letting him go, we didn't have
 2   to wear the masks anymore or anything else.
 3        Q    Did the three of you have a conversation
 4   about what to do in that room --
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    -- that side room?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    And was that at that time?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    And did the three of you agree on what to
11   do?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    After the three of you had that
14   conversation, do you remember the doctors telling
15   you anything more about Randy's condition?
16        A    No.
17        Q    Were you able to go then see Randy
18   without the mask --
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    -- after that point?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    After that point, were other friends and
23   family --
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    -- also in the room?
0154
 1        A    Yes.  They were letting everybody in.
 2        Q    Okay.  Do you know if when you were
 3   speaking with doctors whether anyone else went in
 4   to see Randy with the masks on?
 5        A    I don't know.  They could have.
 6        Q    When you were speaking to doctors, did
 7   you talk to anyone else other than the male doctor
 8   that spoke to you in the first conference room?
 9   Was there anyone else that worked for the hospital
10   that you spoke to when you were there?
11        A    No, not about Randy.  Is that what you
12   mean?
13        Q    Yes.
14        A    No.
15        Q    Okay.  Was the person who took Leigh,
16   Shellie, and you into the side room the same doctor
17   that spoke to you in the larger conference-like
18   area?
19        A    I think it was a woman that did that.
20        Q    So there was a male doctor that spoke to
21   you in the conference room, but then a female
22   provider who spoke with you in the side room?
23        A    I don't know.  I don't remember if she
24   was a doctor or --
25        Q    But it was a woman?
0155
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    And you don't know if she was a doctor or
 3   a nurse?
 4        A    Or -- what do you call it?
 5        Q    Or an administrator?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    Other than those two people that worked
 8   for the hospital, you didn't speak to anyone else
 9   about Randy?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Did at any point any of the doctors or
12   the nurse or the administrator tell you what
13   happened to cause his burns or his accident?
14             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
15             THE WITNESS:  They didn't go into really
16        deep depth of it, other than a lot of body
17        functions would shut down, organs and stuff.
18   BY MS. CUEVAS:
19        Q    Okay.  What I was asking is a little
20   different, which is whether you spoke with any of
21   Randy's treating providers or administrators in the
22   hospital about what actually happened during the
23   accident?
24        A    Oh, no, no.  I didn't talk to them about
25   that.
0156
 1        Q    Okay.  So none of his providers told you
 2   that Randy poured gasoline on a fire?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    None of them told you whether he told
 5   them what happened?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Did any of the providers -- strike that.
 8             When you were in the conference room, you
 9   said there were about three or four people, as you
10   remember.  Did you ever speak with the other
11   three -- two or three people?
12        A    No.
13        Q    So just the male doctor and the female
14   who spoke with you in the side room?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Did you ever talk with Shellie or Leigh
17   or anyone else that was there that day at the
18   hospital about Randy's accident?
19        A    Just Shellie and Leigh when we were
20   alone.
21        Q    Where were you guys when you were alone
22   talking?
23        A    In that little conference room where they
24   asked us what we wanted to do.
25        Q    What did you tell Shellie and Leigh about
0157
 1   the accident?
 2        A    Just that I had come back up on the deck,
 3   I heard a boom, and Randy was walking across the
 4   yard on fire.
 5        Q    And he was on fire at that point when you
 6   saw him?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    Was -- where was he on fire?
 9        A    Somewhere out there in the yard, I mean.
10        Q    I mean on his body, on his person.
11        A    Everywhere.
12        Q    He was completely engulfed?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Okay.  Did Shellie or Leigh say anything
15   else about the accident to you at that time?
16        A    No.
17        Q    Did you learn anything from Shellie about
18   the accident that day that you didn't already know
19   from being there outside with him?
20        A    No.
21        Q    No?
22        A    Huh-uh.
23        Q    In other words, because Shellie was at
24   some point outside with you and Jim and the
25   neighbors and Randy and Tom?
0158
 1        A    Uh-huh, yes.
 2        Q    Shellie didn't tell you that she saw
 3   anything?
 4        A    No.  We were too worried about -- we
 5   didn't talk about stuff like that at that point.
 6        Q    Okay.
 7        A    We were worried about what to do with
 8   Randy and --
 9        Q    Do you -- did you ever hear from any of
10   Randy's treating providers that he had grabbed the
11   wrong container?
12        A    No.
13        Q    How much longer after you and Shellie and
14   Leigh were sitting in that conference room together
15   and made a decision about what to do, about how
16   much longer did you stay at the hospital after
17   that?
18        A    You mean after we let him go?
19        Q    I mean the whole -- the whole -- from the
20   time you were making a decision about what to do,
21   how long did you stay in the hospital that day?
22        A    I don't remember the exact time.
23        Q    Do you remember how long after you guys
24   made a decision that you actually let him go?
25        A    Maybe about an hour, but I'm not sure.
0159
 1        Q    I understand.  And you weren't able to
 2   communicate with Randy?  He wasn't talking back?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    Was he making any noises at all?  You
 5   said he was breathing heavily when you spoke,
 6   right?
 7        A    He would just take a real deep breath,
 8   but we don't know if it was the machine doing it or
 9   if it was him doing it.
10        Q    Okay.  So you don't know if he was really
11   conscious at that time?
12        A    No, I don't know.  I'm sorry.
13        Q    And other than when you were waiting to
14   go see Randy and other than when you were in the
15   conference area with the three or four doctors and
16   nurses, and other than when you, Leigh, and Shellie
17   were in the side room talking about what to do,
18   were you with Randy the rest of the time you were
19   at the hospital?
20        A    I tried to be as much as possible.
21        Q    But you were not with him the whole time?
22        A    No, because other people wanted to be in
23   there.  Shellie wanted to be alone, of course.  You
24   know, I would be too and -- as much as possible.
25        Q    So as best as you can recall, about an
0160
 1   hour after you all had the conversation about what
 2   to do, that's when Randy passed.  Is that fair?
 3        A    Yeah.  They turned off the whatever it
 4   was.
 5        Q    Did you ever speak to any of his treating
 6   physicians after they turned off the machines?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    Do you remember how much longer you
 9   stayed at the hospital after you let Randy go?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Do you remember if it was a long time?
12        A    No, it wasn't a really long time.
13        Q    Does the name Robert F. Mullins sound
14   familiar, a Dr. Mullins?
15        A    I don't remember the doctors' names.
16        Q    Okay.  So you didn't have any other
17   conversations with any --
18        A    Not about Randy.
19        Q    Not about Randy.  Okay.  And not about
20   the accident?
21        A    No.
22        Q    Did you ever read any of Randy's medical
23   files?
24        A    No.
25        Q    To this point today as you sit here,
0161
 1   you've never read any of his medical files?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    No?
 4        A    Don't want to.
 5        Q    Did you ever take any notes while you
 6   were at the hospital?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    You mentioned that you'd written down the
 9   EMS woman's name, or the ambulance woman's name.
10   Did you take any other notes?
11        A    I didn't that day.  She came back -- I
12   wanted to thank her because she was so nice to me.
13   She came back about two weeks later.
14        Q    To your house?
15        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
16   Knocked on my door and told me she had kept her
17   promise.  She told Randy that I loved him.  She
18   said his last words was, "Tell Gayla I love her."
19   And she wanted to see a picture of him so that she
20   would know what he looked like before.  It
21   wasn't -- it wasn't Randy.
22        Q    When she came over, did she come over
23   unprompted?
24        A    Yeah.  I was glad because I wanted to
25   thank her for taking care of him.  That's when I
0162
 1   wrote down her name.
 2        Q    Was her name Megan Hale?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Did you write down any other notes other
 5   than her name?
 6        A    Well, the lady that was with her.
 7        Q    Who was with her?
 8        A    I don't remember her name.  She just --
 9   they knew I liked babies.  She had a baby, so --
10   she lived right behind me at the time.
11        Q    The woman that was with --
12        A    Yeah.
13        Q    -- Ms. Hale lived behind you at the time?
14        A    Yeah.
15        Q    Okay.  Did you get a call before they
16   came over?
17        A    Huh-uh.
18        Q    Just knocked on your door?
19        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
20        Q    Yeah?  They just --
21        A    They scared me.  Yes.  They scared me for
22   a second because they were in the ambulance.
23        Q    Now, Ms. Hale was in the ambulance --
24   when you said they were in the ambulance, do you
25   mean that your neighbor was also in the ambulance?
0163
 1        A    Yeah.  She's an EMS person too.  I'm
 2   sorry.
 3        Q    Okay.  So there were two people that were
 4   with EMS with Randy --
 5        A    Not this -- that day there were two
 6   people that she came up to tell me she kept her
 7   promise.
 8        Q    Okay.  But you don't remember -- other
 9   than the female from the ambulance, EMS --
10        A    No.
11        Q    -- you don't remember anybody else?
12        A    There probably was, but I didn't see
13   them.  I didn't --
14        Q    Okay.  And your neighbor was not someone
15   who was with Randy --
16        A    I don't know.
17        Q    -- in the ambulance that day?
18        A    She may have been, but all I know is she
19   came up that day that -- with Megan.
20        Q    Do you remember what time it was when you
21   left the hospital?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Do you remember if it was dark out?
24        A    It was dark.
25        Q    Do you remember if it was the same day,
0164
 1   technically?
 2        A    I don't know.
 3        Q    When you left the hospital, where did you
 4   go?
 5        A    Back home, back to mine and Randy's
 6   house.
 7        Q    And did Luc drive you back?
 8        A    No, Beverly did, because she wanted to
 9   stay with me.
10        Q    So you went back to your house that you
11   shared with Randy.  Did you and Beverly go straight
12   there?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Did you and Beverly talk about the
15   accident when you were on -- in the car on the way
16   back?
17        A    I just told her the same thing, that I
18   don't know what happened, big boom, he ran across
19   the yard engulfed in flames, and Jim came and Tom
20   came.
21        Q    Did you -- what else did you and Beverly
22   do in the car on the way back?
23        A    I kind of made her talk like I did Luc,
24   get my mind off of it, so she told me stuff that
25   had been going on with her.
0165
 1        Q    Okay.  How long did Beverly stay with you
 2   at the house after you went back?
 3        A    I think it was like a day, because she
 4   just wasn't prepared.  She just flew up there and
 5   didn't have any clothes or anything.  She came back
 6   like two days later, stayed almost a week with me.
 7        Q    Okay.  When was the first time that you
 8   went into your backyard and looked at the area
 9   where the accident had happened after the accident
10   happened, the next day or any days following?  When
11   was the first time that you --
12        A    Probably a couple of days, but I never
13   went out there, and I tried my best to avoid it.
14        Q    Okay.  So when you went -- so you did go
15   outside?
16        A    I just looked that way, and I didn't go
17   up to anything or anything like that.
18        Q    You didn't inspect --
19        A    No.
20        Q    -- the area?
21        A    No.
22        Q    When you first went back outside and
23   looked in your backyard, did you see the pillow in
24   your backyard?
25        A    I don't know.  I guess it was back there.
0166
 1   I wasn't really --
 2        Q    Do you remember seeing it?
 3        A    No, but it could have been back there, it
 4   couldn't have been.  I don't know.
 5        Q    You don't specifically remember seeing
 6   the pillow?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    Do you remember seeing a gas can in your
 9   backyard?
10        A    No.  I didn't go all the way back here.
11   I just stood out in here.
12        Q    Okay.  And from where you were standing
13   when you went back out onto your back porch, do you
14   remember where you were on your back porch?
15        A    No.
16        Q    Did you go beyond the brick area?
17        A    No.
18        Q    So you never went back beyond the brick
19   after the accident?
20        A    Huh-uh.
21        Q    No?
22        A    No.  Sorry.
23        Q    So to this day from after the accident,
24   you have not gone into your backyard?
25        A    No.
0167
 1        Q    And from where you were standing, do you
 2   remember if you were on your deck when you first
 3   looked in the backyard?
 4        A    No, I don't remember.
 5        Q    Do you remember if you were on your
 6   porch?
 7        A    I could have been, but I don't remember.
 8        Q    But from where you were standing, you do
 9   not recall seeing either the pillow or a gas can.
10   Is that right?
11        A    Yeah.  I did not see a -- I don't recall
12   seeing a pillow or a gas can.
13        Q    Okay.  Between the time that you and
14   Beverly returned to your house and when you first
15   went outside a couple days later, did you have any
16   visitors at the house?
17        A    Yeah.  There was a ton of them.
18        Q    Okay.  Do you know if anyone inspected
19   the backyard after the accident?
20        A    They probably did, but I wouldn't have
21   known it.
22        Q    So did you have any conversations with
23   anyone who went into your backyard and looked
24   around?
25        A    No.
0168
 1        Q    So as you sit here today, you have not
 2   had a single conversation with someone who
 3   inspected your backyard that was at your home after
 4   the accident?
 5        A    Not at that time.  Now, I know that
 6   somebody did, but when they inspected it or looked
 7   at it or whatever, I don't know.
 8        Q    Okay.  Who were the people that came to
 9   your property in the days that followed the
10   accident?
11        A    Friends and family.
12        Q    Did Shellie come?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Did Leigh?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Did Luc?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Did Eric?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    And do you know if any of them inspected
21   the property?
22        A    I want to say Eric and Shellie did, but I
23   don't know.
24        Q    And you don't know when that was?
25        A    Huh-uh.
0169
 1        Q    When you looked out -- when you first
 2   went outside after the accident a couple of days
 3   later, did you see any gas on the ground?
 4        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
 5        Q    Could you smell gasoline?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Was anything burnt or damaged that you
 8   could see in your yard?
 9        A    There was burnt leaves.
10        Q    Where were there burnt leaves?
11        A    Around where Randy was.
12        Q    And where was that?  If you could point.
13        A    In that area.
14        Q    In that same circle?
15        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
16        Q    Yes?
17        A    Yes.  Sorry.
18        Q    Was there -- when you were standing
19   there, could you see the burn pile from where you
20   were standing when you looked into your backyard?
21        A    No.
22        Q    Could you see any gas cans at any point
23   in your --
24        A    No.
25        Q    -- yard or property from where you were
0170
 1   standing?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    And you never personally inspected the
 4   burn -- the burn pile?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    To this day, you still have not inspected
 7   the burn pile?
 8        A    No.  I don't want nothing to do with it.
 9        Q    Okay.  Have you ever looked at the burn
10   pile that was involved in the accident since the
11   day of the accident?
12        A    I've seen it, but it's because I had to
13   go back into this area to get something that's
14   right there, so I've seen it.  I didn't stare at it
15   or --
16             MS. CUEVAS:  I'm marking as Exhibit 3 a
17        photo that was produced by the plaintiff.  And
18        for the record, this is Photo 32 of the Durig
19        photos.
20                  (Defendant's Exhibit 3, Color
21             Photograph, was marked for
22             identification.)
23   BY MS. CUEVAS:
24        Q    Do you recognize this pile of debris in
25   the photo?
0171
 1        A    Yeah.  I mean, it's a burn pile is what I
 2   call it, what we called it.
 3        Q    So this is the burn pile that was in your
 4   backyard?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Okay.  And do you know if this pile of
 7   debris in the burn pile in this photo is the same
 8   as the burn pile -- as the contents in the burn
 9   pile on the day of the accident?
10        A    No.  I don't --
11        Q    You don't know?
12        A    No.
13        Q    Does this photo sort of show debris
14   that's typical of the kind that Randy would burn in
15   the pile?
16             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
17             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, leaves and straw and
18        part of boards and --
19   BY MS. CUEVAS:
20        Q    So tell me, what kinds of things would
21   Randy typically burn in the back -- in the burn
22   pile in the backyard?
23        A    Leaves and straw and old boards and
24   sometimes cardboard boxes.
25        Q    Do you know if any of the debris that was
0172
 1   in the burn pile at the time of the accident, do
 2   you know if any of that debris has been preserved?
 3        A    I don't know.
 4        Q    Do you know who would know?
 5        A    Shellie.
 6        Q    When was the very last time that you were
 7   at your property on 8 Myrtle Island Road?
 8        A    When I moved out, whatever day was it --
 9   whatever day it was.
10        Q    And that was in May about sometime?
11        A    Yeah.
12        Q    When you had to go into the backyard to
13   get something that was in the structure and you saw
14   the burn pile, did it look more or less like this?
15        A    Yeah.
16        Q    Was there more debris in it than in this
17   photo?
18        A    I don't remember.
19        Q    Do you remember any debris that looked
20   different than the burn pile that's depicted here?
21        A    At that time?
22        Q    Uh-huh, yeah.
23        A    No, I don't remember.
24        Q    Okay.  Well, do you know if more fires
25   have been burned in this burn pile since the day of
0173
 1   the accident?
 2        A    I don't know.
 3        Q    You have no idea?
 4        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
 5        Q    Do you know if at any point between
 6   November 18th, 2018, and the last day you moved out
 7   of the property whether a fire was built in this
 8   burn pile?
 9        A    I don't think there was any when I was
10   living at the house.  I don't remember if there
11   was.  But after that, I have no idea if they burned
12   or if they didn't.
13        Q    But you don't recall any fires being
14   built in the burn pile?
15        A    I don't recall any.
16        Q    Do you have any reason to believe that
17   there was a burn -- a fire built in the burn pile
18   when you were still living at the property after
19   the accident?
20        A    I'm sorry.  Say it again.
21        Q    Do you have any reason to believe that
22   there was a fire built on the burn pile after the
23   accident when you still lived on the property?
24        A    No, I don't.
25             MS. CUEVAS:  I am marking as Defendant's
0174
 1        Exhibit 4 another photo, and for the record,
 2        this is Photo 79 of the Durig photos that were
 3        produced by the plaintiff.
 4                  (Defendant's Exhibit 4, Color
 5             Photograph, was marked for
 6             identification.)
 7   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 8        Q    Do you agree with me that this is a photo
 9   of a lighter?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Among some other things.
12             And to the best of your recollection, is
13   this a photograph -- was this photograph taken in
14   the structure that's at the end of the driveway?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    About how far would you say this
17   structure is from the burn pile in your backyard?
18        A    I'd have to guess.  If I'm -- I'm making
19   a guess.
20        Q    Do you think it's a couple of yards?
21             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
22             THE WITNESS:  I don't know.
23   BY MS. CUEVAS:
24        Q    Where this lighter is at this time, is
25   this the location where the lighter was stored on
0175
 1   the property?
 2             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 3             THE WITNESS:  Sometimes it was there,
 4        sometimes it was in the little storage area
 5        further back that way.
 6   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 7        Q    So tell me a little bit about the
 8   structure that's at the end of the driveway.  When
 9   you say there's a storage area that's further back,
10   what do you mean?
11        A    Back in here.
12        Q    Okay.  And is that -- is there a door
13   that opens and closes there?
14        A    No.
15        Q    So it's just open?
16        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
17        Q    Okay.  Is there a door frame?
18        A    A door frame.
19        Q    Okay.  And sometimes you're saying the
20   lighter sometimes was inside that structure?
21        A    Or sometimes it might be inside the
22   house.
23        Q    Okay.  The last place -- where's the last
24   place you saw the lighter?
25        A    There, I guess.
0176
 1        Q    Okay.  Do you know if Randy ever used
 2   this lighter to light the burn pile?
 3        A    He may have.
 4        Q    Do you know if he ever used this lighter
 5   to light fires on the property?
 6        A    He may have.  I don't know.
 7        Q    Did Randy ever light fires anywhere other
 8   than the burn pile on your property?
 9        A    In the fireplace.
10        Q    And that's inside?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Okay.  Anywhere else outside?
13        A    No.
14        Q    And you don't know if anyone else moved
15   this lighter to this location?
16        A    I don't know.
17        Q    At the time of the accident, do you
18   remember seeing this lighter anywhere?
19        A    No.
20        Q    Are you -- strike that.
21             Do you know whether anyone moved anything
22   between the time of the accident and the first time
23   you went out into the backyard?
24        A    I don't know.
25        Q    Now, I know you said you never really did
0177
 1   a full inspection of the area.  At any point when
 2   you walked to the back area where the burn pile is
 3   to go to that structure at the back end of the
 4   driveway, did you see any gas cans?
 5        A    I know there was at least one.
 6        Q    And is that the same one that you
 7   mentioned earlier that was always in the area under
 8   the covered part of the --
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    -- structure at the end of the driveway?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Tell me about that gas can.  What did it
13   look like?
14        A    It was red with a little spout.
15        Q    It's a red can?
16        A    Yeah.
17        Q    Do you know -- I know that you said that
18   you believe that Shellie and Eric inspected the
19   property, but do you know of anyone after the
20   accident who did for sure?
21        A    I don't know because they didn't keep me
22   in the loop of anything.
23        Q    Okay.  Do you know whether Randy's nephew
24   Clifton came to the property after the accident?
25        A    If he did, nobody told me.
0178
 1        Q    And I take it -- I think I know the
 2   answer to this question, but are you the person who
 3   retrieved the gas can that was involved in your
 4   husband's accident from your property?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    Do you know who did?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    Do you know when that can was retrieved?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Were you home when the can was retrieved,
11   as far as you know?
12        A    I could have been, because in that house,
13   people could come up and -- Shellie was there a lot
14   of times, and I didn't even know it.  You couldn't
15   hear anybody drive up.  They could go do what they
16   wanted to do and leave.  So they -- I could have
17   been home when they did it.  I don't know.
18        Q    But no one told you that they were going
19   to?
20        A    No.  Nobody told me.  They didn't keep me
21   in the loop about anything.
22        Q    And at any point after the accident, did
23   you see the gas can that was involved --
24        A    No.
25        Q    -- in Randy's accident?  No?
0179
 1        A    No.  I'm sorry.
 2        Q    During the accident, on the day of the
 3   accident, did you ever see a gas can that was
 4   involved in his accident?
 5        A    No.  It was behind the bushes.
 6        Q    How do you know it was behind the bushes?
 7        A    Because they were -- I mean, it was
 8   behind the -- where you can't see.  I didn't go
 9   back there.
10        Q    Okay.  How do you know that?
11        A    Well, I'm assuming.  That's where they
12   always were.
13        Q    All the cans were usually back there?
14        A    Well, the ones that he used the most.
15        Q    How many cans did he usually use the
16   most?
17        A    There was sometimes two there.
18             MS. CUEVAS:  I don't have that many more
19        questions, but I do have a few more about
20        cans.
21             MR. TINSLEY:  You said that about an hour
22        ago.
23             MS. CUEVAS:  Sorry, guys.
24             MR. TINSLEY:  An hour-and-a-half,
25        actually.
0180
 1             MS. CUEVAS:  Well, it is what it is.
 2             MR. TINSLEY:  I'm just saying maybe you
 3        don't build up our expectations.
 4   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 5        Q    I want to talk to you about the gas can
 6   that was involved in the accident.  Do you know who
 7   purchased the can?
 8        A    Randy did.
 9        Q    Do you know what kind of gas can it was?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Do you know who the manufacturer is?
12        A    No.
13        Q    Do you know whether Walmart manufactured
14   the can?
15        A    No.
16             MS. CUEVAS:  I am marking as Exhibit --
17        Defendant's Exhibit 5 a photograph that was
18        produced by the plaintiff in this case, and
19        for the record, this is Photo 88 of the Durig
20        photos.
21                  (Defendant's Exhibit 5, Color
22             Photograph, was marked for
23             identification.)
24   BY MS. CUEVAS:
25        Q    Mrs. West, is this a photo of the

 1   gasoline container that was involved in your
 2   husband's accident, as far as you know?
 3        A    As far as I know.
 4        Q    And it's hard to see, I apologize, but do
 5   you see on Exhibit 5, in the lower left portion of
 6   the front of the can, below, the words "Blitz USA,
 7   Inc., Miami, OK."  Can you see that?
 8        A    No.  It's too little.
 9        Q    Okay.  Can you see -- can you read any of
10   the letters that are -- that are in that area of
11   the gas can?
12        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
13        Q    No?
14        A    It's too little.  Sorry.
15        Q    Well, I will represent to you that it
16   says, "Model Number 11833."
17        A    Okay.
18        Q    Do you understand -- is that the model
19   number of the can that you understand was involved?
20        A    I don't know.  I've never --
21             MR. AKINS:  I'm sorry.  What was the
22        number again?
23             MS. CUEVAS:  11833.
24             MR. AKINS:  Thank you.

0182
 1        Q    Did you know that at some point, the gas
 2   can that was involved in your husband's accident
 3   was placed in a black trash bag?
 4        A    I know Shellie and Leigh, after a long
 5   time, told me that they had the gas can and the
 6   pillow up in the attic of this building, but I
 7   don't remember how long it was afterwards.
 8        Q    Do you remember when you had that
 9   conversation with them?
10        A    Huh-uh.
11        Q    Do you know who put it in a trash bag
12   or --
13        A    No.
14        Q    Do you know whether it was Shellie and
15   Leigh that actually retrieved the can from the area
16   of the accident?
17        A    I don't know.
18        Q    You said that Randy purchased the gas
19   can?
20        A    It was there before we got married.
21        Q    Okay.  Tell me everything that you know
22   that sort of supports your understanding that he
23   purchased the can.
24        A    I guess I assumed, since it was there
25   before we got married, that he purchased it.
0183
 1        Q    Any other reason to believe that he
 2   purchased it?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    When do you think he bought the can?
 5        A    I have no idea.
 6        Q    So you have no personal knowledge about
 7   when he purchased the can?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    Do you know where he purchased the can?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Do you know where he shopped for gas
12   cans?
13        A    No.
14        Q    So you have no idea, sitting here right
15   now, where he purchased this or any other gas can
16   that was on his property?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Now, you've mentioned that there were
19   other gas cans.  Do you know what kinds of gas cans
20   he had?
21        A    No.  They're all just gas cans to me.
22        Q    Do you know how many gas cans he had?
23        A    There was three or four on the side of
24   this building over here somewhere, and then there
25   was -- seemed like there was always two right here.
0184
 1        Q    Okay.  Would you circle the area closer
 2   to the burn pile where there were always two?
 3        A    One would go somewhere, I don't know
 4   where, but --
 5        Q    If you're having issues, I can give you
 6   another pen.  Try that one.
 7        A    Somewhere in there.
 8        Q    Okay.  And would you write next to that
 9   little circle you just did a "G" for me.
10        A    (Witness complies.)
11        Q    And where on the property -- you said the
12   other side of the structure, there were other gas
13   cans that you remember on the property.  Where was
14   that?
15        A    I'm not exactly sure.  There's a little
16   shed over here.  I don't know if that's the shed or
17   what.  But they're over here next to the shed.
18        Q    Okay.  And would you write a "G" by those
19   circles?
20        A    (Witness complies.)
21        Q    And is that area outside?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    So it's kind of open to the -- is it
24   covered?
25        A    No, not where the gas cans were.
0185
 1        Q    Okay.  And what about the first place
 2   that you marked where he stored the gas cans, was
 3   that area covered?
 4        A    Yeah, yes.
 5        Q    But was it exposed to the elements?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    Did you ever use any of Randy's fuel
 8   containers?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Did you ever fill any of them up?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Do you know where Randy filled the
13   containers?
14        A    No.
15        Q    Do you know if he filled them up at a gas
16   station?
17        A    I don't know.
18        Q    Do you know where Randy stored the gas
19   can that was involved in the accident?
20        A    In this area.
21        Q    Closer to the burn pile?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    Okay.  And you said that as you remember,
24   he stored two gas cans there?
25        A    Yeah.  I don't know why, yeah, most of
0186
 1   the time.
 2        Q    What color were they?
 3        A    I don't remember the other color.
 4        Q    Okay.  Do you remember what color the
 5   cans that were on the other side of the structure
 6   at the end of the driveway were?
 7        A    It seemed like they were yellow, but --
 8        Q    You think he had yellow cans there.
 9             MS. CUEVAS:  Okay.  I'm marking as
10        Exhibit 6 a photograph that was produced by
11        plaintiff, and it falls on Page 74 of the
12        Durig photos.
13                  (Defendant's Exhibit 6, Color
14             Photograph, was marked for
15             identification.)
16             THE WITNESS:  Oh, well, a lot I know.
17   BY MS. CUEVAS:
18        Q    You see that there are five --
19        A    Now I remember them.
20        Q    Do you see that there are five gas cans
21   in this photo?
22        A    Yes.
23             MS. CUEVAS:  I'm also going to mark as
24        Exhibit 7 another photograph that was produced
25        by the plaintiff, and this one falls at
0187
 1        Page 77 of the Durig photos, for the record.
 2                  (Defendant's Exhibit 7, Color
 3             Photograph, was marked for
 4             identification.)
 5   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 6        Q    And you see that in this photo,
 7   Exhibit 7, that there is a different-colored, sort
 8   of an orange-colored can, correct?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    And this is not one of the cans that's
11   pictured in photo Exhibit 6?
12        A    No.
13        Q    Okay.  And together -- Exhibit 6,
14   Exhibit 7, and Exhibit 5 of the gas can that was
15   involved in the accident, together, that's seven
16   different gas cans.  Do you agree?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Now, Exhibit 6 shows the gas can sort of
19   outside resting up against what appears to be some
20   siding.  Is that how you remember seeing the gas
21   cans?
22        A    Yes, just sitting out there.
23        Q    Just sitting out there outside, right?
24             So it's fair to -- it's fair that
25   these -- this -- that these gas cans were
0188
 1   photographed where they were actually stored.  Is
 2   that right?
 3        A    Yeah.  I mean, they could have been in a
 4   different order at different times or whatever, but
 5   yeah, basically.
 6        Q    And is it fair to assume that these gas
 7   cans were photographed in the same condition that
 8   they were in when your husband used them?
 9        A    Yes.  He hardly ever used them, though,
10   these.
11        Q    Okay.
12             MR. TINSLEY:  And you're pointing to
13        Exhibit 6?
14             THE WITNESS:  Yes.
15             MS. CUEVAS:  Thank you.
16   BY MS. CUEVAS:
17        Q    Exhibit 6, looking at these five gas
18   cans, the container on the far left looks to be
19   labeled "Kerosene."  Would you agree with me?
20        A    This?
21        Q    That's the one, the one on the far left.
22        A    That's kerosene?  That says "Kerosene"?
23        Q    Do you think it says "Kerosene"?
24        A    I guess.  Looks like "rosene" to me,
25   but --
0189
 1        Q    Do you see a K-E before the "rosene"?
 2        A    Huh-uh.  I see what looks like a gun and
 3   then R-O-S-E-N-E.
 4        Q    Looks like a gun and then -- okay.
 5        A    I know it's not, but it's what it looks
 6   like.
 7        Q    It does look like the marker, the ink has
 8   dripped a little when I look at it.  Well, I'm
 9   going to call this the left can, then --
10        A    Okay.
11        Q    -- if you don't believe it says
12   "Kerosene."
13        A    I mean, it probably does.
14        Q    Okay.  Well, then let's call it the
15   kerosene can, then.
16        A    Okay.
17        Q    And if you'd look at Exhibit 7, you'll
18   see that this can is marked -- is labeled "Diesel."
19   Is that right?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    I'm going to call this the diesel can,
22   okay.
23        A    Okay.
24        Q    Do you know whether Randy had any other
25   cans with a label like "Kerosene" or "Diesel" that
0190
 1   he wrote on?
 2        A    If he did, I don't know.
 3        Q    Okay.  Do you know whether Randy only
 4   stored kerosene in the kerosene can?
 5        A    I'm assuming he did.
 6        Q    That he --
 7        A    Stored kerosene in the kerosene.
 8        Q    Do you know how often he had to refill
 9   that can?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Do you know how much kerosene was in the
12   kerosene can at the time of the accident?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Do you know when Randy purchased the
15   kerosene can?
16        A    No.
17        Q    Do you know if it was Randy that
18   purchased the kerosene can?
19        A    No.
20        Q    Do you know where he purchased --
21        A    No.
22        Q    -- the can?
23             If I were to ask you any questions about
24   the contents of any of these cans, would you be
25   able to answer the questions?
0191
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Do you know where Randy purchased any of
 3   these cans?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    Do you know whether it was, in fact,
 6   Randy that purchased the cans?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    Do you know when he purchased any of the
 9   cans in Exhibit 6 or 7?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Do you know anything about any of the
12   characteristics about any of the cans that are in
13   Exhibit 6 and 7?
14        A    No.
15        Q    So if I were to ask you, for example,
16   does the can -- does the kerosene can have a
17   screen, would you be able to answer that?
18        A    No.
19        Q    The can in Exhibit 7, the diesel can, is
20   that the location -- does that appear to be the
21   location where you first marked that there were two
22   cans that he always kept on the right side of the
23   structure toward the burn pile?
24        A    Yeah, right in that location.
25        Q    And this is the diesel can that you
0192
 1   recall seeing in that area?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    Now, I don't see any yellow or blue cans
 4   in either of the three photos, actually.  Do you
 5   know if he had any other gas cans other than those
 6   that are pictured here?
 7        A    I don't know why I thought they were
 8   yellow.  They could have been purple.
 9        Q    Well, that's okay.  I'm just curious if
10   you remember seeing any other gas cans.
11        A    No, I don't remember seeing any other
12   ones.
13        Q    Okay.  I want you to look at Exhibit 6.
14   It's the photo with the five cans.  And I want you
15   to turn your attention to the middle container.
16   It's the third from the left.  Do you know what
17   kind of fuel Randy stored in there?
18        A    No.
19        Q    Do you know where he purchased that can?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Or when?
22        A    No.
23             MS. CUEVAS:  I am introducing as
24        Exhibit 8 another photo that was produced by
25        the plaintiffs, and for the record, this photo
0193
 1        is at Page 68 of the Durig photos.
 2                  (Defendant's Exhibit 8, Color
 3             Photograph, was marked for
 4             identification.)
 5   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 6        Q    If you pull out Exhibit 6 right next to
 7   Exhibit 8, would you agree that the can that's in
 8   the front of Exhibit 8, the red can, appears to be
 9   the same can that is the middle can, or the third
10   from the left, in Exhibit 6?
11        A    It appears to be.
12        Q    Now, if you look at Exhibit 8, and you
13   look at that can that's at the forefront, the red
14   can, do you see what appears to be a hole or a
15   puncture on -- in between the two handles on that
16   can?
17        A    Right here?
18        Q    Yes.
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    Do you know who put a hole in the gas
21   can?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Do you think it was Randy?
24        A    I have no idea.
25        Q    All right.  Do you know why someone might
0194
 1   put a hole in a gas can?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    Do you know if Randy modified any of the
 4   gas cans that he had on the property?
 5        A    I don't know.
 6        Q    Before Randy's accident, when was the
 7   last time that you saw the gas can that was
 8   involved in his accident, if you remember?
 9        A    Probably the day before, because we were
10   always out in this area.
11        Q    And so the can that was involved in his
12   accident, the best you can recall, is one of the
13   two cans that he stored close to the burn pile?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Do you remember where the can that was
16   involved in Randy's accident was located --
17        A    No.
18        Q    -- the last time you saw it before the
19   accident?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Do you have any reason to believe that it
22   was not in the location that you marked on
23   Exhibit 1?
24        A    I don't know why it wouldn't be there.
25        Q    Do you know what kind of fuel was in the
0195
 1   container that was involved in his accident on the
 2   day of the incident?
 3        A    No, I don't.
 4        Q    Do you know what kind of fuel Randy
 5   stored in that can?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Do you know what use Randy had for
 8   gasoline?
 9        A    All I know is he started fires, I mean,
10   did the burn pile.
11        Q    Okay.  Well, what I'm asking is if you
12   know what uses that Randy had for storing gasoline
13   in containers on the property?
14        A    I don't know what all the uses were for.
15   I don't know.
16        Q    Do you know what uses Randy had for
17   kerosene or storing kerosene in containers on the
18   property?
19        A    I probably did at one point, but I can't
20   remember at this time.
21        Q    Okay.  And the diesel can, do you know if
22   he kept anything in that can other than diesel?
23        A    I don't know if he did or not.
24        Q    You don't know what kind of fuel he put
25   in that can?
0196
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Do you know what --
 3        A    I'm sure it was diesel, I mean, if it
 4   said "Diesel."
 5        Q    Do you know what use Randy had for using
 6   or storing diesel on the property?
 7        A    Does a lawn mower use diesel?  I don't
 8   know.  Maybe.
 9        Q    So you think he may have used fuel for a
10   lawn mower?
11        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
12        Q    Do you know if he ever used a gas can to
13   refuel the lawn mower?
14        A    I'm assuming he did.  I don't know.
15        Q    Do you know if he --
16        A    I thought that's how you did it.
17        Q    Do you know if he ever used a gas can to
18   refill his car?
19        A    No.
20        Q    No, you don't know?
21        A    I don't know.
22        Q    Now, I understand that Randy was an avid
23   boater?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    And he had a boat?
0197
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    That he made?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Okay.  Do you know if he ever used gas
 5   cans to fill the boat?
 6        A    Most of the time he went to -- sounds
 7   funny, but the gas station in the boat, and he
 8   filled it up there.
 9        Q    Okay.  So did you ever see him refill the
10   boat with one of his gas cans?
11        A    I never saw him.  He may have, but I
12   never saw him.
13        Q    Okay.  Now, you said that all you know is
14   that Randy lit fires in the burn pile.  Do you know
15   how often he did that?
16        A    Three or four times a week.
17        Q    Do you know if he always burned things in
18   the pile -- strike that.
19             Did you ever see him light the burn pile?
20        A    Just once or twice.
21        Q    How did he light the burn pile when you
22   saw him once or twice?
23        A    A lot of times he would strike a match,
24   throw it on there.  Sometimes he would use that
25   lighter thing.
0198
 1        Q    The lighter?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    Do you know if he ever used an accelerant
 4   to light the fire?
 5        A    Yes, he did.
 6        Q    Did you ever see him use kerosene to
 7   light the fire?
 8        A    I don't -- I don't -- to me it all
 9   smelled the same, so he could have been using
10   kerosene or gasoline.  I don't know.
11        Q    Did it always -- what did it smell like
12   when you -- when you saw him use accelerant to
13   light a fire?
14        A    Gassy, like gas, I mean.
15        Q    Do you know the difference between what
16   kerosene smells like and gasoline?
17        A    I probably would if you were to put them
18   beside each other, but --
19        Q    But as you sit here, it all smelled the
20   same to you?
21        A    Yes.  I didn't really say, "Hey, did you
22   throw kerosene on there or gasoline?"  You know,
23   I'm not --
24        Q    Do you know what kinds of accelerants he
25   would use to light the burn pile?
0199
 1        A    Whatever was in that red can.
 2        Q    Did you ever see him use the orange can
 3   to light the fire, the burn pile?
 4        A    I don't -- I don't know.
 5        Q    Do you know if he ever used diesel fuel?
 6        A    I don't know.  He might have.  I don't
 7   know.
 8        Q    Do you know if he ever used lighter
 9   fluid?
10        A    He may have once or twice.
11        Q    Do you know why Randy used accelerants to
12   light fires in the yard?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Do you know why he would use kerosene or
15   diesel or lighter fluid instead of gasoline to
16   light a fire?
17        A    I don't know.  I don't know why anybody
18   does it.  I mean, I wouldn't, but --
19        Q    Do you know if it has anything to do with
20   the speed at which things burn?
21        A    Maybe, probably with him.
22        Q    Do you know why Randy used gasoline to
23   light a fire on the morning of the accident?
24        A    No.
25        Q    No?
0200
 1        A    (Witness moves head from side to side.)
 2        Q    Is that a no?
 3        A    Yes.  No.  I'm sorry.
 4        Q    Do you know if it was by accident?
 5        A    I don't know.
 6        Q    Do you know if Walmart had anything to do
 7   with Randy's decision to pour gasoline on a burn
 8   pile?
 9        A    I'm sure not.
10        Q    You can't recall any specific
11   circumstance where Randy used any particular type
12   of accelerant to light the burn pile, though.  Is
13   that fair?
14        A    Yes.  I don't know of any.
15        Q    All right.  Mrs. West, you're not the
16   plaintiff in this case, right, in this lawsuit?
17             MR. AKINS:  I'm going to object.  I don't
18        think she understands the term.
19   BY MS. CUEVAS:
20        Q    Do you know if you are bringing a lawsuit
21   against Walmart, you personally?
22             MR. AKINS:  I'm going to object.  That
23        falls in the purview of attorney-client
24        privilege at this point.  I can answer for her
25        if you want me to off the record or on the
0201
 1        record.  I'm not trying to be a -- I'm going
 2        to instruct her not to answer.  I can fill you
 3        in later.  And I'll stop talking.
 4             MS. CUEVAS:  All right.
 5             MR. AKINS:  That's the longest-running
 6        objection that wasn't running I've ever done
 7        in my life, but I apologize, Counsel, about
 8        it.
 9             MS. CUEVAS:  That's all right.  I
10        understand.  You've been very well behaved,
11        so --
12             MR. AKINS:  Thank you.
13   BY MS. CUEVAS:
14        Q    Mrs. West, to the extent that you can
15   answer this question without disclosing
16   communications that you have had with your
17   attorney -- I am not entitled to know the contents
18   of those communications -- were you involved in a
19   decision personally to sue Walmart in this case?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Before lawyers got involved, who did you
22   discuss that decision with?
23        A    Shellie, Eric, and Leigh.
24        Q    Outside of communications that you've had
25   with your attorney, what do you know about this
0202
 1   lawsuit that we're sitting in here for right now?
 2        A    Not much.
 3        Q    What do you know, other than what your
 4   counsel has told you?
 5        A    That we're suing Walmart.  That's all I
 6   know, I mean.
 7        Q    That's all you know?
 8        A    I don't know what else I'm supposed to
 9   know.  I'm not the lawyer.
10        Q    Okay.
11        A    I mean, I'm not trying to be ugly,
12   just --
13        Q    I don't think you're being ugly.  I just
14   want to know if there are any other facts that you
15   know about this lawsuit, other than communications
16   that you've had with your attorney.
17        A    I don't -- I don't know.
18        Q    Okay.  Do you know that in addition to
19   Randy's estate that there is a claim asserted
20   against Walmart in this case that seeks recovery on
21   your behalf as a beneficiary of his estate?
22        A    I don't understand what that means.  I'm
23   sorry.
24        Q    Okay.  Do you know that in this lawsuit,
25   if the plaintiffs, whoever that is, gets money in
0203
 1   this lawsuit that you get some money, possibly, in
 2   this lawsuit?
 3        A    Oh, yes.
 4             MS. CUEVAS:  I'm marking as Defendant's
 5        Exhibit 9 a copy of the complaint in this
 6        case.
 7                  (Defendant's Exhibit 9, Complaint,
 8             was marked for identification.)
 9   BY MS. CUEVAS:
10        Q    All right.  Please turn to Page 7.  The
11   page numbers are in the bottom center of the page.
12   And if you look toward the bottom of the page,
13   please draw your attention to where it says "34,"
14   and let me know when you're there.
15        A    Okay.
16        Q    Plaintiff and the statutory benefits of
17   William Randolph West's estate have experienced
18   great mental anguish, suffering, grief, sorrow,
19   bereavement, and loss of society, advice,
20   companionship, consortium, comfort, protection, and
21   pecuniary benefit from the loss of decedent.
22             Did I read Paragraph 34 correctly?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Now, let's go through these one by one.
25   Great mental anguish, suffering, grief, sorrow, and
0204
 1   bereavement, do you see that?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    How do you differentiate these sort of
 4   categories?
 5             MR. THOMAS:  Object to the form.
 6             MR. AKINS:  Yeah.
 7   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 8        Q    What, to you, is different from mental
 9   anguish to suffering, from suffering to grief,
10   grief to sorrow?  Is there a difference to you in
11   these words and their meaning?
12             MR. THOMAS:  Object to the form.
13             MR. AKINS:  Yeah, same.
14             THE WITNESS:  All I know is I have them
15        all.  I'm going to therapy.  I have PTSD.  I
16        no longer have the person that I counted on
17        and loved.
18   BY MS. CUEVAS:
19        Q    So in your mind, these words, they all
20   mean -- do they all mean something different?  Do
21   you know what they mean?
22             MR. THOMAS:  Object to the form.
23             MR. AKINS:  Same.
24             THE WITNESS:  I don't understand why I'm
25        having to have a -- tell definitions of words.
0205
 1   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 2        Q    Okay.  Well, I'm asking the questions,
 3   and you're under an obligation to answer them
 4   unless your attorney instructs you not to.
 5             So my question is:  How do you
 6   differentiate what these terms mean from one
 7   another?  Do you, or do they all mean the same
 8   thing to you?
 9             MR. THOMAS:  Same objection.
10             MR. AKINS:  Same objection.  You may
11        answer if you know.
12             THE WITNESS:  Can you ask it in a
13        different way?  I don't --
14   BY MS. CUEVAS:
15        Q    Sure.  Does anguish mean something
16   different than suffering to you?
17        A    They all have different definitions.
18        Q    So they all mean something different to
19   you?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Okay.  How much are you asking the jury
22   to give you for your anguish, suffering, grief,
23   sorrow, and bereavement?
24             MR. AKINS:  I'm going to object to that.
25             MR. THOMAS:  Object to the form.
0206
 1             THE WITNESS:  I object to that.
 2   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 3        Q    Okay.  Well, I'm sorry, but you need to
 4   answer the question.
 5             MR. AKINS:  If you --
 6             THE WITNESS:  You want me to throw
 7        something out there and insult you?
 8             MR. AKINS:  No, no, no, no.
 9   BY MS. CUEVAS:
10        Q    I'm asking you -- I'm asking you what
11   you're asking --
12        A    There's not enough money out there to
13   cover the loss of my husband.  I'll just tell you
14   that.  There is not enough money out there.
15        Q    Okay.  Okay.
16        A    There is not enough money to cover the
17   other people that these people have killed and are
18   probably going to still kill because they won't
19   correct it.
20        Q    And what is your --
21        A    I'm sorry.
22        Q    Let's continue.  Loss of society is the
23   next thing that is in the complaint.  What exactly
24   do you understand --
25        A    I don't know what that means.
0207
 1        Q    Okay.  What about loss of advice?  What
 2   does that mean?
 3        A    That's who I went to.  I went to Randy
 4   for advice.  So yeah, I lost my advice -- adviser.
 5   I lost my companion.  I lost my comforter, my
 6   protecter.
 7        Q    And do you think of those things as being
 8   different:  Society and advice and companionship
 9   and comfort?
10             MR. THOMAS:  Object to the form.
11             MR. AKINS:  Same objection.
12             THE WITNESS:  I still don't understand
13        what you're trying to get at.  Of course
14        they're all different.  They come in a
15        package.  I don't understand what you're
16        wanting.
17   BY MS. CUEVAS:
18        Q    I'm not wanting anything other than what
19   your testimony is, and I hope you can understand
20   that this is my only opportunity to ask you --
21        A    I'm not mad at you.  I just --
22        Q    -- about a claim that has been asserted
23   for your benefit.
24        A    I'm not mad at you.
25        Q    So I understand.  This is difficult, and
0208
 1   I appreciate you talking with me about this, I
 2   really do.
 3             The next, is there -- is there an amount
 4   of money that you think the jury should give you
 5   for society, advice, companionship?
 6             MR. AKINS:  I'm going to object.  I'm
 7        sorry.  Were you finished?
 8             MS. CUEVAS:  That's it.  Yes.
 9             MR. AKINS:  I object.
10             MR. THOMAS:  Object to the form.
11             THE WITNESS:  I still have to answer?
12   BY MS. CUEVAS:
13        Q    Yes.
14             MR. AKINS:  I think she's already -- it's
15        been asked and answered.
16   BY MS. CUEVAS:
17        Q    You still have to answer.
18        A    There's not enough money out there.
19        Q    Okay.  The next thing listed here is
20   consortium.  What do you think this refers to?
21        A    The comfort, the love, everything that
22   goes with a marriage, the talking, the relaxing
23   together, laughing together, sex, everything.
24        Q    Okay.  And I want to ask you about your
25   relationship with Randy.
0209
 1        A    Okay.
 2        Q    Was it a very happy relationship?
 3        A    For the most part.  We had -- we were
 4   like every married couple.  We had our little
 5   tiffs.
 6        Q    Sure.  And did you -- and I'm very sorry
 7   that I have to ask this question, just so you know.
 8   You mentioned, you know, talking, relaxing, sex,
 9   everything.  Did you have an active sexual life
10   with your husband?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Okay.  How often would you say that you
13   and your husband had sex?
14        A    Twice a week.
15        Q    I imagine that your answer to the
16   difference between the loss of comfort or his
17   protection would be the same as when I asked you
18   about the other categories, but if it would be
19   different, I want you to tell me if there's
20   anything different about the amount of money that
21   you would ask a jury to give you for the loss of
22   those things.
23        A    The comfort and the what?
24        Q    And the protection.
25             MR. THOMAS:  Object to the form.
0210
 1             MR. AKINS:  Same objection.
 2             THE WITNESS:  Same answer.
 3   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 4        Q    Finally, pecuniary benefit from the loss
 5   of Randy.  You mentioned that you did not work when
 6   you were married to Randy, right?
 7        A    Yes, I did not work.
 8        Q    And were you financially dependent on him
 9   then?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Were you completely financially dependent
12   on him?
13        A    Yes.
14             MR. WRAY:  You got a couple minutes.
15             MS. CUEVAS:  Yeah.  That's it.
16             MR. WRAY:  Do you want to take a break?
17             MS. CUEVAS:  On the tape only a couple
18        minutes?
19             MR. WRAY:  Yeah, yeah.
20             MS. CUEVAS:  Like how many?
21             MR. WRAY:  Two.
22             MS. CUEVAS:  Two, okay.  Let's change the
23        tape.
24             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right.  This is
25        the end of Media Number 3 in the deposition of
0211
 1        Gayla West.  We are off the record at
 2        2:16 p.m.
 3                  (A recess transpired.)
 4             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the beginning
 5        of Media Number 4 in the deposition of Gayla
 6        West.  We are on the record at 2:22 p.m.
 7   BY MS. CUEVAS:
 8        Q    Mrs. West, you mentioned that you met
 9   Randy at the building.  I believe it was the
10   antique store.  Is that right?
11        A    Red Wagon, yes.
12        Q    Red Wagon, yes.  Did someone introduce
13   the two of you?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Who?
16        A    Actually, his partner.  And I thought of
17   it earlier.  I should have said it.
18        Q    His business partner?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    Do you remember what his business
21   partner's name is now?
22        A    No.  I thought of it earlier.  You were
23   talking, and I didn't want to interrupt.
24        Q    Oh, you're too nice.  Should have
25   interrupted me.
0212
 1             Okay.  So Randy's business partner
 2   introduced you.  Did you know this business partner
 3   previously?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    How did you meet the business partner?
 6        A    It was -- one of my really good friends,
 7   she owned the Red Wagon, and I lived in a little
 8   tiny apartment that was inside Red Wagon.
 9        Q    Okay.  And so just let me understand.
10   Your friend introduced you to Randy's business
11   partner.  Is that right?
12        A    He was there more than Randy was, because
13   he lives in Georgia, so he was the one doing all
14   the business stuff, you know, finding out how to do
15   this, doing that, all that stuff, the everyday
16   running of it.
17        Q    And so you just happened to sort of get
18   to know him that way, from being in there?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    Okay.  Now, you'd mentioned that you're
21   in the middle of an estate dispute with some of
22   Randy's family.  Who is involved in that dispute?
23        A    Shellie and Leigh.
24        Q    Shellie and Leigh.  And are they suing
25   you, or are you suing them, if you know?
0213
 1        A    I don't -- is it called suing?  I don't
 2   know the legal term.
 3        Q    Do you know what the issue is in the
 4   dispute, in your terms?
 5        A    They don't think I have a right to
 6   anything.  That's all I know.
 7        Q    So it's about the inheritance?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Okay.  When you were talking about the
10   accident, and you mentioned that you smelled gas,
11   where did you smell gas?
12        A    Just out in the yard, like.  I don't
13   know.
14        Q    Was it -- was it specifically on Randy or
15   in a particular area of the yard?
16        A    I don't know.  I don't -- I just know it
17   was out there.
18        Q    You just smelled gas in the air?
19        A    Yeah.
20        Q    Yes?
21        A    Yes.  I'm sorry.
22        Q    Okay.  Do you know if anyone actually saw
23   Randy's accident?
24        A    No, I don't know.
25        Q    Do you know --
0214
 1        A    I don't see how they could have.  There
 2   was nobody back there.
 3        Q    Okay.  And do you know, if you're
 4   standing at your neighbor's house, if you can see
 5   the burn pile in the backyard?
 6        A    I don't know.  I never thought about
 7   that, but I don't know.
 8        Q    So as far as you know, there isn't anyone
 9   who has claimed to have seen the accident
10   firsthand?
11        A    Not that I know of.
12        Q    When we were talking a little bit about
13   Randy using accelerants when he's lighting fires,
14   you said that you don't do that?
15        A    Huh-uh.
16        Q    No?
17        A    I'm scared of it.
18        Q    Why?
19        A    Because -- especially now.
20        Q    Right, but before.  Did you do it before
21   the accident?
22        A    No.  I don't -- I don't want to.
23        Q    Why not?
24        A    I don't like fires that much.
25        Q    Okay, all right.  Did you and Randy have
0215
 1   a prenuptial agreement?
 2        A    We -- I signed one three days before,
 3   because Shellie kept on and on and on.
 4        Q    Do you know the terms of that agreement?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    Do you know sort of the legal effect of
 7   what that agreement says?
 8        A    That I wouldn't get anything, I guess.
 9        Q    Is that your only understanding about the
10   prenuptial agreement?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Is there anything else about Randy's
13   accident that you have not told me today about what
14   happened or what you saw or what you heard that you
15   have not yet told me?
16        A    I can't think of anything right now, or I
17   would tell you.
18        Q    All right.  I have no further questions.
19             MR. THOMAS:  I don't have any questions.
20             MR. AKINS:  None for me.
21             MR. WRAY:  Do we need to wait on Mark?

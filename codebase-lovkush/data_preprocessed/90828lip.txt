            12             BY MS. KYLIS:

            13        Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Lippman.

            14             We were introduced briefly off the

            15    record, but for the record, my name is

            16    Kelly Kylis, and along with Jennifer Alexander,

            17    we represent the defendants in the case filed by

            18    Ms. Regina Johnson for which we have brought you

            19    here today.

            20             To begin, would you please state your

            21    name and business address.

            22        A.   My name is Kenneth R. Lippman.  My

                                                                  4





             1    office address is 809 North Charles Street.

             2    That's Baltimore, Maryland 21201.

             3        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

             4             Now, have you had your deposition taken

             5    before?

             6        A.   I have.

             7        Q.   Very good.

             8             Well, since you have, I will just go

             9    over a couple very brief ground rules that you

            10    probably already know.

            11             The first, as Madam Court Reporter has

            12    just reminded me, we must speak slowly and

            13    clearly so that she can accurately record

            14    everything that we say.

            15             Secondly, all responses must be verbal,

            16    yes, no, or whatever the answer may be.

            17             Thirdly, it's very important that we

            18    don't talk over each other so that she can

            19    accurately record everything that we say.

            20             Finally, if you don't understand any of

            21    my questions, please let me know, and I will be

            22    happy to rephrase them.  It's very important

             1    that we are on the same page at all times so

             2    that we have an accurate and clear record going

             3    forward.

             4             Okay?

             5        A.   Okay.

             6        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

             7             Let me show you first what I have

             8    premarked as Deposition Exhibit Number 1.  This

             9    is your notice of deposition, essentially your

            10    invitation to be here today.

            11             Have you seen this document before?

            12        A.   I have not.

            13        Q.   Okay.  Attached to this deposition

            14    notice, if you wouldn't mind taking a quick

            15    look, is a document schedule.

            16        A.   Okay.

            17        Q.   This document schedule requested you to

            18    bring pretty much just a copy of your file

            19    regarding Ms. Johnson.

            20             I see you have some papers with you

            21    today.

            22             What did you bring with you today?

             1        A.   This is basically the office file.

             2        Q.   And what does that include?

             3        A.   Well, there's -- there is one report

             4    from July 16, 2019.  There's actually a separate

             5    report that's not in here as well.

             6             There's the form that Ms. Johnson fills

             7    out when she comes into the office, a patient

             8    history form.

             9             There's a couple pages of my notes.

            10             There's a letter from Paula Valese.

            11             There's some -- there's some x-ray

            12    reports from GW.

            13             Some of the forms that Ms. Johnson

            14    signs when she comes in.

            15             Some of the forms that she didn't sign

            16    when she came in.

            17             And -- oh.  And then there's a letter

            18    from Mr. Covacevich, who unfortunately is not

            19    with us today.

            20        Q.   Right.  Not that he's dead, just --

            21        A.   Yeah.  Just for the day, just for the

            22    day and could not be with us.

             1        Q.   Thank you.

             2        A.   Yeah.

             3             And then there's the -- basically the

             4    bill that my office generates.

             5             And then there's a binder of records.

             6        Q.   Great.

             7             Now, the binder of records that you

             8    have, where did you receive those?

             9        A.   Well, it came with this letter from

            10    Mr. Covacevich.

            11        Q.   Okay.

            12             Okay.  Now, the first item that you

            13    listed in the documents that you brought with

            14    you today is the 7-16-19 report?

            15        A.   Yes.

            16        Q.   I think that you said to me that there

            17    was another report.

            18             When you said that, what did you mean?

            19        A.   I meant just what I said.  There's a --

            20    after I completed this report, I wrote another,

            21    sort of supplemental, additional report, which I

            22    don't think you have.

             1        Q.   Okay.

             2        A.   Okay?

             3        Q.   And why did you not bring it with you

             4    today?

             5        A.   Because it just didn't get -- for some

             6    reason, it's not in the file, but I know about

             7    it, and then -- so I -- I can print it out -- I

             8    can read it to you.  In fact, I can read it off

             9    my phone to you.  It's just a couple -- maybe

            10    one paragraph or so.  But it just wasn't -- for

            11    some reason, it didn't get put in the file.

            12        Q.   Okay.

            13        A.   So the file got processed and billed

            14    without it.

            15        Q.   Understood.

            16        A.   Yeah.

            17        Q.   That second report, when did you

            18    complete it?

            19        A.   I think it has the same date on it.

            20        Q.   It's also from July 16?

            21        A.   It's from July 16, yeah.

            22        Q.   And why was it -- why did you do a

             1    second report on the same day?

             2        A.   Because after I completed it, then I

             3    realized that the impairment issue was not

             4    addressed.  And I don't think it was actually --

             5    I don't know that it was requested in the letter

             6    or addressed in the letter, so I -- I guess at

             7    some point it crossed my mind that that would be

             8    an issue that would come up, so I just -- while

             9    it was fresh in my mind, I dictated something

            10    about it.

            11             MS. KYLIS:  Okay.  If that report

            12    could be produced I guess to counsel and then to

            13    me --

            14             MR. KEARNS:  Yes.

            15             THE WITNESS:  Well, I'll be happy to.

            16    I can't physically do it here.  I can read it

            17    to you if you want.  I mean, I would just read

            18    it in if you want just so you have an idea what

            19    it says.  But if you want me to just send it to

            20    you when I get back to the office, I'm happy to

            21    do that as well.

            22             MS. KYLIS:  I think that would be fine.

             1    I mean, maybe just as a formality we can leave

             2    the deposition open for it?

             3             MR. KEARNS:  You know, you could ask

             4    him, you know, what the substance of the report

             5    is and any opinions that he may have from it.

             6             MS. KYLIS:  Yes.  I do intend to.

             8    we're going to get you a copy of the document,

             9    though.

            10             MS. KYLIS:  Right.

            11             MR. KEARNS:  Yes.

            12             MS. KYLIS:  Yes.  I think that would be

            13    good.

            15        Q.   All right.  Well, while we're on the

            16    subject, can you tell me generally the substance

            17    of the -- what we're going to call the second

            19        A.   Sure.

            20             Do you mind if I reference it?

            21        Q.   Sure.

            22        A.   If I look at it?

             1             Okay.

             2             Do you want me to just read it to you

             3    or just tell you what it says?

             4        Q.   If it would be easier, Doctor, to read

             5    it, that would be fine.

             6        A.   It says "Orthopedic Surgeon's Report."

             7    It's dated July 16, 2019.  And it references

             8    Regina Johnson.

             9             And it says (as read):  Following

            10    review of submitted medical records and the

            11    examination performed on 7-16-19, it could be

            12    said with a reasonable degree of medical

            13    probability and certainty that there is

            14    permanent impairment demonstrated.  This

            15    impairment is considered to be a result of the

            16    injuries sustained when she was shopping

            17    2-2-16.  The impairment is represented in her

            18    current symptomatology, the physical examination

            19    and the imaging results.  This includes the

            20    myelomalacia reported by Dr. Hung.

            21             And it says "Kenneth R. Lippman, M.D."

            22        Q.   Great.  Thank you.

             1        A.   You're welcome.

             2        Q.   Doctor, while we're on this -- I'm

             3    going to just keep referring to it as the

             4    second report -- the last line of this report,

             5    you were discussing that your opinions were

             6    based on the symptomatology and included -- and

             7    you used a medical term.  I was hoping you could

             8    give me a definition of that medical term that

             9    you used in layman's terms, the diagnosis from

            10    Dr. Young.

            11        A.   Hung.

            12        Q.   Hung.  Sorry.

            13        A.   H-U-N-G.

            14             Well, the term is "myelomalacia,"

            15    M-Y-E-L-O-M-A-L-A-C-I-A.  And basically that's a

            16    softening of the cord, the spinal cord.  It's

            17    when the cord turns to mush.

            18        Q.   And what causes that condition?

            19        A.   Well, it could be caused -- it's caused

            20    by some injury to the cord.

            21        Q.   Okay.  Now, we'll get into the

            22    mechanism of injury here in a minute, but I just

             1    want to focus on this while we're on it.

             2             Can you explain to me the basis for

             3    your opinion that this softening of the

             4    spinal cord is causally related to the incident

             5    that occurred at Walmart on February 20, 2016.

             6        A.   Well, there's no indication in the

             7    records that she had any type of problem,

             8    difficulty or concerns that would suggest the

             9    diagnosis of myelomalacia prior to the events of

            10    February --

            11        Q.   20th?

            12        A.   It was 20th.  I just realized that this

            13    one says "02" instead of "20," so the one I read

            14    to you has the wrong date on it.

            15        Q.   Okay.

            16        A.   Okay?

            17        Q.   We can forgive that.

            18        A.   Yes.  Thank you.

            19             So prior to the events of February 20,

            20    2016, she was quite -- she was physically

            21    active and had no symptoms that would be

            22    associated -- that would lead to entertaining

             1    such a diagnosis.

             2             And then when you go through the

             3    initial medical reports, the ones that are

             4    generated basically in the days, weeks and

             5    months following the injury, you see symptoms

             6    that are highly suggestive of this type of

             7    diagnosis.

             8             The -- there's a description of the

             9    initial injury, the unsteadiness that she had,

            10    the ataxia, the radiating symptomatology.  That

            11    and other symptoms are very suggestive of this

            12    type of diagnosis that was eventually made by

            13    MRI.

            14        Q.   Right.

            15             And that diagnosis didn't come until

            16    the MRI in 2018; correct?

            17        A.   That's correct.  There was not an MRI

            18    of the neck in 2016 or 2017, and to the best of

            19    my knowledge, there was not one prior to

            20    2016 either.

            21        Q.   Correct.  Okay.

            22             Now, based on the description you just

             2    if I'm wrong, but it sounds like your opinion is

             3    based on the fact that she did not have any

             4    symptoms of this condition prior to the incident

             5    but did after.

             6             Did you review any medical records of

             7    Ms. Johnson that predate the February 20, 2016

             8    incident?

             9        A.   I did not.

            10        Q.   Okay.

            11        A.   I don't know of any.

            15    assessment that she did not have those symptoms

            16    prior to the February 20, 2016 incident based

            17    solely on her history that she provided to you

            18    verbally when she came in for her visit?

            19        A.   It's based on the history and the lack

            20    of records.

             1    February 20, 2016 incident?

             2        A.   No.  I don't know of any.

             3        Q.   Okay.

             4        A.   I mean, if there are some, I -- I'd be

             5    happy to look at them.  But as we sit here, I

             6    don't know of any.

             7        Q.   Okay.  So when you say "lack of

             8    records," that doesn't necessarily mean that

             9    those records don't exist, it's simply that you

            10    were not provided them to review?

            11        A.   I don't know of any that do exist or

            12    don't exist.  I just don't have any information,

            13    other than I asked her in some way if there was

            14    something like this that predated the events of

            15    2016, and she didn't indicate that there were,

            16    and I don't know that any records have been

             1    on your opinions as to this permanent

             2    impairment referenced in your second report

             4    than the information you've previously provided

             6    basis for that opinion that you can tell me

             7    about as we sit here today?

             8        A.   I'm sorry.  Could you run the question

            11    have you done any kind of quantitative

            14        A.   No.

            16    assessment or anything like that?

            17        A.   No.  I haven't done -- if you're asking

             1    impairment, what does that mean?

            14    starting with college.

            15        A.   I went to college at Clark University,

            16    which is in Worcester, Massachusetts.

            17             After that, I went to medical school,

            19    city of New York.

            20             After that, I completed a one-year

             1    orthopedic residency program at State University

             2    of New York Stony Brook.  I completed that in

             3    1985.

             4        Q.   Great.

             5             And are you board-certified, Doctor?

             6        A.   I am not currently board-certified by

             7    the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery.  I

             8    have been in the past.  I have board

             9    certification from the National Board of

            10    Physicians and Surgeons.

            11        Q.   Forgive me.  You are board-certified

            12    with the second entity you just named?

            13        A.   Yes.

            14        Q.   And which one was that?

            15        A.   It's the National Board of Physicians

            16    and Surgeons.

            17        Q.   And were you previously board-certified

            18    by -- what was the first entity you listed?

            19        A.   You're talking about the ABOS?

            20        Q.   Yes.

            21        A.   I have been on probably three

            22    occasions.

             1        Q.   Okay.  And is there a reason why you're

             2    no longer certified with them?

             3        A.   My certification ran out at the end of

             4    last year.

             5        Q.   Do you intend to recertify?

             6        A.   I'm planning on it.

             7        Q.   Okay.  And what is the difference

             8    between the certification with the ABOS and the

             9    national board?

            10        A.   I don't know that I could explain to

            11    you what the difference is.  It's just another

            12    organization.

            13        Q.   Do you have to recertify with the

            14    national board?

            15        A.   You do.

            16        Q.   How frequently do you have to do that?

            17        A.   I'm not -- I'm actually not sure.  I'd

            18    have to look it up.

            19        Q.   Okay.

            20        A.   But it's relatively -- like -- I don't

            21    know if it's two years or five years.  I really

            22    don't remember, though.  It's just something I

             3             And in what specialty are you

             4    certified?

             5        A.   In orthopedics.

             6        Q.   Does that include surgery?

             7        A.   It does.  It does, yeah.

             8        Q.   Do you hold any state licenses?

             9        A.   I do.

            10        Q.   Which states?

            11        A.   I'm licensed to practice medicine in

            12    the state of Maryland.

            13        Q.   Is that it?

            14        A.   That's it.

            15        Q.   Do you maintain any privileges at any

            16    hospitals?

            17        A.   Yes, I do.

            18        Q.   Which hospitals?

            19        A.   I currently have staff privileges at

            20    St. Joseph's and at GBMC.

            21        Q.   All right.  Since, unfortunately, I

            22    don't have a copy of your CV, could you just

             1    give me your brief job history.

             2             Where do you work now?

             3        A.   I'm in private practice, work out of

             4    two offices, the one that was the business

             5    address I gave you, and then I have another

             6    office that I work out of a half day a week on

             7    Eastern Avenue.

             8        Q.   And do you own that practice?

             9        A.   I own that practice, yes.

            10        Q.   Okay.  How long have you owned that

            11    practice?

            12        A.   That practice probably goes back to the

            13    late '80s sometime.

            14        Q.   Do you hold any other positions

            15    currently?

            16        A.   I'm not sure I understand the

            17    question.  What kind of positions are you

            18    referring to?

            19        Q.   Anything from teaching, another --

            20    another practice that you work in?

            21        A.   No, I don't work in any other

            22    practices.

             1        Q.   Do you do any teaching?

             2        A.   No.

             4        A.   No.

             9        Q.   Okay.

            10        A.   I mean, there were some publications

            11    when I was in residency at that time, but I

            12    couldn't tell you what they were or -- but

            13    nothing since I've been in private practice.

            14        Q.   Okay.

            15             Now, in your private practice, what do

            16    you do, if you could just briefly describe your

            17    job?

            18        A.   I do whatever -- whatever I can and

            19    whatever the day calls for.

            20             So I have an office-based practice.  I

             4    Thank you.

             5             Do you have any administrative

             6    responsibilities as part of owning your

             7    practice?

             8        A.   Yeah.  I got to keep it going.

             9        Q.   I assumed the answer would be yes.

            12    is spent doing administrative duties as compared

            13    to actual practicing medicine?

            14        A.   I don't really know, like I never

            15    really thought about breaking it down that way,

            16    but it's -- it's more time than it's ever been

            17    before.  It seems like every day it's more and

            18    more, but it's not -- I don't think it's the

            19    majority.  It's -- most of the time it's

            20    patient care, but that in and of itself

            21    generates administrative issues, so I'm not

            22    really sure where you draw the line between the

             1    two.

             2        Q.   Okay.

             3             Do you perform surgeries?

             4        A.   I do.

             5        Q.   What kind of procedures do you do?

             6        A.   Carpal tunnel releases, arthroscopies,

             7    mostly shoulders and knees, some joint

             8    replacements.

             9             That's what I do mostly now.  I mean,

            10    the nature of my surgery is not like it used to

            11    be.

            12        Q.   What did it used to be?

            13        A.   I used to do a lot of spine work, don't

            14    really do spine work anymore.

            15        Q.   Is there a reason why?

            16        A.   There's a couple reasons.  I mean, it's

            17    just -- it just doesn't work out the same way

            18    anymore.

            19        Q.   What do you mean by that?

            20        A.   First of all, I don't -- patient

            21    population isn't the same, like I used to always

            22    see people that needed spine surgery and I just

             1    don't see that very often anymore.

             2             I used to work very closely with a

             3    neurosurgeon.  I don't work with him anymore.

             4    He left town, basically.

             5             So just -- it's just a different kind

             6    of practice than it was a couple years ago.

             7        Q.   You said "a couple years ago."

             8             About when did your practice change

             9    from doing a lot of spine work to now being

            10    mostly shoulders and knees?

            11        A.   I'd say probably in the three to

            12    five-year range or something like that.

            13        Q.   Okay.  As it is now, how much of your

            14    practice is spine work?  If you could put a

            15    percentage on it.

            16        A.   I probably haven't been in on a spine

            17    case in well over a year, so it's really not --

            18    I don't -- the ones that I have I send out now.

            19        Q.   Okay.

            20             And do you do any medical-legal work?

            21        A.   Yes.

             1    medical-legal work?

             2        A.   Well, I guess you'd have to define what

             3    that is.  I mean, I guess -- I guess this is

             4    medical-legal work.  I don't see it as

             5    medical-legal work, but you see it in a

             6    different way.

             7             So I do evaluations some.  On different

             8    days it's different amounts.  Many days I don't

             9    see any at all and some days I'll see a couple

            10    of them, and so it depends.  But it's not a

            11    large percentage of the practice where I'll do

            12    a -- this type of evaluation.

            13        Q.   Would you be able to put a numerical

            14    percentage on it?

            15        A.   I'd say it -- well, not really.  I

            16    mean, I don't have a statistical way of doing

            17    that.  But it's -- it's an infrequent part.

            18        Q.   You mentioned that you brought with you

            19    today your billing records for this matter.

             9    and then there's a charge for medical record

            10    review, so it all adds up to 1813.

            11        Q.   Okay.

            12             Do you have a rate sheet, or do you

            13    simply charge 750 an hour, for your

            14    medical-legal consulting work?

            15        A.   So there's a -- I think I know what you

            16    mean by "a rate sheet," so there's -- there's a

            17    piece of paper that has certain charges on it

            18    for depositions, trials, things like that,

            19    medical record review.  I don't have it with me,

            20    but there is such a document.

            21        Q.   Okay.  How much do you charge for

            22    deposition or trial testimony?

                                                                 30





             1        A.   So if it's charged on an hourly rate,

             2    my recollection is it's -- for this deposition

             3    it would be $750 for the first hour and $600 for

             4    each additional hour or part thereof.

             5        Q.   Yes.  I'm trying very hard to keep this

             6    to an hour.

             7             What about trial testimony?

             8        A.   Trial testimony is sometimes billed on

             9    an hourly basis and then it's sometimes billed

            10    on a daily rate, and I don't actually know what

            11    it says about the daily rate, if it does.

            12        Q.   Okay.

            13             Now, obviously you are here on behalf

            14    of the plaintiff.

            15             Do you do any work for defendants as

            16    well?

            17        A.   I have.  Yes.

            18        Q.   When is the last time you had a defense

            19    case?

            20        A.   I don't recall specifically, but within

            21    the last six months or so I would guess.

            22        Q.   How much -- if you can estimate, how

             1    much of your medical-legal consulting practice

             2    is on behalf of plaintiffs versus defendants?

             3        A.   I would say that it's mostly plaintiff

             4    and occasionally defense.

             5        Q.   Okay.  Have you testified in court in a

             6    medical-legal capacity?  As an expert witness?

             7    I'm sorry.  That was a bad question.

             8        A.   Yes, I have.

             9        Q.   When you testified in court as an

            10    expert witness, were you qualified as an expert

            11    in that court?

            12        A.   Yes.

            13        Q.   Which court was that or what courts,

            14    plural, if --

            15        A.   I don't know that I could list all the

            16    courts I've ever -- I mean, you're talking about

            17    thirty-plus years, so -- but I've been accepted

            18    as an expert in the courts in Baltimore City,

            19    Baltimore County, Montgomery County, probably

            20    Howard County, Harford County, and I'm sure

            21    other ones, too, but I don't recall -- oh, in

            22    Southern Maryland, so -- as well.  I don't

             1    remember which county specifically.

             2        Q.   Okay.

             3             What kind of cases have you testified

             4    in as an expert witness?

             5        A.   Basically cases that involve orthopedic

             6    injuries.

             7        Q.   Have you ever not been accepted as an

             8    expert in a court?

             9        A.   No.  I don't think so.

            10        Q.   Okay.

            11             Doctor, what, if anything, did you do

            12    to prepare for your deposition today?

            13        A.   I went through the records that I had

            14    regarding Ms. Johnson and I read my report.  I

            15    also looked at the images that I have.

            16        Q.   Those are the diagnostic images?

            17        A.   Yes.  The ones from George Washington.

            18        Q.   Great.

            19             When you saw Ms. Johnson in 2018, did

            20    you take additional x-rays or other diagnostic

            21    imaging?

            22        A.   I did.

             1        Q.   Okay.

             2        A.   That was on the bill, so --

             3        Q.   That's what I thought.

             4        A.   Right.

             5        Q.   Before I get to those, did -- in

             6    preparation for your deposition today, did you

             7    speak with plaintiff's counsel Mr. Kearns, who's

             8    where with us?

             9        A.   I did.

            10        Q.   And what did you talk about?

            11        A.   Well, I -- the first thing we talked

            12    about is that it's not Mr. Covacevich and he's

            13    kind of new to the case.  And I spoke to him

            14    actually on the phone a couple weeks ago just to

            15    make sure that he had the report and that things

            16    were still scheduled for this time.

            17             That was about the extent of it.

            18             And then today we spoke, but it was

            19    really just socially.  I mean, he just wanted to

            20    make sure I had my report and if I had any

            21    questions, which I really didn't have of him.

            22        Q.   Great.

             1             Now, you referenced Mr. -- please

             2    forgive me for butchering his name --

             3    Covacevich -- Covacevich?

             4             MR. KEARNS:  Covacevich.

             5             BY MS. KYLIS:

             6        Q.   Covacevich.

             7             Did you speak with him before today's

             8    deposition?

             9        A.   Not that I recall.

            10        Q.   Okay.

            11             In preparation for today's deposition

            12    did you speak with anyone else?

            13        A.   I spoke with someone in my office that

            14    told me I had to be here for the deposition who

            15    reminded me, but other than that, no.

            16        Q.   Nothing substantive.

            17        A.   Nothing substantive.

            18        Q.   Okay.  Great.

            19             Have you reviewed any discovery in this

            20    case?

            21        A.   No.  I'm not familiar with that.

             1    Ms. Johnson's deposition transcript?

             2        A.   I actually think I have.  I think it

             3    may have been sent to me after I -- it may have

             4    been sent to me and I -- but I don't recall.

             5    I'd have to look it up to check for sure.

             6        Q.   Do you know if you've read it?

             7        A.   If it was sent to me, I probably read

             8    it, yeah.

             9        Q.   Okay.

            10        A.   But I don't think I had it at the time

            11    of the visit.  I think I got it recently.

            12        Q.   Okay.

            13             Now, you referenced all of the medical

            14    records that you reviewed prior to your visit

            15    with Ms. Johnson of which you have brought with

            16    you here today; correct?

            17        A.   Correct.

            18        Q.   Along with those medical records did

            19    you review any medical bills or charges?

            20        A.   I don't think so.

            21        Q.   Okay.

            22        A.   I don't think there are bills in here.

             1             Well, actually, I take that back.  Yes,

             2    there are bills, so there's -- there's bills

             3    from GW and there are bills from Spinal Balance,

             4    so yeah, there are bills in here.

             5        Q.   And did you review those?

             6        A.   I did.

             7        Q.   And where did you get those bills?

             8        A.   Well, they were all provided to me by

             9    Mr. Covacevich.  At the time, it was

            10    Mr. Covacevich, so it -- they're in this

            11    binder.

            12        Q.   Okay.

            13             Have you spoken to any of Ms. Johnson's

            14    other doctors or treating providers about her

            15    medical treatment?

             1        Q.   Can I see those, please?

             2        A.   Sure.

             3             So there's that and there's

             4    that (indicating).

             5        Q.   As much as I admire your handwriting,

             6    Doctor, would you be willing to read us what

             7    these handwritten notes say?

             8        A.   I'll try.

             9        Q.   Fair enough.

            10             Thank you.

            11        A.   So there's -- there's three pages here.

            12             On what I would consider to be the

            13    first page it has her name and the date, the

            14    7-16-19.

            15             And on the first line there's an N.

            16    That's neck.

            17             The next one is the low -- it says low

            18    back.

            19             The next one says left arm, SH, which

            20    is shoulder, and then elbow, and then it says

            21    left buttock.  It says leg and knee, not the

            22    foot, and the head, problems all over.

             1             And then TX, which is treatment now,

             2    and then it says PT -- that's the physical

             3    therapist -- wants to take it slow.

             4             Then it says orthopedic surgeon at GW

             5    doesn't want to do surgery.

             6             And then it says see I-N-J, so I think

             7    that would be injury, and then it says -- well,

             8    actually, it's not "see."  It's "sec," S-E-C, so

             9    that's an abbreviation for secondary injury,

            10    I-N-J, slash harm.

            11             So there was some discussion that she

            12    was referencing that the surgery might lead to

            13    further injury or harm.

            14        Q.   I'm sorry.  The surgery would lead to a

            15    secondary injury or harm or there was a

            16    secondary injury or harm?

            17        A.   No.  She was -- she was talking about

            18    her understanding of why the orthopedic surgeon

            19    at GW did not want to do the surgery and

            20    explained to me that it was her understanding

            21    that it would lead to secondary injury or harm.

            22             It's not that she sustained another

             1    injury.  I didn't mean to imply that.  There's

             2    no note to that effect.

             3        Q.   Okay.

             4        A.   Okay?

             5             And then it goes on:  Pain every single

             6    morning in low back, up -- that's upper -- back

             7    spasms.  I was a runner until this accident.

             8             And then I have a note about goal --

             9    that's her goals, what she's trying to

            10    achieve -- run the marine marathon, and then

            11    that's followed by that cannot occur.

            12             And then a note:  PT does not want me

            13    to have massage.

            14        Q.   Very briefly, Doctor, if I might

            15    interrupt you, your note that says her goal is

            16    to run -- I assume you mean the Marine Corps

            17    Marathon -- and that cannot occur, I believe

            18    was the way you phrased it, was that your

            19    assessment or her assessment as she described it

            20    to you?

            21        A.   No.  That was her assessment.  That is

            22    what she was reporting to me.

             1        Q.   Okay.

             2        A.   I didn't come to a conclusion at that

             3    point in time.  I was just taking notes from

             4    what she was saying.

             5        Q.   Okay.  Understood.  Thank you.

             6        A.   And then we get to the back of that

             7    page.  It says:  Neck is always crooked, back

             8    pain always excruciating.  I threw my bed away,

             9    got another bed.  It wasn't that.

            10             So she didn't find that changing the

            11    bed was helpful.

            12             I never had spasms/sciatic until this

            13    accident.  I want to be great again.  I am in

            14    pain every day.

            15             And then PT, and then she said, I

            16    cannot pronounce his name.  And then I have a

            17    note it's Washington, D.C. off of 19th Street.

            20             Took FMLA last year.  Doctor put me on

             1    approve of FMLA.  Three, doctor said do desk

             2    over.  Doctors say sit, stand and walk around.

             3             Then it says last time high heel shoes

             4    in 2016.

             5             Then it skips a line and it's

             6    Spinal Balance says massage may irritate.  I

             7    don't know why.  He can tell multiple pain,

             8    two-pound left side dumbbell, five to eight

             9    pounds on right.

            10             Then it goes onto the next page.

            11             He told me I can do intervals of

            12    running.

            13             Then it says ortho surg said my knee

            14    looked like not -- and there's a word I can't

            15    make out -- torn something.  He said tears, said

            16    I was too young for back surgery.  They see the

            17    inflection where it is not good.

            18             Then with regards to neck, has this

            19    type of pain before.  Then it says both knees

            20    involved.  I fell in bath -- no.  Actually, it

            21    says, I fell on something that begins with a B.

            22    And then it says when ST came on top of me.

             2    of them should have been.

             8             Okay.  Doctor, allow me to show you

             9    what I've marked as Deposition Exhibit Number 2.

            10    This is plaintiff's designation of expert

            13             Have you seen this document before?

            14        A.   I don't recall seeing it before.

             1    her.  I saw her for an evaluation back in July.

             2        Q.   Okay.  Do you have -- when you say

             3    "back in July," that's July of 2019; correct?

             4        A.   Yeah.  It was July 16, 2019.

             5        Q.   Great.

             6             Is July 16, 2019 the only time you've

             7    seen Ms. Johnson in the clinical setting?

             8        A.   I believe so.

             9        Q.   Okay.

            10             And I believe you corrected my

            11    terminology.  You were not seeing her for

            12    treatment.  You were seeing her for an

            13    evaluation; correct?

            14        A.   Well, that was my understanding at the

            15    time.

            16        Q.   And what is the difference?

            17        A.   Well, an evaluation would be basically

            18    what you see here and treatment would be

            19    prescriptions.  It would usually involve some

            20    follow-up on more than one occasion.

            21        Q.   Did you provide Ms. Johnson any

            22    prescriptions or recommendations on follow-ups

             1    or other treatment that she should have?

             2        A.   No.

             3        Q.   Okay.  Do you have an independent

             4    recollection of your visit with Ms. Johnson on

             5    July 16, 2019?

             6        A.   Well, yes and no.

             7        Q.   What do you mean by that?

             8        A.   Well, I remember seeing her on that

             9    day.  I don't recall what she wore, but I have

            10    some recollection of it.  I remember talking to

            11    her, things of that nature.

            12        Q.   Do you recall anything particularly

            13    noteworthy for you?

            14        A.   Well, I do, yeah.

            15        Q.   Which is what?

            16        A.   What you read in the report.  I think

            17    that's -- that's why I made those notes, because

            18    it's all noteworthy.

            19        Q.   Okay.

            20             Now, when you saw Ms. Johnson on

            21    July 16, 2019, that was just about three and a

            22    half years after the incident at Walmart on

             1    February 20, 2016; right?

             2        A.   I would agree with that.

             3        Q.   Okay.  Now, let me show you your report

             4    that we've been talking about -- well, let me

             6    Exhibit 3.

             7             Do you recognize that, Doctor?

            10    with Ms. Johnson on July 16, 2019?

            11        A.   It is.  You kind of -- it's shrunken

            12    down a little bit, but it is the report.

            13        Q.   Nothing is missing; right?

            14        A.   No.  I think it's -- it's just

            15    shrunken.  You see how like this fills up the

            16    page and this kind of doesn't (indicating).  It

            17    just looks a little smaller.

            18             MR. KEARNS:  Was it photocopied too

            19    many times?  I'm not sure.

             1        A.   I have a better copy if you want, in

             2    other words, but I think that's probably --

             3        Q.   Sure.  You can work off your copy, as

             4    long as we agree that it's the same report.

             6             Now, I believe we already discussed

             7    this, but in preparation for your visit on

             8    July 16, 2019 with Ms. Johnson, you -- actually,

             9    no, I did not ask you this.

            10             Before your visit with Ms. Johnson on

            11    July 16, 2019, did you review the records that

            12    you were provided, the medical records that you

            13    were provided?

            14        A.   I believe I did.  Yes.

            15        Q.   Okay.

            16             But we did establish that of the

            17    records you reviewed before your visit with

            18    Ms. Johnson on July 16, 2019, none of those

            19    records predated the February 20, 2016 incident

            20    at Walmart; correct?

            21        A.   I think we established that, yes.

            22        Q.   Okay.

             4        A.   The mechanism is that she was by a

             5    shelf, bent over in some way, and the stroller

             6    fell from the shelf, striking her about the back

             7    of the head, the neck and back.

             8        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

             9             Now, in your report, you do note -- I

            10    think you just used the same words -- at the

            11    time of the incident, she was bent over looking

            12    down.

            13             Now, in Ms. Johnson's deposition, she

            14    testified that she was actually squatting.

            15             Does that make a difference to you in

            16    your understanding of the mechanism of injury?

            17        A.   No.

            18        Q.   And why not?

            19        A.   I'm not really sure what the

            20    difference is between bent over and squatting.

            21    She could have been squatting -- I think it's

            22    just a different -- it's a matter of semantics

                                                                 49





             1    really.

             2        Q.   Is there a physical difference in your

             3    mind between squatting and being bent over?

             4             And for example, in my mind when I

             5    think of bending over, I think of bending at the

             6    waist, versus squatting, you're really bending

             7    at the knee I suppose.

             8        A.   She could be bent at the knees and bent

             9    over at the waist as well or some combination of

            10    the two.  But I don't think that the mechanism

            11    is changed by whatever position she may be in.

            12    I don't really see that there's a -- that one

            13    particular position would be more problematic or

            14    less problematic than another.

            15        Q.   All right.  One of the issues -- one of

            16    the medical issues that Ms. Johnson has been

            17    complaining about is pain in her knees.  And she

            18    testified that during the incident she -- when

            19    she was struck by the stroller, she fell landing

            20    on her knees.

            21             Is there a difference, Doctor, in your

            22    assessment of any injury to the knee based upon

             1    whether Ms. Johnson was squatting versus bending

             2    over at the time of the incident?

             3        A.   No.  I think either way she could have

             4    hurt her knees.

             5        Q.   Okay.

             6             Do you have an understanding as to the

             7    height of the shelf that the stroller was on

             8    when it fell onto her as she has alleged?

             9        A.   Well, sort of.

            10        Q.   What do you mean by that?

            11        A.   There's been some reference somewhere

            12    in the records that the shelf was about six feet

            13    high, but I don't take that to be an absolute

            14    measurement.  I don't really know how high the

            15    shelf was.  It was a certain height.  There was

            16    a certain amount of change in the height of this

            17    stroller, but exactly how far it fell I couldn't

            18    say.

            19        Q.   Okay.  If I could ask you to assume

            20    that the shelf on which the stroller was

            21    sitting at the time of Ms. Johnson's incident

            22    was three and a half feet tall, does that

             1    change the mechanism of injury, in your view, or

             2    does it change your assessment as to the

             3    injuries that she sustained based on that

             4    mechanism of injury?

             5        A.   No.

             6        Q.   Why not?

             7        A.   I don't see how it does.

             8        Q.   The assessment that you have made in

             9    your report regarding Ms. Johnson's injuries,

            10    was that assessment based on an understanding

            11    that the shelf was approximately six feet tall?

            12        A.   No.  I'm just saying that there was a

            13    reference in there, but I don't take that to be

            14    an absolute certainty.

            15        Q.   Okay.

            16             Now, Doctor, it's your understanding

            17    that Ms. Johnson went to the emergency room a

            18    few hours after the incident; correct?

            19        A.   Yes.  I think there's -- I wrote about

            20    that in my report.  Yes.

            21        Q.   That's right.

            22        A.   And there are medical records that

             1    support that.

             2        Q.   Yes.

             3             Now, what is your understanding of her

             4    complaints at the time that she went to the

             5    emergency room a few hours after the incident on

             6    February 20, 2016?

             7        A.   Well, my understanding is that those

             8    are the primary complaints that are outlined in

             9    the report, not to say that she didn't say

            10    something else that they didn't transcribe or

            11    they didn't think was as significant as their

            12    primary concern, but it's what's in that

            13    report.  They talk about her head, neck and

            14    back.

            15        Q.   Now, is it fair to characterize those

            16    complaints as purely subjective?

            17        A.   Well, I think complaints are

            18    subjective, yeah, but also I think it's -- if

            19    someone has a complaint, that's a sub- -- that

            20    is by the nature of a complaint subjective.

            21        Q.   Fair enough.

            22        A.   Yeah.

             1        Q.   Now, you -- you reviewed the x-rays

             2    that were taken at the emergency room on the

             3    date of the incident; correct?

             4        A.   Yeah.  I've seen x-rays of her neck,

             5    her chest, her left shoulder and the lumbosacral

             6    spine.

             7        Q.   And all of those x-rays were from the

             8    emergency room on the date of the incident;

             9    correct?

            10        A.   Well, they're dated -- they were taken

            11    just after midnight, so they're actually dated

            12    the next day.  They all say the 21st instead of

            13    the 20th.

            14        Q.   Fair enough.  And I appreciate the

            15    clarification.

            16        A.   Yeah.

            17        Q.   Now, all of those x-rays that we just

            18    talked about, they were all normal; correct?

            19        A.   They're essentially within the limits

            20    of normal in the sense that there's nothing

            21    broken, there's nothing fractured on those

            22    x-rays.

             1        Q.   So based on those x-rays, is it fair to

             2    say that there was no objective finding of

             3    injury?

             4        A.   I don't think that the x-rays show

             5    objective findings of injury.

             6        Q.   Okay.

             7             Now, you have reviewed the medical

             8    records pertaining to Ms. Johnson's medical

             9    treatment after the injury; correct?

            10        A.   That's correct.

            11        Q.   And she treated with a number of

            12    different orthopedic doctors and her primary

            13    care physician; correct?

            14        A.   Sure.  She saw -- I mean, I can read to

            15    you the name of each doctor that she saw.

            16        Q.   That's not necessary.

            17        A.   Okay.

            19    with the GW Medical Faculty Associates after

            20    presenting to the emergency room on

            21    February 20 was on February 25, 2016.

            22             Have you reviewed that record?

             1        A.   If it's in here, I did review it, yes.

             2        Q.   Okay.  Well, I'll represent to you that

             3    the doctor's note from her February 25, 2016

             4    visit notes that she was given a referral for

             5    physical therapy.  And in fact, most of her

             6    other doctor's visits following the incident

             7    make notations or referrals for physical

             8    therapy.

             9             However, based on the records, Ms. --

            10    and her deposition testimony, Ms. Johnson did

            11    not actually attend any physical therapy

            12    until -- I believe it's -- until July 2018,

            13    about two and a half years after the incident.

            14             Do you recall that in your review of

            15    the records?

            16        A.   I think that's correct.

            17        Q.   Okay.  Now, given her -- the nature of

            18    her complaints as to her injuries, do you have

            19    an opinion as to whether her failure to engage

            20    in any kind of physical therapy for two and a

            21    half years after the incident despite being

            22    recommended to do so by her physicians that she

             8    you.

             9             When a patient with the kind of

            10    subjective orthopedic complaints that

            11    Ms. Johnson presented with is recommended to

            12    undergo physical therapy and then doesn't, does

            13    that failure to engage in physical therapy

            14    impede their progress and recovery, generally

            15    speaking?

            16        A.   Generally speaking, I don't know if it

            17    does or it doesn't.

            19             Okay.  Another treatment or study that

            20    Ms. Johnson failed to procure in a timely manner

            21    is an MRI.  She did not have any MRIs taken

            22    until February of 2018, so two years after the

             2             Do you recall that in your review of

             3    the records?

             4        A.   I recall that the MRI was done in 2018,

             5    yes.

             6        Q.   Okay.  Now, her doctors had been

             7    recommending that she get an MRI at least a year

             8    prior to that.

             9             Are you familiar with that?

            10        A.   I can't tell you off the top of my head

            11    when the first time it was recommended, but I

            12    know that it was recommended before it was

            13    actually obtained.

            14        Q.   Okay.  But she didn't get one until

            15    February of 2018; right?

            16        A.   Well, I think that's right.  Yes.

            17        Q.   Okay.

             1    report.  It's the report from Dr. Hung, so

             2    everything that's written down there is what it

             3    shows.

             4        Q.   Okay.  Now, the multilevel degenerative

             5    disk disease, that is not something that is

             6    typically caused by a traumatic incident;

             7    correct?

             8        A.   Well, it could be caused by a

             9    traumatic injury -- by a traumatic event or it

            10    could be affected by a traumatic event, but it's

            11    also something that most likely was present to

            12    some degree prior to the traumatic event.

            13        Q.   Okay.  Does the fact that she didn't

            14    have this MRI taken for approximately two years

            15    after the incident affect its reliability in any

            16    way as to what she may or may not have had as an

            17    underlying condition as of the February

            18    incident?

            19        A.   No.  I think it's a perfectly reliable

            20    MRI.  I don't know of any technical issues or

            21    anything of that nature that would cause me to

            22    question its reliability.

             1        Q.   Okay.  Perhaps I didn't phrase that

             2    quite right.

             3             I'm not trying to question the

             4    technical aspects of the MRI, but what I want to

             5    ask you about, Doctor, is the gap that

             6    Ms. Johnson had in her treatment, the failure to

             7    do PT when it was recommended, the failure to

             8    get an MRI for two years.

             9             Does that affect your opinions in this

            10    case as to the causal relationship between the

            11    incident that occurred in Walmart in February of

            12    2016 and the ongoing complaints that you've

            13    talked about today?

            14        A.   Well, I'm still not sure I understand

            15    the question.

            16             It doesn't affect it.  It's information

            17    that I took into account in coming up with these

            18    opinions.

            19        Q.   All right.

            20        A.   I think if you -- if you look back, as

            21    I alluded to earlier, the -- that specific

            22    issue of the softening of the cord is

             1    represented in her initial findings, which were

             2    noted by numerous different providers at GW, and

             3    it's in keeping with what was subsequently found

             4    on the MRI.

             5             Whether the MRI was done the first day

             6    or the first month or the first year, I don't

             7    know that that would have changed this scenario

             8    in any positive or negative way.

             9        Q.   Is it possible that it could -- the

            10    MRI could have been different in February of

            11    2016?

            12        A.   Oh, I'm sure it was different in 2016.

            13        Q.   What do you mean by that?

            14        A.   Well, I don't think that this

            15    softening of the cord happened instantaneously.

            16    I think it's a slow, gradual, progressive

            17    process, so I'm sure it would have looked

            18    different.

            19             Whatever degenerative findings she had

            20    would change over time to some degree, so that

            21    would look somewhat different, too.  But I don't

            22    know how that would change the natural history

             1    of this event.

             2        Q.   Okay.

             3             One of the things that you mention in

             4    your report, Doctor, is that Ms. Johnson told

             5    you her physical therapist does not want her to

             6    have massages.

             7             Do you have an understanding as to why

             8    that is?

             9        A.   As we sit here, I really don't.  And

            10    as -- I will -- at the time I was with

            11    Ms. Johnson, I really didn't understand it

            12    either, so I can't explain to you why that is.

            13    I would have to defer to whoever said that.

            14        Q.   Okay.

            15             You also note in your report -- and you

            16    mentioned it was in your handwritten notes as

            17    well -- that Ms. -- one of Ms. Johnson's goals

            18    is to be great again.

            19             Do you have an understanding as to what

            20    that means?

            21        A.   Well, my recollection was she was

            22    telling me that she was -- before this happened

             1    she was great and she just doesn't feel that way

             2    anymore.

             3        Q.   All right.

             4             Did -- in that vein, did Ms. Johnson

             5    discuss with you any other sources of stress

             6    that she was undergoing, for example, at her

             7    workplace, during the time period from February

             8    of 2016 until you saw her in July?

             9        A.   I don't re- -- I don't recall any

            10    specific discussion about stress at the

            11    workplace.  There are some references in the

            12    file, so I have some familiarity with it, but I

            13    don't know that we specifically discussed it.

            14    We may have, but I just don't recall.

            15        Q.   Okay.  You do mention in your report

            16    that she has stress in her job.  Okay?  And she

            17    testified in her deposition that one of the

            18    stresses in her job was due to some harassment

            19    that she had been experiencing.

            20             Is it fair to say that that is a

            21    collateral source of the stress that you note

            22    she's experiencing at her job that I believe you

             1    relate to her pain issues attributable to the

             2    Walmart incident?

             3        A.   I think it could be another source of

             4    stress.  Sure.

             5        Q.   Okay.

             6             Okay, Doctor.  I want to ask you just a

             7    couple things about your report where you

             8    discuss the diagnostic imaging you reviewed.

             9    This is page 4 and near the bottom.

            10             You looked at the x-rays of the

            11    cervical spine.

            12             Do you see that in the second to last

            13    paragraph?

            14        A.   I do.

            15        Q.   Okay.

            16             Now, you write here that there were

            17    degenerative and productive changes.

            18             Now, I'm familiar with degenerative

            19    changes, but what does "productive changes"

            20    mean?

            21        A.   Well -- so I think the simple way to

            22    understand that is that it's basically a bone

                                                                 64





             1    spur.  When you see the bone production, that's

             2    a spur.  It's building up in that area.

             3             So that's what I'm referring to when

             4    I'm talking about productive changes.

             5        Q.   Okay.  So you did note productive

             6    changes in the cervical spine.

             7        A.   In the lower segments with reasonable

             8    preservation in the upper segments.

             9        Q.   What does that mean, "reasonable

            10    preservation in the upper segments"?

            11        A.   So C1, C2, C3, C4, they look pretty

            12    normal.  5, 6, 7, they look arthritic.

            13        Q.   Okay.  Now, you just said that they

            14    look arthritic.

            15             Do you attribute those productive

            16    changes -- or do you have an opinion as to

            17    whether those productive changes are

            18    attributable to the injury that Ms. Johnson is

            19    claiming from the Walmart incident?

            20        A.   I don't think they are exclusively

            21    attributable to the injuries.

            22             So interestingly enough, when you --

             1    when you read the initial x-ray report, the one

             2    that was obtained in the emergency room, they

             3    don't actually report productive or degenerative

             4    changes.  But when you look at the -- when you

             5    look at the images, you can see that there were

             6    some productive or degenerative changes, so

             7    this -- this was certainly an average or

             8    reasonable neck back in 2016, February 2016,

             9    when injured.

            10             So how much of the change is due to the

            11    natural aging process and how much of that

            12    change is due to the trauma itself, there's no

            13    way to differentiate those two.

            14        Q.   Okay.  You wouldn't be able to give any

            15    kind of percentage?

            16        A.   No.  I don't know that there's any way

            17    to give any kind of percentage.

            18        Q.   Okay.  But it's fair to say that the

            19    findings that you observed on the x-ray reports

            20    are due both to just the natural aging process

            21    as well as the injury she's claiming?

            22        A.   Sure.

             1        Q.   Okay.

             2             Now, it looks like you -- in the last

             3    paragraph of your report on page 4, you looked

             4    at x-rays of the left knee as well, and those

             5    are x-rays that you obtained as of that

             6    July 2019 visit; correct?

             7        A.   That's correct.

             8        Q.   Okay.  And that x-ray was normal;

             9    right?

            10        A.   From an x-ray standpoint, I would say

            11    that's normal.  Sure.

            12        Q.   No objective findings of any injury in

            13    the left knee based on that x-ray that you

            14    took?

            15        A.   No, not based on that x-ray.

            16        Q.   Okay.

            17             Now, it appears that you only ordered

            18    x-rays of the left knee, not the right knee.  Is

            19    that right?

            20        A.   That is correct.

             3    that -- what the reason was.  Just perhaps

             4    because I thought those findings were more

            12    that first paragraph, it looks to me like you

            13    ordered an x-ray of the left shoulder and

            14    reviewed that.  Am I right?

            15        A.   I did.

            16        Q.   And it appears that you noted some mild

            17    early productive changes at the AC joint.

            18             What does that mean?

            19        A.   Well, it means the same type of

            20    productive changes that you see in the neck.

            21    There's narrowing of the joint space with

            22    increased bone formation.

             1        Q.   And what -- do you have an opinion as

             2    to the cause of those productive changes?

             3        A.   It's the combination of everything

             4    that's happened to that shoulder since the

             5    beginning of her time.  It includes the injury

             6    to the shoulder and also whatever else has

             7    happened to that shoulder over the years.

             8        Q.   When you mentioned the injury to the

             9    shoulder, I assume you're referring to the

            10    incident at Walmart.

            11             What's your understanding as to how the

            12    shoulder -- and let me clarify the --

            13    Ms. Johnson's left shoulder was injured during

            14    the Walmart incident?

            15        A.   Well, it was injured as -- when the

            16    stroller fell on her, in whatever position she

            17    was, at whatever height it fell from.

            18        Q.   So what -- perhaps I'm trying to dumb

            19    this down a little too much, but what happened

            20    to the shoulder that caused injury, based on

            21    your understanding?

            22        A.   Well, I don't know that we fully

             1    defined what happened to the shoulder, other

             2    than it remains problematic and symptomatic.

             3    It's become very stiff as a result of the

             4    injury.

             5             It was originally caused -- I'm sorry.

             6    It was originally called a sprain.  I don't

             7    think that really fully defines the injury, but

             8    that's all the information we have to work

             9    with.

            10        Q.   Okay.

            11             Have you seen Ms. Johnson since

            12    July 16, 2019?

            13        A.   No, I haven't.

            14        Q.   Had you seen her prior to July 16,

            15    2019?

            16        A.   No, I had not.

            17        Q.   Okay.

            18             Now, Doctor, I'll take you to that last

            19    paragraph of your report if I may.

            20             The first line is that it appears to be

            21    your opinion that treatment to date appears

            22    appropriate, reasonable, and causal connection

             1    is demonstrated to the injuries sustained 20 --

             2    I'm sorry -- February 20, 2016 and their

             3    sequelae.

             4             Which treatment are you referring to in

             5    your report in that paragraph?

             6        A.   Well, basically I'm referring to all

             7    the treatment that's in this binder, the

             8    treatment provided by GW and Spinal Balance.

             9        Q.   And Spinal Balance -- we didn't get

            10    into that -- that is the PT provider that she

            11    ultimately saw beginning in 2018; right?

            12        A.   Yes.

            13        Q.   Okay.  And is it your understanding

            14    that she was prematurely discharged from

            15    Spinal Balance due to noncompliance with the

            16    physical therapy program?

            17        A.   No.  I don't recall the reason for

            18    discharge.

            19        Q.   Okay.  If I -- well, allow me to

            20    represent to you that her records reflect that

            21    she was discharged for noncompliance with the

            22    physical therapy program.

             1             Does that affect your opinion at all as

             2    to your opinions that that treatment was

             3    reasonable and necessary in this case?

             4        A.   No.

             5        Q.   Why not?

             6        A.   I thought it was reasonable and she

             7    underwent treatment for a period of time.

             8    That's fine.  I don't know how the discharge

             9    would affect what happened before the

            10    discharge.

            11        Q.   Okay.

            12             When you say in your report that the

            13    causal connection is demonstrated to the

            14    injuries sustained on February 20, 2016 and

            15    their sequelae, what sequelae are you referring

            16    to there?

            17        A.   Well, everything that she has

            18    experienced as a result of these injuries, the

            19    stiffness, the pain, the softening of the cord,

            20    the limitations of function, the need for

            21    activity modifications, the limitations of her

            22    activities, all that are the sequelae of this

             1    injury.

             2        Q.   Now, does the fact that Ms. Johnson was

             3    noncompliant with her physical therapy

             4    treatments and with the recommendations of many

             5    of her doctors during her treatment -- does that

             6    affect whether the sequelae are causally related

             7    to the incident?

             8        A.   No.

             9        Q.   Why not?

            10        A.   Because the sequelae are a result of

            11    the incident independent of any treatment that's

            12    provided subsequent to that event.

            13        Q.   Okay.

            14             Now, is it possible, Doctor, that

            15    Ms. Johnson could have gotten better if she had

            16    been compliant with her doctors' referrals for

            17    physical therapy and the physical therapy that

            18    she did finally begin to undergo?

            19             MR. KEARNS:  Well, I'll object to the

            20    question, but go ahead and answer it if you

            21    can.

             1    I deal with probabilities.

             2             BY MS. KYLIS:

             3        Q.   Do you have an opinion to a reasonable

             4    degree of medical probability that Ms. Johnson

             5    would have gotten better if she had been

             6    compliant with the recommendations of her

             7    treating physicians?

             8        A.   I don't -- I don't know of any

             9    treatment that could have been provided that

            10    would have significantly altered this outcome.

            11        Q.   Okay.  Now, by "this outcome" -- I

            12    think I'll segue into your next line in your

            13    report, which is that long-term prognosis is

            14    considered guarded.

            15             Is that what you mean by "outcome,"

            16    that Ms. Johnson has this permanent impairment

            17    that we've previously talked about today?

            18        A.   Yes.  I think that it's reasonable to

            19    state that what she experiences as of July 16,

            20    2019 is pretty much the way it's going to be for

            21    her.

            22        Q.   Okay.  You next state that ongoing

             1    needs for treatment are anticipated.

             2             What treatment is anticipated?

             3        A.   Well, I can't say with any certainty

             4    what treatment it would be, but I would not be

             5    surprised if there is treatment in the future.

             6    But exactly what it comes out to be or

             7    predicting what it's going to be, I'm not in a

             8    position to do that.

             9        Q.   Okay.  So if I could ask it in a better

            10    way, do you have an opinion to a reasonable

            11    degree of medical probability that Ms. Johnson

            12    will require future treatment related to these

            13    injuries?

            14        A.   No.  It's a possibility, but I can't

            15    say with any degree of certainty that she will

            16    require treatment or what that treatment would

            17    be.

            18        Q.   Okay.

            19             If you are called to testify at trial

            20    in this case, do you intend to offer any

            21    opinions as to whether Ms. Johnson had to miss

            22    any time from work?

             1        A.   If the question comes up, I would

             2    address it.  I mean, it has been addressed in

             3    the records, and I think it was addressed

             4    appropriately in the records.

             5             So she did miss time from work, and

             6    subsequently there were workplace

             7    modifications, and all that seems reasonable and

             8    appropriate.

             9        Q.   Okay.

            10             Okay, Doctor.  If I could end with this

            11    last, very broad question.

            12             We've discussed many opinions that you

            13    have today about Ms. Johnson's care.

            14             Do you have any other opinions that you

            15    would offer at trial as to Ms. Johnson's medical

            16    treatment?

            17        A.   Not that come to mind as we sit here,

            18    but certainly if you ask more questions,

            19    something else may come to mind.

            20             MS. KYLIS:  All right.

            16    handwritten notes or maybe in the second report

            17    that will be produced, you mentioned the

            18    possibility of Ms. Johnson having surgery.  She

            19    had talked to one of her doctors about a

            20    surgery?

            21        A.   Yep.  Yes.

             1    about?

             2        A.   As we sit here, my recollection was

             3    that that was about the neck, surgery on the

             4    neck.

             5        Q.   Okay.  Do you have an opinion to a

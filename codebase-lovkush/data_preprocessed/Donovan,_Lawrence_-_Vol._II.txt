 4              LAWRENCE DONOVAN, having first been duly
 5    sworn, deposes and states as follows:
 6              MR. LYNCH:  Let's do some stipulations first,
 7         and then we'll get Mr. Donovan working.  So we --
 8         this is on the record now.
 9              We took Mr. Donovan's deposition yesterday and
10         covered Peter Crescenzo.  And so today, by
11         agreement, we are going to cover his brother,
12         Biagio.  I don't know and so in the exercise of
13         caution, I'm going to not only state that we are
14         using the same objections, you know, and
15         reservations as we did yesterday, today as we did
16         yesterday, and then another agreement, I'm going to
17         repeat them anyways just in case there is people on
18         the phone that weren't here yesterday.
19              MR. HUMEN:  Okay, yeah.
20              MR. LYNCH:  But they are -- we agree that they
21         are the same as yesterday; right?
22              MR. HUMEN:  Yes, absolutely.
23              MR. LYNCH:  Okay.  So I think they were all
24         objections, except as to form, and motions to strike
0102
 1         are reserved until the time of trial.  An objection
 2         by one is deemed as objection by all defendants,
 3         and then appearance here by any defendant is not a
 4         waiver of process or service of process issues.
 5              And whoever is on the phone, we appreciate
 6         your participation.  We would ask you to please
 7         mute your phone, because we can hear you.  Thank
 8         you.
 9              And then one other thing too, yesterday we
10         reviewed a lot of background information from
11         Mr. Donovan, and in the interest of not having to
12         go over all of that again, can we agree that to the
13         extent that we covered all of that in the Peter
14         Crescenzo case we have now covered it and
15         incorporated it in the transcript for Biagio
16         Crescenzo?
17              MR. HUMEN:  I can agree to that, and based on
18         Mr. Donovan's reaction, I think he'll agree to that
19         too.
20              MR. LYNCH:  You have to promise me one thing,
21         though.
22              THE WITNESS:  What's that?
23              MR. LYNCH:  You have to say yes or no.
24              THE WITNESS:  I will.
0103
 1              MR. LYNCH:  Okay.  All right.  And in an
 2         exercise of caution, we'll reswear the witness.
 3         Okay.
 4              THE REPORTER:  Would you raise your right
 5         hand, please, sir.
 6              Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are
 7         about to give will be the truth, the whole truth,
 8         and nothing but the truth?
 9              THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do.
10                        LAWRENCE DONOVAN,
11    having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified
12    upon his oath as follows:
13                       DIRECT EXAMINATION
14    BY MR. LYNCH:
15         Q    Good morning, Mr. Donovan.
16         A    Good morning.
17         Q    Good to see you again.  Thank you for coming
18    back after yesterday.  It wasn't that bad, so --
19         A    It was bad enough.
20         Q    Okay.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Hopefully
21    it won't be any worse.  How about that today?
22         A    That sounds good.
23         Q    Okay.  And you know the drill, so I won't
24    repeat any of the instructions, but just please try to
0104
 1    wait until I finish my question before you start your
 2    answer.
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    And I will try to help you out in those
 5    instances where you forget a yes or no.  Believe me,
 6    it's very common in a situation --
 7         A    Um-hum.
 8         Q    -- with a layperson because we don't talk like
 9    yes or no.
10         A    Yeah.
11         Q    Except when the nuns ask us questions; right?
12         A    Yeah.
13         Q    Okay.  All right.  Could you state your full
14    name for the record?
15         A    Lawrence T. Donovan.
16         Q    And your last four digits of your social
17    security number?
18         A    7329.
19         Q    Now, we noticed that and couldn't help -- and
20    I'm sure it's not a big surprise -- that we saw you and
21    your attorney speaking after yesterday's deposition --
22         A    Um-hum.
23         Q    -- I anticipate preparing for today's
24    deposition.  Again, I don't want to know anything about
0105
 1    those communications.  It's none of my business.
 2         A    Um-hum.
 3         Q    But can you tell me about how long you met
 4    with your attorney to prepare for this deposition?
 5         A    Not very long about 10 or 15 minutes, maybe.
 6         Q    Okay.  Good enough.  He was easy on you, then.
 7         A    Yeah, he is.
 8         Q    And other than meeting with him yesterday, did
 9    you meet today at all?
10         A    This morning, yeah, I met with him.  Yeah.
11         Q    About how long was that?
12         A    Maybe ten minutes or so.
13         Q    Okay.  He's not testifying, you are.
14              MR. HUMEN:  I'm not allowed to answer.
15         A    Oh.
16    BY MR. LYNCH:
17         Q    But fair enough.  That's fine.
18         A    Okay.
19         Q    Did you review any documents --
20         A    No.
21         Q    -- in preparation?
22         A    No.
23         Q    Okay.  And you brought back with you the same
24    documents that you had yesterday; is that correct?
0106
 1         A    Yes.  Yes.
 2         Q    All right.  And we'll -- I guess we'll
 3    consider those exhibits as exhibits in this deposition
 4    as well?
 5              MR. HUMEN:  Well, he has put additional marks
 6         for the sites he --
 7              MR. LYNCH:  Oh.
 8              MR. HUMEN:  There are a few additional marks.
 9    BY MR. LYNCH:
10         Q    A little more work.  All right.
11              MR. HUMEN:  Yeah.
12    BY MR. LYNCH:
13         Q    So we are going to have to redo that as an
14    exhibit.  Can I take a look it and see what you've done?
15         A    I put a dot next to the jobs that I worked
16    with Benny on, Biagio.
17         Q    Do I see blue --
18         A    That was yesterday.
19         Q    -- which was from before; correct?
20         A    Yes, for Peter.
21         Q    Okay.  And so I'm looking at Exhibit Number 2
22    now.  Is that the one that you marked up?
23         A    Um-hum.  Yep.  Yes.
24         Q    And so you've marked in red.  So we are going
0107
 1    to have to get a color copy here of this, and I'm just
 2    going to -- I'll go through this for the record just to
 3    make it clear for those who end up getting a black and
 4    white copy.  On the first page of Exhibit 2, which
 5    probably was really the second page because
 6    chronologically it's backwards, but not a big deal,
 7    you -- does it look like you crossed out Boston?
 8         A    No, I just hit that with my pen.
 9         Q    Got you.  So that's an erroneous scratch we'll
10    call it?
11         A    Right.  Right.
12         Q    Then down below on that page under 1980 to
13    1983 the second item Seabrook Station/PH Seabrook New
14    Hampshire --
15         A    Um-hum.  Yes.
16         Q    -- is dotted in red?
17         A    Yes.
18         Q    Correct?
19         A    Yeah.
20         Q    So you worked at that site with Peter?
21         A    Yes.  No, with Biagio.
22         Q    All right.  I'm sorry.  Biagio.  You'll keep
23    me straight.
24              And do you know anything about what these site
0108
 1    codes are way over on the right?
 2         A    No, that's something --
 3         Q    From the Thornton firm?
 4         A    I think so, yes.
 5         Q    Okay.  And then on the next page under 1963 to
 6    '65 you've dotted with a red dot Saint Regis Paper in
 7    Bucksport?
 8         A    Yes.
 9         Q    And then International Paper/James River, Jay?
10         A    Yes.
11         Q    And JFK Federal Building; correct?
12         A    Yes.
13         Q    And then again in the middle 1969 Boston
14    Edison/L Street --
15         A    Powerhouse.
16         Q    -- PH, powerhouse, South Boston,
17    Massachusetts; correct?
18         A    Yes.
19         Q    And then last one Monsanto Chemical Company in
20    Everett?
21         A    Yes.
22         Q    All right.  So I think our list is broadened a
23    little from what we've had previously, but we'll manage.
24              So are these -- these are the sites that you
0109
 1    can remember?
 2         A    Yes.
 3         Q    Okay.  And you worked --
 4         A    I probably worked with him on other sites
 5    also, but I just -- I can't remember off the top of my
 6    head.
 7         Q    Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Okay.  Okay.
 8         A    You work on so many different jobs.  I mean,
 9    you can see there, and that's probably not all of them,
10    but --
11         Q    Okay.
12         A    You are on and off the job.  You might be on a
13    job for two months.  They ship you to another job and
14    ship you back to that same job.
15         Q    Understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a long time
16    ago.  It's hard to remember.
17         A    Exactly.
18         Q    All right.  And so why don't I ask it to you
19    this way.  You've checked off all of the jobsites that
20    are on this list that you can remember working with
21    Biagio Crescenzo; correct?
22         A    Yes.
23         Q    Okay.  You think that there may be other jobs,
24    but you can't remember which ones they were?
0110
 1         A    Yes.
 2         Q    Are there any jobs on -- that aren't on this
 3    list that you can remember working with him?
 4         A    I can't remember right off the top of my head.
 5         Q    Okay.  Okay.  So all we can do is test the
 6    best of your memory today.
 7         A    Yes.
 8         Q    So we'll ask you about the ones you do
 9    remember, okay?
10         A    Yes.
11         Q    Okay.  When did you first meet Biagio?
12         A    I was a first-year apprentice on a JFK
13    building in Boston, Massachusetts.
14         Q    So you were a third-year apprentice?
15         A    I was a first-year apprentice.
16         Q    First year, I'm sorry.  I usually tell this to
17    people too.  I am hard of hearing.
18         A    Oh.
19         Q    So I apologize in advance if I mishear some of
20    your answers.
21         A    All right.
22         Q    Just keep your voice up, and we'll manage.
23         A    Yep.
24         Q    So what year was that you were a first-year
0111
 1    apprentice?
 2         A    1965.
 3         Q    Okay.  And so you first met him on the job?
 4         A    Yes.
 5         Q    Did he go by the name Biagio?
 6         A    Benny.  I'd go by Benny too if my name of
 7    Biagio.
 8         Q    Not if you were back in the old country?
 9         A    Yeah.  No, not at all.
10         Q    Okay.  So tell me what you can recall about
11    first meeting him.
12         A    I used to mix the cement from the mud, the
13    asbestos, the One Cote, and deliver stock to his work
14    station, clean up around, you know, where he was working
15    and stuff like that.  Mostly emptying, you know, lugging
16    stock to all the guys.
17         Q    Okay.
18         A    Emptying trailer trucks and all that.
19         Q    The typical first-year apprentice-type work?
20         A    Yes, yes.
21         Q    Okay.  Was he a mechanic at the time?
22         A    He was either third or fourth year, or he
23    might have been a new mechanic.  I'm not quite sure
24    then.
0112
 1         Q    Okay.  He was above you, you remember that?
 2         A    Yes, he was.
 3         Q    Do you recall that he was installing
 4    insulation?
 5         A    He was, yes.
 6         Q    All right.  So the JFK Federal Building is one
 7    of the bigger buildings, at the time at least, in
 8    Government Center; is that right?
 9         A    Yes, yep.
10         Q    And was this new construction?
11         A    Yes.
12         Q    And at what -- when you came on the job, was
13    Benny already there?
14         A    Yes.
15         Q    At what point of construction, what stage of
16    construction had this project been in when you first
17    arrived?
18         A    As far as the whole building itself?
19         Q    Yes.
20         A    It was pretty well done, not finished, but --
21         Q    Sure.
22         A    -- it was ready for us to come in and do it.
23    The piping was in and ductwork and.
24         Q    So the tower had been erected --
0113
 1         A    Yes.
 2         Q    -- an all the exterior walls were installed
 3    and windows --
 4         A    Yes.
 5         Q    -- and things like that?
 6         A    Yes.
 7         Q    All right.  And the plumbers and pipe fitters
 8    had done most of their work at this point?
 9         A    Yes, um-hum.
10         Q    Okay.  Do you recall whether for this jobsite
11    there was spray insulation applied to the beams or to
12    the ceilings and things like that?
13         A    There was, yes.
14         Q    Okay.  And were you present while that work
15    was going on?
16         A    For some of it I was, yes.
17         Q    And how about Benny, did you see him working
18    while that was going on?
19         A    I'm sure he was.
20         Q    Because you were working with him?
21         A    Yes.
22         Q    Okay.  Do you know who the contractor was for
23    the application of the spray?
24         A    I really don't remember.
0114
 1         Q    Okay.  Is that something that you encountered
 2    a lot in the 1960s?
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    And so the pipe coverers workers, the Local 6
 5    workers would often be working at the same time as the
 6    spray insulators; correct?
 7         A    For the most part.  Mostly they were spraying
 8    the beams and the uprights.
 9         Q    Yeah.
10         A    Before they enclosed them all, so --
11         Q    Right.
12         A    -- a lot of them that was already done before
13    we got on the job.
14         Q    Okay.
15         A    And once in a while, there may be one spot
16    here or there they would have to do, you know, just to
17    finish up or something like that.
18         Q    Okay.  And you guys would be doing your work
19    at the same time --
20         A    Yeah.
21         Q    -- is that what you're saying?
22              Okay.  Okay.  Do you know the brand name or
23    manufacturer's name of the materials that they were
24    putting in at the JFK building on the beams?
0115
 1         A    I don't.
 2         Q    Okay.
 3         A    I know it was just a spray insulation.  They
 4    called it fireproofing they called it.
 5         Q    Yeah.  The -- so I take it there were probably
 6    a lot of pipe covers on this job?
 7         A    They were, yeah.
 8         Q    Who was the -- who was your employer?
 9         A    New England Insulation.
10         Q    Do you recall how big the crew was when you
11    got there?
12         A    I would say probably 20 guys or so.  Then they
13    put on some what they call travelers, workers from other
14    locals.
15         Q    Got you.  This was a busy time for your local,
16    wasn't it?
17         A    It was.  Yeah.
18         Q    The JFK -- so how long were you on this job?
19         A    I went from that job in the same year up to
20    International Paper in Jay, Maine.
21         Q    Okay.
22         A    So I might have been there four or five months
23    or four -- three or four months.  I'm not positive about
24    it, but --
0116
 1         Q    And when you went up to Jay, Maine, did you
 2    work for a different employer?
 3         A    No, same, same office.  New England.
 4         Q    So NEI?
 5         A    Yeah.  NEI.
 6         Q    So for the three to five months approximately
 7    that you were working at the JFK building, was Benny
 8    there throughout that time?
 9         A    Yes.  Then he went up to Jay, Maine, also from
10    that job.
11         Q    Did you go at the same time that he did?
12         A    I'm not quite sure.
13         Q    Okay.
14         A    Probably not.
15         Q    Okay.
16         A    Because I was a helper, so --
17         Q    Right.
18         A    -- they were probably staging the job, getting
19    everything ready, and -- but there were already guys
20    there too, so --
21         Q    So who left first, you or him?
22         A    I think I did, but I can't swear to that.
23         Q    Okay.  Fair enough.  You know I just have to
24    ask these questions.
0117
 1         A    That's fine.
 2         Q    That's good.  That's good.  All right.  So
 3    were you -- were you assisting Benny Crescenzo the
 4    entire time you were working the JFK job, or were there
 5    other apprentices that were doing that?
 6         A    There were other apprentices too, you know.
 7         Q    Okay.  Okay.  So what I want to focus you on
 8    right now is what work did you observe Benny Crescenzo
 9    doing on the JFK job?
10         A    Applying pipe covering mostly.
11         Q    Okay.  And obviously this is to pipes.  What
12    type of pipes are we talking about?
13         A    Steam pipes, plumbing pipes.
14         Q    Would this be pipes that ran throughout the
15    building?
16         A    Yes.
17         Q    Okay.  Was there a mechanical room or area at
18    all that you --
19         A    Yeah.
20         Q    -- can recall?
21         A    Yes.
22         Q    Do you recall seeing Benny do any work in that
23    room, or was this just --
24         A    You know, I was all over that job supplying
0118
 1    stuff.
 2         Q    Okay.
 3         A    He probably was because most of the guys were
 4    in and out sometimes, so you do so much, and then you
 5    have to wait for the fitters or the plumbers to finish
 6    up what they were doing for the next phase.
 7         Q    Did you observe him doing any work in the
 8    boiler room at all?
 9         A    Yeah.
10         Q    Where was the boiler room located?
11         A    Let me think now.  It was in the boiler floor.
12    That's all I can remember.
13         Q    Okay.  Do you remember the brand name,
14    tradename, or manufacturer of the boiler?
15         A    I don't.
16         Q    Do you remember what type of boiler it was?
17         A    I don't.  I was a first-year helper.  I didn't
18    know --
19         Q    Understand.  And I just have to ask you --
20         A    That's fine.
21         Q    -- in case one of these other --
22         A    That's fine.  I just want to let you know.
23         Q    Yep, yep.  Did you do any work in the boiler
24    room yourself?
0119
 1         A    No, just supplying the stock.  That was mostly
 2    my job was supplying stock to the guys.
 3         Q    Okay.  And so they -- this is a big room where
 4    they would keep the material as well?
 5         A    Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like a basement -- I
 6    don't know if it was a garage or not underneath.  I'm
 7    not sure, but it was an open space.  We had a -- we
 8    built our own shed out of the boxes of stock, you know.
 9         Q    Okay.  Got you.
10         A    For lunch and stuff.
11         Q    Sort of walled off --
12         A    Yeah.
13         Q    -- your own little space?
14         A    Yeah.
15         Q    Got you.  Okay.  So you didn't do any work in
16    the boiler room.  Most of your work was lugging it out
17    up into the building, I assume?
18         A    Yes, yes.
19         Q    Okay.  And the insulators, then, would be
20    applying the covering to the pipe?
21         A    Yes.
22         Q    Other than applying pipe covering to pipes, do
23    you recall seeing Benny Crescenzo doing any other type
24    of work?
0120
 1         A    Some ductwork.
 2         Q    Other than applying ductwork insulation and
 3    pipe covering, did he do -- do you remember seeing him
 4    do any other type of work?
 5         A    The ductwork took -- we used to cover it with
 6    a chicken wire and a coat of One Cote cement.  Then a
 7    coat of asbestos cement over that, then canvas on top of
 8    that.
 9         Q    And then what on top of that?
10         A    Canvas.
11         Q    Canvas.
12         A    Heavy canvas.
13         Q    Yep.  Okay.  We'll get into that in a little
14    more detail.  But other than the ductwork and the pipe
15    covering, do you recall seeing Benny do any other type
16    of work?
17         A    I don't remember.
18         Q    Okay.  And was this work being done just on
19    the different floors of the building?  Is that what it
20    was?
21         A    Yes.  Yes.  It was, I think, a 27-story
22    building.
23         Q    Yeah, good size.
24         A    And then they had a mechanical room up top.
0121
 1         Q    Okay.  Do you recall seeing him do any work in
 2    the mechanical room?
 3         A    Yes, that's -- the ductwork.
 4         Q    Ductwork?
 5         A    Yeah.
 6         Q    Was that all in the mechanical room?
 7         A    Mostly was, yes.  As far as I remember, it
 8    was.
 9         Q    Okay.  So you've mentioned One Cote of couple
10    of times yesterday.  What is One Cote?
11         A    It's a cement they -- it's a one-coat finish
12    for fittings.  It's for heat -- well, heat plumbing too,
13    cold.  Just on the fittings and elbows and valves you
14    use this just to patch in the different areas.  There
15    might be openings and stuff like that.
16         Q    Okay.  So areas in between where the block
17    pipe covering couldn't cover; right?
18         A    Yes, exactly.
19         Q    Okay.
20         A    It's an insulating cement is what it is.
21         Q    Do you know the manufacturer of One Cote?
22         A    You asked me yesterday, and I was racking my
23    brain.  I can't remember.
24         Q    I figured I could do a better job of racking?
0122
 1              MR. KENNY:  Of course.
 2         A    You are so far.  Just joking.
 3    BY MR. LYNCH:
 4         Q    No.  You don't know how funny that is.
 5              Then you mentioned there was also an asbestos
 6    cement that you would cover over --
 7         A    Yes, um-hum.
 8         Q    -- material?
 9              Do you remember the brand name, tradename, or
10    manufacturer of that?
11         A    I think it was Vermont Asbestos.  I know
12    because -- well, I mixed a lot of the big mud tubs.
13         Q    Okay.
14         A    Bags of it.
15         Q    And when you say you think it was Vermont
16    Asbestos, what do you recall?
17         A    It was a 7M asbestos too on different jobs,
18    so --
19         Q    Was that different than the Vermont Asbestos?
20         A    It was the same -- it was asbestos cement.
21         Q    Okay.
22         A    Maybe a different manufacturer.
23         Q    Got you.  Got you.  Do you know who made the
24    7M?
0123
 1         A    I'm not quite sure of that either.
 2         Q    Okay.  So what about the material that you
 3    described as Vermont Asbestos told you that it was
 4    Vermont Asbestos?
 5         A    It was on the bags, yeah.
 6         Q    What size bags were they?
 7         A    They were 50-pound bags, either 50 or
 8    80 pounds.  Some of them might have been 80 pounds, but
 9    at least 50 pounds.
10         Q    What type of material was the bag?
11         A    It was like a heavy -- not canvas, but a heavy
12    paper, like a reinforced paper.
13         Q    Okay.
14         A    With a lining on the inside of it.
15         Q    What color was the paper?
16         A    Like a beige, beige color.
17         Q    And other than the name Vermont Asbestos, do
18    you recall any other writing on the bag?
19         A    There was writing too, and it would say net
20    weight 50 pounds or -- but I think it was harvested in
21    Vermont, state of Vermont.  I think that's where most of
22    it came from was Vermont.
23         Q    Okay.  Any other writing that you can recall
24    on the bag?
0124
 1         A    Not that I can remember, no.
 2         Q    All right.
 3         A    It's just for a high insulating cement,
 4    something like that.  You know what I mean?
 5         Q    Got you.  Got you.
 6              So you also mentioned canvas.  Do you know who
 7    made that material?
 8         A    I don't.  It came in rolls too, and I can't
 9    remember.
10         Q    Okay.  And I assume that NEI supplied all the
11    materials for this job?
12         A    Yes.
13         Q    The pipe-covering material, can you tell me if
14    you remember the brand name, tradename, or
15    manufacturer's name of that?
16         A    It was Kaylo pipe insulation and Kaylo block.
17    Then there was also fiberglass pipe covering.  I can't
18    remember.  I thought of it this morning too, and I -- I
19    can't remember.
20         Q    Okay.  Well, let's stick with the Kaylo.  How
21    did that come packaged?
22         A    Boxes, cartons.
23         Q    Okay.  Do you remember any writing on the
24    boxes or cartons?
0125
 1         A    Just high-temperature insulation.
 2         Q    Okay.
 3         A    That's about it.
 4         Q    Other than Kaylo, do you remember any name on
 5    it identified it?
 6         A    I don't.  I don't.
 7         Q    Okay.  Got to ask.
 8         A    Yeah, oh, I know.
 9         Q    Okay.  So Benny would be carrying that
10    material to the different mechanics throughout the
11    building.  Is that what's going on?
12         A    I would be --
13         Q    You would be --
14         A    He was applying.
15         Q    Oh, he was applying, okay.  That's right.  So
16    you would be carrying to him and to others?
17         A    Um-hum.
18         Q    To apply the materials?
19         A    Um-hum.
20         Q    That's a "yes"?
21         A    Yes.  Sorry.
22         Q    You are doing good.  You are doing good.
23              Did you see Benny working with any materials
24    other than what we've just talked about?
0126
 1         A    Not that I can recall.
 2         Q    Okay.
 3         A    That's about the major part of the whole job.
 4         Q    Now, with respect to any of the equipment that
 5    was involved on the plumbing or the steam systems, are
 6    you able to identify for us the manufacturer or the
 7    tradename or anything about any of the equipment?
 8         A    I don't.  I don't.
 9         Q    No.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Just got to ask.
10              Okay.  Is that occasion in 1965 the only time
11    you recall working with Benny Crescenzo at the JFK
12    building?
13         A    Yes.
14         Q    And then you say at some point then shortly
15    thereafter you both ended up at one of the paper mills?
16         A    Um-hum.
17         Q    And it's the International Paper mill?
18         A    Yes, in Jay, Maine.
19         Q    Okay.  You checked off the Saint Regus Paper
20    in Bucksport.  Do you see that?
21         A    Yes.  We were up there too.
22         Q    Okay.  If the Saint Regus dates seems to be
23    '63 to '65 and then the International Paper is '65, just
24    so you know, do you know which came first?
0127
 1         A    The Jay came first.  I know that.
 2         Q    Jay came first?
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    So your next memory is after the JFK building
 5    you were then up at Jay at that paper mill?
 6         A    Yes.  Yeah.
 7         Q    And at some point Benny Crescenzo was there as
 8    well?
 9         A    Yes.
10         Q    All right.  What work was being done by NEI at
11    that site?
12         A    All the insulation work, piping ductwork,
13    boiler.
14         Q    Was it new construction?
15         A    Yes.  It was a new paper mill.  There was an
16    old one right down the street from it in Livermore
17    Falls, and they built a brand-new one up maybe two miles
18    up the road.
19         Q    Okay.  So I take it it was not operational
20    when you were there; correct?
21         A    No.  No.
22         Q    Okay.  At what stage of construction was the
23    mill when you arrived?
24         A    It was pretty far along.  Like I say, mostly
0128
 1    the equipment was in, the piping and stuff.  I mean,
 2    they were still working on some, like the tanks and
 3    stuff outside.  They had different types of tanks and
 4    stuff.  It was, you know, ready for us to go in there.
 5         Q    Okay.  And what work do you recall seeing
 6    Mr. Crescenzo doing?
 7         A    Piping, pipe covering, mostly pipe covering, I
 8    would say.  There was a ton of it.
 9         Q    Yeah.  There's a lot of steam lines running
10    through a paper plant; right?
11         A    Yes, chemicals.  Excuse me.
12         Q    Do you recall, for the paper plant at Jay,
13    seeing Benny Crescenzo doing any work other than
14    applying pipe covering to pipes?
15         A    We had some outside tanks that I forget what
16    they -- their specific names were, but there was, like,
17    three or four of them out in a row.  And we had a crew
18    on each one of them, and Benny was on the crew -- one of
19    the crews.
20         Q    Okay.  So he was applying insulation to one of
21    the tanks?
22         A    Yes, block, Kaylo block.
23         Q    Any materials other than Kaylo block that was
24    being used on that tank?
0129
 1         A    There was probably piping going to it, so I'm
 2    assuming that there was pipe covering done there too.
 3         Q    Well, we don't want you to assume or guess.
 4    Did you see --
 5         A    Well, there is positively piping going to
 6    those tanks.
 7         Q    Sure.  Did you see him working on that?
 8         A    Yes.
 9         Q    And do you recall the brand name, tradename,
10    or manufacturer of that pipe covering?
11         A    That's Kaylo.
12         Q    Also Kaylo?
13         A    Yeah.
14         Q    Okay.
15         A    The Owens Corning fiberglass pipe covering was
16    on the JFK job.  Just came to me, Owens Corning.
17         Q    That's the fiberglass?
18         A    On the JFK job.  Probably that job too if
19    there was some.
20         Q    Okay.  So do you know the brand name,
21    tradename, or manufacturer of the tanks that were being
22    insulated?
23         A    I don't.
24         Q    And other than applying the Kaylo block and
0130
 1    pipe covering, was there any other materials that were
 2    being used for that work?
 3         A    There was a digester they called it.  It was
 4    done with fiberglass board.
 5         Q    Okay.
 6         A    And actually me and a helper, me and another
 7    helper did most of the work on that.  The other guys
 8    were afraid to go up on it and stage it.
 9         Q    Okay.
10         A    I should have got more money for doing it, but
11    I didn't.
12         Q    Did what you were told in those days; right?
13         A    Hum?
14         Q    You did what you were told?
15         A    Exactly right.
16         Q    Yeah.  Do you know who made the fiberglass
17    board?
18         A    I think it was Owens Corning also.
19         Q    Okay.  Any other equipment that you can recall
20    that Benny Crescenzo worked on at the International
21    Paper plant in Jay?
22         A    I can't remember.  It's just there is so much
23    stuff there.
24         Q    Okay.
0131
 1         A    The piping, those tanks, the ductwork.
 2         Q    What kind of ductwork?  I'm not sure.  Maybe I
 3    missed the ductwork.
 4         A    It was -- not ductwork, the tank work.
 5         Q    Tank work.  Okay.  Yep.
 6         A    Yeah, but --
 7         Q    Okay.  Okay.  And I didn't ask this, but
 8    the -- I think I know the answer.  The pipe covering
 9    that was applied just to the regular pipes in the mill,
10    who made that?
11         A    I would say Kaylo insulation was applied on
12    most of that.
13         Q    Okay.
14         A    Yeah.
15         Q    So the steam lines outside as well as inside
16    were all Kaylo?
17         A    Yes, yes.  And something like the hot water
18    and cold water was fiberglass pipe insulation too.
19         Q    Okay.  And that would have been Owens Corning
20    as well?
21         A    I'm pretty sure it was Owens Corning.
22         Q    Was there any cement or coverings or any
23    materials like that being used on that job?
24         A    Yes.
0132
 1         Q    Do you recall the brand name, tradename, or
 2    manufacturer of that?
 3         A    One Cote and the Vermont Asbestos.
 4         Q    Okay.
 5         A    All the fittings at that time was used mud.
 6    Now they have like a fiberglass with a PVC cover --
 7         Q    Um-hum.
 8         A    -- all premade that snaps right over the
 9    fittings.
10         Q    Got you.
11         A    So back then it was all -- all cement.
12         Q    When you say a fitting, what is that?
13         A    An elbow of a valve or a T.
14         Q    Okay.  Are you able to recall any of the
15    manufacturers of any of the fittings for any of these
16    jobs that we are talking about?
17         A    No.  See, that was the plumbers' work.
18         Q    Right.
19         A    It was, you know -- I don't remember.
20         Q    Okay.  Anything else that you can recall
21    seeing Benny Crescenzo do on the Jay paper mill job?
22         A    No.  Just applying the -- you know, cutting
23    the insulation, you know, fitting it right, and all that
24    stuff which we had a lot of dust, by the way.  Just
0133
 1    mostly our trade, what we do in our trade.
 2         Q    Right.  And cutting pipe covering is a dusty
 3    process?
 4         A    Oh, yeah.
 5         Q    I think we all agree on that.
 6         A    Yeah, it was.
 7         Q    Yeah.  The -- so how long were you at the Jay
 8    mill?
 9         A    Probably a few months.  Then they went up to
10    the other job on Bucksport.  The helpers they kind of
11    bounced around a little bit, the apprentices.
12         Q    And you're not sure whether you went there
13    before or after Benny; correct?
14         A    I'm not quite sure.
15         Q    How about when you left?  Do you recall
16    whether he was still there or whether he had moved on?
17         A    I don't remember that either.
18         Q    Okay.  So you can't say for sure how long he
19    was there?
20         A    No.  Not positively.  I know he was there, but
21    for how long, I don't know.
22         Q    Okay.  So during that period of the three or
23    four months that you were there, he was there, but we
24    don't know how long; correct?
0134
 1         A    Um-hum.
 2         Q    Let you take a drink.
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    Thank you.  Okay.  Any other work you can
 5    recall about the International Paper mill in Jay?
 6         A    That's about it.
 7         Q    Okay.  I think we've covered it.  That's good.
 8    So you mentioned that you also went to another paper
 9    mill up in that time period?
10         A    Yeah.
11         Q    The Saint Regus; is that right?
12         A    Yeah, in Bucksport.  And it was the same type
13    of work.  Everything was the same.
14         Q    Was this new construction?
15         A    I'm -- I don't think it was because I was
16    there a couple of times, and I think it was a plant that
17    was already there, and they might have added a paper
18    machine or something like that.
19         Q    Got you.  So you're there a couple of times.
20    Do you recall how many times you were there and Benny
21    Crescenzo was also there?
22         A    I know then that year.
23         Q    Okay.
24         A    And he may have been there after that other
0135
 1    times I was there, but I just can't be --
 2         Q    So this would be 1965?
 3         A    Yeah.  I can't pinpoint the other times I saw
 4    Benny there.
 5         Q    Sure.  I think that's fair enough.  So let's
 6    just focus on that one time with Benny.  How long were
 7    you there?
 8         A    Probably a few months.  You know, they bounce
 9    us around, like I say, you know.
10         Q    I completely understand.
11         A    Yeah.
12         Q    And do you -- are you able to say whether,
13    when you arrived there, whether Benny was already there
14    or not?
15         A    I can't tell you.
16         Q    Same thing for when you left?
17         A    Yeah.
18         Q    You don't know?
19         A    I'm not sure, no.
20         Q    All right.  Was it the same sort of hierarchy
21    too?  You were assisting, and he was a little more
22    senior.
23         A    Yeah, yeah.  He was a mechanic then, a
24    journeyman, I'm sure.
0136
 1         Q    Okay.  Okay.  So -- and this is an NEI job as
 2    well?
 3         A    Um-hum.
 4         Q    Yes?
 5         A    Yes.
 6         Q    What work was -- was being done?
 7         A    Piping, mostly piping.
 8         Q    Okay.  So this was an established mill.  Do
 9    you recall whether there was any removal of any
10    insulation material being done by NEI?
11         A    I can't remember.  Back then if something had
12    to be taken off, we would take it off, you know, throw
13    it in the plastic bag and throw it in the dumpster.
14         Q    Sure.  And I think I didn't ask a very good
15    question.  So while you were there and you remember
16    Benny being there as well, was NEI removing material or
17    was it just applying material?
18         A    I can't say for sure.
19         Q    All right.
20         A    But they probably were, but I can't say for
21    sure.
22         Q    Okay.
23         A    Then they started their own removal business a
24    few years after that in Erie, yes.
0137
 1         Q    Right.  Understand that, yeah.  Did you ever
 2    work in the removal side of the business?
 3         A    A little bit.  Not much.
 4         Q    Okay.  Did you ever get certified to remove
 5    asbestos?
 6         A    I did, yeah.
 7         Q    That's a lot of the Local 6 men got that
 8    certification; right?
 9         A    They did, yeah.
10         Q    Yeah.
11         A    But then they decided not to do it.  They
12    started their own little local, 6A I think it was.  You
13    know, once every -- you know, I didn't want to remove
14    it.  I put it on.  I had enough of that.
15         Q    Got you.  All right.  So you recall, then,
16    that Benny Crescenzo was applying material?
17         A    Yes, um-hum.
18         Q    Okay.  And you mentioned piping?
19         A    Um-hum.
20         Q    Other than piping, do you recall any other
21    work, any other equipment that was being insulated by
22    Benny Crescenzo?
23         A    I don't remember.
24         Q    Okay.  Let's talk about the piping then.  What
0138
 1    material was being applied?
 2         A    Kaylo pipe insulation.
 3         Q    Any other materials besides Kaylo pipe
 4    covering?
 5         A    I can't remember.  I don't really remember,
 6    but if it was, like, hot water or cold water, it was
 7    pipe -- fiberglass insulation.
 8         Q    Okay.  Any cement or material used for
 9    fittings?
10         A    Same cement, same scenario.
11         Q    Same products?
12         A    Yes.
13         Q    So One Cote and --
14         A    I think they had like a franchise on the pipe
15    covering.  That's all they used.  They got that
16    material, the Owens Corning, from them.
17         Q    So let me ask it this way to be clearer.  So
18    when you say "they," you mean NEI?
19         A    Um-hum.  Yes.
20         Q    And so when you worked for NEI, you remember
21    that the materials were mostly Owens Corning materials?
22         A    Yes.
23         Q    Okay.  It was your understanding they had some
24    sort of deal with them?
0139
 1         A    And Kaylo.  And I think the more they ordered
 2    the cheaper it was for them too.  They used to get it by
 3    the train load at International Paper.  I know that.
 4         Q    Okay.  So when you say "they used to get it,"
 5    you're saying?
 6         A    NEI.
 7         Q    NEI.  And it arrived at the job up in Maine by
 8    train?
 9         A    Yes.
10         Q    Okay.
11         A    Some trucks, some train, you know.
12         Q    Were you unloading railcars?
13         A    Yes, um-hum.
14         Q    How far away was the rail siding?
15         A    Not that far, you know.  It might have been
16    right on the job, if I can recall right.
17         Q    Okay.  Well, that was going to be my next
18    question.  Did you have to load it onto a truck?
19         A    Well, I think some of it we did, and some was
20    close enough we could just take it off and put it --
21    they had, like, a little building there they used to
22    keep it in, you know.
23         Q    Okay.  Okay.  And then once it came time to
24    bring in the material to the mechanics, how did you do
0140
 1    that?
 2         A    We would load a truck and take it to the
 3    different sections wherever they needed it.
 4         Q    Okay.  Okay.  Any other materials that you can
 5    recall you and Mr. Crescenzo using on the Saint Regus
 6    paper job?
 7         A    No, I can't recall.
 8         Q    Okay.
 9              (Off-the-record discussion held.)
10    BY MR. LYNCH:
11         Q    The next job on your list here is Boston
12    Edison/L Street?
13         A    Um-hum.
14         Q    Where is that located?
15         A    South Boston.
16         Q    Okay.  Who were you working for for that job?
17         A    That was New England Insulation also.
18         Q    Okay.  Do you recall the year?
19         A    In the '60s, '69 was it?
20         Q    It was '69 on this sheet?
21         A    Yes.
22         Q    You pretty sure it was '69?
23         A    I think it was.  I've been there a bunch of
24    times too, so --
0141
 1              MR. LYNCH:  Do we have the marked Social
 2         Security record here today?  That's it.  Great.
 3    BY MR. LYNCH:
 4         Q    Do you recall working for Spacecon?
 5         A    I know I saw that.  I don't remember who it
 6    is.
 7         Q    Yeah.  You did that off and on for a few
 8    years?
 9         A    Spacecon.  Was it an insulation outfit?
10    Spacecon.
11         Q    Do you recall working for Philip Carey Corp?
12         A    Yes.
13         Q    Okay.  I'm seeing for NEI here '68 earnings
14    but not '69?
15         A    No.
16         Q    Could it be '68 that you did this work?
17         A    Oh.  '68.  Sometimes the job goes from '68
18    into '69 or vice versa.
19         Q    Understood.  Okay.  So in any event, tell us
20    what type of work NEI was doing at the L Street station?
21         A    Same, insulation piping.
22         Q    Okay.
23         A    Boiler, boilers.
24         Q    You remember boilers?
0142
 1         A    Yeah.
 2         Q    Okay.
 3         A    They were patching the boiler.  We would patch
 4    it.
 5         Q    Is there --
 6         A    They had shut-downs.  So they would replace
 7    some of the old stuff, and we'd replace it with the new
 8    insulation.
 9         Q    Okay.  Is it -- how long do you recall that
10    you were on that job?
11         A    I think I would say months because I know it's
12    less than a year, so --
13         Q    And when you came on that job, was Benny
14    Crescenzo already there?
15         A    I think he was.
16         Q    And when you left, was he still working?
17         A    I think he was still there.
18         Q    Okay.
19         A    His brother-in-law Paul Paulson ran a lot of
20    work for NEI, and Benny used to work a lot with him.
21         Q    Paul Paulson?
22         A    Yes.
23         Q    Okay.  Was he in charge of the job?
24         A    Yeah.  Yes.  He was deceased too.
0143
 1         Q    Pardon me.  He's deceased?  Yeah.
 2              Can you tell me how many NEI workers there
 3    were on this job?
 4         A    Probably 10 or 12.
 5         Q    And what was your position at the time?
 6         A    I was probably a third-year apprentice.
 7         Q    Okay.  And Benny was a mechanic at that point?
 8         A    Yeah, yeah.
 9         Q    Were you assisting -- well, strike that.
10              How many apprentices were on the job?
11         A    I want to say three maybe.
12         Q    Did you work with Benny all the time or some
13    of the time?
14         A    Just some of the time.  You never work with
15    the same guy for the whole job, you know.
16         Q    Can you tell me what work it was you have a
17    memory of seeing Benny do at the L Street station?
18         A    The piping, the fittings that went a lot with
19    the piping.  That's about all I remember.
20         Q    Okay.
21         A    See, most of the jobs, that's what it is.
22    It's all piping or --
23         Q    Sure.
24         A    You know, just repetitive.  Everything we do
0144
 1    is repetitive.
 2         Q    Sometimes there is work on specific equipment
 3    like those tanks that you mentioned, so we got to --
 4         A    Yeah.
 5         Q    If that happened, we need to know.  Okay?
 6         A    Yeah.  Um-hum.
 7         Q    So the piping would be steam piping; is that
 8    right?
 9         A    Yes, yes.
10         Q    What material was being applied?
11         A    The same.  Kaylo pipe insulation.  The same
12    insulating cement.
13         Q    So One Cote you think?
14         A    Yes.
15         Q    And Vermont Asbestos?
16         A    Yes.
17         Q    And that would be used for the fittings;
18    correct?
19         A    Yes.
20         Q    Okay.  Do you remember the brand name,
21    tradename, or manufacturer of any of the fittings?
22         A    I don't.
23         Q    About how long do you recall Benny working on
24    that job?
0145
 1         A    I was there a few months, and he was there the
 2    whole time I was there, you know.
 3         Q    Okay.  What other workers do you recall from
 4    that job?
 5         A    That were on the job with us?
 6         Q    Yes, the NEI crew.
 7         A    Paul Paulson, John Traina, Freddy Fitzgerald,
 8    Walter Clifford, can't remember.  That's about all I can
 9    remember.
10         Q    Okay.  Fair enough.  That's pretty good.
11         A    Yeah.  Well, you work with the guys -- you
12    know, most of the same guys you work on jobs with too,
13    you know, if you work for the one shop.
14         Q    Right.  Similar crews?
15         A    Yeah.
16         Q    Yeah.  And I take it from your list here
17    that's the only time you can recall working L Street
18    with Benny; correct?
19         A    Yes.
20         Q    Okay.  The next job I see here is Monsanto?
21         A    Um-hum.
22         Q    In Everett; correct?
23         A    Monsanto, yes.
24         Q    I hear they are building something else there
0146
 1    now?
 2         A    Oh, I don't know.  They could be.
 3         Q    Do you gamble?
 4         A    Oh, the casino.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
 5         Q    So do you recall what year it was that you
 6    went to Monsanto?
 7         A    I'm thinking around '70, something like that.
 8         Q    Okay.
 9         A    '71.
10         Q    Was it soon after you had been at L Street?
11         A    Yes.
12         Q    Was this an NEI job as well?
13         A    Yes.  Um-hum.  Yes.
14         Q    And how many NEI workers were on that job?
15         A    Geez.  There was a few.  I know Walter
16    Clifford was running the job.
17         Q    Okay.
18         A    Dick Dawson might have been on there.  Benny.
19    Geez, I can't remember.
20         Q    Okay.  What was the work that was being done
21    by NEI?
22         A    That was mostly piping on that job.
23         Q    Was this new construction?
24         A    It was new.  The job itself was old, but that
0147
 1    was new -- new piping they were putting in.  I don't
 2    know if they added a chemical to the plant or whatever,
 3    but --
 4         Q    So was it in one of manufacturing areas?
 5         A    It was mostly outside.
 6         Q    Okay.
 7         A    Yeah.
 8         Q    So were these steam lines?
 9         A    Yes.
10         Q    And were they above-ground steam lines?
11         A    Yes.  They were -- you know, they were
12    probably 3 feet off the ground maybe.
13         Q    Got you.
14         A    And they'd run around and into the buildings.
15         Q    What were the diameter of the pipes?
16         A    I would say they were about 12-inch pipe, as
17    far as I remember.
18         Q    Okay.
19         A    Good-sized pipe.
20         Q    And so the work was all being -- that was
21    being done was all insulating these pipes?
22         A    Yes.
23         Q    What materials were being applied?
24         A    Kaylo.
0148
 1         Q    Right.  So Kaylo pipe covering?
 2         A    Yes.  And block if they had -- the valves,
 3    sometimes they couldn't get the right proper size pipe
 4    cover to go over the valves, they would block them.
 5         Q    Okay.  Any other materials, cement materials?
 6         A    The cement, the same.
 7         Q    One Cote?
 8         A    One Cote.  And then there was a
 9    high-temperature cement too.  Hy-Temp they called it.
10         Q    Okay.
11         A    For the real hot lines, and I don't remember
12    the manufacturer of that either.
13         Q    So you mentioned, as we've gone through this
14    process One Cote, and you're not sure who made that;
15    correct?
16         A    Yeah.  I don't remember.
17         Q    Vermont Asbestos is something that was used as
18    well?
19         A    I think that was the name brand, Vermont
20    Asbestos.
21         Q    Okay.
22         A    And there was also 7M.  I forget if --
23         Q    Right.  And you're not sure who made that?
24         A    No.
0149
 1         Q    Okay.  And then Hy-Temp, is that another -- is
 2    it a type of cement or a brand name?
 3         A    It's a heavier -- heavier-type insulation.
 4    When you mixed it, it had more fibers in it and stuff.
 5         Q    Okay.
 6         A    It was more for real high-temperature piping.
 7         Q    Was it made by one manufacture or were there
 8    different varieties of Hy-Temp?  Do you know?
 9         A    I'm not sure, but I think it was one
10    manufacturer.
11         Q    But you don't know who that is?
12         A    I don't.
13         Q    No.  I just got to ask you.
14         A    I know.  You think I would I worked it for so
15    long, but sometimes I don't remember my own name.
16         Q    Sometimes there is stuff you see most often is
17    the easiest to forget?
18         A    I guess.
19         Q    Okay.  So all this work was outside.  It was
20    all with the Kaylo material and the difference --
21         A    Some of that was inside.
22         Q    Okay.
23         A    But I didn't work inside, as far as I can
24    remember, because I remember working on that pipe on the
0150
 1    outside mostly.
 2         Q    Okay.  Did you ever observe Benny Crescenzo
 3    doing any work inside?
 4         A    Yes -- uh, no, I didn't work inside.
 5         Q    Okay.  Okay.
 6         A    As far as I can remember.
 7         Q    That's all we can ask.
 8         A    Yeah.
 9         Q    About how long were you there?
10         A    A few months.  You know, these jobs, they
11    don't last that long, you know.
12         Q    Yeah.  When you started, was Benny already
13    there?
14         A    I'm pretty sure he was.
15         Q    When you left was he still working or had he
16    left?
17         A    I think he was, yeah.
18         Q    Okay.  All right.  If you don't mind, why
19    don't we take a short break?  I'm near the end of my
20    examination.  I'm sure I'll get some instructions and
21    then have a few more questions for you, and then I'll
22    pass you on to the rest of the group.
23              MR. HUMEN:  Perfect.  We are coming close to
24         an hour anyways.  I was going to suggest one soon,
0151
 1         so --
 2              THE WITNESS:  Okay.
 3              MR. LYNCH:  All right.  Thanks.
 4              (Recess taken from 10:58a.m. until
 5         11:12 a.m.)
 6              MR. LYNCH:  Okay.  Back on the record.
 7              Based on an off-the-record conversation, we
 8         recognize that some of the exhibits that have been
 9         marked -- in fact, now that I look at it, almost
10         all of the exhibits that have been marked --
11              MR. HUMEN:  Yeah.
12              MR. LYNCH:  -- as exhibits have Mr. Donovan's
13         full social security number on there, and we have
14         agreed to work out redacting the social security
15         number so that only the last four digits will be
16         shown, and counsel and I will endeavor to get that
17         done before any of these exhibits are distributed
18         to anybody else.  Okay.
19              THE WITNESS:  I appreciate that, thank you.
20              MR. LYNCH:  By all means.
21              The second housekeeping matter is yesterday we
22         marked as Exhibit Number 2 the work history of
23         Mr. Donovan, and then he was nice enough between
24         yesterday and today to mark in red pen the jobsites
0152
 1         that he worked with Benny Crescenzo on as he
 2         testified to earlier.  And so we've marked as
 3         Exhibit 5 dated April 6th, that document.
 4              So in case anybody is confused, I just wanted
 5         to have the explanation on the record as to why one
 6         document actually has two exhibit stickers on it.
 7         Okay.
 8              MR. HUMEN:  Fine.
 9              (Exhibit Number 5 marked for identification.)
10              MR. LYNCH:  Any other housekeeping matters?
11              MR. HUMEN:  Not that I can think of.
12              MR. LYNCH:  Okay.  Good.
13              I'm going to mark these.  We used these at the
14         last deposition, so just to give you a heads up.
15              MR. HUMEN:  Okay.
16    BY MR. LYNCH:
17         Q    So there were, Mr. Donovan, a couple of
18    questions that I needed to follow up on you--
19         A    Um-hum.
20         Q    -- that I may have skipped by.
21              On Saint Regus you mentioned that you and
22    Mr. Crescenzo were doing work on piping.  It's a big
23    place I know.  Can you tell me where it was that this
24    piping was that you were doing the work?
0153
 1         A    Geez.  I can't specifically say if it was the
 2    powerhouse or in the --
 3         Q    In the plant itself?
 4         A    -- the plant itself.  I can't remember.
 5         Q    You're not sure either way?
 6         A    No.
 7         Q    Okay.
 8         A    Could have been both.
 9         Q    We don't want you to guess.
10         A    No, I'm not guessing, but I know we were
11    working on it, but where it was specifically, if it was
12    in this room or that room or -- I can't tell you.
13         Q    Okay.  Well, my question I guess to you is
14    today, all these years later, do you have a specific
15    memory of seeing where Mr. Crescenzo was actually
16    working at the Saint Regus paper plant?
17         A    I can't say specifically what area he was in.
18         Q    Okay.
19         A    But I know he was there.
20         Q    Okay.  Fair enough.  For the Monsanto job, you
21    mentioned that there was some of the cement material
22    that was applied to fittings.  Do you remember the brand
23    name, tradename, or manufacturer of any of the
24    fittings --
0154
 1         A    I don't.
 2         Q    -- for Monsanto?
 3         A    Jenkins valve comes into my mind, but I can't
 4    say where they were, what jobs they were.  They might
 5    have been on all of the jobs for all I know.  But the
 6    fittings aren't really marked as far as I know.
 7         Q    Right, right.  I mean, that's why we just have
 8    to ask.
 9         A    Yeah.
10         Q    So you can't say, for example, that Jenkins
11    valves were at any of these jobs --
12         A    Not specifically, but --
13         Q    Let me finish the question.
14         A    Okay.  Sorry.
15         Q    So I'll start again.
16         A    I thought you finished.
17         Q    I pause sometimes.  So you can't say that
18    Jenkins valves were at any of these jobs that either
19    Benny or Crescenzo -- that Benny or Peter Crescenzo were
20    working; correct?
21         A    I can't say specifically what jobs the Jenkins
22    valves were on?
23         Q    Yeah.
24         A    They could have been on all of those jobs.  I
0155
 1    can't say specifically for sure.
 2         Q    Or they could have been on none of them?
 3         A    Well, maybe none of them.  Yeah.  That's true.
 4         Q    Okay.
 5         A    But I'm -- well.
 6         Q    You remember them?
 7         A    Yes, I do.
 8         Q    Okay.  Yesterday we talked about Cleaver
 9    Brooks boilers in connection with Peter Crescenzo's
10    work, so I'm going to ask you the same question.  You
11    don't remember doing any work or seeing any Cleaver
12    Brooks boilers at any of the Benny Crescenzo sites, do
13    you?
14         A    I don't remember.  I don't remember.
15         Q    Okay.  Could I borrow those back now?  All
16    right.  I'm going to mark as Exhibit 6 four pages.
17              (Exhibit Number 6 marked for identification.)
18    BY MR. LYNCH:
19         Q    And I'm going to direct your attention to
20    what's going to be the second of the four pages, and
21    it's sort of a handwritten box, and it says the
22    following words, and I'll let you look at it, okay, in
23    capital letters, "This product contains asbestos fiber,"
24    and then in smaller but black capital letters, "If dust
0156
 1    is created when this product is used avoid breathing the
 2    dust.  If adequate ventilation control is not possible,
 3    wear respirator approved by U.S. Bureau of Mines."
 4              I'm going to ask you to take a look at that,
 5    sir.
 6         A    Um-hum.
 7         Q    Do you recall seeing that warning or something
 8    to that effect on any of the packaging of any of the
 9    materials that you used in your trade?
10         A    I probably have, but I can't specifically say
11    on what products.
12         Q    Okay.  So you've seen something to that effect
13    previously?
14         A    Yes, um-hum.
15         Q    Do you recall when you first saw that type of
16    thing?
17         A    I can't say specifically what year or what
18    month or.
19         Q    Okay.  You mentioned once the '70s hit, I
20    think yesterday you said that at that point these
21    products went asbestos free?
22         A    Right.  Yeah.
23         Q    And you could use your stock, but they
24    couldn't purchase any more; right?
0157
 1         A    Exactly.
 2         Q    Did you see those warnings on the products
 3    prior to 1970 is my question?
 4         A    I can't say specifically that I did.  I
 5    probably did, but I can't say.
 6         Q    Okay.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  All right.
 7    We can put that one in the --
 8              MR. LYNCH:  And we'll mark these 7 and 8.
 9              (Exhibit Number 7 marked for identification.)
10              (Off-the-record discussion held.)
11              (Exhibit Number 8 marked for identification.)
12    BY MR. LYNCH:
13         Q    Let me ask you if you would look at Exhibit 7,
14    and I'll spare you reading the whole thing again.  Just
15    take a quick look at it and review in particular the
16    caution label that's in the middle of the page.  Do you
17    see that, sir?
18         A    Yes, I do.
19         Q    And that's got a similar type of language as
20    that other warning did.  Would you agree with me on
21    that?
22         A    Yes.
23         Q    Okay.  Do you recall seeing that on any
24    packaging?
0158
 1         A    I probably did, but I can't say specifically.
 2         Q    Okay.  Fair enough.  And same question for
 3    Number 8?
 4         A    Same answer.
 5         Q    You don't want to look at it?
 6         A    No.
 7         Q    Okay.  It's about the same.  I think the jury
 8    will understand that.
 9         A    Yeah.
10         Q    Okay.  So you have a general memory of seeing
11    that on some packaging, but you can't say when; is that
12    correct?
13         A    Yes.
14         Q    Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Could I get the
15    one right there on the right, the list?  That's it.
16    Look at that.
17              Yeah.  I didn't get back to that page.  So I
18    skipped over Seabrook, apparently.  Sorry.  So you have
19    on Exhibit Number 2 and Exhibit 5, you checked off
20    Seabrook Station in Seabrook, New Hampshire.  Do you
21    recall working there with Mr. Crescenzo?
22         A    I do.  Yep.
23         Q    Okay.  And that would have been Benny
24    Crescenzo?
0159
 1         A    Right.
 2         Q    Do you recall approximately when you worked
 3    there?
 4         A    I would say '80, '82, something like that.  In
 5    the '80s.
 6         Q    Okay.  Who was your employer?
 7         A    That was New England Insulation also.
 8         Q    All right.  And what was the job that New
 9    England Insulation was doing?
10         A    They had a small job at Seabrook.  It wasn't
11    the major portion of the job.  They were only on there
12    for a short time too, I'm thinking.
13         Q    Okay.
14         A    Just something that had to be done right away.
15    I'm thinking something like that, but it wasn't a real
16    big part of a job.
17         Q    Was it applying insulation or removing?
18         A    Oh, yes.  These were all applying insulation.
19    All those jobs that are listed are applying insulation,
20    cement, and everything that goes with it.
21         Q    Okay.  Now, this job is in 1980.  So at this
22    point you're not using any asbestos material?
23         A    Exactly.  Right.
24         Q    Okay.  Do you recall what materials it was
0160
 1    that was being used for that job?
 2         A    I know it was a lot of fiberglass insulation,
 3    pipe covering.
 4         Q    Okay.
 5         A    That's about all I can remember.
 6         Q    Do you remember what plant or facility the
 7    work was being done?
 8         A    I don't.  I don't.  I was there for almost
 9    four years at Seabrook.  They went from with them to
10    another company that took the job over.
11         Q    Okay.  How long do you recall Benny Crescenzo
12    being there?
13         A    Probably a few months.  Like every job is, you
14    know, three or four, five months.
15         Q    Okay.  Fair enough.
16         A    Except for that major job at Seabrook was,
17    like, three or four years.
18         Q    For you?
19         A    Yeah.
20         Q    Okay.  Okay.  So for the -- for the work that
21    Benny Crescenzo was doing when you were there, we agree
22    that it was applying insulation material; correct?
23         A    Um-hum.  Yes.
24         Q    We agree that it was not asbestos containing?
0161
 1         A    Yes.
 2         Q    Okay.  Now, we asked about the Asbestos
 3    Workers Journal yesterday, so same answers as you gave
 4    yesterday.  I'm not going to ask you about them again
 5    today, okay?
 6         A    Okay.  Thank you.
 7              MR. LYNCH:  I think that I'm done.  Thank you
 8         very much for your time.
 9              THE WITNESS:  Excellent.  I'm very happy.
10              MR. LYNCH:  Appreciate it.  I wasn't that bad.
11              THE WITNESS:  No, just a pain in the --
12              MR. LYNCH:  I hear you.
13              MS. HOCKMEYER:  I'll just speak up.
14                       CROSS EXAMINATION
15    BY MS. HOCKMEYER:
16         Q    Good morning.  Kara Hockmeyer again.  I'm
17    going to ask you similar questions that I asked you
18    yesterday about International Paper.  This time we're
19    just going to focus just on Benny in 1965.  You said
20    that you worked there for a couple of months, correct,
21    three to five months I think you approximated?
22         A    Yes.
23         Q    Can you tell me -- I know you said that you
24    don't recall whether Benny was there first or whether he
0162
 1    was still there when you left.  Can you approximate for
 2    me at all how many months or days or weeks that Benny
 3    was on the site at International Paper while you were
 4    there?
 5         A    I would say a few months.
 6         Q    Are you able to give me any number, three,
 7    four, five, nothing?
 8         A    I can't say.
 9         Q    Okay.  Do you have a memory of what time of
10    year it was or what season it was?
11         A    Probably fall into the winter, I'm thinking.
12         Q    Memory of snow?
13         A    Yeah.  That's what I remember.
14         Q    And yesterday we talked about that you
15    couldn't commute up there.  Fair to say that Benny
16    stayed up there when he was working as well?
17         A    Yes.
18         Q    Do you know where he stayed?
19         A    Some guys rented houses.  A bunch of them
20    would get together and rent a house and some in a motel,
21    but I'm not quite sure where he stayed.
22         Q    Did you ever stay at the same place with
23    Benny?
24         A    No.
0163
 1         Q    Benny was also employed by New England
 2    Insulation at this time?
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    Do you recall who the foreman was on the job?
 5         A    Paul Paulson.  Walter Clifford was under him
 6    and Al Brown was under him.
 7         Q    That was my next question.  You said Alfred
 8    Brown?
 9         A    Yes.  I think it was that.  His last name was
10    Brown because there were two or three of them.
11         Q    So did Benny report to Alfred Brown and then
12    Alfred reported up to Clifford, or did Benny report all
13    the way just straight up to Paul Paulson?
14         A    You didn't report to anybody.  You reported on
15    the job, and they told you where to go.  If Walter had a
16    specific job to do, Paul would say, "Well, take these
17    guys and put them there.  Take those guys and put them
18    here."  So you didn't really report to anybody as far as
19    that goes.
20         Q    Okay.  So was everybody taking their orders
21    from Paul Paulson?
22         A    I think from Walter -- well, from Paul, yes,
23    originally from Paul.  Paul was the general foreman.
24         Q    Got it.  Like we talked about yesterday do you
0164
 1    remember a general contractor being on the job?
 2         A    There was one, but I can't remember.
 3         Q    Do you think it was Walsh Construction?
 4         A    I don't remember Walsh Construction.  Like I
 5    say, I think the only job I remember him on was at Mass
 6    General Hospital -- Walsh Construction.  They could have
 7    been there, but I don't remember.
 8         Q    Who was your supervisor on the job?
 9         A    Walter Clifford mostly.
10         Q    Did you ever report to Benny or take orders
11    from Benny directly?
12         A    No.
13         Q    Would it be fair to say that you and Benny
14    would take your direction and your job assignment
15    instructions from the foreman each day?
16         A    Yes, from the start of the job, say here.  We
17    just go back to the same place we were working before.
18    You know, it wasn't a daily instruction to go here, do
19    this, do that.  They would give you a job to do, and you
20    usually went there until it was finished unless they had
21    something they wanted done faster or something.
22         Q    Understood.  So once would you start a task,
23    you would sort of know that you were assigned to that
24    task and told to complete it unless there was another?
0165
 1         A    Just about, yes.
 2         Q    Did you ever speak with anybody from
 3    International Paper?
 4         A    No.
 5         Q    Do you ever see Benny speak to anybody from
 6    International Paper?
 7         A    I had no reason to, and I don't think Benny
 8    did either.
 9         Q    In 1965 you talked a little bit with Frank
10    about the fact that it was a new construction.  Can you
11    describe for me the facilities of International Paper at
12    that time?  Was it one building? multiple buildings?
13         A    There were multiple buildings.
14         Q    The set-up.
15         A    Yeah.
16         Q    Was there a separate building where the
17    manufacturing and the paper machines were?
18         A    Yes.
19         Q    And then a separate building where the
20    powerhouse equipment would be?
21         A    Yes.  Yeah.
22         Q    Where were the tanks located?
23         A    Outside the building, outside -- I think it
24    was outside the powerhouse.  There was a big digester
0166
 1    area there.  They called it -- that was probably a
 2    hundred 40 feet tall?
 3         Q    The digester was outside?
 4         A    Yes.
 5         Q    And how many tanks were there?
 6         A    Oh, there was a bunch.  I can't remember.
 7    There was so many different chemicals making the paper
 8    and stuff.
 9         Q    But only one big digester?
10         A    Yes.
11         Q    So there were -- was there just one
12    manufacturing building and one powerhouse building, or
13    do you remember any other facilities?
14         A    There were other facilities, but I don't know
15    what they used them for.
16         Q    You didn't have occasion to go into them?
17         A    Not that I can recall, no.
18         Q    And how about Benny?  Where did you see him
19    working, aside from outside on the tanks?
20         A    Inside doing pipe -- pipe covering.
21         Q    In the manufacturing building?
22         A    Yeah.
23         Q    Was there still a guard shack that you had to
24    check in with like there was in '76?
0167
 1         A    Yes, yes.
 2         Q    Do you have any memory of the visitor sign-in
 3    process in '65, whether or not there was a badge or a
 4    name tag?
 5         A    I think there was a badge, but I'm not
 6    positive, because some jobs have a metal chip they give
 7    you with the number on them and some they give you a
 8    badge, but I can't remember specifically.  But I know
 9    there was a guard shack.
10         Q    Are you able to approximate for me the percent
11    of time that you saw Benny working outside on the tanks
12    versus inside in the manufacturing facility?
13         A    I can't tell.  I can't, you know.
14         Q    Half and half?
15         A    Yeah, maybe half and half.
16         Q    Most of the time inside?  Most of the time
17    outside?
18         A    I think most of the time inside, some time
19    outside, because most of the work was inside as far as
20    the piping and stuff.
21         Q    Do you recall there being any overtime on this
22    job?
23         A    Maybe sporadically if they had to have a job
24    finished for a certain reason, but I can't recall.  It
0168
 1    wasn't just an overtime job.
 2         Q    Do you remember yourself working any overtime?
 3         A    I can't remember, no.
 4         Q    How about Benny?
 5         A    I can't remember that either.
 6         Q    Okay.  Was it standard shifts like we talked
 7    about yesterday, 7:30 to 3:30 or 8:30 to 4:30?
 8         A    Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.
 9         Q    Thank you.  Did you see Benny doing any work
10    aside from the pipe covering inside and the insulation
11    of the tanks outside?
12         A    No, no.
13         Q    Did you see Benny doing any work on the
14    digester?
15         A    No.  No.
16         Q    Did you ever see Benny at the train receiving
17    any of the supplied materials?
18         A    No.  Mostly apprentices did that.
19         Q    And you said New England Insulation would
20    supply these materials on the train or on the truck.
21    Then the apprentice would pick them up and bring them to
22    the facility?
23         A    Yes.
24         Q    That's where Benny would use them?
0169
 1         A    Yes, inside or outside, yeah.  Wherever it was
 2    needed.
 3         Q    Do you recall if New England Insulation had a
 4    trailer on the site --
 5         A    They did.
 6         Q    -- for the crew?
 7         A    They had a couple of trailers.
 8         Q    And this would be where you would eat lunch or
 9    have your breaks?
10         A    Um-hum, yes.
11         Q    Would it also be where you would meet with
12    your crew to find out about assignments?
13         A    You would change your clothes there and --
14    yeah, yes.
15         Q    So I'll go to the clothing.  So you said you
16    would change your clothes there.  So what -- what would
17    you put on to do your job?  What were your clothes,
18    uniform?
19         A    Mostly dungarees, like a blue shirt, work
20    shirt, you know.
21         Q    Was this clothing --
22         A    It wasn't a specific uniform.  It was whatever
23    you felt like wearing when you worked.
24         Q    Was it clothing that was provided to you by
0170
 1    New England Insulation?
 2         A    No.
 3         Q    It was your own clothing?
 4         A    Yes.
 5         Q    And you would change there.  Would then the
 6    clothing that you had worn that day be washed for you,
 7    or --
 8         A    No, you would --
 9         Q    -- you would just change and bring it home?
10         A    Yeah.
11         Q    And was that the routine for all of the crew?
12         A    I would say so, yeah.
13         Q    How about the tools that you needed for your
14    job?  Did you bring your own tools?
15         A    Yes.
16         Q    Were there any tools that your crew needed
17    that they didn't already own?
18         A    Banding machines, they supplied them, and we
19    had to give them back.  That's about it as far as I
20    know.
21         Q    When you say "they," do you mean New England
22    Insulation would supply them?
23         A    Yes, yes.
24         Q    Do you recall any other co-workers at the site
0171
 1    other than the few that you mentioned -- and I can read
 2    you back the names -- Paul Paulson, Walter Clifford,
 3    Alfred Brown, and obviously Benny?
 4         A    Yeah.  Joe Nelson, Bobby Lesenechal, Kenny
 5    O'Connell.  I'm trying to think.  Alfred Swenson, Bobby
 6    Armstrong, Larry Moore.  There was a few -- bunch of
 7    others, but I can't remember.
 8         Q    Can you approximate how big the crew was that
 9    was there?
10         A    Probably 25 guys or so.
11         Q    How about the names of any other personnel up
12    at the site other than New England Insulation?
13         A    I don't remember any of them, no.
14         Q    We talked yesterday about wearing dust
15    masks -- dust masks up there in 1976.  Was there any
16    safety equipment in '65 when you were there?
17         A    No, not that I can recall.
18         Q    Have a memory of anybody wearing dust masks at
19    that time?
20         A    No, no.
21         Q    Did you ever attend any safety meetings up at
22    International Paper in '65?
23         A    Yes.  It was mostly about wearing safety belts
24    when you were working on -- you know, up in the air and
0172
 1    stuff like that.  It was, you know, that was about it.
 2         Q    Where were the meetings held?
 3         A    At the trailers.
 4         Q    Who ran the meetings?  Was it -- was it your
 5    foreman?
 6         A    I think it was the foreman, yeah.
 7         Q    Ever go to any other safety meetings aside
 8    from safety meetings run by New England Insulation?
 9         A    Not that I can recall.
10         Q    Are you aware of any safety-related complaints
11    that were filed in 1965?
12         A    I don't recall any.
13              MS. HOCKMEYER:  Okay.  I'll go over my notes,
14         but I think those are all my questions.  Thank you.
15              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
16                       CROSS EXAMINATION
17    BY MR. COSTELLO:
18         Q    All right.  You ready?
19         A    I'm ready.
20         Q    Okay.  Mr. Donovan, my name is Chris Costello.
21    I introduced myself to you yesterday.  I'm going to ask
22    you some questions primarily focused on L Street
23    station.
24         A    Okay.
0173
 1         Q    So from your testimony earlier today, I
 2    understand it's your memory that you went to work at
 3    L Street station sometime in 1968 for --
 4         A    Yes.
 5         Q    -- NEI?
 6              And Paul Paulson, he was the job
 7    superintendent?
 8         A    Yes, supervisor, yeah.
 9         Q    And then who was your foreman?
10         A    I think Paul was the foreman.  I don't think
11    they had any other foremans.
12         Q    Okay.
13         A    As far as I can remember.
14         Q    And when you were answering questions a little
15    bit earlier today, you generally mentioned shutdown
16    maintenance, but I was unclear if you were talking about
17    that with reference to this particular project when you
18    were there with Benny.  So can you tell me when you were
19    with Benny at L Street station working for NEI what was
20    the scope of work that you were doing?
21         A    Mostly piping.  All I can remember is piping.
22         Q    Just piping?
23         A    That's all I can remember.
24         Q    Okay.  Do you associate the piping work that
0174
 1    you did with any particular unit at L Street station?
 2         A    I think it was mostly Unit 6 if I can -- if I
 3    remember right.  There was like six boilers there, and
 4    they had shut down one.  I don't know if it was Number 3
 5    boiler was shut down.  I forget.  Don't quote me on
 6    that.
 7         Q    Okay.  So I think you testified earlier that
 8    you had been to L Street station a number of times over
 9    the course of your career, but this is the only time you
10    remember being there with Benny; is that right?
11         A    Yes.
12         Q    So were you there in later years as well?
13         A    Yes.
14         Q    So do you know the difference between New
15    Boston station and L Street station?
16         A    New Boston, I think they added onto the -- as
17    far as I can recall.  I don't know if I ever worked on
18    that, though.
19         Q    Okay.  I just want to make sure.
20         A    I think they added that on to Everett station.
21         Q    Everett's a different station.
22         A    Yeah.  New Boston is down the road.  L Street,
23    you are talking.  Okay, yeah, you're right.
24         Q    So do you understand that there is a New
0175
 1    Boston station and then there is an L Street station?
 2         A    Down the road a little bit from L Street.
 3         Q    So let me ask you this.  Can you look at your
 4    Exhibit 2 -- well, we renumbered these today, didn't
 5    we? -- and then Exhibit 3?
 6              I think yesterday you testified that these
 7    lists were essentially compiled earlier in years based
 8    on information you had provided to the Thornton Law
 9    Firm; is that right?
10         A    Yes, um-hum.
11         Q    Now, on Exhibit 3, it identifies L Street
12    station for 1969 as the fourth, fifth, and sixth items
13    down, '69, '73, and '87.  Do you see that?
14         A    Yes.
15         Q    Okay.  And then on Exhibit 2, it identifies
16    L Street station and Mystic station?
17         A    Mystic station is at Everett.
18         Q    Right.  So I just want to make sure, when you
19    are talking about your time with Benny, that it's
20    L Street station and not Mystic?
21         A    L Street, yeah.
22         Q    Okay.
23         A    I remember New England having me working at
24    Mystic.  Usually that was Eastern Refractories had that
0176
 1    for years, as far as I can remember.
 2         Q    All right.  I just want to make sure we are on
 3    the right site.
 4         A    Yep.
 5         Q    And so when you were at L Street station with
 6    Benny, you remember six boiler units?
 7         A    Yes.
 8         Q    And how big was the boiler unit that you
 9    associate with the piping work that you were doing with
10    Benny?
11         A    Several stories high.
12         Q    And do you know the manufacturer of the boiler
13    unit?
14         A    I don't recall.
15         Q    Okay.
16         A    Could have been any of them, Foster Wheeler,
17    B&W.
18         Q    You just don't know, as you sit here today?
19         A    I don't know.
20         Q    Okay.
21         A    We had no reason to know, actually.
22         Q    And so the piping work that you were doing for
23    NEI with Benny in 1968, 1969, that was associated with
24    that boiler unit?
0177
 1         A    I'm pretty sure it was.
 2         Q    Okay.  And --
 3         A    It could have been any of them.  I'm not sure
 4    if it was one, two, or five or six.
 5         Q    Okay.  But it was associated with a boiler
 6    unit?
 7         A    Yes, it was associated with the L Street
 8    powerhouse.
 9         Q    And you didn't do any work on any other
10    equipment while you were at L Street at this time with
11    Benny; is that right?
12         A    I don't recall.  I don't think so.
13         Q    And you didn't observe Benny doing any work
14    other than this piping work at L Street station; is that
15    right?
16         A    I don't recall.
17         Q    And when you were there with Benny and Paul
18    Paulson and these other guys, it was part of a shutdown
19    maintenance?
20         A    I'm thinking it was.  Most of the time it is.
21         Q    And it's just for one -- for this one unit?
22         A    Yes.
23         Q    Okay.  And were there any other trades or
24    contractors working in your vicinity, in Benny's
0178
 1    vicinity when you were there?
 2         A    Usually there is boilermakers, fitters, pipe
 3    fitters.
 4         Q    Do you have a memory of that during this time
 5    at --
 6         A    Usually you'd see them on the jobs all the
 7    time, so I -- you know, I can't specifically say.
 8         Q    Okay.  Do you know who had hired New England
 9    Insulation, if there was a contractor over you?
10         A    I think they just went through Boston Edison
11    as far as I know.
12         Q    Did you ever see any contract or purchase
13    order?
14         A    No.
15         Q    That wasn't your job because I think you said
16    you were a third-year apprentice?
17         A    Exactly.
18         Q    You never had any role in looking at contracts
19    or purchase orders?
20         A    No.
21         Q    You never saw any job specifications or
22    anything like that?
23         A    No.
24         Q    Okay.  And when you were present at L Street
0179
 1    station, you were an apprentice and Benny was a
 2    journeyman?
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    Okay.  And were you on the same crew with
 5    Benny?
 6         A    Yes.
 7         Q    Okay.  And so you were getting materials for
 8    him to use?
 9         A    Yes.
10         Q    And because it was NEI those were Owens
11    Corning materials that you were --
12         A    I'm pretty sure it was Owens Corning.
13         Q    Okay.
14         A    Or Kaylo or -- Kaylo.
15         Q    Okay.  And those were Owens Corning products
16    that were supplied to the jobsite by NEI; is that
17    correct?
18         A    I'm pretty sure.
19         Q    Okay.
20         A    I'm pretty sure it was Owens Corning.
21         Q    But all the materials that you and Benny and
22    the NEI journeymen were using on the site were all
23    supplied by NEI to the site for your use?
24         A    Yes, yes.
0180
 1         Q    And while you were there, Paul Paulson told
 2    you guys what to do?
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    When to do it, how to do it?
 5         A    Yes.
 6         Q    Okay.  And you were specially trained union
 7    insulation contractors?
 8         A    Yes.
 9         Q    No one from Boston Edison told you how to do
10    your job on this particular site?
11         A    No.
12         Q    You never spoke to anyone from Boston Edison?
13         A    No, I had no reason to.
14         Q    Okay.  So on your Exhibit Number 2, the double
15    marked one, for the 1969 time period you have one, two,
16    three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten -- you
17    have 11 sites listed on your sheet that at least have a
18    1969 as a partial time frame.  Do you see that?  It
19    starts with L Street station and ends with Public
20    Service New Hampshire/Schiller?
21         A    Yes.
22         Q    So is it your memory that in 1969 that you
23    were working at at least these 11 different sites during
24    the course of that period?
0181
 1         A    I see seven sites there.
 2         Q    Well, there is seven just for 1969, but then
 3    you have '69-'70 One Center Plaza, Pease Air Force Base,
 4    and then you have a '69 to '74 for Public Service New
 5    Hampshire at Merrimack and Schiller.  Do you see that?
 6         A    Yes.  Um-hum.
 7         Q    So is it fair to say that you were at at least
 8    11 -- these 11 sites at some point in 1969?
 9         A    Well, it could have been '68 to '69, '69 to
10    '70.  I can't specifically say it was either January 2nd
11    through January 12th.
12         Q    No, I understand.  But just what I'm trying to
13    get clear, earlier you testified that you were at
14    L Street station for a couple of months.
15         A    Yeah.
16         Q    That's kind of been your testimony about every
17    site?
18         A    Yeah, just mostly jobs, especially as
19    apprentice, you know.
20         Q    All right.  So what I want to know is seeing
21    this list of 11 sites, if that would help you narrow the
22    amount of time that you were at any particular sight, if
23    you could say, "Oh, now looking at this I was at
24    L Street for maybe a month with Benny"?
0182
 1         A    I can't say.  A couple of months.
 2         Q    Okay.
 3         A    A month, two months, four months, I don't
 4    know.
 5         Q    Okay.  When you went to L Street for NEI this
 6    time with Benny, were you removing any existing pipe
 7    insulation or were you just applying new?
 8         A    I can't remember removing any.
 9         Q    Okay.
10         A    They may have, but I --
11         Q    But as you sit here today, you don't recall
12    removing any existing insulation?
13         A    I didn't, no, I did not.
14         Q    Do you recall observing Benny removing any
15    existing insulation?
16         A    I do not.
17         Q    And when you first got to L Street station
18    during this time period -- this was your first time at
19    L Street station; right?
20         A    I forget.  I've been there so many times.
21         Q    Okay.  Well, when you got there, did
22    Paul Paulson or anyone at NEI have a toolbox safety talk
23    or a safety meeting for the first time you went on site?
24         A    I can't remember.
0183
 1         Q    Okay.  For the different jobs that you were at
 2    over the years from the time you were an apprentice to
 3    your early years as a journeyman, did the different
 4    insulation contractors you work for typically have some
 5    sort of, like, job kickoff meeting or safety meeting to
 6    overview the project?
 7         A    Not that I can remember.
 8         Q    Okay.
 9         A    Maybe just told to be safe and work safely
10    and, you know.
11         Q    Okay.
12         A    A lot of these jobs were you would only be
13    there for a week sometimes, you know.
14         Q    Right.
15         A    If they had to have something done for them
16    put the ductwork in, insulate the pipes behind it before
17    they put the ductwork in, stuff like that.
18         Q    Right.  It's a repetitive job, so, you know --
19         A    Yeah, same thing every day for 35 years.
20         Q    Right.  So you got your initial training
21    through the union apprenticeship program?
22         A    Yes.
23         Q    And on the job early on, and you had safety
24    meetings and safety talks early on as part of your union
0184
 1    training; is that right?
 2         A    Yes.  Yes.
 3         Q    Okay.  Okay.  Do you actually recall observing
 4    Benny install new pipe covering at L Street station?
 5         A    Yes.
 6         Q    And that was new pipe covering that you were
 7    probably handing to him because you were an apprentice?
 8         A    Yes.
 9         Q    And do you know if any of the pipe covering
10    was prefabricated back in Canton at NEI before it was
11    delivered to the site?
12         A    They did -- made a lot of fittings, you know,
13    that we used.
14         Q    Right.  So do you know when you went to
15    L Street, was it one of those jobs where, you know,
16    NEI's delivering the materials to the site but they are
17    also delivering it prefabricated because you sort of
18    showed up at the job a little bit later, it sounds?
19         A    I didn't see a whole lot of prefab work.
20    Usually they were smaller fittings we'd do the -- we'd
21    miter them on the job, you know.
22         Q    But do you remember premitered fittings being
23    delivered to the jobsite for use?
24         A    Not that job.
0185
 1         Q    Okay.
 2         A    I remember up in -- up in the paper mill,
 3    International Paper.
 4         Q    Okay.
 5              MR. COSTELLO:  You're welcome, Kara.
 6    BY MR. COSTELLO:
 7         Q    When you traveled to L Street station for this
 8    job with Benny, did you commute there on your own or did
 9    you go with a group of people?
10         A    On my own.
11         Q    On your own.  When you got there, you checked
12    in with security.
13         A    Yes.
14         Q    Okay.  And when you were bringing the
15    materials, the pipe covering materials in to be applied
16    to this pipe covering, you just don't have a memory, as
17    you sit here today, of the warnings that were on the
18    boxes?
19         A    No, I don't.
20         Q    Okay.  I think I'm just about done.  I'm just
21    looking through my barely legible notes.
22              You don't remember, as you sit here today,
23    what the Spacecon company is?
24         A    No, I don't know where that came from.  I have
0186
 1    to check on that.
 2         Q    Okay.
 3         A    Is that an insulation outfit?
 4         Q    They are a big construction company.
 5         A    Are they?
 6         Q    Yeah.
 7         A    Where were they out of?  Do you know offhand?
 8    Does it say?
 9         Q    I think somewhere in the Midwest.  You can
10    check later.
11         A    Spacecon.
12              MR. COSTELLO:  All right.  I think that's all
13         the questions I have for you, sir.  Thank you very
14         much for your time.
15              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
16                       CROSS EXAMINATION
17    BY MR. SIMONS:
18         Q    Good morning, Mr. Donovan.
19         A    Good morning.
20         Q    My name is Michael Simons.  Are you okay to
21    continue for a few minutes?
22         A    Pardon me?
23         Q    Are you okay to continue for a few minutes?
24         A    I would like to take a little break, if I can.
0187
 1         Q    Absolutely.  Yes.
 2              (Recess taken from 11:49 a.m. until
 3         12:02 p.m.)
 4              MR. SIMONS:  People on the phone, we are going
 5         back on the record now.  Thank you.  Please make
 6         sure your phones are on mute.
 7    BY MR. SIMONS:
 8         Q    All right.  Mr. Donovan, again my name is
 9    Michael Simons.  I just want to talk to you very briefly
10    about a brand of valves which you identified a few
11    moments ago, Jenkins valve.
12         A    Um-hum.
13         Q    Okay.  My understanding from when you were
14    speaking with Frank was that it's a brand of valve that
15    you recall seeing during the time you worked as an
16    insulator, but you can't place it at any particular
17    jobsite where you worked with either Benny or Peter
18    Crescenzo; is that correct?
19         A    Well, mostly the powerhouses, the Jenkins,
20    they are big valves, the big -- so, I mean, I would say
21    they are probably in every powerhouse, Jenkins, as far
22    as I know.
23         Q    Okay.  Do you have a specific memory, though,
24    of seeing either Peter or Benny Crescenzo working with
0188
 1    or around a Jenkins valve?
 2         A    I can't say it was a Jenkins valve, but I've
 3    seen them working on valves.
 4         Q    Got you.  Okay.  All right.  Did you ever see
 5    any written materials from Jenkins that you're aware of?
 6         A    No.
 7         Q    Okay.  Did you ever talk with any
 8    representative from Jenkins that you're aware of?
 9         A    No.
10         Q    Okay.
11         A    I have no reason to.
12         Q    Understood.  Do you have any information that
13    Jenkins ever supplied any insulation materials to be
14    used on their valves?
15         A    All I know is the gaskets, I think they used
16    to, you know, replace the gaskets with these asbestos
17    gaskets, as far as I can remember.
18         Q    Okay.  Did you ever do any of that kind of
19    work yourself?
20         A    No, that was usually another trade that did
21    that.
22         Q    Okay.  What trade would that have been?
23         A    Was either the fitters or the -- they were
24    affiliated -- millwrights, I think.
0189
 1         Q    Okay.  And am I correct that, since you don't
 2    recall seeing either Peter or Benny working with or
 3    around a Jenkins valve, it would be fair to say that you
 4    don't recall any other trades doing any kind of gasket
 5    work on a Jenkins valve in their presence either?
 6         A    I've seen them do work on the valves, but like
 7    I say, I can't say it was a Jenkins valve or what kind
 8    it was.
 9         Q    Okay.  Do you have any information that
10    Jenkins either required or recommended or suggested that
11    the valves be externally insulated?
12         A    I haven't seen any paperwork about it, but
13    usually if it's in line with the pipe, that gets
14    insulated also.
15         Q    Okay.  But that decision to externally
16    insulate any kind of valve, that would have been made by
17    either the architect or by your employer?
18         A    Yeah.
19         Q    Okay.
20         A    I would say so, yes.
21         Q    Okay.  And my understanding is you last worked
22    with Peter Crescenzo in 1976 that you recall at
23    International Paper?
24         A    Yes.
0190
 1         Q    And the last time you remember working with
 2    Benny Crescenzo was in 1980 at Seabrook?
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    Okay.  Anything about a Jenkins valve that you
 5    recall in terms of -- you mentioned a size.  What size,
 6    just curiously, do you recall them being?
 7         A    Probably 6-inch to 12-inch.
 8         Q    Okay.
 9         A    Or more.
10         Q    Okay.  I would say this is a dumbest question
11    in the world, but how would you know a valve was a
12    Jenkins valve?
13         A    It says right on there.
14         Q    There you go.
15         A    Stamped right on there, Jenkins valve.
16         Q    Okay.  All right.  And that would be stamped
17    on the body of the valve itself or on a separate tag?
18         A    On the body of the thing itself.
19         Q    Okay.  Do you remember the color of any of the
20    Jenkins valve that you remember?
21         A    I think they were red, if I recall right.
22         Q    Okay.  Do you remember what material any
23    Jenkins valves were made of that you saw over there?
24         A    It's steel, iron valve, whatever they make the
0191
 1    valves out of.
 2         Q    And, sir, I know you started as an apprentice
 3    with the union in 1965.  What year did you retire from
 4    doing insulation work with Local 6?
 5         A    I think it was 1997.  Okay.
 6              MR. SIMONS:  Great.  Sir, those are all the
 7         questions I have.  I thank you very much for your
 8         time.
 9              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
10                       CROSS EXAMINATION
11    BY MR. APJOHN:
12         Q    Good morning, Mr. Donovan.
13         A    Good morning.
14         Q    My name is Eric Apjohn.  I should be able to
15    keep this pretty brief for you.  You testified that you
16    completed some work at Monsanto plant in Everett, Mass;
17    right?
18         A    Yes.
19         Q    Do you remember what year that was?
20         A    It's on my records there somewhere.  Off the
21    top of my head, 1970, '72 or something.
22         Q    Was it only that one time in 1970?
23         A    As far as I can recall.
24         Q    Okay.  You were employed by NEI at the time?
0192
 1         A    Yes.
 2         Q    All right.  Do you remember who the general
 3    contractor was at that site?
 4         A    I don't.
 5         Q    Do you remember who the job foreman was?
 6         A    Walter Clifford.
 7         Q    Walter Clifford was the foreman?
 8         A    Yes.
 9         Q    I think you testified that the majority of
10    your work was outside; correct?
11         A    Yes.
12         Q    You only saw Benny perform work outside?
13         A    Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure.  Yeah.
14         Q    All right.  How long were you at that
15    facility?
16         A    A couple of months.
17         Q    Do you remember the approximate date range?
18         A    I don't remember.
19         Q    Do you know the season?  If you were outside,
20    was it sunny or --
21         A    It was warm out.  Yeah.  It was -- yeah.
22         Q    Do you know how long Benny was actually at
23    that site?
24         A    Again, I can't recall.  He might have been
0193
 1    before I was there and after I left.  I can't say, but
 2    he was there at least for a couple of months.
 3         Q    Do you have any recollection of him leaving
 4    that site to join you at the next jobsite you worked at?
 5         A    I don't recall.  I can't remember.
 6         Q    All right.  Did you report to anyone else
 7    other than Walter Clifford?
 8         A    No.
 9         Q    Did you have to report to the general
10    contractor?
11         A    No, I -- no.
12         Q    Do you know if there were any Monsanto
13    employees on the site while you were working there?
14         A    I'm sure they had to be there.  They had to
15    work for Monsanto.  They had to be there.
16         Q    Did you have any interactions with them?
17         A    No, I did not.
18         Q    Safe to say you never took any direction for
19    your work from them?
20         A    Yeah.  Yes.  They -- they would probably tell
21    a foreman.  The foreman would converse with them.  We
22    had nothing -- workers don't do that.
23         Q    Okay.
24         A    But Walter Clifford or whoever was the boss
0194
 1    for Walter -- I think Walter Ramos was the outside
 2    super.  He was probably the one talking with Monsanto,
 3    or Ted Brodie, the owner of the company.  But as far as
 4    the workers themselves talking with them, no.  We --
 5         Q    All right.  You said it was Walter Ramos?
 6         A    Walter Clifford was the foreman.  Walter Ramos
 7    was the outside super.
 8         Q    All right.  Was there anyone from Monsanto
 9    directly supervising your work?
10         A    I don't recall.  We had nothing to do with
11    those people.  Monsanto.
12         Q    Okay.
13         A    That is as the workers go, you know.  We had
14    nothing to do with them.
15         Q    And all materials for that work was provided
16    by NEI?
17         A    Yes.
18         Q    Any materials provided by Monsanto at the
19    site?
20         A    Not that I can remember.  There might have
21    been insulation there that they wanted to get rid of to
22    use.  That's -- that's all I can think of.
23         Q    Do you remember removing any asbestos from
24    that site?
0195
 1         A    I don't remember.  Not myself, anyway.
 2         Q    What you saw was generally just pipe covering
 3    outside?
 4         A    Yes.
 5         Q    Are you aware of what type of work was taking
 6    place inside?
 7         A    I don't recall.  I don't recall.
 8         Q    Okay.  Did you attend any safety meetings at
 9    that site?
10         A    No.
11         Q    No.
12         A    Not that I can remember.
13              MR. APJOHN:  All right.  That's all I have.
14              THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
15              MR. LYNCH:  Anybody else in the room?  Anyone
16         on the phone have any questions.  Going once.
17              MR. HUMEN:  David, do you have any questions?
18              MR. LYNCH:  No questions.  The last one, and
19         then you'll be done.
20                       CROSS EXAMINATION
21    BY MR. KENNY:
22         Q    All right, sir.  I'm the last one, and then
23    we'll end this.  I spoke with your counsel, and he said
24    I could ask you some questions regarding yesterday's
0196
 1    deposition.  I just had two or three follow-up to your
 2    work that you did insulating a boiler at International
 3    Paper in 1976 with Mr. Peter Crescenzo.  You recall
 4    insulating the boiler with a thick wall insulation?
 5         A    Yes.
 6         Q    And you think that the boiler may have been
 7    manufactured by Riley Stoker, but you weren't sure?
 8         A    I'm not sure.
 9         Q    And you mentioned this boiler was many feet
10    high?
11         A    Um-hum.
12         Q    Are you able to estimate how many feet?
13         A    Probably six or seven stories.
14         Q    Do you know what type of fuel this boiler was
15    burning?
16         A    It would -- no, I can't.
17         Q    Do you know what the boiler was used for?
18    Electricity?  Steam?
19         A    Yes, electricity.
20         Q    Electricity.
21         A    And probably steam too, but --
22         Q    Okay.  And you said yesterday that you think
23    this boiler was a replacement of a different boiler that
24    was already there?
0197
 1         A    Replacement.
 2         Q    Right, this boiler was being installed to
 3    replace a boiler that was already at this facility.
 4    Does that not sound correct?
 5         A    They rehabbed them.  I don't know if they
 6    replaced the whole thing.
 7         Q    Okay.  So you think that they were rehabbing
 8    this?
 9         A    As far as I know.  My head right now is --
10         Q    I got you.
11         A    -- is screaming at me.
12         Q    Okay.  So you wouldn't be able to tell me the
13    year that it was erected -- the boiler?
14         A    Whatever year was on the job.
15         Q    '76?
16         A    Yeah.
17         Q    Okay.  So you think the boiler was erected in
18    '76?
19         A    I think so.
20         Q    All right.  And fair to say that the boiler
21    was fully assembled by the time you and Peter got there
22    and were insulating the exterior?
23         A    Mostly assembled.  Sometimes, they were still
24    working inside the boilers.
0198
 1         Q    Okay.  Are you able to recall any specific
 2    types of stuff that was being done to the inside of the
 3    boiler that you were -- when you were present?
 4         A    A lot of welding.
 5         Q    Welding.  Anything other than welding?
 6         A    As far as -- we didn't have much to do inside
 7    the boiler, so --
 8         Q    Okay.
 9         A    You could hear welding and banging and trying
10    to fit up the pipes and stuff inside I guess.
11         Q    Fair to say you or Peter never worked on the
12    inside of the boiler?
13         A    I never did.  Although we used to call it the
14    penthouse inside the boiler at the very top of boiler.
15         Q    Okay.
16         A    There was some piping and stuff that had to be
17    done inside, but I don't recall me being there or Peter
18    being there.
19         Q    Okay.
20         A    I remember up in -- up in Bow, New Hampshire,
21    we had to do that, but I don't recall that.
22         Q    Okay.  So no work done on the inside of the
23    boiler by either you or Peter?
24         A    As far as I know.

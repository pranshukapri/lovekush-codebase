           2                           DIRECT EXAMINATION

           3     BY MS. KAPLAN:

           4     Q     All right.  Ms. Jurka, am I saying your name the 

           5           right way?

           6     A     Jurka.  

           7     Q     Thank you.  I will try to remember that.  My 

           8           name is Jackie Kaplan, and I introduced myself 

           9           to you off the record this morning, but so the 

          10           record is clear, I'm going to be asking you 

          11           probably most of if not all of the questions 

          12           today.  

          13                First I'll just ask Attorney Donohue if we 

          14           can agree to the usual stipulations?  

          15                MR. DONOHUE:  Yes.  That's agreed.  

          16     Q     And I'll put them on the record just to be 

          17           clear.  So first of all, all objections except 

          18           as to form are reserved, motions except as to 

          19           strike are reserved.  An objection by one 

          20           Defendant is good for all Defendants, and 

          21           although I don't think that this is an issue, I 

          22           will put it on the record, appearance today does 

          23           not waive any jurisdictional claims or defenses 





                                                                               7





           1           including those related to service of process.  

           2           Are those all agreed?  

           3                MR. DONOHUE:  Those are agreed.  

           4     Q     Excellent.  Ms. Jurka, have you ever been 

           5           deposed before?

           6     A     No.  

           7     Q     Okay.  I'll set out a few rules and we'll try to 

           8           go from there.  So the first and most important 

           9           thing is that we have a court reporter here 

          10           today which you may have noticed, and so you and 

          11           I are going to do our very best or I'll ask you 

          12           to do your very best not to speak over one 

          13           another so try to let me finish my question 

          14           before you answer and I'll try to let you finish 

          15           your answer before I ask my next question.  

          16                Next is that all your answers do need to be 

          17           verbal today because we can't take down a head 

          18           nod or a head shake or anything like that.  So 

          19           I'll ask that you say yes and no or anything 

          20           else that you have to say.  

          21                If you answer a question that I ask, I'm 

          22           going to assume you understood my question.  

          23           However, if you don't understand my question or 





                                                                               8





           1           you want me to rephrase it, just let me know and 

           2           I'm happy to do so.  

           3                If you need a break you can let us know and 

           4           we're happy to take a break.  You just need to 

           5           answer the one question if it's pending at the 

           6           time, and then we'll take a break.  

           7                Understand all of that?  

           8     A     Yes, I do.  

           9     Q     Thank you.  Okay.  And then one other rule I 

          10           like to mention is that this is what we call a 

          11           discovery deposition, and what we mean by that 

          12           is we're trying to discover whatever information 

          13           you are aware of and recall, and we want to make 

          14           a record of that.  We don't want you to guess as 

          15           to anything.  So if the answer to a question is 

          16           either I don't know or I don't remember, those 

          17           are perfectly acceptable answers.  We just don't 

          18           want you to assume or guess or anything like 

          19           that.  All right?  

          20     A     (Nods head.) 

          21                COURT REPORTER:  Is that yes?

          22     A     Yes.  

          23     Q     It's only natural so we'll try to remind you.  





                                                                               9





           1           One other question.  Are you represented by 

           2           counsel today?

           3     A     No, I'm not.  

           4     Q     Okay.  Have you spoken to Mr. Donohue who 

           5           represents your brother?  

           6     A     Yes, I have.  

           7     Q     Okay.  Did you speak to Mr. Donohue before 

           8           today?  

           9     A     Yes, I have.  

          10     Q     Have you spoken with anyone else from Mr. 

          11           Donohue's office?

          12     A     No.  

          13     Q     How many times have you spoken with Mr. Donohue 

          14           before today?

          15     A     Twice.  

          16     Q     And when were those occasions?

          17     A     He called me two or three weeks ago and we spoke 

          18           at that time, and then he called me again on 

          19           Monday or Tuesday and we spoke then.  

          20     Q     All right.  

          21     A     Oh, he also came to my house.  

          22     Q     When was that?

          23     A     In the two or three week time frame, shortly 





                                                                              10





           1           after I had spoken to him on the phone.

           2     Q     So he visited your home between the first and 

           3           second phone call you had with him?

           4     A     Yes.  

           5     Q     The first phone call, the one that was 2 to 3 

           6           weeks ago, how long was that?

           7     A     About a half an hour.

           8     Q     And what did you discuss?

           9     A     We discussed broadly what I knew about my 

          10           brother's condition and about the new heating 

          11           system that was installed in the family home.  

          12     Q     Okay.  And I'll ask you more about those in a 

          13           few minutes.  

          14                When Mr. Donohue visited you at your home, 

          15           how long was that visit?  

          16     A     About half an hour.  

          17     Q     And what did you discuss during that visit?

          18     A     The same thing.  He spoke about the deposition, 

          19           some of the things that you just went over, what 

          20           would be happening.  

          21     Q     A little preview?

          22     A     Yes.  

          23     Q     And when you spoke on Monday or Tuesday of this 





                                                                              11





           1           week, how long was that call?

           2     A     20 minutes?  

           3     Q     And what did you discuss during that call?

           4     A     Pretty much just reviewed the same things.  

           5           Nothing different.  

           6     Q     Other than conversations with Mr. Donahue, have 

           7           you done anything else to prepare for today's 

           8           deposition?

           9     A     No.  

          10     Q     Have you spoken with your brother about today's 

          11           deposition?

          12     A     Only to the extent that he knows it's going on.  

          13     Q     Is your brother the one who originally told you 

          14           you might be deposed in this case?

          15     A     I don't know.  

          16     Q     And when you say only to the extent he knows 

          17           what's going on, what do you mean by that?

          18     A     I told him that I had spoken to Matt and that 

          19           there would be deposition that they wanted me to 

          20           come to.  

          21     Q     Did you speak with your brother about what Matt 

          22           had told you would be the substance of today's 

          23           deposition?  





                                                                              12





           1     A     No.  

           2     Q     Have you spoken with your brother about the 

           3           deposition more than one time?

           4     A     No.  

           5     Q     When your brother was originally deposed back in 

           6           March, did you speak with him about that 

           7           deposition?

           8     A     I knew it was going on, but we didn't discuss 

           9           what was talked about at the deposition.  

          10     Q     What did you believe was going on at that 

          11           deposition?

          12     A     I knew there was a law case concerning the 

          13           mesothelioma.  So I believed it was discussion, 

          14           you know, how to put this.  About the law case.  

          15     Q     Understood.  Other than the medical diagnosis 

          16           and condition, the mesothelioma, did you 

          17           understand what else was discussed at the 

          18           deposition in March?  

          19     A     I knew nothing about the deposition other than 

          20           the fact that there was one.  

          21     Q     And I'll ask you the same question about Day 2 

          22           of your brother's deposition which was last week 

          23           or the week before?  





                                                                              13





           1     A     I knew there was a second deposition.  

           2     Q     And did you speak with your brother about that 

           3           deposition?

           4     A     Only that he told me it was very short.  

           5     Q     So let me ask you because you mentioned that 

           6           your conversations with Mr. Donohue were related 

           7           to both your brother's condition as well as the 

           8           new heating system in your home.  Is that 

           9           correct?

          10     A     Yes.  

          11     Q     And did you speak with your brother about that 

          12           new heating system that was in your home?  

          13     A     No.  

          14     Q     Are you close with your brother?  

          15     A     Yes.  

          16     Q     Now, I understood, correct me if I'm wrong, that 

          17           you live next door to one another?  

          18     A     We do.  

          19     Q     How long have you lived next door to one 

          20           another?

          21     A     Six years.  

          22     Q     What is your address?

          23     A     581 Scenic Road, Unit 6, Laconia.  





                                                                              14





           1     Q     Where did you live before that address?  

           2     A     Smithfield, Virginia.

           3     Q     How long had you lived in Smithfield, Virginia?

           4     A     8 years.  

           5     Q     What were you doing in Smithfield?  

           6     A     My husband was employed by the military, Air 

           7           Force and the Navy, and that's how we got there.

           8     Q     Did you remain close with your brother during 

           9           that time?

          10     A     Yes.  My parents lived very close to him so when 

          11           I visited my parents I saw him regularly.

          12     Q     That was in New Hampshire?

          13     A     No, in Massachusetts.

          14     Q     Back in Massachusetts.  Would you say that 

          15           you've always had a close relationship with your 

          16           brother?  

          17     A     Yes.  

          18     Q     Can I have you state your full name for the 

          19           record which I probably should have done a few 

          20           moments ago but we'll do it now.  

          21     A     Donna Marie Jurka.  J U R K A.  

          22     Q     And what is your maiden name?

          23     A     Bixby.  





                                                                              15





           1     Q     What is your date of birth?

           2     A     5/5/51.  

           3     Q     Where were you born?

           4     A     Haverhill, Massachusetts.  

           5     Q     I should have asked you.  Do you have any plans 

           6           to move from the 581 Scenic Road address?

           7     A     No.  

           8     Q     Who do you live there with?

           9     A     My husband.  

          10     Q     What is your husband's name?

          11     A     Valdis.  V A L D I S.  Jurka.

          12     Q     Do you have any children?  

          13     A     Yes.  I do.  

          14     Q     How many children do you have?

          15     A     I have three living children.  

          16     Q     Do any of them live with you?

          17     A     No.  

          18     Q     Other than your husband, does anyone live with 

          19           you?

          20     A     No.  

          21     Q     Are you currently on any medications?

          22     A     Yes, I am.  

          23     Q     I won't ask that you list them all.  I'd just 





                                                                              16





           1           ask whether any of those medications affect your 

           2           memory or ability to testify here today.  

           3     A     No.  

           4     Q     So I'm going to jump right into one of the 

           5           things I believe you discussed with Mr. Donohue, 

           6           and that's that new heating system in your home 

           7           on Stone Avenue.  Is that the address you're 

           8           referring to?

           9     A     Yes, it is.  

          10     Q     And it was One Stone Avenue?

          11     A     Yes.  

          12     Q     I'll represent to you that your brother 

          13           testified a new heating system was installed in 

          14           approximately 1961.  Does that ring true with 

          15           your memory?

          16     A     Yes.  I would have said 1959, but -- 

          17     Q     Why is that?

          18     A     That's just my memory of it, and, you know, I 

          19           was very young so --

          20                MR. DONOHUE:  Your memory controls so you 

          21           can just say whatever you remember.  

          22     A     I remember it as I was being 8 years old so it 

          23           would have been 1959.





                                                                              17





           1     Q     What is it that you recall about being 8 years 

           2           old or how are you recalling 1959?

           3     A     And I don't know why I remember it this way, but 

           4           all my life I have remembered being 8 years old.  

           5           I helped my father install the heating system so 

           6           it wasn't just something happening in the 

           7           background.  I was involved.  And in my mind I 

           8           was always 8 years old.  

           9     Q     Is it something you've spoken about in the years 

          10           since you did it?  

          11     A     It might have been mentioned some place along 

          12           the line, but no, no big discussion of it.  

          13     Q     Do you remember what grade you were in in 

          14           school?

          15     A     No.  

          16     Q     Is there anything else going on at the time that 

          17           you can recall simultaneously?

          18     A     No.  

          19     Q     So you believe you were 8 years old which would 

          20           have made your brother 10; is that correct? 

          21     A     Yes.  

          22     Q     How long had you lived in the One Stone Avenue 

          23           home before this heating system was installed?





                                                                              18





           1     A     Four years.  

           2     Q     Your recollection is that you moved into the One 

           3           Stone Avenue home in 1955 approximately?

           4     A     Yes.  

           5     Q     Can you recall any addresses you lived in prior 

           6           to 1955?  

           7     A     We lived, no, I don't know if it was Broadway or 

           8           North Broadway in Haverhill.  

           9     Q     Do you recall the number?

          10     A     No.  

          11     Q     Do you recall anything that that home was 

          12           nearby?  

          13     A     No.  

          14     Q     A school, a supermarket, anything like that?

          15     A     No.  

          16     Q     Is that the only other home you lived in before 

          17           Stone Avenue?

          18     A     No.  I lived somewhere else.  My father was 

          19           building the house on Broadway/North Broadway, 

          20           when I was born.  

          21     Q     Do you know whether the other home you lived in 

          22           was in Haverhill?  

          23     A     Yes, it was.  





                                                                              19





           1     Q     Do you know whether your parents owned that 

           2           other home?  

           3     A     Yes, they did.  

           4     Q     And obviously they owned the home on Broadway or 

           5           North Broadway because your father was building 

           6           it?

           7     A     Yes.  

           8     Q     Do you know how long it took your father to 

           9           build that home?  

          10     A     Well, I would say probably four years.  It was 

          11           continuously under construction until they 

          12           moved.  

          13     Q     And did you move into the home before, during or 

          14           after the construction?

          15     A     Probably to some extent during.  

          16     Q     All right.  So going back to the One Stone 

          17           Avenue, you believe you lived there for four 

          18           years before this new heating system was 

          19           installed; is that correct?

          20     A     Yes.  

          21     Q     You said you participated or you helped your 

          22           father install the new heating system?

          23     A     Yes.





                                                                              20





           1     Q     What was -- and you were 8 years old at the 

           2           time?

           3     A     Yes.  

           4     Q     What was your role in the installation process?  

           5     A     A lot of fetching, cutting pipe, putting pipe 

           6           dope on the pipes as they were being connected, 

           7           holding things.  

           8     Q     How are you cutting pipe?

           9     A     My father had a pipe cutter, had actually two 

          10           different ones depending on the size of the pipe 

          11           that was used being used, and he had set it up, 

          12           and, you know, just had to turn in.  

          13     Q     Say that again?  You just had to turn it?

          14     A     Yes.

          15     Q     What was the pipe cutter?  Can you describe 

          16           that?  

          17     A     Okay.  At least the larger one was a fairly long 

          18           arm, approximately, I don't know, two and a half 

          19           feet long, and there was a circular piece to it 

          20           that went around the pipe that had blades and 

          21           you turn it on the pipe and then tighten it and 

          22           turn more until it cut the pipe.  

          23     Q     You must have been a very strong 8 year old.  





                                                                              21





           1     A     I don't remember it as being terribly difficult 

           2           to do.  

           3     Q     No?  

           4     A     No.  

           5     Q     It sounds difficult.  

           6     A     It happens very gradually, you know, tighten a 

           7           little bit, tighten a little bit.  

           8     Q     Understood.  All right.  And that pipe, do you 

           9           know what material that pipe was made of?  

          10     A     Steel.  

          11     Q     Do you know that or are you guessing?  

          12                MR. DONOHUE:  Objection.  

          13     Q     If you know it, it's fine.  

          14     A     My mind, I know it.  

          15     Q     Understood.  That's totally fine.  All right.  

          16                So the steel pipe.  And what part of the 

          17           system was that steel pipe for?  In other words, 

          18           what was the pipe doing for the system?

          19     A     Well, there were two different types of pipe.  

          20           There were gas pipes, and there were steam 

          21           pipes.  

          22     Q     Did you cut both of these pipes?

          23     A     Yes.





                                                                              22





           1     Q     And both types were steel?

           2     A     Yes.  

           3     Q     Did the gas pipes and the steam pipes look 

           4           different?  

           5     A     Steam pipes were considerably larger.  

           6     Q     Could you estimate the diameter of the gas 

           7           pipes?  

           8     A     One inch?  

           9     Q     And how about the steam pipes?  

          10     A     Two and a half?  

          11     Q     Okay.  So let's go back to the unit itself.  Do 

          12           you recall seeing the heating unit?  

          13     A     Yes.  

          14     Q     Can you describe that unit?

          15     A     The unit was probably 40 inches tall, two feet 

          16           wide, four feet long, encased in metal covering, 

          17           gray, with a water gauge on the outside, and a 

          18           faucet.  

          19     Q     The gray metal covering; do you know what type 

          20           of metal that was?

          21     A     Steel.  

          22     Q     Were you present at the home when that unit 

          23           arrived?  





                                                                              23





           1     A     I don't remember it arriving.  

           2     Q     So you don't know whether your father picked it 

           3           up or whether it was delivered?  

           4     A     No, I don't.  

           5     Q     The first time you saw that unit, was it already 

           6           in place?

           7     A     As far as I remember, yes.  

           8     Q     And where was that?  

           9     A     In the basement.  

          10     Q     So you were never present while that unit was 

          11           moved in any way?

          12     A     No.  

          13     Q     And did the unit arrive in one piece?  Strike 

          14           that.  You don't know how it arrived.  

          15                The first time you saw the unit, was it in 

          16           one piece?  

          17     A     The first time I remember seeing it it was in 

          18           one piece.  

          19     Q     Do you know what its power source was?

          20     A     Natural gas.  

          21     Q     Did it have a name plate on it that you can 

          22           recall?  

          23     A     No.  





                                                                              24





           1     Q     No, it didn't have one or no, you can't recall?

           2     A     I can't recall.  

           3     Q     So you wouldn't know the model number of that 

           4           piece of equipment?

           5     A     No.  

           6     Q     And you wouldn't know what year that piece of 

           7           equipment was manufactured?  

           8     A     No.  

           9     Q     And you don't know how your father purchased the 

          10           piece of equipment?

          11     A     I don't know for a fact yet I'm sure that it 

          12           came through the Haverhill Gas Company.

          13                MS. KAPLAN:  And I'll move to strike the 

          14           nonresponsive of that answer.  

          15     Q     So you don't know how the unit was packaged when 

          16           it arrived because you weren't there.  

          17     A     No.  

          18     Q     And you don't know how it was delivered; is that 

          19           correct?

          20     A     Yes.  

          21     Q     Did you ever see any documentation or written 

          22           materials accompanying or with the unit?  

          23     A     No.  





                                                                              25





           1     Q     Since the unit was already in place and out of 

           2           its packaging, whatever that may have been, the 

           3           first time you saw it you can't say today 

           4           whether it came with any auxiliary materials, 

           5           can you?  

           6                MR. DONOHUE:  Objection.  This is to the 

           7           term auxiliary materials.  If you know what that 

           8           means.  

           9     A     Well, like the pipe are you talking about?  

          10     Q     Sure.  

          11     A     Okay.  There was pipe.  Whether they were 

          12           delivered at the same time or not, I do not know 

          13           that.  

          14     Q     Understood.  So you had mentioned pipe and you 

          15           also mentioned a pipe dough; is that correct?  

          16     A     Dope.  

          17     Q     Dope.  Apologies.  So you don't know whether 

          18           that piping or whether that pipe dope came with 

          19           the unit or whether it was purchased separately?

          20     A     No.  

          21     Q     Do you recall any other auxiliary products, and 

          22           if you need me to describe that I will but I 

          23           think you know what I'm referring to, do you 





                                                                              26





           1           recall any others beside the pipe and the pipe 

           2           dope?  

           3     A     No, I do not.  

           4     Q     Can you describe the pipe dope?

           5     A     Came in a small metal can with a lid that popped 

           6           off.  You'd apply it with a, well, a small paint 

           7           brush.  Rather stiff paint brush.  

           8     Q     You said a stiff paint brush?  

           9     A     Well, the bristles were short and stiff.  Not 

          10           like you'd use for painting a wall.  

          11     Q     How big was the can?  I know you said it was 

          12           small, but could you describe --

          13     A     Maybe three inches in diameter and three inches 

          14           tall.  

          15     Q     Did you use any other tools other than the paint 

          16           brush?  

          17     A     With using the pipe dope?  

          18     Q     Yes.  

          19     A     No.  

          20     Q     Can you recall any writing on that can of pipe 

          21           dope?

          22     A     No.  

          23     Q     Is pipe dope a generic or a colloquial term or 





                                                                              27





           1           is that the name of the product?

           2     A     I do not know.  

           3     Q     Did your father call it pipe dope?

           4     A     Yes.  

           5     Q     And what did you do with the pipe dope?  

           6     A     Applied it to the threads of the pipe before 

           7           they were connected.  

           8     Q     Okay.  I'm going to ask you to describe that a 

           9           little bit further.  So you applied this product 

          10           to piping pieces that were not connected to the 

          11           unit itself?  

          12     A     Yes.  

          13     Q     At some point those pipe pieces were connected 

          14           to the unit; is that correct?

          15     A     Yes.  

          16     Q     Did you do that work or did someone else do that 

          17           work?  

          18     A     Attaching it to the boiler itself?  I don't 

          19           know.  My father or I, possibly my brother.

          20     Q     So you don't have a specific recollection of 

          21           attaching those pipe pieces to the boiler 

          22           itself?  

          23     A     No.  





                                                                              28





           1     Q     Can you say how many pipe pieces were connected 

           2           to the boiler?  

           3     A     Only through logic.  No.  

           4     Q     Fair enough.  And like I said, I know this is a 

           5           long time ago so I don't want to put any undue 

           6           pressure.  Just whatever you remember.  

           7                So you would apply this pipe dope product 

           8           to the pieces of pipe and then would the pieces 

           9           of pipe also be connected to one another 

          10           throughout the home?

          11     A     Yes.  

          12     Q     And was that the majority of your job with 

          13           respect to the installation of this heating 

          14           system?  

          15     A     Do you mean just applying the pipe dope or 

          16           connecting the pieces?  

          17     Q     That whole process.  

          18     A     The whole process.  Pipe dope connecting pieces.

          19     Q     And then running them through the home?

          20     A     Yes.

          21     Q     How long was each piece of pipe?

          22     A     It would depend on how straight a run it would 

          23           have before it needed to turn.  Variable.  





                                                                              29





           1     Q     Had you finished your answer?  I didn't mean to 

           2           cut you off.  

           3     A     Yes.  

           4     Q     Is that why you were cutting pieces, to make 

           5           them fit throughout the home?

           6     A     Yes.  

           7     Q     And were they connected to radiators throughout 

           8           the home?

           9     A     Yes.  

          10     Q     Did you work on those pieces of equipment at 

          11           all?  

          12     A     No.  

          13     Q     As you were doing your role which was the 

          14           cutting of the pipe and then the threading of 

          15           the pipe and applying the pipe dope as I 

          16           understand it, what was your brother doing if 

          17           you can recall?

          18     A     We didn't work together.  We'd work with my 

          19           father at different times so it would only be 

          20           one of us at a time.  

          21     Q     Why is that?  

          22     A     I assume dealing with two children at one time 

          23           is probably just a little bit too much.  





                                                                              30





           1     Q     Got it.  So you have no memory of observing your 

           2           brother work on this installation?

           3     A     No.  

           4     Q     While you were doing your role which we've 

           5           previously described, can you recall what you 

           6           observed your father doing?  

           7     A     He was doing the same thing.  It was nothing I 

           8           was doing alone.

           9     Q     So you were working together on this project?

          10     A     Yes.  

          11     Q     How long in total did it take to install the 

          12           boiler system?  

          13     A     Several weeks probably to a few months.  It was 

          14           done over the summer.  

          15     Q     So you would work on it in a piecemeal process; 

          16           is that fair to say?

          17     A     Yes.  

          18     Q     And as I understood your brother's testimony, 

          19           your family had a cottage in Alton, New 

          20           Hampshire; is that correct?

          21     A     That's true.

          22     Q     And you spent time at that cottage over this 

          23           summer?  





                                                                              31





           1     A     Yes.  

           2     Q     How long how often would you go to that cottage?  

           3     A     I don't remember that particular year.  

           4     Q     How long did you have that cottage?  

           5     A     Well, my parents had it for probably 25 years.  

           6     Q     Do you know the address of it?  

           7     A     It's Spring, oh, possibly 18, it was Spring 

           8           Street, Alton.  I think 18.  

           9     Q     Do you know if it's still there?

          10     A     Yes, it is.  

          11     Q     Does your family still own it?

          12     A     No.  

          13     Q     So you can't say any other products that you 

          14           recall your father using while you were working 

          15           with him on this project?

          16     A     No.  No.  

          17     Q     Can you describe what the basement looked like?

          18     A     It was a cement floor, cement walls.  It was an 

          19           unfinished basement.  So washing machine, dryer 

          20           were down there.  Nothing special.  

          21     Q     Was it kind of dirty?  

          22     A     Not terribly dirty, but.

          23     Q     If you walked down there with bare feet, would 





                                                                              32





           1           your feet come up a different color?

           2     A     Yeah.  

           3     Q     All right.  And after you participated in this 

           4           installation project, you never repaired or 

           5           maintained that boiler at all, did you?  

           6     A     No.  

           7     Q     And you were never present while either your 

           8           brother or your father did any work on the 

           9           boiler; is that correct?

          10     A     No.  

          11     Q     I have a couple photographs I'd like to show 

          12           you, and I have a copy for your attorney.  

          13           There's three of them.  Chase, I don't know if 

          14           you want to take a look at these, too?  

          15                MR. MARSHALL:  I can just take a look.  

          16                MS. KAPLAN:  Folks on the phone, I'm 

          17           showing some photographs, and we'll get these to 

          18           everyone via email.  

          19                MR. DONOHUE:  You're going to take these 

          20           one by one?  

          21                MS. KAPLAN:  Yes.  And you can sort of 

          22           ignore the writing.  I mean, you can look at it, 

          23           but they're just notes.  





                                                                              33





           1     Q     So the first photo is a photo of a home.  

           2                MR. DONOHUE:  Are we going to mark these as 

           3           exhibits?  

           4                MS. KAPLAN:  Yes, we can mark them, but I 

           5           just want to ask her about them.

           6                MR. DONOHUE:  When you mark them for an 

           7           exhibit, can you also just state what the 

           8           statements are underneath the exhibit?  

           9                MS. KAPLAN:  Yes.  

          10                MR. DONOHUE:  Thank you.

          11     BY MS. KAPLAN:

          12     Q     Well, the statement is "Childhood home?", and 

          13           that's what I'm going to ask you.  Is this your 

          14           home at One Stone Avenue?  

          15     A     Yes, it is.  

          16     Q     And does this photo fairly and accurately depict 

          17           what your home looked like when you lived there?

          18     A     Substantially.  The front porch is different.  

          19     Q     Okay.  Is the front porch new or just renovated?

          20     A     New.  

          21     Q     So there was not a front porch when you were 

          22           there?

          23     A     There was, but it was much smaller.  





                                                                              34





           1     Q     Okay.  Looking at this home, as far as you can 

           2           tell are the dimensions the same?

           3     A     Yes.

           4     Q     So there aren't any additions to the width or 

           5           length of the house as far as you can tell from 

           6           this front view?

           7     A     No.  

           8     Q     So was the basement that I just asked you to 

           9           describe the size of the home?

          10     A     Yes.  It did not go under the front porch.  

          11     Q     Understood.  So it would have started underneath 

          12           the door and the window that we can see?

          13     A     Yes.  

          14     Q     All right.  So we'll go ahead and mark this as 

          15           Exhibit 1.  

          16                 (Exhibit 1 marked for identification)

          17                MR. DONOHUE:  I'm just going to put an 

          18           objection on the record to Exhibit 1 to the 

          19           extent it has a statement on the bottom of it, 

          20           and I think that's going to become more relevant 

          21           as the next two exhibits are entered, but I'll 

          22           restate that objection when the time comes.  

          23                MS. KAPLAN:  That's fine.  





                                                                              35





           1     BY MS. KAPLAN:

           2     Q     Moving on to the second photograph, is this a 

           3           building or series of buildings that you 

           4           recognize were across the street from your home?

           5     A     No.  

           6     Q     No.  What was across the street from your home 

           7           at One Stone Avenue?  

           8     A     A lumberyard.  You'd see the lumber pile.

           9     Q     You could see the lumber.  Okay.  Was it just 

          10           like a sales lumberyard or was anything 

          11           happening at that yard?  

          12     A     No.  They actually cut the lumber there.  

          13     Q     They cut the lumber.  Would that lumberyard 

          14           operate during the day and on weekends and all 

          15           of that?

          16     A     Yes.  Probably not Sundays.  

          17     Q     And, again, I'm just asking for your experience 

          18           so if you observed it operating.  

          19     A     Yes.

          20                MR. DONOHUE:  Can you specify what time 

          21           period we're talking about as regards to the 

          22           lumberyard?  

          23     Q     Sure.  When you moved into the home on One Stone 





                                                                              36





           1           Avenue was the lumberyard there?  

           2     A     Yes.

           3     Q     And when you moved out of the home on One Stone 

           4           Avenue which I should ask you do you know what 

           5           year you moved out of that home?  

           6     A     1973.  

           7     Q     Where did you go from there?

           8     A     To Chestnut Street in Haverhill.  

           9     Q     Did your parents stay at the One Stone Avenue 

          10           home?

          11     A     No.  

          12     Q     Okay.  Did your whole family move to Chestnut 

          13           Avenue?

          14     A     Yes.  Chestnut Street.  

          15     Q     Chestnut Street.

          16     A     Yes.

          17     Q     What was that address?  

          18     A     I don't remember.  

          19     Q     Was your brother still living with you guys when 

          20           you moved to Chestnut Street?

          21     A     My brother was in the Army when we moved, and so 

          22           I moved out of Chestnut Street and he came back 

          23           and so he moved in.  We weren't there together.  





                                                                              37





           1     Q     Understood.  So in 1973, you would have been 22?  

           2           Is that right?

           3     A     Yes.  

           4     Q     And do you know whether your brother lived at 

           5           the Chestnut Street home when he came home from 

           6           the Army?

           7     A     Yes, he did.

           8     Q     Do you know how long he lived there?

           9     A     No, I don't.  

          10     Q     All right.  So then back to the lumberyard.  Was 

          11           the lumberyard still there and operating when 

          12           you moved out in 1973?

          13     A     Yes, it was.

          14     Q     We'll mark this as Exhibit 2.  

          15                 (Exhibit 2 marked for identification)

          16     Q     And folks on the phone, the writing on the 

          17           bottom says "Industrial Building Across Street" 

          18           which Mrs. Jurka says she did not recognize from 

          19           her childhood living there, but I will send it 

          20           to you anyway.  

          21                All right.  So we're now looking at the 

          22           third photograph which is essentially an aerial 

          23           view of the area, and -- 





                                                                              38





           1                MR. DONOHUE:  Jackie, if I may I just, I 

           2           want to object to this one as well to the extent 

           3           that it is premarked with labels that seem to 

           4           depict different businesses.

           5                It also has another statement underneath so 

           6           I'll object to the extent it's suggestive.  I 

           7           don't know what the basis is for these markings 

           8           including the street markings as well.

           9                MS. KAPLAN:  The objection is noted.  

          10     BY MS. KAPLAN:

          11     Q     And Ms. Jurka, I'll ask you to take a look at 

          12           this aerial view, and there's a white circle you 

          13           may see.  Do you recognize that that is the One 

          14           Stone Avenue home?  

          15     A     Yes.  

          16     Q     Okay.  And this is where you lived between '55 

          17           and '73?  

          18     A     Yes.  

          19     Q     And you'll see some sort of square looking 

          20           buildings towards the lower and left-hand side 

          21           of this photograph.  Do you recall whether any 

          22           of those buildings were there when you lived in 

          23           that home between 1955 and 1973?





                                                                              39





           1     A     I know there were industrial buildings at that 

           2           site.

           3     Q     Other than the lumberyard, do you know what was 

           4           going on at any of the other industrial 

           5           buildings at that site?

           6     A     I know there was a tannery, and I believe that 

           7           this building was a tannery.

           8     Q     And I'm going to give you a pen and let you mark 

           9           which one you thought was a tannery, and this is 

          10           a pink pen.

          11                MR. DONOHUE:  Thank you.  

          12     A     So I believe that was the building there.  

          13     Q     Okay.  And for the record, Ms. Jurka has now 

          14           circled one of the buildings which she believed 

          15           was the tannery at the time, and that will be on 

          16           the marked exhibit.  

          17                Other than the tannery and the lumberyard, 

          18           do you know what was happening at any of these 

          19           other buildings between '55 and '73?  

          20                MR. DONOHUE:  Can you just specify which 

          21           buildings?  

          22                MS. KAPLAN:  Sure.  The same ones I asked 

          23           about before which are the sort of square 





                                                                              40





           1           looking build -- the nonresidential buildings.  

           2           So they begin on the sort of top left corner 

           3           there.  There's that red one with the black top 

           4           and then coming down there is that whole 

           5           left-hand side of the photograph shows 

           6           square-looking buildings.  

           7     A     Okay.  The red one with the blacktop, that, I 

           8           think that's a new building, but it was the city 

           9           maintenance yard where they had their 

          10           maintenance trucks, sand for the winter, salt.  

          11     Q     Your memory is that in that location the city 

          12           maintenance building and yard was while you 

          13           lived there, but you don't recognize that red 

          14           building from that time?

          15     A     No.  

          16     Q     Understood.  Anything else that you recognize or 

          17           that you can recall from that area while you 

          18           lived there?

          19     A     No.  

          20     Q     We'll go ahead and mark this as Exhibit 3 with 

          21           Plaintiff's counsel's objections noted.  

          22     A     Do you want the red building marked?  

          23     Q     Yes.  Let's circle that one.  Actually, strike 





                                                                              41





           1           that.  You don't need to because it's the only 

           2           red building.  

           3     A     Oh, okay.  

           4     Q     So you've already identified it.

           5                 (Exhibit 3 marked for identification)

           6     Q     All right, Ms. Jurka, I'm going to ask you now 

           7           about sort of the other topic I think you 

           8           discussed with Mr. Donohue and which you 

           9           understand brings us all here today and that is 

          10           what you referred to as your brother's 

          11           condition.  And you earlier said that it was a 

          12           mesothelioma.  Is that your understanding of his 

          13           diagnosis?

          14     A     Yes.

          15     Q     Do you know what type of mesothelioma he was 

          16           diagnosed with?

          17     A     Peritoneal.  

          18     Q     And do you know when he was diagnosed?  

          19     A     Last summer.

          20     Q     Were you with him when he received the 

          21           diagnosis?

          22     A     No, I wasn't.

          23     Q     Did he tell you about it?





                                                                              42





           1     A     Yes, he did.

           2     Q     What did he tell you?  

           3     A     He told me he had been diagnosed with cancer and 

           4           what type it was.  

           5     Q     Now, I know having the opportunity to have 

           6           reviewed some medical records that have been 

           7           provided in this case, I'll represent to you 

           8           medical records have been provided in this case, 

           9           and I believe you're listed as the backup proxy 

          10           for your brother; is that correct?

          11     A     I did not know that.  

          12     Q     Okay.  Fair enough.  Do you know who his medical 

          13           proxy is?

          14     A     I don't know that for a fact.  I would believe 

          15           his wife would be.  

          16     Q     All right.  And you understand what a medical 

          17           proxy is?

          18     A     Yes.  

          19     Q     Have you attended any medical appointments or 

          20           treatments with your brother?

          21     A     No.  

          22     Q     Does your brother tell you about his medical 

          23           appointments and treatments after or before they 





                                                                              43





           1           happen?  

           2     A     Sometimes.  

           3     Q     Are you aware that your brother had a CT scan in 

           4           March of this year?

           5     A     Yes.  

           6     Q     Did he tell you what the results of that CT scan 

           7           were?

           8     A     Yes, he did.

           9     Q     Is it your understanding that the results of 

          10           that CT scan showed no evidence of cancer?  

          11     A     Yes.  

          12     Q     Did your brother tell you that?

          13     A     Yes.  He did.  

          14     Q     Did he tell you anything else about that CT 

          15           scan?

          16     A     No.  

          17     Q     I'll represent to you that your brother 

          18           testified on Day 2 of his deposition which 

          19           happened just a week or two ago that his 

          20           diagnosis has not slowed him down at all.  Is 

          21           that your impression of his diagnosis as well?

          22     A     Physically, yes.  But I think psychologically it 

          23           has affected him.  





                                                                              44





           1     Q     Okay.  What does your brother like to do with 

           2           his free time?  

           3     A     His biggest hobby is pickleball.  

           4     Q     And does he still play pickleball?

           5     A     Yes.  He does.  

           6     Q     Where does he play pickleball?

           7     A     In several different communities locally.  

           8           Different days different places.

           9     Q     Do you ever play with him?

          10     A     No.

          11     Q     Have you ever played?

          12     A     No.  

          13     Q     All right, Ms. Jurka.  If you'll give me a 

          14           minute we'll go off the record, and I'm going to 

          15           take a quick look at my notes and then hopefully 

          16           we'll be done and then we'll see if anyone else 

          17           has questions for you, okay?  

          18     A     Okay.  

          19     Q     Off the record.  

          20                            (Off the record)

          21                MS. KAPLAN:  While I'm looking at my notes, 

          22           does anyone on the phone have questions for Mrs. 

          23           Jurka?





                                                                              45





           1                MR. ROSSETTI:  I have a couple short 

           2           questions.

           3                MS. KAPLAN:  Is that Steve?  

           4                MR. ROSSETTI:  Yes.  I have literally about 

           5           two minutes.  

           6                MS. KAPLAN:  Okay.  Are you okay to keep 

           7           going?  

           8                THE WITNESS:  Yes, I am.

           9                MS. KAPLAN:  All right.  So Steve, if you 

          10           want to go ahead?

          11                              EXAMINATION

          12     BY MR. ROSSETTI:

          13     Q     Thank you, Mrs. Jurka.  Can you hear me okay?

          14     A     Yes, I can.

          15     Q     Okay.  Thank you.  You testified about the 

          16           boiler that was installed at One Stone Avenue 

          17           for a decent amount of time this morning so I 

          18           don't want to belabor that, but my questions are 

          19           going to be related to that, okay?

          20     A     Okay.  

          21     Q     All right.  And if you don't understand my 

          22           question, please let me know.  Okay?

          23     A     Yes.  





                                                                              46





           1     Q     Okay.  You were not present when your father 

           2           purchased that boiler, correct?

           3     A     No.  I was not.  

           4     Q     Okay.  So you don't know where he purchased the 

           5           boiler, correct?

           6     A     I'm sure it came through the Haverhill Gas 

           7           Company.  He had purchased other appliances 

           8           through them.  

           9     Q     Okay.  But that wasn't the question that I asked 

          10           you.  You don't know whether or not he purchased 

          11           it through Haverhill Gas or if he purchased it 

          12           somewhere else, correct?

          13     A     No, I don't.  

          14     Q     Okay.  So that could have been purchased with a 

          15           discount that he received as a Haverhill Gas 

          16           employee from some other place, correct?

          17     A     No.  His discount would have been through the 

          18           Haverhill Gas Company.  

          19     Q     Okay.  But again, you didn't see him purchase it 

          20           and you weren't there when he purchased it, 

          21           correct?

          22     A     No.  I was not.  

          23     Q     Okay.  I think that's all the questions I have

           1           for right now.  Thank you very much for your 

           2           time.  

           3                MS. KAPLAN:  And I am all set as well.  So 

           4           does anyone else on the phone have questions for 

           5           Mrs. Jurka before we turn it over to Matt?  

           6                         (No audible response)

           7                MS. KAPLAN:  I will take that as a no.  Do 

           8           you guys want to take a little break or do you 

           9           want to just go?

          10                MR. DONOHUE:  Let's take five minutes.

          11                MS. KAPLAN:  Okay.  Five-minute break.

          13                              EXAMINATION

          14     BY MR. DONOHUE:

          15     Q     Thank you.  We're back on the record.  Mrs. 

          16           Jurka, this is Matt Donohue.  As you know, I 

          17           represent your brother, and I'm just going to 

          18           ask you a few what I imagine to be final 

          19           questions for today.  

          20                May I see Exhibit 3?  Mrs. Jurka, I'm going 

          21           to hand you Exhibit 3.  I actually have a couple 

          22           very quick questions for you.  Have you seen 

          23           this photo before today?  





                                                                              48





           1     A     No.  

           2     Q     Do you know when this photo was taken?

           3     A     No.  

           4     Q     And you said that you believe the home circled 

           5           in the white circle is the home you lived in on 

           6           Stone Avenue, correct?

           7     A     Yes.

           8     Q     Are you familiar with any of the names or 

           9           businesses that are written elsewhere on that 

          10           exhibit?  

          11     A     No, I'm not.  

          12     Q     Did you put those names or business names on 

          13           this photograph?

          14     A     No, I did not.

          15     Q     Do you know why they were put on this 

          16           photograph?

          17     A     No.

          18     Q     And does this depict your neighborhood exactly 

          19           as it appeared when you lived there growing up?

          20     A     Not exactly.  

          21     Q     Okay.  Now, you previously testified that you 

          22           believed the boiler that was installed at your 

          23           home on Stone Avenue was purchased through 





                                                                              49





           1           Haverhill Gas; is that correct?

           2     A     Yes.  

           3     Q     And did your father purchase any other 

           4           appliances through Haverhill Gas?

           5     A     A stove, two stoves.  And central air 

           6           conditioning system.

           7     Q     Did you ever know your father to purchase 

           8           appliances for your home from any other store or 

           9           through any other entity?

          10     A     No.  

          11     Q     You previously said your brother was quote, 

          12           unquote, mentally affected by -- 

          13                MS. KAPLAN:  Objection.  

          14     Q     -- by the diagnosis.  

          15     A     Yes.  

          16     Q     Could you say a little bit more about what you 

          17           think your brother is going through?

          18     A     I think he's under a lot of stress.  He has said 

          19           to me that he's not concerned as much about 

          20           himself but leaving and leaving his wife and 

          21           children when they might need him.  Going for 

          22           the scan, he was concerned.  Who knows if the 

          23           mesothelioma will come back and the stress of is

           1           it back now.  

           2     Q     Okay.  All right.  That's all the questions I 

           3           have for you.  

           4                MS. KAPLAN:  Anyone on the phone have 

           5           followup?  

           6                         (No audible response)

           7                MR. DONOHUE:  Thank you very much, 

           8           Mrs. Jurka.  I appreciate you coming in today.

   10:01  2                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Good morning.  This is

   10:03  3   the start of the deposition of Corey Dayton.  We are now

   10:03  4   on record at 10:03 a.m. on September 11th, 2019.  This is

   10:03  5   for the case titled Douglas S. Chabot, et al. Vs.

   10:03  8                  Will counsel please identify yourselves,

   10:03  9   state any agreements on the record, after which the court

   10:03 10   reporter will swear in the witness.

   10:04 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  David Knotts, Robbins, Geller,

   10:04 12   Rudman & Dowd, for Mr. Dayton and Plaintiffs.

   10:04 13                  MS. ZALKA:  Caroline Zalka from Weil

   10:04 15                  MS. PROVEY:  Corinna Provey from Weil

   10:04 16   Gotshal for the Defendants.

   10:04 17                  THE WITNESS:  Corey Dayton, Plaintiff.

   10:04 18                        COREY M. DAYTON,

   10:04 19   having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:

   10:04 20                           EXAMINATION

   10:04 21   BY MS. ZALKA:

   10:04 22        Q.   Good morning, Mr. Dayton.  Obviously, we've

   10:04 23   introduced ourselves, but, for the record, I'm Caroline

   10:04 24   Zalka.  As you heard, I represent the defendants.

   10:04 25        A.   Yes.

                                                                        8



   10:04  1        Q.   Have you been deposed -- deposed before?

   10:04  2        A.   No.

   10:04  3        Q.   No?

   10:04  4        A.   Have I been what?

   10:04  5        Q.   Have you been deposed before?

   10:04  6        A.   No.

   10:04  7        Q.   Okay.  So I'll just go over a couple of the

   10:04  8   ground rules.

   10:04  9                  So first is, if you don't hear a question,

   10:04 10   just tell me and I'll repeat it.  If you're not clear

   10:04 11   about what a question means, tell me and I'll repeat it.

   10:04 12   We can take breaks when you want; I just ask that you

   10:04 13   answer any question that's concurrently pending before we

   10:04 14   take a break.  And I'll happy -- I'll be happy to find a

   10:05 15   convenient spot --

   10:05 16        A.   Okay.

   10:05 17        Q.   -- if you want a break, just let me know.

   10:05 18                  Just a reminder to not use gestures;

   10:05 19   they're hard for the court reporter to capture.  So just

   10:05 20   make sure you're answering all my questions verbally.

   10:05 21        A.   Okay.

   10:05 22        Q.   If you -- I'm not asking you for any privileged

   10:05 23   information.  So any information that's protected by

   10:05 24   attorney/client privilege or work product, so if you think

   10:05 25   that a question calls for that -- I'm sure your counsel

                                                                        9



   10:05  1   will interject, but you can always confer with your

   10:05  2   counsel in that regard.

   10:05  3        A.   Okay.

   10:05  4        Q.   Okay.  If you don't ask for clarification, I'll

   10:05  5   assume that you understood the question.  Okay?

   10:05  6        A.   Okay.

   10:05  7        Q.   And you understand that you're testifying under

   10:05  8   oath, correct?

   10:05  9        A.   Yes.

   10:05 10        Q.   Final thing, which I will work on as well, we

   10:05 11   just both need to make sure like I finish my question

   10:05 12   completely and you finish your answer completely, and try

   10:05 13   not to talk over one another, because it makes it really

   10:05 14   hard for the court reporter to get what we're saying if we

   10:06 15   start talking over one another.

   10:06 16        A.   Okay.

   10:06 17        Q.   Okay.  So let's just talk a little bit first

   10:06 18   about, can you describe your professional background.

   10:06 19        A.   Yes.  I'm a principal compliance engineer.  I

   10:06 20   work for Fujitsu.  It's a Japanese company.  Been there

   10:06 21   for 22 years.  I handle all the regulatory compliance work

   10:06 22   for market strategy, market -- or of deployment into

   10:06 23   different regions of the world for our particular project.

   10:06 24   And I'm an expert in regulatory compliance testing, which

   10:06 25   I've been doing for 37 years.

                                                                       10



   10:06  1        Q.   And what is your title at Fujitsu?

   10:06  2        A.   Principal compliance engineer.

   10:06  3        Q.   And what -- what actually does that mean?  Like

   10:06  4   what is principal compliance engineer?

   10:07  5        A.   Okay.  So let's say you design this -- we design

   10:07  6   this computer, so various countries have

   10:07  7   regulatory -- they have regulations, that you have to meet

   10:07  8   certain criteria, such as electromagnetic interference,

   10:07  9   product safety.  For their tier one customers here in the

   10:07 10   U.S., for central offices, such as Verizon, AT&T,

   10:07 11   CenturyLink, they require approval to the NEBS standard --

   10:07 12   and NEB -- N-E-B-S standard -- and that particular

   10:07 13   standard, it costs about $100,000 to run all of the tests

   10:07 14   for that.  And it's everything from ESE to electrical

   10:07 15   magnetic compatibility, product safety, bonding,

   10:07 16   grounding, earthquake testing, fire testing, operational

   10:08 17   temperature and humidity testing, transportation vibration

   10:08 18   testing.  Like if you put the box in -- you know, you're

   10:08 19   shipping a box, you want to get it there without it being

   10:08 20   damaged.  Storage temperature testing.  It goes on and on.

   10:08 21   Hygroscopic dust, airborne contaminants.  So that's the

   10:08 22   testing that we do.

   10:08 23        Q.   Okay.

   10:08 24        A.   And -- and our customers require this approval

   10:08 25   before they purchase our product.

                                                                       11



   10:08  1        Q.   Got it.

   10:08  2        A.   And I also handle for not only the U.S., but for

   10:08  3   the worldwide compliance.

   10:08  4        Q.   Okay.  How many people do you have reporting to

   10:08  5   you?

   10:08  6        A.   So I am no longer a manager.  I used to be a

   10:08  7   senior manager for 17 years at Fujitsu.  And three years

   10:08  8   ago -- that was in Pearl River, New York.  And Fujitsu

   10:09  9   came in and closed down the R&D facility, laid over 100

   10:09 10   people off, gave five people the opportunity to relocate

   10:09 11   to Richardson area.  I was one of the five people.  I

   10:09 12   didn't want to be 58 years old looking for another job, so

   10:09 13   I decided to relocate and I bought a house here, and I

   10:09 14   settled in.

   10:09 15                  So I was the senior manager then, but the

   10:09 16   fact that they laid off my entire team, I had nobody to

   10:09 17   manage anymore, so I became an individual contributor.

   10:09 18        Q.   Got it.  And prior to your time with ju-

   10:09 19   -- jujitsu -- Fujitsu, where did you work?

   10:09 20        A.   I worked at a company called EIS, and I did the

   10:09 21   same thing, regulatory compliance.  There I was a senior

   10:10 22   compliance engineer.  Then prior to that, I worked at

   10:10 23   another company, Micrognosis, M-I-C-R-O-G-N-O-S-I-S, and I

   10:10 24   was a senior compliance engineer there.

   10:10 25                  I've pretty much been a compliance engineer

                                                                       12



   10:10  1   from the beginning.

   10:10  2        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever worked in any way in the

   10:10  3   financial services industry?

   10:10  4        A.   Only for Micrognosis, but it wasn't financial

   10:10  5   services.  They developed and built computerized trading

   10:10  6   systems.  So we would -- you know, we had many of the big

   10:10  7   accounts, the JPMorgans, and Prudential base, many

   10:10  8   accounts in Europe, Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo.

   10:11  9                  So -- and that was just a trading system

   10:11 10   to -- you know, the price of stocks, bonds, money markets,

   10:11 11   futures.  But I was in the engineering end of it, not

   10:11 12   the -- the procurement or managing stocks, bonds, money

   10:11 13   markets.

   10:11 14        Q.   So outside of kind of the engineer -- being

   10:11 15   responsible for some of the aspects of the engineering

   10:11 16   that related to a system that was being used by financial

   10:11 17   services companies, in your professional career, you

   10:11 18   haven't had any direct experience in financial services?

   10:11 19        A.   No.  Not -- just installing the equipment.

   10:11 20        Q.   Got it.

   10:11 21        A.   But I had no direct access to their financial

   10:11 22   servers that provided the information.

   10:11 23        Q.   Have you ever been an officer of a public

   10:11 24   company?

   10:12 25        A.   No, I have not.

                                                                       13



   10:12  1        Q.   Or a director of a public company?

   10:12  2        A.   No, I have not.

   10:12  3        Q.   Okay.  Are you a member of any professional

   10:12  4   organizations?

   10:12  5        A.   I'm a member of the IEEE.

   10:12  6        Q.   For those of us that aren't in the engineering

   10:12  7   space, what does that stand for?

   10:12  8        A.   It's Electrical Engineering Association -- yeah.

   10:12  9   It's I-E-E-E.  So -- and I'm in the electromagnetic

   10:12 10   compatibility section.  They have different sections under

   10:12 11   the IEEE, and I'm under the electromagnetic compatibility,

   10:12 12   which has to do with area of my line of work.

   10:12 13        Q.   Okay.  Any other professional organizations?

   10:12 14        A.   Well, I mean, I'm on various committees.  One is

   10:13 15   ATIS, A-T-I-S, and that is where we develop industry

   10:13 16   standards for telecommunications and communications

   10:13 17   equipment, as well as a tel- -- I'm on telcordia

   10:13 18   committees, which develop standards for the NEBS.

   10:13 19   N-E-B-S, that's the testing I explained to you earlier.

   10:13 20        Q.   Uh-huh.

   10:13 21        A.   And so I've been a member of those committees

   10:13 22   for several -- many, many years.

   10:13 23        Q.   And what about your educational background, can

   10:13 24   you just tell me where you got your degrees from, which

   10:13 25   degrees and when?

                                                                       14



   10:13  1        A.   Right.  Well, I went to a community college,

   10:13  2   Orange County Community College.  I got an associate's

   10:13  3   degree.  And I started going to the New York Institute of

   10:13  4   Technology.  But instead, I -- the company I had started

   10:14  5   working for earlier in the summer wanted me back so badly

   10:14  6   that I went directly to work for them, and I had -- I

   10:14  7   wanted to go to school at night to finish up, but it

   10:14  8   didn't transpire out that way, because I ended up

   10:14  9   traveling so much in this particular -- particular line of

   10:14 10   work.  There is a lot of traveling involved; typically, 40

   10:14 11   to 50 percent of the time is traveling.

   10:14 12                  And for that company, it was back in the

   10:14 13   days with the analogue telephone lines, and any -- anytime

   10:14 14   we sold a product into a particular country, I would have

   10:15 15   to go to that country and do the testing to get approval

   10:15 16   to hook into the telephone network.

   10:15 17                  And so I have been -- and I've been doing

   10:15 18   that ever since.  But now -- there's no analogue telephone

   10:15 19   lines now; everything is digital.  So they have

   10:15 20   memorandums of understanding between various countries

   10:15 21   that now we don't have to travel to that country to get

   10:15 22   approval to hook into the telephone line.  We can just go

   10:15 23   to an accredited laboratory, either local or, you know,

   10:15 24   somewhere in the U.S., and have the testing done.

   10:15 25        Q.   I know this can be hard sometimes, but I think

                                                                       15



   10:15  1   just if you -- my question was just kind of when -- when

   10:16  2   did you get which degrees.

   10:16  3        A.   Okay.  Associate's.  Okay.

   10:16  4        Q.   Okay.  So I think you said you got an

   10:16  5   associate's degree from Orange County Community College?

   10:16  6        A.   Yes.  And that's it.

   10:16  7        Q.   That's it?

   10:16  8        A.   Yeah.

   10:16  9        Q.   Have you ever taken any courses relating to

   10:16 10   investing or financial advice?

   10:16 11        A.   No, I haven't.

   10:16 12        Q.   Okay.  And I take it no kind of undergraduate --

   10:16 13        A.   No.

   10:16 14        Q.   Let me just finish my question.

   10:16 15        A.   Okay.

   10:16 16        Q.   I knew -- I know you know where I'm going.

   10:16 17                  So no undergraduate courses or anything

   10:16 18   like that, in terms of financial services or investing

   10:16 19   advice?

   10:16 20        A.   No, I have had no -- no courses in that area.

   10:16 21        Q.   Okay.  So in terms of depositions, you mentioned

   10:17 22   that you hadn't been deposed before, correct?

   10:17 23        A.   Deposed means?

   10:17 24        Q.   This, basically, where you sit in a room --

   10:17 25        A.   Never, never ever.

                                                                       16



   10:17  1        Q.   Okay.  You've led a charmed life then.

   10:17  2                  What about any other kind of testimony?

   10:17  3   Have you ever testified in court or in an arbitration?

   10:17  4        A.   No, no testimonies.

   10:17  5        Q.   Okay.

   10:17  6        A.   You know, just juries and grand juries.

   10:17  7        Q.   In terms of any prior experience as like a party

   10:17  8   to a lawsuit, like either as a plaintiff or a defendant --

   10:17  9        A.   Never.

   10:17 10        Q.   Never.  This is your first time?

   10:17 11        A.   Yes.

   10:17 12        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever participated in any way

   10:17 13   before in a securities class action?

   10:17 14        A.   No.

   10:17 15        Q.   Is this your first time seeking to represent a

   10:17 16   class?

   10:17 17        A.   Yes.

   10:17 18        Q.   Are you receiving any compensation for seeking

   10:18 19   to represent a class?

   10:18 20        A.   No.

   10:18 21        Q.   Are you receiving any -- anything in exchange

   10:18 22   for seeking to represent a class?

   10:18 23        A.   No.

   10:18 24        Q.   Are you currently involved in any other judicial

   10:18 25   proceedings?

                                                                       17



   10:18  1        A.   No.

   10:18  2        Q.   What about regulatory proceedings?

   10:18  3        A.   No.

   10:18  4        Q.   And so historically have you ever been involved

   10:18  5   in any regulatory proceedings?

   10:18  6        A.   No.

   10:18  7        Q.   Have you ever given any informal interviews to

   10:18  8   any regulators?

   10:18  9        A.   No, I have not.

   10:18 10        Q.   Okay.  I -- so throughout the day I'm going to

   10:18 11   be showing you documents; they'll have been premarked with

   10:18 12   an exhibit number.

   10:18 13                  So I'm showing you what's been premarked as

   10:18 14   Exhibit Number 1.

   10:18 15                  (Exhibit 1 marked.)

   10:18 16                  MR. KNOTTS:  Thank you.

   10:18 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And just generally, you can

   10:19 18   take your time to look at the document, and just let me

   10:19 19   know when you're ready.

   10:19 20        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   10:19 21                  Okay.  This is about today's deposition.

   10:19 22   Okay.

   10:19 23        Q.   Have you seen this document before?

   10:19 24        A.   Have I seen this document before?  Yes, it looks

   10:19 25   familiar.

                                                                       18



   10:19  1        Q.   Okay.

   10:19  2        A.   Yes, I remember these two names on here as well.

   10:19  3   Yes, I've seen this.

   10:19  4        Q.   The two names you were just pointing to, just

   10:19  5   for the record, were?

   10:19  6        A.   Caroline -- well, actually, it's one name.  It's

   10:20  7   the same name twice -- Hickey.

   10:20  8        Q.   Yes.  That's me.

   10:20  9        A.   Yeah.

   10:20 10        Q.   Do you understand that you're testifying

   10:20 11   pursuant to this notice today?

   10:20 12        A.   Yes.

   10:20 13        Q.   Okay.  Prior to receiving this notice, when did

   10:20 14   you first understand that you were going to be deposed in

   10:20 15   this action?

   10:20 16        A.   Well, I can't give you a date.

   10:20 17        Q.   Sure.

   10:20 18        A.   It's been quite some time.

   10:20 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll -- so just -- and you

   10:20 20   can answer when, but just if you're going to get into

   10:20 21   things that we've discussed, you know --

   10:20 22                  THE WITNESS:  No.

   10:20 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- I'll ask you not to go

   10:20 24   there, but you can answer the time.

   10:20 25        A.   Well, I don't know the exact -- I mean, I was

                                                                       19



   10:20  1   well aware of this months ago, that this would be

   10:20  2   happening.

   10:20  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   10:20  4        A.   Not necessary -- not the time or the date,

   10:20  5   because we just came up with that a couple of weeks ago.

   10:21  6        Q.   Okay.  So -- and again, I'm not asking for any

   10:21  7   communications that you had with your attorneys, that

   10:21  8   would reflect legal advice.

   10:21  9                  So is it your testimony that I think you

   10:21 10   first understood at least several months ago that you

   10:21 11   would be deposed in the action?

   10:21 12        A.   Yeah.  Yes.

   10:21 13        Q.   Okay.

   10:21 14        A.   And I agreed to it.

   10:21 15        Q.   What steps did you take to prepare for the

   10:21 16   deposition?

   10:21 17        A.   Well, I read several of the documents.  Went

   10:21 18   over the information on the stocks that I purchased.

   10:21 19   Various -- reviewed various e-mails that were produced by

   10:22 20   my attorney.  That's -- that's about it.

   10:22 21        Q.   Okay.  So let's take that in turn.

   10:22 22                  You said you read several documents.  Which

   10:22 23   documents?

   10:22 24        A.   Well, there was a motion to dismiss document.

   10:22 25   There were, I think, several work-in-progress documents, I

                                                                       20



   10:22  1   think it was called.

   10:22  2        Q.   Work-in-progress documents.

   10:22  3        A.   I -- maybe I'm using the wrong terminology.

   10:22  4                  There were -- there were a lot of

   10:22  5   documents.  If you produce the documents and I look at

   10:22  6   them, I can give you a better explanation if I've seen the

   10:22  7   document or not.

   10:23  8        Q.   Sure.  And I can ask you that, and I will today.

   10:23  9   I just want to first get what you remember.

   10:23 10                  When did you prepare?

   10:23 11        A.   Well, I mean, I've been reading the documents

   10:23 12   all along, okay, but prepared yesterday.

   10:23 13        Q.   Okay.  So when you previously just testified

   10:23 14   that you -- I asked what steps did you take to prepare;

   10:23 15   you said you read several documents.

   10:23 16                  Is it your testimony that you were

   10:23 17   referencing the documents that you read yesterday?

   10:23 18        A.   Yes.

   10:23 19        Q.   Okay.  So -- and then with respect to the

   10:23 20   documents that you read yesterday, you said you recall

   10:23 21   reading a motion to dismiss; you recall reading several

   10:23 22   work-in-progress documents.

   10:23 23                  Are there any other documents that you

   10:23 24   recall reading yesterday?

   10:23 25        A.   E-mails and my various financial statements.

                                                                       21



   10:23  1   And that's about it.

   10:23  2        Q.   Okay.  So with respect to the documents you

   10:24  3   reviewed to prepare for the deposition, it was the motion

   10:24  4   to dismiss, the work-in-progress documents, e-mails and

   10:24  5   then financial statements?

   10:24  6        A.   Yes.

   10:24  7        Q.   Okay.  And nothing else that you can recall?

   10:24  8        A.   There may have been, but not that I can recall.

   10:24  9        Q.   Okay.  And with respect to the e-mails, how

   10:24 10   many, roughly?

   10:24 11        A.   Roughly?

   10:24 12        Q.   Sure.

   10:24 13        A.   There were at least 20 or 30.  And a lot of it

   10:24 14   was just communication back and forth throughout the time

   10:24 15   period, between my attorney and myself and also the other

   10:24 16   plaintiffs.

   10:24 17        Q.   Okay.  So then --

   10:24 18        A.   And also --

   10:24 19        Q.   Go ahead.

   10:24 20        A.   Also the -- the check that was done on my e-mail

   10:24 21   background, you know, it was done on my e-mail.

   10:25 22        Q.   Okay.  Let's take that in turn then.

   10:25 23                  So with respect to the e-mails that you

   10:25 24   reviewed yesterday to prepare for the deposition, it in --

   10:25 25   there was around 20 or 30.  A lot of it was communications

                                                                       22



   10:25  1   between and among your lawyers and yourself and the other

   10:25  2   named plaintiffs; is that correct?

   10:25  3        A.   Yes.

   10:25  4        Q.   Did you have any e-mails with the other named

   10:25  5   plaintiffs that didn't have your lawyers on them, that you

   10:25  6   reviewed?

   10:25  7        A.   No.

   10:25  8        Q.   How did the e-mails that you reviewed help you

   10:25  9   prepare for this deposition?

   10:25 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   10:25 11                  Just I'll ask you not to reveal the content

   10:25 12   of any e-mails with counsel.  But as long as you're able

   10:25 13   to answer the question with that in mind, go ahead.

   10:25 14        A.   What's the question again?

   10:25 15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   How did your review of the

   10:25 16   e-mails yesterday help you prepare for this deposition?

   10:25 17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same --

   10:25 18        A.   Well --

   10:25 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.  Keep that in

   10:25 20   mind --

   10:25 21        A.   Just --

   10:25 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- to the extent that you can

   10:25 23   answer, go ahead.

   10:25 24        A.   It helped refresh my memory a bit.

   10:26 25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What did it help you refresh

                                                                       23



   10:26  1   your memory about?

   10:26  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.  Keep that in

   10:26  3   mind.  Go ahead.

   10:26  4        A.   The -- basically, the correspondence that we had

   10:26  5   throughout the several months, we tend to forget some of

   10:26  6   it, and it refreshed my memory.  And I said, oh, yeah, I

   10:26  7   remember that.  Matter of fact, I even remembered that I

   10:26  8   was in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time when I was reading

   10:26  9   it.

   10:26 10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What are you referring

   10:26 11   to when you say "it"?

   10:26 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  And again, I'll ask you not to

   10:26 13   divulge communications with attorneys.

   10:26 14                  THE WITNESS:  No, we don't need to.  Okay.

   10:26 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  So if you can answer that

   10:26 16   without doing that, you can -- you can go ahead.

   10:26 17        A.   What was the question again?

   10:26 18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Sure.

   10:26 19                  You said -- basically, I had asked you how

   10:27 20   did it help -- what did it refresh your recollection, and

   10:27 21   you said that you reviewed the correspondence, and that

   10:27 22   over the past several months you kind of tend to --

   10:27 23        A.   Right, it --

   10:27 24        Q.   -- forget it.  And then you said, for example, I

   10:27 25   remembered that I was in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time

                                                                       24



   10:27  1   when I was reading it.  And I asked you what was it --

   10:27  2        A.   Yeah, it was a particular document that I had to

   10:27  3   read.  And I don't remember which document it was, as far

   10:27  4   as the title goes.  It was a document that I had to read

   10:27  5   and give approval to.

   10:27  6        Q.   Okay.  Is there anything else that you can tell

   10:27  7   me about --

   10:27  8        A.   No.

   10:27  9        Q.   -- that specifically refreshed your recollection

   10:27 10   based on your review yesterday?

   10:27 11        A.   No.

   10:27 12        Q.   Okay.  Now, you mentioned these work-in-progress

   10:27 13   documents; what were those?

   10:27 14        A.   It's --

   10:27 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  And same objections about not

   10:27 16   revealing the contents of things and communications with

   10:27 17   us.

   10:27 18        A.   Right --

   10:27 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  If you can answer that then --

   10:27 20        A.   You would have to produce the document so I can

   10:28 21   look at it.

   10:28 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Well, why don't you explain to

   10:28 23   me what the document is?

   10:28 24        A.   So --

   10:28 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same.

                                                                       25



   10:28  1        A.   That's why I need to see the document.

   10:28  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You reviewed the document

   10:28  3   yesterday, correct?

   10:28  4        A.   Yeah, but --

   10:28  5        Q.   Okay.

   10:28  6        A.   There were --

   10:28  7        Q.   Let me finish my question.

   10:28  8        A.   Okay.

   10:28  9        Q.   Sorry.  I don't want us to talk over one

   10:28 10   another.

   10:28 11        A.   Sure.

   10:28 12        Q.   So I think you reviewed the work-in-progress

   10:28 13   documents yesterday.  I'm just asking you, generally, can

   10:28 14   you tell me kind of what they were?

   10:28 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.

   10:28 16        A.   So --

   10:28 17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.

   10:28 18        A.   Yeah.  I'd like to look at the document.  I'd

   10:28 19   like to -- there's many, many documents that I looked at,

   10:28 20   and it wasn't just yesterday; it was throughout several

   10:28 21   months.  There's many documents.  So this is not my

   10:28 22   particular line of expertise.  So it's -- I would have to

   10:28 23   actually see the document to -- what you're referring to.

   10:29 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What isn't your

   10:29 25   particular line of expertise?

                                                                       26



   10:29  1        A.   This right -- this right here is not my

   10:29  2   particular line of expertise, as far as depositions go.

   10:29  3        Q.   Yeah.  And the only thing -- you know, I'm

   10:29  4   just -- again, I'm just asking you questions.  Your job is

   10:29  5   to answer them truthfully.  If anything is unclear, you

   10:29  6   can, obviously, let me know.  So I don't -- that's the

   10:29  7   basic kind of ground rules.

   10:29  8                  And I think -- I'm just asking you -- so

   10:29  9   you've mentioned that you've reviewed these

   10:29 10   work-in-progress documents yesterday.  All I'm asking for

   10:29 11   is your recollection, even at a high level, of what those

   10:29 12   documents were?

   10:29 13                  MR. KNOTTS:  And he's asked this --

   10:29 14   answered this question multiple times, Counsel.

   10:29 15                  And to the extent that you can add anything

   10:29 16   to your previous answers, go ahead.  But I'll also ask you

   10:29 17   not to reveal any communications --

   10:29 18        A.   Well, I've asked to see the documents, and they

   10:29 19   haven't been produced.

   10:29 20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you say, They haven't been

   10:30 21   produced, what do you mean?

   10:30 22        A.   I'm asking to see the documents so I can get

   10:30 23   another refreshing look at it.  But I did review several

   10:30 24   documents.  I remember the title of those particular

   10:30 25   documents, okay, and it basically reviewed the case.

                                                                       27



   10:30  1        Q.   Okay.  Did the work-in-progress documents

   10:30  2   refresh your recollection?

   10:30  3        A.   Yeah, to -- somewhat it did, but there's a lot

   10:30  4   of legal terminology in there as well.

   10:30  5        Q.   And can you tell me how it helped -- how the

   10:30  6   work-in-progress documents helped refresh your

   10:30  7   recollection?

   10:30  8                  MR. KNOTTS:  You've asked this question two

   10:30  9   or three times now, Counsel.

   10:30 10                  To the extent you have anything else to

   10:30 11   add, go ahead.

   10:30 12        A.   No, I don't.  I have nothing else to add.

   10:30 13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I think you previously

   10:31 14   answered the question about how the e-mails helped refresh

   10:31 15   your recollection; now I'm asking you specifically about

   10:31 16   the work-in-progress document?

   10:31 17                  MR. KNOTTS:  You've already asked.

   10:31 18        A.   I've already answered the question.

   10:31 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So is your answer that it did

   10:31 20   help refresh your recollection, but you can't give any

   10:31 21   more explanation --

   10:31 22        A.   Yes.

   10:31 23        Q.   -- how it refreshed your recollection?

   10:31 24        A.   Yes.

   10:31 25        Q.   Okay.  But it would help to see the document?

                                                                       28



   10:31  1        A.   Yeah.  I can...

   10:31  2        Q.   So the other -- so that's the first two kind of

   10:31  3   categories of documents that you mentioned.

   10:31  4                  The third one, I think, was financial

   10:31  5   statements?

   10:31  6        A.   Yes.

   10:31  7        Q.   Okay.  What -- what were you referring to there?

   10:31  8        A.   My Ameritrade financial statements, in which

   10:31  9   I -- there's three accounts that I have had purchased Rite

   10:32 10   Aid stock under.

   10:32 11        Q.   Any other financial statements?

   10:32 12        A.   No.

   10:32 13        Q.   And roughly how many of the Ameritrade

   10:32 14   statements did you review?

   10:32 15        A.   Several.  But there was a pile of them.  They

   10:32 16   all basically said the same thing.  It was just going

   10:32 17   through different waters.  But I hadn't sold any stock, so

   10:32 18   if there was 1,000 shares on one, it was 1,000 shares on

   10:32 19   the next and 1,000 shares on the next, because I hadn't

   10:32 20   sold anything.  But I -- there was -- reviewed my -- my

   10:32 21   main Ameritrade account, my Roth Ameritrade account, and

   10:33 22   my IRA Ameritrade account, all of which have Rite Aid

   10:33 23   stock in it.

   10:33 24        Q.   And so did you review the monthly statements for

   10:33 25   each of those three accounts?

                                                                       29



   10:33  1        A.   So I reviewed the monthly statements for one

   10:33  2   account, and I can't remember if it was all the accounts.

   10:33  3   I know for sure it was the main account, and then also the

   10:33  4   IRA.  I can't remember if it was the Roth as well.

   10:33  5        Q.   And what was the time frame of the statements

   10:33  6   that you reviewed, meaning for which months or years had

   10:33  7   they been issued?

   10:33  8        A.   They went over a very wide period, but

   10:33  9   primarily -- well, it was primarily from -- from October

   10:34 10   2016 to June 2017.

   10:34 11        Q.   Did you review any outside of that time period?

   10:34 12        A.   I don't remember reviewing any outside, not with

   10:34 13   my attorney.  I reviewed it on my own.

   10:34 14        Q.   Okay.  And based on your recollection of the

   10:34 15   documents you reviewed yesterday, you said there was no

   10:34 16   sales of -- you made no sales of Rite Aid stock?

   10:34 17        A.   No, I have not.

   10:34 18        Q.   Is that during just that period or --

   10:34 19        A.   Totally.

   10:34 20        Q.   Totally.  So you've never sold any Rite Aid

   10:34 21   stock?

   10:34 22        A.   To my knowledge, I have never sold any Rite Aid

   10:34 23   stock.

   10:35 24        Q.   And how many purchases did you make of Rite Aid

   10:35 25   stock based on what you reviewed yesterday?

                                                                       30



   10:35  1        A.   A lot.

   10:35  2        Q.   Okay.

   10:35  3        A.   I mean, how many times did I purchase Rite Aid

   10:35  4   stock; probably seven, eight times.

   10:35  5        Q.   Okay.

   10:35  6        A.   I have a list of it, but I'm just guessing seven

   10:35  7   or eight times.  There's -- you have to realize, I

   10:35  8   have -- I own about 60 or 70 stocks, so sometimes it all

   10:35  9   blends in.

   10:35 10        Q.   When you say, Sometimes it all blends in, what

   10:35 11   do you mean?

   10:35 12        A.   Well, I mean, it's going back so far.  I think

   10:36 13   my first purchase might have been around 2013.  Okay.  And

   10:36 14   my last purchase, I believe, it was 2017.  So, over time

   10:36 15   you forget.  But, I mean, I have an Excel spreadsheet with

   10:36 16   the Rite Aid stock purchases and, to my recollection, it

   10:36 17   was seven or eight purchases.

   10:36 18        Q.   So when you earlier said, I have a list of it,

   10:36 19   were you referring to that Excel spreadsheet?

   10:36 20        A.   Yes, of the RAD stock.

   10:36 21        Q.   Okay.  When did you create that document?

   10:36 22        A.   I created that document a couple of years ago.

   10:36 23        Q.   Okay.  And did you update it over time if your

   10:36 24   transactions in RAD changed?

   10:36 25        A.   I didn't have to update it, because after 2017,

                                                                       31



   10:37  1   I never purchased any RAD stock again.

   10:37  2        Q.   Between the time period that you mentioned, 2013

   10:37  3   and 2017, was it something that you updated during that

   10:37  4   time frame, to the extent that you made additional

   10:37  5   transactions in Rite Aid stock?

   10:37  6        A.   Well, I have a -- no, I did not have to update

   10:37  7   anything, because I -- I go on my Ameritrade account and I

   10:37  8   look at the transactions.  Okay.  I was -- this was put

   10:37  9   together under the -- I was asked to by my attorney.

   10:37 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  So then -- so given that this

   10:37 11   document was prepared at the request of attorneys, it

   10:37 12   sounds like in connection with litigation --

   10:37 13                  THE WITNESS:  It was.

   10:37 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.  So with that in mind,

   10:37 15   go forward.

   10:37 16                  MS. ZALKA:  That's okay.

   10:37 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  And let me just ask you:

   10:37 18   So when did you create it?

   10:37 19        A.   When did I create it?  I can't give you a date

   10:38 20   when I created it.  I would have to look at the e-mail

   10:38 21   exchanges, because I know I e-mailed it to the attorneys.

   10:38 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  And then so now we're getting

   10:38 23   into communications with attorneys.  So, again, I'll ask

   10:38 24   you not to divulge communications with attorneys.

   10:38 25                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

                                                                       32



   10:38  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Yeah.  And I'm just asking you

   10:38  2   if you have -- you may not have a specific date

   10:38  3   recollection, but just, generally, when did you create it,

   10:38  4   like month or year?

   10:38  5        A.   I think it was like three years ago.  Maybe

   10:38  6   two-and-a-half years ago.  It was a while ago that I

   10:38  7   created that document.

   10:38  8        Q.   Okay.  And it was created at the request of your

   10:38  9   attorney?

   10:38 10        A.   Yes.

   10:38 11        Q.   Okay.  You mentioned the three Ameritrade

   10:38 12   accounts.  Just to confirm, were they the only three

   10:38 13   accounts that you ever held or transacted in Rite Aid

   10:39 14   stock?

   10:39 15        A.   Yes.

   10:39 16        Q.   Okay.  Do you have any other investment

   10:39 17   accounts, other than the three Ameritrade accounts you

   10:39 18   just identified?

   10:39 19        A.   Yes.

   10:39 20        Q.   Okay.  How many others?

   10:39 21        A.   I have my 401(k).

   10:39 22        Q.   Beyond that?

   10:39 23        A.   Well, other than checking and various savings

   10:39 24   accounts.

   10:39 25        Q.   Yeah.  Anything that you hold securities in, put

                                                                       33



   10:39  1   it that way.

   10:39  2        A.   No, just my 401(k).  And that's through John

   10:39  3   Hancock.

   10:39  4        Q.   And you don't have trading discretion in your

   10:39  5   401(k) account; how is it structured?

   10:39  6        A.   I have brokerage capability.

   10:39  7        Q.   Okay.  Do you exercise that brokerage

   10:39  8   capability?

   10:39  9        A.   I do.

   10:39 10        Q.   Have you ever transacted in Rite Aid stock in

   10:40 11   your 401(k)?

   10:40 12        A.   No.

   10:40 13        Q.   Have you ever transacted in Walgreens stock in

   10:40 14   your 401(k)?

   10:40 15        A.   No, no.

   10:40 16        Q.   Have you ever transacted in Fred's stock in your

   10:40 17   401(k)?

   10:40 18        A.   No.  Definitely not.

   10:40 19        Q.   Why do you say "definitely not" to that?

   10:40 20        A.   I read the papers and it had -- had a little

   10:40 21   misfortune yesterday or the day before.

   10:40 22        Q.   Okay.  So going back to your preparation for the

   10:40 23   deposition.  So in terms of the financial statements that

   10:40 24   you reviewed, it was just for the three Ameritrade

   10:40 25   accounts, correct?

                                                                       34



   10:40  1        A.   Yes.

   10:40  2        Q.   And did you review any public disclosures?

   10:41  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  And again, objection to the

   10:41  4   extent it calls for work product on -- on things that we

   10:41  5   may have given him during preparation.

   10:41  6        A.   No.

   10:41  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  But you can answer.

   10:41  8        A.   No.

   10:41  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   No?

   10:41 10        A.   No.

   10:41 11        Q.   Okay.  Did anyone other than your lawyers attend

   10:41 12   your prep session?

   10:41 13        A.   No.

   10:41 14        Q.   How long did that last?

   10:41 15        A.   Approximately two-and-a-half, three hours.

   10:41 16        Q.   Okay.  Outside of the meeting, did you do

   10:41 17   anything to prepare for the deposition, or review any

   10:41 18   other documents than what you've already identified?

   10:41 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll, I guess, instruct

   10:41 20   you not to answer on documents that we selected or sent to

   10:41 21   you.

   10:41 22        A.   Over time I had -- I had gone back to some of my

   10:41 23   previous e-mails and looked at documents.  That's it.

   10:41 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Um --

   10:42 25        A.   Prior to yesterday's review.

                                                                       35



   10:42  1        Q.   What were the e-mails that you reviewed?

   10:42  2        A.   Those were e-mails where my attorney had an

   10:42  3   attachment and sent the document to me.  I didn't --

   10:42  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  So then don't go beyond that.

   10:42  5                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  That's all I'm saying.

   10:42  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  All right.

   10:42  7        A.   I'm not -- and -- yeah, that's basically it.

   10:42  8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   10:42  9        A.   And I didn't look at all of them.  I just looked

   10:42 10   at a couple of them.

   10:42 11        Q.   But it was exclusively, it sounds like, I just

   10:42 12   want to confirm, e-mails to and among you and your

   10:42 13   attorneys?

   10:42 14        A.   Correct.

   10:42 15        Q.   Okay.  Have you discussed today's deposition

   10:42 16   with anyone, outside of your lawyers?

   10:42 17        A.   No.

   10:42 18        Q.   Have you discussed today's deposition with any

   10:42 19   of the other named plaintiffs?

   10:42 20        A.   No.

   10:42 21        Q.   When was the first time you met or spoke with,

   10:43 22   communicated with any of the named plaintiffs?

   10:43 23        A.   I don't know.  That would be about a year ago,

   10:43 24   when the documents started being sent out from the

   10:43 25   attorney.

                                                                       36



   10:43  1        Q.   So you have no prior relationship, outside of

   10:43  2   the context of this lawsuit, with any of the other named

   10:43  3   plaintiffs?

   10:43  4        A.   No, I do not.

   10:43  5        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever considered being a

   10:43  6   plaintiff in a lawsuit before, other than this one?

   10:43  7        A.   No.

   10:43  8        Q.   No?

   10:43  9                  Have you ever had any communications about

   10:43 10   potentially appearing as a plaintiff in a lawsuit?

   10:43 11        A.   Not to my knowledge.

   10:43 12        Q.   Outside of this lawsuit, have you ever

   10:44 13   had -- have you ever considered suing anybody or anybody

   10:44 14   -- any company?

   10:44 15        A.   Not outside of this.

   10:44 16        Q.   And by outside this lawsuit, I'm referring to

   10:44 17   the caption Chabot versus Walgreens.

   10:44 18        A.   Yes.

   10:44 19        Q.   You understood that?

   10:44 20        A.   Yes, I understood that.

   10:44 21        Q.   Okay.  Other than with your lawyers, have you

   10:44 22   had any communications with anybody concerning your claims

   10:44 23   in this lawsuit?

   10:44 24        A.   Well, I just -- I had one -- just one e-mail

   10:44 25   to my -- just to my mother.

                                                                       37



   10:44  1        Q.   Okay.  Outside of one e-mail to your mother,

   10:44  2   have you had any other communications with anybody

   10:44  3   concerning this lawsuit?

   10:44  4        A.   No.

   10:44  5        Q.   Have you sent any other e-mails, other than the

   10:44  6   e-mail that you sent to your mother, concerning your

   10:45  7   claims in this lawsuit?

   10:45  8        A.   No.

   10:45  9        Q.   What about the subject matter of the claims, so

   10:45 10   relating more generally -- let me put it this way:  Have

   10:45 11   you had any communications concerning the Walgreens and

   10:45 12   Rite Aid merger?

   10:45 13        A.   Not to my knowledge.

   10:45 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  You mean other -- other than

   10:45 15   with attorneys?

   10:45 16                  MS. ZALKA:  Correct.

   10:45 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm not asking you for --

   10:45 18   that's a fair clarification.

   10:45 19                  I'm not asking you about communications

   10:45 20   with your attorneys.  My questions are geared towards

   10:45 21   outside of communications with your lawyers --

   10:45 22        A.   No.

   10:45 23        Q.   -- have you ever had any communications with

   10:45 24   anybody concerning the subject matter of this lawsuit?

   10:45 25        A.   Not to my knowledge.

                                                                       38



   10:45  1        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever -- and just so the record

   10:45  2   is clear.  Have you had any communications, outside of

   10:45  3   communications with your attorneys, concerning the

   10:45  4   Walgreens and Rite Aid merger?

   10:45  5        A.   Not to my knowledge.  I just pretty much kept to

   10:46  6   myself on this.

   10:46  7        Q.   And what do you mean pretty much kept to

   10:46  8   yourself on this?

   10:46  9        A.   Well, there's no need to send any communications

   10:46 10   about that.

   10:46 11        Q.   Why not?

   10:46 12        A.   I don't -- I don't need to.  And, you know,

   10:46 13   people don't have to know my business either, as far as,

   10:46 14   you know, what I'm going through, how many stocks I own.

   10:46 15   So there's just no need for me to communicate with

   10:46 16   anybody.

   10:46 17        Q.   Okay.

   10:46 18        A.   I mean, I don't communicate with anybody on

   10:46 19   stocks hardly at all.  I mean, you know, my brother once

   10:46 20   in a while says, hey, you should buy this stock or you

   10:46 21   should buy that stock, and I just blow him off.

   10:47 22        Q.   People's families are complicated.  No, kidding.

   10:47 23                  In terms of -- do you have anybody that

   10:47 24   you've got any financial advice from?

   10:47 25        A.   No, I don't -- I take care of my own portfolios.

                                                                       39



   10:47  1        Q.   So even outside of kind of a formal engagement,

   10:47  2   like so outside of kind of formally retaining a financial

   10:47  3   advisor to help you manage your portfolio, is there

   10:47  4   anybody on an informal basis that you tend to consult with

   10:47  5   respect to financial advice?

   10:47  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.  But go

   10:47  7   ahead.

   10:47  8        A.   I handle my own portfolio.  So the answer is no;

   10:47  9   no, I don't speak to anybody about what to buy or what

   10:47 10   to -- you know, never.

   10:47 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  I'm going to shift gears

   10:47 12   a little bit.  I want to talk about just generally

   10:48 13   document retention.

   10:48 14        A.   Uh-huh.

   10:48 15        Q.   Do you have a practice around retaining

   10:48 16   documents?

   10:48 17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

   10:48 18        A.   No.  As far as -- are you referring to the

   10:48 19   e-mails?

   10:48 20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So we can talk about it in

   10:48 21   general.  So let's start with e-mails.  Like, do you

   10:48 22   generally save all of your e-mails?

   10:48 23        A.   I hardly ever delete my e-mails; they just go on

   10:48 24   and on and on.

   10:48 25        Q.   I'm the same.

                                                                       40



   10:48  1                  Okay.  What about any other types of

   10:48  2   documents?

   10:48  3        A.   Yeah.  I don't save financial documents.  I

   10:48  4   don't save documents relating to stock.  All I do is if I

   10:48  5   go into my Ameritrade account and the various stocks that

   10:48  6   I own, I will read the news, what's going on with the

   10:49  7   company regarding the news.  Once in a blue moon, I might

   10:49  8   read a financial statement.  But if I do, I just open it

   10:49  9   up, but I don't save it.

   10:49 10        Q.   Beyond reading the news and once in a blue moon

   10:49 11   reading a financial statement, are there any other sources

   10:49 12   that you use in connection with deciding to transact in or

   10:49 13   hold stock?

   10:49 14        A.   No.  I -- I primarily use my Ameritrade account

   10:49 15   to do any research on -- on stocks and reading the various

   10:50 16   documents through Ameritrade.

   10:50 17                  Once in a while I may go to the Yahoo

   10:50 18   website, because if I click on something on Ameritrade,

   10:50 19   it'll take me to another website.  But that's it.

   10:50 20        Q.   Okay.  Can you explain to me how you access kind

   10:50 21   of research or information on your Ameritrade account?

   10:50 22   Kind of because you keep on saying I go into Ameritrade,

   10:50 23   but I don't know what that means.

   10:50 24                  So I'm trying to understand, essentially,

   10:50 25   what sources of information that you might have had --

                                                                       41



   10:50  1   that you did have access to through your Ameritrade

   10:50  2   accounts?

   10:50  3        A.   Well, like I mentioned, sometimes I will look at

   10:50  4   the financial statement.  But primarily I look at the

   10:50  5   news, okay, on a particular company.  If I own a stock and

   10:51  6   the stock is going up, I'm interested why is it going up,

   10:51  7   or if the stock is going down, I'm interested in why is it

   10:51  8   going down today?  Is there anything in the news about it?

   10:51  9   It's just a common sense thing to do.

   10:51 10                  And then, you know, I also look to see, you

   10:51 11   know, how many -- you know, is the stock a buy, is it a

   10:51 12   hold, is it a sell?  That information is also available on

   10:51 13   the Ameritrade.

   10:51 14        Q.   And in your Ameritrade account, it has kind of

   10:51 15   recommendations, buy/hold/sell, and a research report that

   10:51 16   goes along with it.

   10:51 17                  Is that what you're describing?

   10:51 18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.  But go

   10:51 19   ahead.

   10:51 20        A.   Yes, they have the research reports.  And I

   10:51 21   rarely look at them; I just don't have time.

   10:51 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you recall reading any

   10:52 23   research reports regarding Walgreens?

   10:52 24        A.   No, all my Walgreens information came from news

   10:52 25   articles.

                                                                       42



   10:52  1        Q.   Okay.  Do you recall reading any research

   10:52  2   reports concerning Rite Aid?

   10:52  3        A.   Everything that I -- my knowledge was all from

   10:52  4   news articles.

   10:52  5        Q.   Okay.  Same question with respect to Fred's:  Do

   10:52  6   you recall reading any research reports regarding Fred's?

   10:52  7        A.   No.  Again, just reading the news articles.

   10:52  8        Q.   And the news articles that you read concerning

   10:52  9   Walgreens, are you Googling or are those like available

   10:52 10   through Ameritrade?

   10:52 11        A.   Those are available through Ameritrade.

   10:52 12        Q.   Is that a curated set of information?

   10:52 13        A.   What do you mean by that?

   10:52 14        Q.   Fair.

   10:52 15                  So what I mean is on -- sounds like on the

   10:53 16   Ameritrade platform, you log on -- you first log on --

   10:53 17   let's do it this way.

   10:53 18                  You log on to Ameritrade, correct?

   10:53 19        A.   Yes.

   10:53 20        Q.   And then I assume you have account statements

   10:53 21   somewhere that are available?

   10:53 22        A.   Right.

   10:53 23        Q.   And then how do you get to the news information

   10:53 24   that you've been referring to in responding to my

   10:53 25   questions?

                                                                       43



   10:53  1        A.   Okay.  It's just there on the screen, as part of

   10:53  2   the desktop.  If I go into that particular account and I

   10:53  3   click on a particular symbol, stock symbol, okay, the news

   10:53  4   is right at the bottom.  And I can select to read whatever

   10:53  5   news I want to based on that particular stock.

   10:53  6        Q.   So to take Rite Aid as an example.  So let's say

   10:53  7   you have a holding in Rite Aid in your Ameritrade account,

   10:53  8   right, 1,000 shares.  You click on the RAD symbol, and

   10:53  9   then it comes up with information and news about Rite Aid?

   10:54 10        A.   Correct.

   10:54 11        Q.   Did you save that information?

   10:54 12        A.   Never.

   10:54 13        Q.   Never.  How frequently did you access that

   10:54 14   information concerning Rite Aid?

   10:54 15        A.   Well, I accessed it very frequently during the

   10:54 16   initial announcement that there would be a merger between

   10:54 17   Rite Aid and Walgreens at $9 a share, because it -- you

   10:54 18   know, I thought it was a halfway decent price.  So I was

   10:54 19   interested, and so I did read it, and frequently.

   10:54 20        Q.   When was the last time you accessed it?

   10:54 21        A.   Last time I accessed it?  Well, even on my phone

   10:54 22   here, you know, if you have an Apple phone, there's a

   10:54 23   stock thing that you can click on and, you know, RAD is --

   10:55 24   and Walgreens is programmed into my phone.

   10:55 25                  So, I mean, I go and I look at my stock

                                                                       44



   10:55  1   portfolio.  So all the stocks I own is programmed into the

   10:55  2   phone.  So I'll go there every day, and I'll go through

   10:55  3   and look.  And then if something interests me, then I'll

   10:55  4   click on it.  So, you know, I mean, I read -- that's --

   10:55  5   that's how I knew about Fred's, okay, I -- I was going

   10:55  6   through the app on my phone and I was looking at Rite Aid

   10:55  7   stock, because it actually started going up in the last

   10:55  8   week or so, and there was news on there that Fred is

   10:55  9   closing stores and filing for Chapter 11.

   10:56 10        Q.   In terms of when you say the app on your phone,

   10:56 11   are you referring to the Ameritrade app --

   10:56 12        A.   No.

   10:56 13        Q.   -- or something else?

   10:56 14        A.   Something else.

   10:56 15        Q.   Okay.  So let's first just stick with

   10:56 16   Ameritrade.

   10:56 17        A.   Okay.

   10:56 18        Q.   Let's take this methodically.

   10:56 19        A.   Sure.

   10:56 20        Q.   With respect to the information that you

   10:56 21   referenced in your Ameritrade account, you mentioned that

   10:56 22   you could click on a symbol and it would come up with, you

   10:56 23   know, information and news about that security or the

   10:56 24   company that issued it, correct?

   10:56 25        A.   Right.

                                                                       45



   10:56  1        Q.   Okay.  And when was the last time you accessed

   10:56  2   information concerning Rite Aid through --

   10:56  3        A.   Through Ameritrade?

   10:56  4        Q.   -- that mechanism?

   10:56  5        A.   Through Ameritrade?

   10:56  6        Q.   Yes.

   10:56  7        A.   Okay.  It's been a while, because I -- a month?

   10:56  8   I don't know.  A month.  Because it's more convenient for

   10:56  9   me to use this app on my phone.

   10:56 10        Q.   Okay.  And with respect to the Ameritrade

   10:56 11   account, have -- on average, between 2016 and last month,

   10:56 12   when you recall last accessing it, how frequently did you

   10:56 13   use the kind of -- the Ameritrade account to access

   10:57 14   information concerning Rite Aid?

   10:57 15        A.   2016?  Well, I mean, at the beginning of 2016, I

   10:57 16   was using it frequently.  And then after the merger didn't

   10:57 17   happen, it became less and less I was using the app.  I

   10:57 18   don't know how many times.

   10:57 19        Q.   Did you save any of the information that you

   10:57 20   accessed concerning Rite Aid on the Ameritrade app?

   10:57 21        A.   I never save the information.

   10:57 22        Q.   Okay.

   10:57 23        A.   Because if I needed it, I can always get it

   10:57 24   again, and it just clutters up my hard drive.

   10:57 25        Q.   If you needed to get it today, how would you do

                                                                       46



   10:57  1   it?

   10:57  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

   10:57  3                  To the extent that you can understand the

   10:57  4   question, you can answer.

   10:57  5        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Sure, I can -- did you

   10:57  6   understand my question?

   10:57  7        A.   Yeah.  I would just do a search online, either

   10:58  8   through my Ameritrade account or I'll Google it.

   10:58  9        Q.   And through your Ameritrade account, does it

   10:58 10   retain the information historically that you've accessed?

   10:58 11        A.   The -- if you're referring to the articles that

   10:58 12   I read --

   10:58 13        Q.   Yes.

   10:58 14        A.   -- yes, they go -- they're historically

   10:58 15   correlated.

   10:58 16        Q.   Okay.  And you can just go on your app and pull

   10:58 17   those?

   10:58 18        A.   I can go onto the app and I can pull them, but

   10:58 19   there is -- there is a cutoff date.  It doesn't go on

   10:58 20   forever.  You know, I might be able to go back for three

   10:58 21   months, but then after that, I can't get -- I can't get it

   10:58 22   anymore.  If I wanted a particular article, I'd have to

   10:58 23   Google it.

   10:58 24        Q.   What about your account statements on

   10:59 25   the -- your Ameritrade statements, can you access those

                                                                       47



   10:59  1   for every month since the beginning of the account?

   10:59  2        A.   I can, but I don't.

   10:59  3        Q.   But those -- your monthly account statements,

   10:59  4   both current and historical, are available to you through

   10:59  5   the Ameritrade kind of log-in?

   10:59  6        A.   Yes.  I -- I went to paperless, so everything is

   10:59  7   soft copy.

   10:59  8        Q.   Do you have a separate file or folder where you

   10:59  9   save all of your monthly statements?

   10:59 10        A.   No, I do not, because I know they're online and

   10:59 11   I can get them anytime.

   10:59 12        Q.   Okay.  Beyond e-mail, you said you generally

   11:00 13   don't -- you generally save all of your e-mail, correct?

   11:00 14        A.   Yeah.

   11:00 15        Q.   Okay.  Do you -- are there any other categories

   11:00 16   of documents, other than e-mail, that it's your practice

   11:00 17   to retain in the ordinary course?

   11:00 18        A.   No.

   11:00 19        Q.   Do you use text messages to communicate --

   11:00 20        A.   Yes.

   11:00 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Period or about?

   11:00 22                  MS. ZALKA:  I was going to finish the

   11:00 23   sentence, but you answered.

   11:00 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Have you used text messages to

   11:00 25   communicate about Walgreens or Rite Aid?

                                                                       48



   11:00  1        A.   No.

   11:00  2        Q.   Okay.  About the lawsuit?

   11:00  3        A.   No.

   11:00  4        Q.   Okay.  Do you have any hard copy documents or

   11:00  5   notes concerning Walgreens or Rite Aid?

   11:00  6        A.   No.

   11:00  7        Q.   What steps have you taken to preserve documents

   11:01  8   for purposes of this litigation?

   11:01  9        A.   I haven't -- it's just my nature not to delete

   11:01 10   documents, so automatically I know they're preserved,

   11:01 11   because I'm not in the habit of deleting documents.

   11:01 12        Q.   What steps did you take to preserve the articles

   11:01 13   and information that you accessed through Ameritrade?

   11:01 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

   11:01 15                  THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry; I didn't get your

   11:01 16   answer.

   11:01 17        A.   I don't save those.  I mentioned that several

   11:01 18   times.

   11:01 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So just to be -- you did not

   11:01 20   take any action to save or retain the information that you

   11:01 21   accessed concerning Walgreens or Rite Aid through the

   11:01 22   Ameritrade platform?

   11:01 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Just objection to form, and to

   11:01 24   the extent it's even possible to retain those things.

   11:01 25        A.   So, no, I have not.

                                                                       49



   11:01  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   If you want to, can you print

   11:01  2   out from the Ameritrade platform?

   11:01  3        A.   Yes.

   11:01  4        Q.   So, for example, if you had -- if you accessed

   11:02  5   one of the articles or the reports that you mentioned, you

   11:02  6   could -- through the Ameritrade platform, you could print

   11:02  7   that?

   11:02  8        A.   Yes.

   11:02  9        Q.   At any point did you take any steps to print any

   11:02 10   of the information or reports that you accessed concerning

   11:02 11   Walgreens or Rite Aid?

   11:02 12        A.   No.  It would just clutter up -- I'm not a big

   11:02 13   person -- I'm not a big hard copy person.

   11:02 14        Q.   So I asked you what steps did you take to

   11:02 15   preserve documents for purposes of this litigation, and

   11:02 16   your response was it's just my nature not to delete

   11:02 17   documents, so automatically I know they're preserved,

   11:03 18   because I'm not in the habit of deleting documents.

   11:03 19                  Do you recall that?

   11:03 20        A.   Yes.

   11:03 21        Q.   So, are there any steps that you took, other

   11:03 22   than relying on your general nature, to preserve documents

   11:03 23   for purposes of this litigation?

   11:03 24        A.   No, because I know that -- I know the

   11:03 25   information is obtainable if anybody needs to obtain it.

                                                                       50



   11:03  1        Q.   Now, you mentioned there was a cutoff date for

   11:03  2   three months for certain articles in Ameritrade; is that

   11:03  3   correct?

   11:03  4        A.   I'm just guessing, because there's been --

   11:03  5   there's been times, and it's not necessarily -- it's not

   11:03  6   necessarily Rite Aid or Walgreens, but it might be some

   11:03  7   other stock I'm interested in, and I wanted to go back and

   11:03  8   reread an article that I saw and that article wasn't there

   11:03  9   anymore.  And I couldn't get access to it, so I would have

   11:03 10   to Google -- if I remember the title of the document, I

   11:03 11   would have to Google it.

   11:04 12        Q.   Have you destroyed any documents concerning

   11:04 13   Walgreens or Rite Aid since 2016?

   11:04 14        A.   No.

   11:04 15        Q.   Have you destroyed any documents concerning your

   11:04 16   transactions in Walgreens or Rite Aid since 2016?

   11:04 17        A.   Regarding my transactions?

   11:04 18        Q.   Uh-huh.

   11:04 19        A.   I don't know; that's an odd question.  Destroy

   11:04 20   any documents regarding my transactions.  You know, I

   11:04 21   might have shredded one of my statements, which I'm

   11:04 22   allowed to do.

   11:04 23        Q.   Other than potentially shredding --

   11:04 24        A.   You know, because the --

   11:04 25        Q.   Go ahead.

                                                                       51



   11:04  1        A.   You know, obviously, you know, you don't want

   11:04  2   identity theft, so I shred all of my mail.  Again, if I --

   11:04  3   but -- but I never print the documents out to begin with,

   11:05  4   so -- now, I used to get -- before I went paperless, I

   11:05  5   used to get the documents mailed to me.  That -- I'm not

   11:05  6   sure if it was monthly or quarterly statements.  It got to

   11:05  7   the point where I had piles and piles and piles of it.

   11:05  8                  So before I went paperless, yes, I had

   11:05  9   destroyed my statements, because I put them through the

   11:05 10   shredder.

   11:05 11        Q.   When did you go paperless?

   11:05 12        A.   Quite a while ago.  A lot -- when did I go

   11:05 13   paperless?  Probably about five or six years ago.

   11:05 14        Q.   Okay.

   11:05 15        A.   Because I ended up having -- you know, I had a

   11:05 16   stack like this.  It was ridiculous.

   11:06 17        Q.   So sitting here today, just so we're clear,

   11:06 18   you're not aware of any documents that you destroyed since

   11:06 19   2016 concerning Walgreens or Rite Aid?

   11:06 20        A.   Yes, I'm not -- I'm not aware of that.

   11:06 21        Q.   Okay.

   11:06 22                  MS. ZALKA:  Let's mark the RFP.

   11:06 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  And we've been going for about

   11:06 24   an hour --

   11:06 25                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure.

                                                                       52



   11:06  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- whenever -- if we want to

   11:06  2   take a break now, if this is a good stopping point.

   11:06  3                  MS. ZALKA:  We could get through the

   11:06  4   RF -- I'm happy to take a break now if you'd like to take

   11:06  5   a break.

   11:06  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  It's up to you.

   11:06  7                  THE WITNESS:  Let's go.

   11:06  8                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

   11:06  9                  MS. ZALKA:  We can take a break very

   11:06 10   shortly.

   11:06 11        A.   What's an RFP?

   11:06 12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   It's a -- it is a lawyer

   11:06 13   shorthand for request for production.  I'm about to show

   11:06 14   it to you.

   11:06 15        A.   In my area, it's a request for proposal.

   11:06 16        Q.   I know, yeah.

   11:06 17                  MR. KNOTTS:  I don't think she has any of

   11:07 18   those.

   11:07 19                  MS. ZALKA:  I do not.  I have many more

   11:07 20   RFPs that are for production.

   11:07 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I think I may have just

   11:07 22   given the game away.  But take a moment.  This has been

   11:07 23   marked as Exhibit 18.

   11:07 24                  (Exhibit 18 marked.)

   11:07 25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And you can just let me know

                                                                       53



   11:07  1   when you're ready.

   11:07  2        A.   Okay.

   11:07  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  18 is in there?

   11:07  4                  MS. ZALKA:  I think we premarked all of

   11:07  5   them.

   11:07  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

   11:08  7        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   11:08  8                  Okay.

   11:08  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you recognize this document?

   11:08 10        A.   I think I recognize this document.

   11:08 11        Q.   What is it?

   11:08 12        A.   Basically, it has to do with the retention of

   11:08 13   documents relating to the -- the case.  And let's see.

   11:09 14                  Yeah.  And that's -- that's what a lot of

   11:09 15   it has to do with.

   11:09 16        Q.   And, again, I'm sure Mr. Knotts will jump in.

   11:09 17   I'm not asking you for any communications that you had

   11:09 18   with your lawyers concerning this document.  I just want

   11:09 19   to know what steps did you take to collect documents that

   11:09 20   were requested for production?

   11:09 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  You can -- I think you can

   11:09 22   answer that generally.

   11:09 23        A.   Okay.  I -- I had -- I collected my financial

   11:09 24   statements, okay, through Ameritrade.  And that was for

   11:09 25   the class action period, October 2016 to June 2017.  I

                                                                       54



   11:09  1   went online trying to gather the documents.  It started

   11:09  2   getting really difficult, because I happened to go back

   11:10  3   and do the searching such a long time ago, so I had

   11:10  4   requested Ameritrade for assistance with the search of the

   11:10  5   documents, and they sent me all -- several of the

   11:10  6   documents.  And -- except for one account, which I later

   11:10  7   obtained.

   11:10  8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I'll come back to that.

   11:10  9   First, so other than the effort you just described with

   11:10 10   respect to your Ameritrade financial statements, what

   11:10 11   steps did you take to collect the documents that are

   11:10 12   requested for production?

   11:10 13                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.  Asked and answered.  So

   11:10 14   again --

   11:10 15        A.   Well, I --

   11:10 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is it anything other than the

   11:10 17   Ameritrade financial statements?

   11:10 18        A.   No.  That's it.

   11:11 19        Q.   Okay.

   11:11 20        A.   And -- and -- and leave my e-mail intact.

   11:11 21        Q.   When you say you leave your e-mail intact --

   11:11 22        A.   To leave my e-mail intact, and don't delete

   11:11 23   anything.

   11:11 24        Q.   I see.

   11:11 25        A.   I'm sort of familiar with that process, because

                                                                       55



   11:11  1   in my line of work it happens all the time with patents.

   11:11  2        Q.   So you've identified two other steps that you

   11:11  3   took in order to respond to the document request that's

   11:11  4   been marked as Exhibit 18.

   11:11  5                  The first is you collected financial

   11:11  6   statements through Ameritrade, and the second is that you

   11:11  7   left your e-mails intact.

   11:11  8        A.   Yes.  And that was -- and I was asked to do that

   11:11  9   by my attorney.

   11:11 10        Q.   Okay.  Other than those two items, did you do

   11:11 11   anything else to respond to the documents that are

   11:11 12   requested here?

   11:12 13        A.   Not to my knowledge.

   11:12 14        Q.   Okay.  Let's talk about the -- the Ameritrade

   11:12 15   financial statements collection.

   11:12 16                  You mentioned that the time period that you

   11:12 17   used was October 2016 through June 2017.  Is that

   11:12 18   accurate?

   11:12 19        A.   That was what the information that I gathered is

   11:12 20   over that period.

   11:12 21        Q.   Did you collect any financial statements between

   11:12 22   October 1, 2015, and October 1, 2016?

   11:12 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  As best as you can recall.

   11:12 24   And you may have documents on this, Counsel.

   11:12 25        A.   I may have.

                                                                       56



   11:12  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   11:12  2        A.   I can't -- I can't answer the -- 100 percent I

   11:12  3   can't answer it, but, you know, I may have gone over or

   11:13  4   under.

   11:13  5        Q.   Why don't we approach it this way then:  What

   11:13  6   was your understanding of the time period for which you

   11:13  7   should be collecting the requested Ameritrade financial

   11:13  8   statements?

   11:13  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

   11:13 10   calls for attorney/client privileged information.

   11:13 11                  So if you can answer, other than things

   11:13 12   that we have discussed, you can.  But if it involves

   11:13 13   things that we discussed, I'll instruct you not to answer.

   11:13 14        A.   Well, just that -- that's the time period of the

   11:13 15   suit.  And so that's all that I should be interested in.

   11:13 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I want to understand

   11:13 17   whether -- so let me ask it this way.

   11:13 18                  When you requested the -- your monthly

   11:13 19   financial statements from Ameritrade, did you request them

   11:13 20   for a specific time period?

   11:13 21        A.   Yes.

   11:13 22        Q.   What was that time period?

   11:13 23        A.   I believe it was the time period of October 2016

   11:14 24   to June 2017.

   11:14 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  And -- so I -- I will -- and

                                                                       57



   11:14  1   we can clarify.  I think the witness may be

   11:14  2   misremembering --

   11:14  3        A.   No, no, actually, it may have gone back.  It may

   11:14  4   have gone back to -- to maybe the first time I purchased

   11:14  5   the Rite Aid stock, it might have gone back to, now that

   11:14  6   I'm thinking about it.  I'd have to see the e-mail I sent

   11:14  7   to Ameritrade.

   11:14  8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   11:14  9        A.   There were a lot of files.  Yeah, there were so

   11:14 10   many files that it was probably beyond that period that I

   11:14 11   said.  It was probably -- it could have been gone back to

   11:14 12   the first time I purchased Rite Aid stock, now that I

   11:15 13   think about it.

   11:15 14        Q.   Is it possible that it could also have gone past

   11:15 15   June 2017?

   11:15 16        A.   It's possible.

   11:15 17        Q.   Okay.  And so you mentioned just now that given

   11:15 18   the -- essentially, the number of the documents, the

   11:15 19   volume of the documents, you think it might have been for

   11:15 20   a longer time period going back --

   11:15 21        A.   Yes.

   11:15 22        Q.   -- to the original Rite Aid transactions?

   11:15 23        A.   Yeah.  There were a lot of them.

   11:15 24        Q.   Ballpark, roughly how many, do you think?

   11:15 25        A.   Geez, 30.

                                                                       58



   11:15  1        Q.   For each account or total?

   11:15  2        A.   Total.

   11:15  3        Q.   Outside of your monthly statements, and outside

   11:16  4   of -- outside of the information or research or analysis

   11:16  5   that you get when you click on the CUSIP symbol, is there

   11:16  6   any other information that's available to you within the

   11:16  7   Ameritrade website or app, whatever you want to say, that

   11:16  8   you access concerning either Walgreens or Rite Aid?

   11:16  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  And objection to the extent it

   11:16 10   mischaracterizes his testimony about whether all of that

   11:16 11   information is available to him.

   11:16 12                  But you can answer.

   11:16 13        A.   Oh, I mean, there's -- there's -- there's

   11:16 14   different tabs you can click on, but I don't always -- I

   11:16 15   don't click on those a lot; where you can gather more

   11:16 16   information on the company and, you know, the -- including

   11:16 17   the financial statements of the company.  But I hardly

   11:16 18   ever click on it.

   11:16 19                  It also tells you who the various officers

   11:17 20   of the company.  You can -- there's a tab I think you can

   11:17 21   click on for that.  It doesn't give you, to my knowledge,

   11:17 22   any insider information.  I wish it did.

   11:17 23                  But, you know, there's an

   11:17 24   additional -- it's just like any other brokerage account,

   11:17 25   okay.  It gives you additional information on a particular

                                                                       59



   11:17  1   company.

   11:17  2                  I don't use it a lot, though.  I --

   11:17  3   I'm mainly -- I mainly read the news about the company.

   11:17  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Between 2016 -- between October

   11:17  5   2015 and the end of 2017, do you recall ever clicking on

   11:17  6   any of the other tabs that you just mentioned, concerning

   11:17  7   the financial statements or the officers of the company --

   11:17  8        A.   I don't --

   11:18  9        Q.   -- with respect to Rite Aid or Walgreens?

   11:18 10        A.   I don't recall clicking on it.

   11:18 11        Q.   Putting aside the Ameritrade framework, do you

   11:18 12   ever recall reviewing the financial statements of

   11:18 13   Walgreens or Rite Aid in that time period?

   11:18 14        A.   I don't recall reviewing the financial

   11:18 15   statements.

   11:18 16        Q.   And do you recall reviewing any earnings calls

   11:18 17   by either Rite Aid or Walgreens in 2016 and 2017?

   11:18 18        A.   I only -- as far as that goes, I -- there's been

   11:18 19   -- there were various press releases that they talked

   11:18 20   about the earning -- earning things.

   11:18 21                  THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry; earning what?

   11:19 22                  THE WITNESS:  The earning calls; there were

   11:19 23   various press releases that talked about it from different

   11:19 24   financial agencies or news -- news casting.  Maybe

   11:19 25   Bloomberg or something like that.

                                                                       60



   11:19  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you recall reviewing any

   11:19  2   press releases by -- issued by Rite Aid or Walgreens

   11:19  3   themselves?

   11:19  4        A.   Well, I -- one of the reasons that I held onto

   11:19  5   my stock was it gave -- yes, I do.  It gave the indication

   11:19  6   that the deal would go through and it would be smooth

   11:19  7   sailing through the Federal Trade Commission.

   11:19  8        Q.   So it's your testimony that you recall reviewing

   11:19  9   a press release issued by which company?

   11:19 10        A.   Walgreens.

   11:19 11        Q.   Okay.  So it's your testimony that you recall

   11:20 12   reviewing a press release issued by Walgreens that gave

   11:20 13   the implication that the deal would go through and that it

   11:20 14   would be smooth sailing through the Federal Trade

   11:20 15   Commission.

   11:20 16                  How many press releases?

   11:20 17        A.   There were more than one.  And, you know, the

   11:20 18   smooth sailing might have been on another press release.

   11:20 19   I do remember saying that they had inside information or

   11:20 20   they had a very -- you know, they -- they -- they've

   11:20 21   worked with the Federal Trade Commission in the past and

   11:20 22   they had inside contacts there, sort of.  I got that

   11:20 23   impression, that -- that was my interpretation.  And that

   11:21 24   they had a good relationship with the Federal Trade

   11:21 25   Commission.  And I thought that -- I interpreted several

                                                                       61



   11:21  1   of the press releases as if the deal would go through.

   11:21  2                  If I didn't, I would have sold my RAD

   11:21  3   stock.

   11:21  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  And RAD is just capital R,

   11:21  5   capital A, capital D.

   11:21  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   How many press releases --

   11:21  7        A.   Oh, I --

   11:21  8        Q.   -- do you recall reviewing that were issued by

   11:21  9   Walgreens?

   11:21 10        A.   That's hard to say.  I can't give you that

   11:21 11   answer, how many press releases.  There was more than one.

   11:21 12        Q.   More than one and less than five?

   11:21 13        A.   Yeah.

   11:21 14        Q.   Okay.  Outside of those between one to five

   11:22 15   press releases, did you review any other disclosures

   11:22 16   by -- issued by Walgreens during 2016 and 2017?

   11:22 17        A.   No, not to -- not to that extent.  All I was

   11:22 18   doing was monitoring through the news releases how the

   11:22 19   acquisition was going.  And then come to find out that

   11:22 20   the -- I thought that they would have taken it all the way

   11:22 21   to the end, where the Federal Trade Commission would

   11:22 22   actually make a decision formally on whether or not the

   11:22 23   deal would go through; but, instead, they bailed out of it

   11:22 24   before there was even a formal decision made by the

   11:23 25   Federal Trade Commission.

                                                                       62



   11:23  1        Q.   Did you review any transcripts of earnings calls

   11:23  2   by Walgreens in 2016 and 2017?

   11:23  3        A.   I -- I read quotes in news articles based on

   11:23  4   those, but I don't remember reading anything, per se,

   11:23  5   directly from the earnings call.

   11:23  6        Q.   Okay.  Did you review any SEC filings by

   11:23  7   Walgreens in 2016 and 2017?

   11:23  8        A.   Not to my knowledge.

   11:23  9        Q.   Did you review any SEC filings by Rite Aid?

   11:23 10        A.   Not to my knowledge.

   11:24 11        Q.   Did you review any transcripts of earnings calls

   11:24 12   by Rite Aid in 2016 and 2017?

   11:24 13        A.   Not to my knowledge.

   11:24 14        Q.   So you reviewed Walgreens trans -- so you -- so

   11:24 15   sorry, correct?

   11:24 16                  Did you review news articles?

   11:24 17        A.   Yes.

   11:24 18        Q.   As you -- let me strike that.

   11:24 19                  With respect to press releases, you've

   11:24 20   testified that you reviewed between one and potentially

   11:24 21   five press releases that were actually issued by Walgreens

   11:24 22   in 2016 and 2017, correct?

   11:24 23        A.   Yes.

   11:24 24        Q.   Same question with respect to press releases

   11:24 25   issued by Rite Aid:  How many, if any, press releases

                                                                       63



   11:24  1   issued by Rite Aid in 2016 and 2017 did you review?

   11:24  2        A.   You know, I mean, as far as press releases, I

   11:24  3   don't know, maybe no more than five actual press releases.

   11:25  4        Q.   Okay.  Other than the press releases you just

   11:25  5   testified to that were issued by Rite Aid or Walgreens

   11:25  6   that you recall potentially reviewing in 2016 and 2017,

   11:25  7   and outside of the news articles generally that may have

   11:25  8   touched upon Walgreens and Rite Aid, are there any other

   11:25  9   sources of information or disclosures that you recall

   11:25 10   reviewing concerning Walgreens and Rite Aid in 2016 and

   11:25 11   2017?

   11:25 12        A.   No.

   11:25 13        Q.   Did you save any of the press releases?

   11:25 14        A.   No.

   11:25 15        Q.   Would it be possible to determine which press

   11:25 16   releases you reviewed?

   11:25 17        A.   No, it's -- it would be difficult.  I mean,

   11:26 18   I -- I do remember press releases, you know, and like I

   11:26 19   said, stating that the -- they felt that the merger would

   11:26 20   go through and would be successful.

   11:26 21                  That's what I remember reading.  And if you

   11:26 22   ask me when -- what date it was, I have no idea what date

   11:26 23   it was.

   11:26 24        Q.   When you said that the press releases stated

   11:26 25   that they felt that the merger would go through and would

                                                                       64



   11:26  1   be successful, are you referring to the press release that

   11:26  2   was issued by Walgreens or a news article?

   11:26  3        A.   Walgreens.

   11:26  4        Q.   And same question with respect to Rite Aid, the

   11:26  5   between one and five press releases issued by Rite Aid

   11:26  6   that you recall reviewing, did they also state, similarly,

   11:26  7   that the merger would go through?

   11:26  8        A.   I don't remember reading anything that -- to

   11:27  9   that extent for Rite Aid, but later on I read where Rite

   11:27 10   Aid was saying that the merger may not go through.  Later

   11:27 11   on.

   11:27 12        Q.   When was that?

   11:27 13        A.   Later on in -- I don't know the date.  It was a

   11:27 14   couple of months be -- it was prior to -- I believe it was

   11:27 15   prior to when they ended up having to formulate another

   11:27 16   plan to divest the -- to go from, I think it was $9 a

   11:27 17   share to $7 a share or $6.50 a share.

   11:27 18                  It was -- they felt that they weren't going

   11:28 19   to get the approval by the Federal Trade Commission, so

   11:28 20   they lowered the expectations on -- prior to that, I

   11:28 21   thought they would get the approval.  And they were

   11:28 22   working towards getting the approval, from what I say,

   11:28 23   based on the -- Fred's was going to buy 380 of their

   11:28 24   stores, of Rite Aid stores.

   11:28 25                  So they were trying to sell some of the

                                                                       65



   11:28  1   assets, which made sense to me.  And then Fred's was also

   11:28  2   willing to take on more stores if the Federal Trade

   11:28  3   Commission came in and said, you have to sell more stores

   11:28  4   in order for this merger to go through.

   11:29  5                  And then it started looking like it wasn't

   11:29  6   going to -- may not happen, but it still gave, you

   11:29  7   know -- there was still hope and gave indication that it

   11:29  8   was still going to happen.  But I can't recall the time or

   11:29  9   the dates when I -- when I read those things.

   11:29 10        Q.   So I think you said that you recall reading

   11:29 11   where Rite Aid was saying that the merger may not go

   11:29 12   through.

   11:29 13                  Do you recall that testimony?

   11:29 14        A.   Yes.

   11:29 15        Q.   Okay.  And then I think you said that that was,

   11:29 16   quote, you said, I think it was when the $9 to $7 a share,

   11:29 17   went to $6.50 a share, they didn't feel they were going to

   11:29 18   get approval by the Federal Trade Commission?

   11:29 19        A.   To my knowledge, that's when I think -- it was

   11:29 20   when I read that.

   11:30 21        Q.   Okay.

   11:30 22        A.   I could be wrong.

   11:30 23        Q.   When did you first start to think that

   11:30 24   they -- when did you first start to understand that they

   11:30 25   may not get FTC approval?

                                                                       66



   11:30  1        A.   When I read -- and don't quote me on the time or

   11:30  2   the date -- when I read a Bloomberg article.  But I

   11:30  3   was -- had hopes because Walgreens had a special

   11:30  4   relationship with the FTC, and if there was any issues,

   11:30  5   that they would formally announce that there was issues,

   11:30  6   and I don't remember seeing that.

   11:30  7        Q.   So you recall that after you read the Bloomberg

   11:30  8   article, you understood that they may not get FTC

   11:31  9   approval?

   11:31 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, misstates the

   11:31 11   testimony.

   11:31 12                  Go ahead.

   11:31 13        A.   Well --

   11:31 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You can answer to the extent

   11:31 15   you want to clarify.

   11:31 16        A.   Without giving up something, such as selling

   11:31 17   additional stores, things -- things of that sort, I

   11:31 18   thought -- I thought the merger was going to go through --

   11:31 19   all the way to the end.  I thought they were going to wait

   11:31 20   until there was an official announcement by the Federal

   11:31 21   Trade Commission, okay, and not formulate another plan,

   11:31 22   okay, which was Walgreens to buy, I don't know what

   11:31 23   percentage -- it was almost 50 percent of the Rite Aid

   11:31 24   stores, and thereby cutting the company in half, just

   11:32 25   about.  And I was very surprised about that.

                                                                       67



   11:32  1                  Then that's when I started really getting

   11:32  2   concerned about the stock.

   11:32  3        Q.   So you started to get really concerned about the

   11:32  4   stock when?

   11:32  5        A.   When they formulated the -- their last plan that

   11:32  6   they had, okay, which was to purchase -- I don't know the

   11:32  7   number of stores, but it was a significant amount, maybe

   11:32  8   even 50 per -- 40 or 50 percent of the Rite Aid stores.

   11:32  9   Thereby cutting Rite Aid in half, the company -- literally

   11:32 10   cutting it in half.  And then without shareholder

   11:32 11   approval.

   11:32 12                  And I'm not quite sure how that happened.

   11:32 13   It cut a company in half, but the shareholders don't have

   11:32 14   a chance to vote on it.

   11:32 15        Q.   What's your experience in connection with FTC's

   11:33 16   review of proposed mergers?

   11:33 17        A.   I have very little.  The only experience I have

   11:33 18   is listening to Bloomberg radio on XM Satellite.  I know

   11:33 19   enough to be dangerous.

   11:33 20        Q.   Okay.

   11:33 21                  MS. ZALKA:  We can take a break now if you

   11:33 22   want.

   11:33 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Works for me.

   11:33 24                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  Do you want to just take

   11:33 25   10 minutes --

                                                                       68



   11:33  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Sure.

   11:33  2                  MS. ZALKA:  -- is that good for you?

   11:47 10   loop on the document requests, which is Exhibit 18.

   11:47 11                  Other than Ameritrade, have you contacted

   11:47 12   any other third parties regarding responding to these

   11:47 13   document requests?

   11:47 14        A.   No.

   11:47 15        Q.   Okay.  And are you aware of any documents or

   11:47 16   information regarding your investments in Rite Aid or

   11:47 17   Walgreens that you didn't provide to your counsel in

   11:47 18   response to request for production?

   11:47 19        A.   No.

   11:47 20        Q.   Are you -- did you do any search of your

   11:47 21   computer to locate documents responsive to this request?

   11:47 22        A.   No.

   11:47 23        Q.   Did you provide a copy of your computer files to

   11:48 25        A.   I did not provide a copy of my computer files.

                                                                       69



   11:48  1        Q.   Are you aware sitting here today of any effort

   11:48  2   to search your electronic files, other than e-mail, for

   11:48  3   documents in connection with this request?

   11:48  4        A.   No, it's only my e-mails at this point.

   11:48  5        Q.   Okay.  I am going to hand you what has been

   11:48  6   marked as Exhibits 2 through 17.  You can take a minute to

   11:48  7   look through those.

   11:48  8                  MS. ZALKA:  I'll give a copy to counsel.

   11:48  9   They're in order.

   11:48 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Thanks.

   11:48 11                  (Exhibits 2 through 17 marked.)

   11:49 12        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   11:50 13                  MS. ZALKA:  I think actually if I just list

   11:50 14   the dates that correspond to each exhibit for clarity for

   11:50 15   what we're going to go through?

   11:50 16                  MR. KNOTTS:  Sure.

   11:50 17                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  So I'm just going to

   11:50 18   read into the record.

   11:50 19                  So Exhibit 2 is the Ameritrade account

   11:50 20   statement for the account ending 3791 for January 2016.

   11:50 21                  Exhibit 3 is the Americade -- Ameritrade

   11:50 22   account statement for account number 3791 for October

   11:50 23   2016.

   11:50 24                  And Exhibit 4 is the Ameritrade account

   11:50 25   statement, 3791, for November 2016.

                                                                       70



   11:50  1                  Exhibit 5 is the Ameritrade account

   11:50  2   statement, account number 3791, for December '16.

   11:50  3                  Exhibit 6 is the account statement, same

   11:50  4   account, 3791, for January 2017.

   11:50  5                  And Exhibit 7 is the same monthly account

   11:50  6   statement for February 2017.

   11:50  7                  Exhibit 8 is the same monthly account

   11:50  8   statement for March 2017.

   11:51  9                  Exhibit 9 is the same monthly account

   11:51 10   statement for April 2017.

   11:51 11                  Exhibit 10 is the monthly account statement

   11:51 12   for May 2017.

   11:51 13                  Exhibit 11 is for June 2017.

   11:51 14                  Exhibit 12 is for July 2017.

   11:51 15                  Exhibit 13 is for August 2017.

   11:51 16                  Exhibit 14 is for September 2017.

   11:51 17                  Exhibits 2 through 14 reflect the account

   11:51 18   statements for 3791 -- the account number ending in 3791.

   11:51 19        A.   Okay.

   11:51 20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is Exhibit 2 through 14 copies

   11:51 21   of your monthly account statements for your Ameritrade

   11:51 22   account ending in 3791?

   11:51 23        A.   Yes.

   11:51 24        Q.   Now, you also have an account ending 6684; is

   11:52 25   that correct?

                                                                       71



   11:52  1        A.   I do.

   11:52  2        Q.   What is the difference between the 6684 account

   11:52  3   and the 3791 account?

   11:52  4        A.   Okay.  I believe the 3791 account is my main

   11:52  5   Ameritrade account, completely taxable; and the account

   11:52  6   6684 is the Roth IRA account.

   11:52  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  And now that we're getting

   11:52  8   into this sort of stuff, we'll mark the transcript

   11:53  9   confidential under the protective order.

   11:53 10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   The -- if you take a look at

   11:53 11   Exhibits 15 and 16 are account statements for your 6684

   11:53 12   account; is that correct?

   11:53 13        A.   6684 -- yes, 6684.

   11:53 14        Q.   And Exhibit 15 is for January 2016?

   11:53 15        A.   Yes.

   11:53 16        Q.   And Exhibit 16 is for June 2017?

   11:53 17        A.   Yes.

   11:53 18        Q.   Why were your monthly account statements for

   11:53 19   6684 for all the other months not produced?

   11:53 20        A.   Okay.  I had put a request through Ameritrade to

   11:54 21   gather the information for me, and I had put down the

   11:54 22   period that I needed and I put down what accounts.

   11:54 23   Evidently what they did is they didn't provide all the

   11:54 24   information.

   11:54 25        Q.   Did you do anything to check whether or not you

                                                                       72



   11:54  1   were provided all of the information that had been

   11:54  2   requested?

   11:54  3        A.   I did a quick -- I did a quick search, and there

   11:54  4   was actually one account that they left out altogether, my

   11:54  5   IRA; not my Roth IRA, but my IRA.  And that was discovered

   11:54  6   later on.

   11:54  7        Q.   All right.  Let's first focus on the Roth IRA

   11:54  8   account, the 6684.

   11:54  9                  MS. ZALKA:  Counsel, we're going to call

   11:54 10   for production of the monthly account statements that are

   11:54 11   responsive to defendant's request for production for the

   11:54 12   account 6684 for the full time period.

   11:54 13                  MR. KNOTTS:  And he just said that he

   11:55 14   produced what TD Ameritrade sent to him, so he's produced

   11:55 15   everything that he has.

   11:55 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You can access these accounts

   11:55 17   on your -- like on the website or the app, correct?

   11:55 18        A.   I -- I would have -- yeah, I guess I can.  I

   11:55 19   can, but they don't make it easy for you.

   11:55 20        Q.   Unfortunately, that's not a --

   11:55 21        A.   Right.

   11:55 22        Q.   -- a --

   11:55 23        A.   That's why I had requested it.

   11:55 24                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm going to call for

   11:55 25   production of responses that are within his custody and

                                                                       73



   11:55  1   control --

   11:55  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  He just said it's not easy to

   11:55  3   access that material.  We've produced everything that TD

   11:55  4   Ameritrade has sent to him based on his multiple requests.

   11:55  5                  MS. ZALKA:  Are you refusing to produce

   11:55  6   them?

   11:55  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  I mean, we'll take your

   11:55  8   request under consideration.  But, again, he's asked for

   11:55  9   the documents, TD Ameritrade has sent him this material,

   11:55 10   and he's given it to you.

   11:55 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   The monthly account statements

   11:56 12   for 6684 would -- between October 20 -- between January

   11:56 13   2016 and September 2017, would reflect information

   11:56 14   concerning your holdings and Rite Aid stock, correct?

   11:56 15        A.   Yes.

   11:56 16        Q.   Are your monthly account statements currently

   11:56 17   accessible to you if you go into your Ameritrade and just

   11:56 18   click on the month?

   11:56 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  For what time period?

   11:56 20                  MS. ZALKA:  The time period I just

   11:56 21   mentioned in my question.

   11:56 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  The previous question?

   11:56 23                  MS. ZALKA:  Yeah.

   11:56 24        A.   I can access my accounts online.

   11:56 25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Including your monthly account

                                                                       74



   11:56  1   statements?

   11:56  2        A.   Yes.

   11:56  3        Q.   So am I correct that you could simply log on to

   11:56  4   your account, click on the account number and then click

   11:56  5   on the month, download the statement?

   11:56  6        A.   Well, it's a few more clicks.  But...

   11:56  7        Q.   A couple more clicks, but yes?

   11:56  8        A.   Yes, I can -- I can monotonously get to it,

   11:57  9   even -- one of the biggest problems that they have is you

   11:57 10   have to -- you have to change the name.  When you click on

   11:57 11   it, it always gives the same name.  So you actually have

   11:57 12   to go in and rename what you're saving.

   11:57 13                  But -- I'm just looking here.  Six, cash,

   11:57 14   stocks -- let's see --

   11:57 15                  (Witness reviews document.)

   11:57 16                  Okay.  Are all these -- are these monthly

   11:58 17   statements?  It looks to be monthly statements.  Yeah,

   11:58 18   okay.

   11:58 19        Q.   Is there another kind of statement that you

   11:58 20   receive or have access to, other than monthly?

   11:58 21        A.   I'm not sure if there's quarterly statements or

   11:58 22   not, but my -- I don't think -- I don't think there is.  I

   11:58 23   know there's annual -- there's an annual one for tax

   11:58 24   purposes that -- that gives you, you know, everything,

   11:58 25   including if there's any wash sales.

                                                                       75



   11:58  1        Q.   What did you mean by "wash sales"?

   11:58  2        A.   Basically, if you purchase a stock -- you

   11:58  3   can't -- you can't sell a stock for a loss and then

   11:58  4   repurchase it back within a 30-day period.  That's -- I

   11:59  5   think that's my understanding of it; otherwise, you can't

   11:59  6   use that for a tax deduction.

   11:59  7        Q.   Okay.  So other than monthly account statements

   11:59  8   and the annual kind of tax statement, is there any other

   11:59  9   type of statement that you have access to?

   11:59 10        A.   No, not that I am aware of.

   11:59 11        Q.   Okay.  Now, you mentioned there was a third

   11:59 12   account that you realized later on that hadn't been

   11:59 13   provided; is that correct?

   11:59 14        A.   Yes.

   11:59 15        Q.   When did you realize that?

   11:59 16        A.   About a month ago, maybe.

   11:59 17        Q.   Okay.  And how did you come to realize that a

   11:59 18   month ago?

   11:59 19        A.   My attorney mentioned it, I believe.

   12:00 20        Q.   Was that --

   12:00 21        A.   What that --

   12:00 22        Q.   -- the account number 6700?

   12:00 23        A.   I don't know.  I don't --

   12:00 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  I mean, divulges any

   12:00 25   communications -- you -- but --

                                                                       76



   12:00  1        A.   I may be mistaken.

   12:00  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What account number is the

   12:00  3   account you realized --

   12:00  4        A.   I don't know the number off the top of my head.

   12:00  5        Q.   Okay.  Why don't you take a look at Exhibit 17.

   12:00  6        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   12:01  7                  Yeah.  That's my rollover IRA.  That's the

   12:01  8   one.  So maybe I did provide it.  I didn't go through --

   12:01  9        Q.   Do you also have access to the monthly

   12:01 10   statements for your rollover IRA account?

   12:01 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

   12:01 12   mischaracterizes his earlier testimony about access.

   12:01 13                  But go ahead.

   12:01 14        A.   I have access to my statements.

   12:01 15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So am I correct that you

   12:01 16   then have access to the monthly account statements for the

   12:01 17   roll -- the rollover IRA account ending in 6700?

   12:01 18        A.   Yes.

   12:01 19        Q.   Did you undertake an effort to collect those

   12:01 20   monthly account statements in connection with this

   12:01 21   litigation?

   12:01 22        A.   I did not look at every document that Ameritrade

   12:02 23   produced.  And I was under the assumption that all three

   12:02 24   accounts that were in there and that they had fulfilled my

   12:02 25   request.  But, evidently, they didn't.

                                                                       77



   12:02  1        Q.   When did you realize -- your realization with

   12:02  2   respect to the rollover IRA account that happened about a

   12:02  3   month ago --

   12:02  4        A.   Yeah.

   12:02  5        Q.   -- did you realize at any point before today

   12:02  6   that you had not been provided with or produced the full

   12:02  7   set of monthly account statements for reflecting your

   12:02  8   transactions in Rite Aid stock for your other two anthems?

   12:02  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.  And to the

   12:02 10   extent it misstates earlier testimony.

   12:02 11                  But go ahead.

   12:02 12        A.   Well, later on I realized there was a deficit in

   12:02 13   the number of documents that -- that I provided.

   12:02 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   12:02 15        A.   Which I can provide at any time.

   12:03 16        Q.   Okay.  So you realized there was a deficit in

   12:03 17   the number of documents that you provided and that you

   12:03 18   could provide those at any time.

   12:03 19                  When did you first realize there was a

   12:03 20   deficit in the number of documents that you provided?

   12:03 21        A.   Couple of months ago.

   12:03 22        Q.   And what was the nature of the deficit that you

   12:03 23   identified?

   12:03 24        A.   That there -- all the documents weren't there.

   12:03 25        Q.   When you say, All the documents weren't there,

                                                                       78



   12:03  1   are you referring to the monthly statements or something

   12:03  2   else?

   12:03  3        A.   I don't know, it must have -- it might have -- I

   12:03  4   don't know when it was.  I don't know what time it

   12:03  5   actually was.  What -- you know, a month ago or -- but I

   12:03  6   know that the majority of the statements that were

   12:03  7   provided, because I looked later on in my account, under

   12:04  8   the e-mail, and I noticed that the majority of the

   12:04  9   statements were out of my main account, and I later

   12:04 10   realized, looking at the e-mails, that not all of the

   12:04 11   information was there, as far as -- I didn't think I

   12:04 12   needed to produce all of the information because, over the

   12:04 13   period, if you look at the number of shares purchased over

   12:04 14   the period, you will see that the purchase -- if I, let's

   12:04 15   say, purchased 750 shares at the beginning, I still had

   12:04 16   750 shares at the end.  I didn't think I had to collect

   12:04 17   everything in between.

   12:04 18        Q.   So did you understand, in connection with

   12:04 19   responding to defendant's request for documents, that you

   12:05 20   did not have to produce unique documents that concerned

   12:05 21   your transactions in Rite Aid?

   12:05 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

   12:05 23                  To the extent it calls for attorney/client

   12:05 24   privileged information, don't discuss anything that we've

   12:05 25   talked about.  But if you understand the question, you can

                                                                       79



   12:05  1   answer.

   12:05  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you say, I didn't think I

   12:05  3   had to collect everything in between, what did you mean?

   12:05  4        A.   I -- I came up to that conclusion myself.

   12:05  5        Q.   And what exactly was that conclusion?

   12:05  6        A.   Just of the redundant nature of having so many

   12:05  7   documents basically say the same thing.  The number of

   12:05  8   shares I purchased still remains the same, because I

   12:05  9   didn't sell any.

   12:06 10                  So I purchased shares.  I didn't sell

   12:06 11   anything; so the beginning and the end, the number of

   12:06 12   shares I own would still be the same.

   12:06 13        Q.   Roughly how many documents did you not provide

   12:06 14   because of that understanding?

   12:06 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

   12:06 16        A.   I don't know.  I mean -- I don't know.  If

   12:06 17   that's the case, then I would have to go back and produce

   12:06 18   a monthly statement like what was produced for the main

   12:06 19   account, and that was not done on my half.

   12:06 20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Am I correct, though, that your

   12:06 21   monthly statements in your rollover IRA account ending in

   12:06 22   6700 and your Roth IRA account ending in 6684, for which

   12:06 23   you did not produce the monthly statements during the

   12:06 24   relevant time period, that those did actually reflect

   12:07 25   information concerning your transactions in Rite Aid every

                                                                       80



   12:07  1   month, correct?

   12:07  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well, objection to form.

   12:07  3   Misstates evidence.

   12:07  4        A.   There's no transaction; it's only the

   12:07  5   fluctuation of the stock price.

   12:07  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So let's ask this:  Did

   12:07  7   your monthly account statements for those two accounts

   12:07  8   reflect information concerning your holdings in Rite Aid

   12:07  9   stock?

   12:07 10        A.   They do reflect my holdings in Rite Aid stock --

   12:07 11        Q.   And that information would change --

   12:07 12        A.   -- which is constant.

   12:07 13        Q.   Would the market value be constant?

   12:07 14        A.   Of course not.

   12:07 15        Q.   Okay.  So, would the cost basis be constant?

   12:07 16        A.   No.

   12:07 17        Q.   Would the average cost be constant?

   12:07 18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

   12:07 19        A.   The av -- what do you mean by the "average

   12:07 20   cost"?  The -- I mean, the cost that I pay for them would

   12:07 21   be constant.

   12:07 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you see -- so there would be

   12:07 23   unique information concerning your holdings in Rite Aid

   12:07 24   stock that appears on each of your monthly statements,

   12:07 25   correct?

                                                                       81



   12:08  1        A.   Yes, that information changes on a

   12:08  2   minute-to-minute basis.

   12:08  3                  MS. ZALKA:  Counsel, I call for production

   12:08  4   of monthly statements that Mr. Dayton has access to that

   12:08  5   reflects his holdings and transactions in Rite Aid stock,

   12:08  6   and each of the accounts at Ameritrade in which he held

   12:08  7   Rite Aid stock during the period for which you've agreed

   12:08  8   to produce responsive documents.

   12:08  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  We'll take your request under

   12:08 10   -- under advisement.  And I'll note that you haven't

   12:08 11   raised an issue on this prior to the deposition today.

   12:08 12   You've had -- had his trading records.  But we'll take a

   12:08 13   look at it and see what he can access and is required to

   12:08 14   produce under the rules and the agreements.

   12:08 15                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  Well, with respect to

   12:08 16   the rollover IRA account, I would note that the first and

   12:08 17   only -- the one and only account statement for that

   12:08 18   account that you produced was produced last night.  And

   12:08 19   with respect to the Roth IRA account, which ends in 6684,

   12:09 20   you produced also an additional account statement last

   12:09 21   night, and otherwise only produced one.

   12:09 22                  So with -- in that regard, in any event,

   12:09 23   you can, obviously, let us know whether or not you're

   12:09 24   going to produce the documents that are clearly responsive

   12:09 25   to the request.

                                                                       82



   12:09  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well, but, again, he's made

   12:09  2   multiple requests to TD Ameritrade.  He's sent you

   12:09  3   everything that they have sent to him.  You guys have

   12:09  4   everything that we have.  But, again, we'll -- we'll

   12:09  5   certainly consider your request.

   12:09  6                  MS. ZALKA:  We'll be keeping the deposition

   12:09  7   open until resolution of this request.

   12:09  8                  MR. KNOTTS:  And again, we can,

   12:09  9   obviously -- obviously object to that, but --

   12:09 10                  MS. ZALKA:  We can talk about it.

   12:09 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  There's no additional

   12:09 12   information that you don't already have in those

   12:09 13   documents.

   12:09 14                  MS. ZALKA:  You haven't see -- have you

   12:09 15   seen the documents?

   12:09 16                  MR. KNOTTS:  No, but as the witness

   12:09 17   testified, he didn't have additional transactions and his

   12:09 18   holdings didn't --

   12:09 19                  MS. ZALKA:  I think now you're just

   12:10 20   testifying, Mr. Knotts.

   12:10 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Mr. Dayton, let's change

   12:10 22   gears a little bit.

   12:10 23                  How did you get involved in this action?

   12:10 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  You can answer.  And just

   12:10 25   remember that -- not to discuss attorney/client

                                                                       83



   12:10  1   discussions.

   12:10  2        A.   I was reading, I think it was either the Rite

   12:10  3   Aid or Walgreens news, and I saw something in there

   12:10  4   basically about a possible class action lawsuit, and I was

   12:10  5   interested in participating because of my losses, and for

   12:11  6   an opportunity to try to recover some of my losses.

   12:11  7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When was that?

   12:11  8        A.   I -- I don't know.  I don't know what date that

   12:11  9   was.

   12:11 10        Q.   Kind of roughly, I guess, can you tell me the

   12:11 11   year?

   12:11 12        A.   It was a couple years ago.  I -- I don't know

   12:11 13   the exact date.

   12:11 14        Q.   Um --

   12:11 15        A.   It was -- obviously, it was after the deal fell

   12:11 16   apart, but it might not have been too far after.  And if

   12:11 17   you asked me the date that the deal fell apart, I can't

   12:11 18   give that to you either.

   12:11 19        Q.   Okay.  Before "the deal fell apart," in your

   12:12 20   words, did you contemplate suing Rite Aid or Walgreens

   12:12 21   concerning the deal?

   12:12 22        A.   Well, I was -- I was not happy about it, and so

   12:12 23   I was hoping that there would be a class action lawsuit.

   12:12 24   Not necessarily that I would be part of it, but that there

   12:12 25   would be one.

                                                                       84



   12:12  1        Q.   Why did you hope that there would be a class

   12:12  2   action lawsuit before the deal fell apart?

   12:12  3        A.   No, not before.

   12:12  4        Q.   So my question was --

   12:12  5        A.   No, after.

   12:12  6        Q.   So my question to you was:  Before the deal fell

   12:12  7   apart --

   12:12  8        A.   No.

   12:12  9        Q.   -- did you contemplate suing Rite Aid or

   12:12 10   Walgreens --

   12:12 11        A.   No.

   12:12 12        Q.   -- concerning any aspect of the deal?

   12:12 13        A.   No, not at all.  I was hopeful that merger was

   12:12 14   going to go through, which is why I retained my stock.

   12:13 15   Otherwise, I would have liquidated the account,

   12:13 16   the -- well, my stock holdings.

   12:13 17                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Can we take a quick

   12:13 18   break?  I need to fix -- I have a slight issue here.

   12:13 19                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure.

   12:13 20                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

   12:13 21   12:13 p.m.

   12:13 22                  (Recess in the proceedings from 12:13

   12:14 23                  to 12:14 p.m.)

   12:14 24                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

   12:14 25   12:14 p.m.

                                                                       85



   12:14  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So before, in your words, The

   12:14  2   deal fell apart, at any point did you contemplate bringing

   12:15  3   any claim against Rite Aid or Walgreens concerning any

   12:15  4   aspect of the merger?

   12:15  5        A.   No.  Not before.

   12:15  6        Q.   Okay.  When did you first talk to a lawyer in

   12:15  7   connection with claims against either Rite Aid or

   12:15  8   Walgreens related to the deal?

   12:15  9        A.   It was when I saw the article in the news, call

   12:15 10   this number, and I called the number.

   12:15 11        Q.   Do you recall roughly --

   12:15 12        A.   No, I don't know --

   12:15 13        Q.   -- when that was?

   12:15 14        A.   No, I don't.

   12:15 15        Q.   Even just by virtue of a year time frame; was it

   12:15 16   this year, last year, year before?

   12:15 17        A.   No, it wasn't -- it wasn't too long after the

   12:15 18   deal fell apart, and the announcement was made that Rite

   12:16 19   Aid would be selling several -- you know, half of the

   12:16 20   stores, or whatever the number was to Walgreens, you know,

   12:16 21   it could have been months after that, but I don't

   12:16 22   know -- I don't know the exact date when that happened.

   12:16 23                  It's -- it's not clear in my head the exact

   12:16 24   date.  All I can tell you is it was after things were in a

   12:16 25   very bad situation.

                                                                       86



   12:16  1        Q.   Was it a matter of months after the deal around

   12:16  2   the merger announcement?

   12:16  3        A.   It could have been.  It could have been.  It

   12:16  4   could have been.

   12:16  5        Q.   So I want your best recollection, not kind of a

   12:16  6   hypothetical.  So the question is --

   12:16  7        A.   I'm sorry; I --

   12:16  8        Q.   And I understand if you can't give specifics,

   12:17  9   but what I'm trying to understand is what is your best

   12:17 10   recollection and understanding of how many months after

   12:17 11   the deal fell apart, to use your words, did you first

   12:17 12   contemplate taking legal action?

   12:17 13        A.   I don't know; two or three months.  But, again,

   12:17 14   it's just a guess.  And you can't hold me to it, because

   12:17 15   it was just a guess.

   12:17 16        Q.   Could it have been a year?

   12:17 17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   12:17 18        A.   I don't -- I'm not sure.  I don't think it was

   12:17 19   that -- I don't think it was a year.  I think it was under

   12:17 20   a year.

   12:17 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why don't you think it was over

   12:17 22   a year?

   12:17 23        A.   Because it -- to me it seems like it -- I don't

   12:17 24   think I waited an entire year before contacting the

   12:18 25   telephone -- before calling that -- the number that was in

                                                                       87



   12:18  1   the news.  I don't think I waited a whole year.

   12:18  2        Q.   Why don't you think you waited an entire year?

   12:18  3        A.   Maybe I did, but I just -- I don't --

   12:18  4        Q.   Tell me why do you think that?

   12:18  5        A.   Because a whole year seems like a long time.

   12:18  6   But I seem to think that it came out -- the article came

   12:18  7   out prior to a year.

   12:18  8        Q.   When you say the article came out prior to the

   12:18  9   year, are you referring to the class action notice --

   12:18 10        A.   Yes.

   12:18 11        Q.   -- that you recall reviewing and calling the

   12:18 12   telephone number?

   12:18 13        A.   Yes.

   12:18 14        Q.   Okay.  When did you first believe that Walgreens

   12:19 15   had misled investors somehow?

   12:19 16        A.   Okay.  So when the -- when they didn't -- when

   12:19 17   they didn't wait for the formal announcement from the

   12:19 18   Federal Trade Commission and they decided to formulate

   12:19 19   their own deal.

   12:19 20                  I was hopeful that -- because I thought

   12:19 21   they had a special relationship, I thought that the deal

   12:19 22   would go through.

   12:19 23        Q.   Um --

   12:19 24        A.   And --

   12:19 25        Q.   Sorry; go ahead.

                                                                       88



   12:19  1        A.   If it didn't go through, that it would be a

   12:19  2   formal announcement from Walgreens.

   12:19  3        Q.   Why did you think that they had a special

   12:20  4   relationship?

   12:20  5        A.   Because I recall, to my knowledge,

   12:20  6   reading -- reading that Pessina, I believe, had mentioned

   12:20  7   that in one of the news releases.

   12:20  8        Q.   So it's your testimony --

   12:20  9        A.   So don't -- don't ask me when, because I don't

   12:20 10   have -- I don't know what the date was.

   12:20 11        Q.   So your recollection is that Mr. Pessina

   12:20 12   indicated in a press release that Walgreens had a special

   12:20 13   relationship with the FTC, which led to you believe that

   12:20 14   the deal would go through, and that when Walgreens decided

   12:20 15   they wouldn't -- that they -- in June, that the deal, the

   12:20 16   merger agreement was not going to go through, that's when

   12:21 17   you first thought that Walgreens had misled investors --

   12:21 18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, misstates

   12:21 19   testimony.  But go ahead.

   12:21 20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   -- does that accurately state

   12:21 21   your recollection and belief?

   12:21 22        A.   That's a fair statement.

   12:21 23        Q.   Thank you.  So with respect to the -- is there

   12:21 24   any other aspect, other than the special relationship

   12:21 25   statement that you mentioned, that led you to believe that

                                                                       89



   12:21  1   Walgreens had misled investors?

   12:21  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  And objection to the extent

   12:21  3   that it calls for attorney/client privileged information

   12:21  4   and discussions that we've had --

   12:21  5                  MS. ZALKA:  Yeah.  I'm not interested in

   12:21  6   anything your lawyer's told you.  I want to know what you

   12:21  7   believed.

   12:21  8                  MR. KNOTTS:  So again, I'll make my

   12:21  9   objection and my instruction about attorney/client

   12:21 10   privileged --

   12:21 11                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure.

   12:21 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- information.

   12:21 13                  So just request that you don't divulge

   12:21 14   things that we've talked about in connection with this

   12:22 15   lawsuit, but to the extent that you had an understanding

   12:22 16   coming in, by all means.

   12:22 17        A.   Well, I had an understanding that -- at the

   12:22 18   beginning, based on Wal -- Walgreens' announcement that

   12:22 19   there was no reason why the acquisition wouldn't be

   12:22 20   successful.

   12:22 21                  And as I mentioned earlier on, although

   12:22 22   it's not quoted of them saying it I thought it was smooth

   12:22 23   sailing, which is why I held on to my stock.  I wouldn't

   12:22 24   have hold (sic) on to my stock if I thought it would not

   12:22 25   be successful.

                                                                       90



   12:22  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Other than this special

   12:22  2   relationship statement that you mentioned, are there any

   12:22  3   other statements that you believe -- strike that.

   12:22  4                  So I think you've testified that you first

   12:22  5   started to think that Walgreens had misled investors when

   12:23  6   they announced the alternative to the Merger Agreement?

   12:23  7        A.   Yes.

   12:23  8        Q.   Is that correct?

   12:23  9        A.   Yes.

   12:23 10        Q.   And you've testified that you've -- at that

   12:23 11   time, you believed that Walgreens had misled investors

   12:23 12   because Mr. Pessina had made a statement about having a

   12:23 13   special relationship with the FTC?

   12:23 14        A.   I do remember that.

   12:23 15        Q.   Is there anything -- so outside of things your

   12:23 16   lawyers may have told you, I'm asking you for your actual

   12:23 17   recollection of having a reaction to those events in '17,

   12:23 18   2017.

   12:23 19                  So when you heard the news in 2017 that the

   12:23 20   merger agreement wasn't going to go forward, is there any

   12:23 21   other statement or manner in which you believe that

   12:23 22   Walgreens had misled investors at that time, other than

   12:23 23   the special relationship statement that you mentioned?

   12:23 24        A.   I just remember that -- and I don't know in how

   12:24 25   many articles it was mentioned, but all along,

                                                                       91



   12:24  1   from -- from the articles that I was reading all along, it

   12:24  2   seemed like -- all the way to the end, it seemed like it

   12:24  3   would be a successful merger.

   12:24  4        Q.   And -- go ahead.

   12:24  5        A.   All the way to the end.  And in some cases, I

   12:24  6   can't recall if it was a quote from a Walgreens executive

   12:24  7   or being a quote from the news, but I know that

   12:24  8   even -- even to the end, they were saying that the merger

   12:24  9   was going to be successful.  To my knowledge, they were

   12:24 10   saying that.  It wasn't far after that that the deal

   12:25 11   started falling through.

   12:25 12        Q.   In June of 2017, Walgreens announced an

   12:25 13   alternative to the Merger Agreement; do you recall that?

   12:25 14   Is that when the deal fell apart, in your --

   12:25 15        A.   I remember more than one alternative -- more

   12:25 16   than one plan.  Which plan are you referring to?

   12:25 17        Q.   So do you recall that in June, Walgreens

   12:25 18   announced the termination of the Merger Agreement?

   12:25 19        A.   Okay.  And -- yes, I do remember that.

   12:25 20        Q.   So maybe that will just help orient.

   12:25 21                  So I'm asking you basically your reaction

   12:25 22   at the time -- I'm not interested in what your lawyers

   12:25 23   have told you afterwards, but when you -- did you actually

   12:26 24   read that announcement when it was made on that day?

   12:26 25        A.   Yes.

                                                                       92



   12:26  1        Q.   Okay.  And so based on that announcement, what

   12:26  2   did you understand Walgreens to have misled investors

   12:26  3   about and through which statements?

   12:26  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

   12:26  5   a few times.  And I'll ask that you not talk about things

   12:26  6   that you've learned in the course of the litigation from

   12:26  7   counsel, but you can answer based on your perception at

   12:26  8   the time.

   12:26  9        A.   I felt that I was -- I was led on, all the way

   12:26 10   up to the point where it was -- the deal was canceled.

   12:26 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   But other than the special

   12:26 12   relationship with the FTC statement that you referenced

   12:26 13   earlier, are there any other statements by Walgreens in

   12:26 14   the press releases that you read that somehow led you --

   12:26 15        A.   Yeah, they --

   12:26 16        Q.   -- to --

   12:27 17        A.   Basically, they said that there wasn't -- it

   12:27 18   would be -- I mentioned this already, there will be no

   12:27 19   bumps in the road, in other words, to the merger.  And

   12:27 20   there was no mention of any Federal Trade Commission at

   12:27 21   the time.

   12:27 22        Q.   What do you mean, There was no mention of any

   12:27 23   Federal Trade Commission at the time?

   12:27 24        A.   Well, the -- the opposition or the -- the issue

   12:27 25   with the Federal Trade Commission coming in saying that

                                                                       93



   12:27  1   there was -- you know, there was going to be an issue, as

   12:27  2   far as a monopoly goes, that wasn't brought up until later

   12:27  3   on, in articles.  Basically, from, I think maybe the -- it

   12:27  4   might have been Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg and some

   12:27  5   of the other financial magazines, but they started

   12:28  6   bringing up scrutinization -- scrutiny of the Federal

   12:28  7   Trade Commission.

   12:28  8        Q.   What did you mean when you say "later on"?

   12:28  9        A.   At the beginning, when the -- I did not read

   12:28 10   anything at the beginning, when the merger was first

   12:28 11   announced, that there would be any issue with the -- the

   12:28 12   Federal Trade Commission wasn't mentioned.

   12:28 13        Q.   By who?

   12:28 14        A.   By the -- by the articles or the announcements

   12:28 15   made by Walgreens.

   12:28 16        Q.   When do you think that Walgreens first started

   12:28 17   to discuss the FTC review of the deal?

   12:28 18        A.   I don't know.  When I first -- I first saw it in

   12:28 19   the discussion with Rite Aid and not -- not Walgreens.  It

   12:29 20   started coming out with Rite Aid.  And when it was

   12:29 21   coming -- you know, closer to when the deal -- it was

   12:29 22   actually when they changed the deal, it went from $9 a

   12:29 23   share, then they were talking about $7 or $7.50 a share,

   12:29 24   they extended the time period.  And I didn't hear anything

   12:29 25   saying that there was -- I didn't hear anything from

                                                                       94



   12:29  1   Walgreens saying that there was any FTC issues.  I do

   12:29  2   remember it coming from -- from Rite Aid.

   12:29  3        Q.   So you were aware of -- as of what date that

   12:30  4   there were issues with the FTC review?

   12:30  5        A.   I can't give you any dates.  It was -- it was

   12:30  6   around the -- it could have been around the time that they

   12:30  7   announced the -- their second plan, which was to -- to

   12:30  8   lower the number of stores that they were going to

   12:30  9   purchase and to lower the stock price to the $7 or $7.50.

   12:30 10   And I thought they were doing that so they could obtain

   12:30 11   the FTC approval, because the number of stores that they

   12:30 12   were initially going to buy was too many and, thereby,

   12:30 13   perhaps forming a monopoly.

   12:30 14                  So when they decided to lower the number of

   12:31 15   shares, I thought that was -- excuse me -- a workaround

   12:31 16   plan to obtain FTC approval.

   12:31 17                  So even then I was hoping that the FTC

   12:31 18   would approve the merger.  And, quite frankly, like I

   12:31 19   said, I held onto the stock because I was hopeful.

   12:31 20        Q.   And what was your hope based on?

   12:31 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   12:31 22        A.   You have to be -- you have to elaborate on what

   12:31 23   it's based on.

   12:31 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I think when you said, you

   12:31 25   know, quite frankly, I held onto the stock because I was

                                                                       95



   12:31  1   hoping for FTC approval, correct?

   12:32  2        A.   Right.

   12:32  3        Q.   And I was asking you, what -- what was that hope

   12:32  4   based on?

   12:32  5        A.   The hope was based on that they were doing what

   12:32  6   they can to make adjustments to their plan to obtain the

   12:32  7   approval.

   12:32  8        Q.   Okay.  Now, you are seeking to be a class

   12:32  9   representative, correct?

   12:32 10        A.   Yes.

   12:32 11        Q.   What's your understanding of what your

   12:32 12   obligations are?

   12:32 13        A.   Okay.  Well, talking to my -- interfacing,

   12:32 14   talking with my attorney on the class -- on the suit;

   12:32 15   answering any questions between my attorney and myself;

   12:33 16   and what we're doing here right now; hoping for

   12:33 17   a -- working on a settlement, favorable settlement, for

   12:33 18   myself and also for the stockholders for that time period;

   12:33 19   keeping abreast of the details of the suit; providing any

   12:33 20   documentation necessary, et cetera.

   12:33 21        Q.   Anything else?

   12:33 22        A.   No.  That's about it.

   12:33 23        Q.   Okay.  What's the class period in this case?

   12:33 24        A.   The class period?

   12:33 25        Q.   Uh-huh.

                                                                       96



   12:33  1        A.   Okay.  I believe it's, what, October 20th, 2016,

   12:34  2   to June 28th, 2017.

   12:34  3        Q.   And what's the significance of those two dates?

   12:34  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.  And I'll

   12:34  5   ask you not to divulge communications with us and things

   12:34  6   that you've learned in the lawsuit.  But if you have an

   12:34  7   understanding coming in, you can -- you can go ahead and

   12:34  8   answer.  And it calls for a legal conclusion.

   12:34  9                  Go ahead.

   12:34 10        A.   Okay.

   12:34 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Let me ask you this:  Do you

   12:34 12   know why those dates are the beginning and the end of the

   12:34 13   class period?

   12:34 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objections.  Don't

   12:34 15   divulge things that you've learned from us, but you can

   12:34 16   answer if you had an understanding coming in.

   12:34 17        A.   Well, I know the end date was when it -- I

   12:34 18   believe when it fell through, when the deal actually fell

   12:34 19   through.

   12:34 20                  The -- as far as the start date goes, I'm

   12:35 21   not quite sure what that was, as far as the start date,

   12:35 22   again.  I was hoping that it would actually go back much

   12:35 23   further than what it did, as far as the dates go.

   12:35 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why were you hoping that?

   12:35 25        A.   Well, I thought it would have gone back from the

                                                                       97



   12:35  1   time that the merger was announced.

   12:35  2        Q.   Why did you think that?

   12:35  3        A.   I just thought that that was logical.

   12:35  4        Q.   Uh-huh.

   12:35  5        A.   Because, you know, that's when -- that's when

   12:35  6   people might -- and institutions might -- that's when the

   12:35  7   trading volume would probably increase.  At that --

   12:35  8        Q.   And why would -- sorry; go ahead and finish.

   12:35  9        A.   Well, at that point when it's announced.

   12:35 10        Q.   Why would the trading volume probably increase

   12:36 11   when it was announced?

   12:36 12        A.   Because -- well, that's -- basically because the

   12:36 13   stock is traded on news.  Okay.  So it's -- people and

   12:36 14   companies would be buying into it.  That's what I

   12:36 15   initially thought.

   12:36 16        Q.   And why were you hoping that the class period

   12:36 17   would go back to when the deal was first announced?

   12:36 18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   12:36 19                  But you can go ahead.

   12:36 20        A.   Well, because I had additional shares,

   12:37 21   and -- you know, I had a total of almost -- you know, over

   12:37 22   32,000 shares.  So narrowing it down to that brief chunk

   12:37 23   of time, cut it down to, I think, 7,000 shares.  I was

   12:37 24   just -- I wanted to be and helped to be -- you know, to be

   12:37 25   made a -- whole, or at least try to be made -- I mean, I

                                                                       98



   12:37  1   know I'll never be made whole.  I mean, I know I'm going

   12:37  2   to incur losses.

   12:37  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And --

   12:37  4        A.   I'm just trying to recover anything I can, as

   12:37  5   well as for the stockholders.

   12:37  6        Q.   When you said you had over 32,000 shares, and

   12:38  7   this cut it down to 7,000 shares, are you talking about

   12:38  8   Rite Aid stock?

   12:38  9        A.   Yes.

   12:38 10        Q.   Are you talking about purchases or overall

   12:38 11   holdings?

   12:38 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, but you can answer.

   12:38 13        A.   The shares that I owned at that time period.

   12:38 14   Shares that I purchased during that time period were

   12:38 15   7,000, I believe.

   12:38 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   12:38 17        A.   And if they went back further, I would have had

   12:38 18   more shares.

   12:38 19        Q.   More shares that you purchased?

   12:38 20        A.   Yeah.  I believe so.  I believe so.

   12:38 21        Q.   So did you purchase Rite Aid stock after the

   12:38 22   merger was announced?

   12:38 23        A.   I don't believe I did.

   12:38 24        Q.   When do you think your first purchase of Rite

   12:38 25   Aid stock was between October 2015 and the end --

                                                                       99



   12:38  1        A.   I would have to look at my portfolio to look --

   12:38  2   to verify that.  I can't answer that.

   12:39  3        Q.   Okay.  How many transactions -- how many

   12:39  4   purchases did you make at Rite Aid during October 2015

   12:39  5   through the end of 2017?

   12:39  6        A.   I don't have any -- yeah, I have to look at my

   12:39  7   data.  I'd have to look at my accounts.

   12:39  8        Q.   We'll do that.  I just want to know do you have

   12:39  9   a sense of roughly how much?

   12:39 10        A.   No.

   12:39 11        Q.   Are we talking dozens or are we talking like --

   12:39 12        A.   No, just let me -- let me -- no, I have no idea

   12:39 13   how many.  I mean, you know, I may -- I may have made, I

   12:39 14   don't know, like eight purchases altogether.  Maybe it was

   12:39 15   more; I don't know.

   12:39 16                  I mean, I started purchasing it way back.

   12:39 17   I'm not sure if it was 2012, 2013.  So --

   12:39 18        Q.   And I'm just specific in my question, just to be

   12:39 19   clear, was focused on after the merger was announced,

   12:39 20   purchases after the merger was announced.

   12:39 21        A.   Purchases after the merger was announced, maybe

   12:39 22   three or four times.

   12:39 23        Q.   Was there any specific piece of information or

   12:40 24   news that you relied on in connection with those

   12:40 25   purchases, to your recollection?

                                                                      100



   12:40  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

   12:40  2                  Go ahead.

   12:40  3        A.   I was -- there was one point there that the

   12:40  4   stock started going down, so I decided to purchase -- I

   12:40  5   thought it was a good buy, so I decided to purchase when

   12:40  6   the price went down.

   12:40  7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   But any specific piece of news

   12:40  8   or information or disclosure or SEC filing that you

   12:40  9   reviewed and relied upon in connection with the decision

   12:40 10   to make those specific purchases?

   12:40 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

   12:40 12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   To the best of your

   12:40 13   recollection.

   12:40 14        A.   No, just to the fact that I was hopeful that the

   12:41 15   merger would happen.

   12:41 16        Q.   And that hope was based on the statement,

   12:41 17   according to you, that Mr. Pessina made regarding the

   12:41 18   special relationship with the FTC?

   12:41 19        A.   Yeah, but it wasn't just that statement.  It was

   12:41 20   all statements where -- that the -- that the deal would go

   12:41 21   through.  This wasn't -- that wasn't even the same press

   12:41 22   release.  These are two separate press releases that I

   12:41 23   remember.  One was the deal would fall -- that the deal

   12:41 24   would go through, and another one was that they had a

   12:41 25   special -- I'm not sure if he even said, you know, inside

                                                                      101



   12:41  1   information with the FTC.  I thought that, you know, they

   12:42  2   have -- with other acquisitions in the past, that they had

   12:42  3   worked with FTC on multiple times, and perhaps even with

   12:42  4   the -- and I don't know if that has anything to do with

   12:42  5   the U.S., but the merger with Boots.

   12:42  6                  So I'm thinking that they may have worked

   12:42  7   with them then.  And I'm sure there were other mergers

   12:42  8   along the way that they worked with the -- so I believed

   12:42  9   it to be an honest statement.

   12:42 10        Q.   You believe what to be an honest statement?

   12:42 11        A.   That they had a special relationship with the

   12:43 12   FTC.  And that they would be the first ones to be notified

   12:43 13   if there was an issue, and that they would notify -- you

   12:43 14   know, they would make a press release or announcement or

   12:43 15   something during the -- even an earnings call.  I never

   12:43 16   heard anything.

   12:43 17        Q.   When you say that you never heard anything, what

   12:43 18   did you do to actually understand all of the disclosures

   12:43 19   that were being made by Walgreens and Rite Aid concerning

   12:43 20   the merger?

   12:43 21        A.   Well, I believed what they said was truthful.

   12:43 22        Q.   No.  What I am asking you is what did you do to

   12:44 23   understand all of the disclosures that were being made by

   12:44 24   Walgreens and Rite Aid about the merger?

   12:44 25        A.   I didn't do anything.  I stayed firm and kept

                                                                      102



   12:44  1   the stock.

   12:44  2        Q.   But -- you did not do anything to understand the

   12:44  3   full set of disclosures that were being made by the

   12:44  4   Walgreens and Rite Aid concerning the merger?

   12:44  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

   12:44  6   a few times.  He's talked about what he did during this

   12:44  7   time period.

   12:44  8                  So you can --

   12:44  9        A.   No, I mean, I've answered it.  I've answered

   12:44 10   your question.

   12:44 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I think you've answered it

   12:44 12   different ways, so I'm just trying to understand what it

   12:44 13   is that you actually are testifying to having a specific

   12:44 14   recollection about doing during this time period.  So --

   12:44 15        A.   I mean, I don't know --

   12:44 16        Q.   Just let me finish my question.

   12:44 17        A.   Okay.  Uh-huh.

   12:45 18        Q.   It will make it easier.

   12:45 19        A.   Sure.

   12:45 20        Q.   My question is:  With respect to the time period

   12:45 21   we're talking about, October 2015 through 2017, you

   12:45 22   testified that you did not do anything to understand the

   12:45 23   full set of disclosures that were being made by Walgreens

   12:45 24   and Rite Aid about the merger; is that correct?

   12:45 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  And objection to the extent it

                                                                      103



   12:45  1   leaves out other testimony on the subject.

   12:45  2        A.   When I said I didn't do anything, I meant I

   12:45  3   didn't exercise the selling of the stock.  That's what I

   12:45  4   meant when I didn't do anything.

   12:45  5        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What did you --

   12:45  6        A.   That's all I meant.

   12:45  7        Q.   Okay.  That's a helpful clarification.

   12:45  8                  What did you do to understand the full set

   12:45  9   of disclosures that were made by Walgreens and Rite Aid

   12:45 10   about the merger during the period between 2015 and June

   12:45 11   2017?

   12:46 12        A.   I don't remember doing anything other than

   12:46 13   absorbing the information.  I don't know what I can do;

   12:46 14   call up -- pick up the phone and call Pessina and say,

   12:46 15   hey, I don't like what you're doing.  I don't

   12:46 16   understand --

   12:46 17        Q.   Let me --

   12:46 18        A.   What can I do based on this?  I mean, you know,

   12:46 19   I read -- I read a lot of news articles.  Okay.  And it's

   12:46 20   hard to -- there are so many news articles that I read,

   12:46 21   okay.  I can't recall what was said in all of the news

   12:46 22   articles.  There are certain things that are said, though,

   12:46 23   that I can -- that I did remember, okay, and those things

   12:46 24   gave me hope, okay, that the -- that the deal would not

   12:47 25   fall through.  Hence, why I did not sell my shares.

                                                                      104



   12:47  1        Q.   Okay.  So I'm asking you specifically -- not

   12:47  2   with respect to what actions you took with your stock.

   12:47  3   I'm asking about what are the documents that you reviewed

   12:47  4   and the disclosures that you reviewed during this period.

   12:47  5                  So it sounds like what you said is you read

   12:47  6   a lot of news articles.  And I'm asking you:  What else

   12:47  7   did you do beyond reading news articles to understand what

   12:47  8   Walgreens and Rite Aid were disclosing to investors about

   12:47  9   the merger?

   12:47 10        A.   Oh, excuse me.

   12:47 11                  Nothing --

   12:47 12        Q.   Okay.

   12:47 13        A.   -- other than monitoring -- monitoring my

   12:47 14   stocks, the price of my stocks, the trading activity, the

   12:48 15   volume of trades, things of that sort.

   12:48 16        Q.   Who are the defendants in this lawsuit?

   12:48 17        A.   Stefano Pessina, who is the CEO.  And there is a

   12:48 18   George Fairweather, and he's the chief financial officer,

   12:48 19   I believe.  That's -- those are the only two that I

   12:48 20   remember.

   12:48 21        Q.   Are you suing just individuals?

   12:48 22        A.   No, I thought I was -- I thought I was also

   12:48 23   suing the company.

   12:48 24        Q.   And what claims are you asserting?

   12:49 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll object to the extent

                                                                      105



   12:49  1   it calls for a legal conclusion, and to the extent it

   12:49  2   calls for information that you've learned from us.  But to

   12:49  3   the extent that you have an understanding separate from

   12:49  4   that, you can answer.

   12:49  5        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And that will always be true.

   12:49  6   I'm not asking you, again, for kind of communications with

   12:49  7   your lawyers.

   12:49  8                  I'm asking you what is your understanding

   12:49  9   of what are the claims you're suing those defendants

   12:49 10   about?

   12:49 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  And same objection, same

   12:49 12   instruction.

   12:49 13                  But go ahead.

   12:49 14        A.   Well, I mean, I -- I don't think that

   12:49 15   the -- the -- some of the announcements were forthcoming

   12:49 16   and honest, especially when saying that there would be no

   12:49 17   objection or no opposition to the merger.

   12:50 18                  Also, like I mentioned, the fact that they

   12:50 19   had a special relationship with the Federal -- FTC.

   12:50 20   That's it.

   12:50 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So there's two -- you

   12:50 22   mentioned two items in response to my question, which was

   12:50 23   the announcements that there would be no objection or not

   12:50 24   opposition to the merger.  And the second thing you

   12:50 25   mention is the special relationship with the FTC; is that

                                                                      106



   12:50  1   correct?

   12:50  2        A.   Yes.

   12:50  3        Q.   Are there any other categories of announcements

   12:50  4   that you take issue with?

   12:50  5        A.   No.

   12:50  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, and objection to the

   12:50  7   extent that it calls for legal advice.  And I think you

   12:50  8   asked about the claims and then you said take issue with

   12:51  9   so those are two different -- two different things.

   12:51 10        A.   No.

   12:51 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   No?

   12:51 12        A.   No.  That's about the -- the extent of it.

   12:51 13        Q.   So with respect to your complaint against

   12:51 14   Walgreens and Mr. Fairweather and Mr. Pessina, it relates,

   12:51 15   to your recollection, that there were statements made by

   12:51 16   Walgreens or Mr. Pessina or Mr. Fairweather that, one,

   12:51 17   there would be no opposition to the merger by the FTC and,

   12:51 18   two, that Walgreens had a special relationship with the

   12:51 19   FTC.  Is that accurate?

   12:51 20        A.   Yes.

   12:51 21        Q.   Did you pursue -- do you believe that Rite Aid

   12:51 22   misled investors?

   12:51 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   12:51 24                  Don't divulge attorney/client

   12:51 25   contributions, but you can answer.

                                                                      107



   12:51  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   To be clear, how about we do

   12:51  2   this.  So in June 2017, the merger agreement was

   12:51  3   terminated, as we discussed.

   12:51  4                  Upon that announcement, do you recall

   12:51  5   thinking that you were misled by Rite Aid?

   12:51  6        A.   The fact that they -- the fact that they agreed

   12:52  7   to sell half -- I don't know if it was half the stores,

   12:52  8   but just for the record I'm going to say half the stores,

   12:52  9   okay.

   12:52 10                  Yeah, I was misled that way, because I

   12:52 11   didn't realize that they were going to break the company

   12:52 12   in half.  And -- so there was no discussion about that

   12:52 13   nowhere.  That came up later on.

   12:52 14                  And then when they announced it, I said to

   12:52 15   myself, oh, well, they're going to have to get the

   12:52 16   shareholders to vote on that.  And then I was completely

   12:52 17   wrong; no shareholder vote on that.

   12:52 18                  How can you break a company in half without

   12:52 19   having a shareholder vote?  I'm still scratching my head

   12:52 20   over that one.  But, you know, I'm not a lawyer,

   12:53 21   especially in that particular area of expertise.  So...

   12:53 22                  So, yeah, I feel like that was part of why

   12:53 23   I felt misled.

   12:53 24        Q.   Any other aspects upon -- strike that.

   12:53 25                  Upon the announcement in June 2017 of the

                                                                      108



   12:53  1   termination of the Merger Agreement, is there any other

   12:53  2   way in which you believe you had been misled by either

   12:53  3   Walgreens or Rite Aid, other than what you've already

   12:53  4   identified?

   12:53  5        A.   Well, I didn't think that there would be a

   12:53  6   second plan where they were going to reduce the number of

   12:53  7   stores and, in doing so, reduce the price of the shares

   12:53  8   from $9 to $7 or $7.50.  But that was -- that was a blow

   12:54  9   to me.

   12:54 10                  But then I thought that maybe they were

   12:54 11   doing that as a prerequisite of obtaining FTC approval, so

   12:54 12   -- in order to reduce the number of shares.

   12:54 13        Q.   And --

   12:54 14        A.   I mean the number of stores.

   12:54 15        Q.   So I think you've identified four items.  The --

   12:54 16   with respect to Walgreens, you identified the statement

   12:54 17   that you recall Walgreens making that there would be no

   12:54 18   opposition by the FTC along with the special relationship

   12:54 19   comment.

   12:54 20        A.   Yes.

   12:54 21        Q.   And with respect to Rite Aid, you've identified

   12:54 22   that you think that they would not have reduced the number

   12:55 23   of share -- the price of the shares in the deal from 9 to

   12:55 24   7, or 6.50 in January, and that they would not have agreed

   12:55 25   to sell stores; is that correct?

                                                                      109



   12:55  1        A.   Yeah.  Half their stores.

   12:55  2        Q.   Half the stores.

   12:55  3        A.   Right.

   12:55  4        Q.   Other than those four items, is there anything

   12:55  5   else?

   12:55  6        A.   No.

   12:55  7        Q.   Okay.

   12:55  8                  MS. ZALKA:  Can I get a complaint?

   12:55  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  It's a long complaint.  Do we

   12:55 10   -- before we start getting into that, do we want to get

   12:55 11   lunch?

   12:55 12                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm open to whenever you guys

   12:55 13   want to do.

   12:55 14                  THE WITNESS:  Well, I guess we have a

   12:55 15   couple more hours?  Or...

   12:56 16                  MS. ZALKA:  Yes, I would -- I would suggest

   12:56 17   lunch.  It's not going to end in a couple of hours.  If

   12:56 18   you want --

   12:56 19                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

   12:56 20                  MS. ZALKA:  I think we'll be taking a lunch

   12:56 21   break.  It's really just a matter of when you would like

   12:56 22   to have it.

   12:56 23                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Well, we can have it

   12:56 24   now, I guess.  What time is it?

   12:56 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  It's now 1:00.

                                                                      110



   12:56  1                  MS. ZALKA:  1:00.

   12:56  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  So why don't we go off the

   12:56  3   record.

   12:56  4                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure.

   12:56  5                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

   12:56  6   12:56 p.m.

   12:56  7                  (Recess in the proceedings from 12:56

   01:39  8                  to 1:40 p.m.)

   01:39  9                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

   01:40 10   1:40 p.m.

   01:40 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Mr. Dayton --

   01:40 12        A.   Uh-huh.

   01:40 13        Q.   -- I'm handing you what's been marked as Exhibit

   01:40 14   19.

   01:40 15                  (Exhibit 19 marked.)

   01:40 16        A.   Okay.

   01:40 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Let me know when you're ready.

   01:40 18        A.   Is this the one that's mainly referring to --

   01:41 19   some of it's the Hering case?  Yeah, okay.

   01:41 20                  (Witness reviews document.)

   01:41 21                  Okay.

   01:41 22        Q.   Are you ready?

   01:41 23        A.   Uh-huh.

   01:41 24        Q.   Do you recognize this document?

   01:41 25        A.   I believe so, but there were several documents

                                                                      111



   01:41  1   that -- a lot of -- some of them had similar content, but

   01:41  2   I think I remember this particular document.

   01:42  3        Q.   Okay.  What is it?

   01:42  4        A.   So it's the class action complaint for

   01:42  5   violations of Security Act of 1934.

   01:42  6        Q.   Uh-huh.

   01:42  7        A.   I think they refer to it as the -- in Section

   01:42  8   10-B, I've seen reference to that in the past.  And this

   01:42  9   is -- this is what this is in reference to, part of it,

   01:42 10   right.

   01:42 11        Q.   What do you mean?

   01:42 12        A.   The -- so this is basically what the complaint

   01:42 13   is.  This is -- covers the -- in detail what the complaint

   01:43 14   is.

   01:43 15        Q.   Okay.  Did you review a draft of this before it

   01:43 16   was filed?

   01:43 17        A.   I believe I did.

   01:43 18        Q.   Did you provide any comments on it?

   01:43 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

   01:43 20   calls for privileged communications.

   01:43 21                  You can answer generally, yes or no.

   01:43 22        A.   I don't remember if I put any comments on it.

   01:43 23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And how long did you spend

   01:43 24   reviewing it?

   01:43 25        A.   I read through the document once; so an hour.

                                                                      112



   01:43  1        Q.   Okay.  Was there anything in it that surprised

   01:43  2   you?

   01:43  3        A.   No.  There was -- counted -- you know, some of

   01:43  4   the statements, I mean -- I guess, there was really -- no,

   01:43  5   nothing that surprised me in any way.  Some legal

   01:44  6   termination (sic) in there, but, no, I wasn't surprised at

   01:44  7   anything.

   01:44  8        Q.   Okay.  There -- do you believe that Walgreens

   01:44  9   made any material misstatements or misinformation during

   01:44 10   the proposed class period that aren't in this document?

   01:44 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

   01:44 12   calls for a legal conclusion and calls for attorney/client

   01:44 13   privileged information.

   01:44 14                  Don't divulge anything that you've learned

   01:44 15   from us during litigation, but you can answer with that in

   01:44 16   mind.

   01:44 17        A.   All I can say is that there was more information

   01:44 18   in this document than I was aware of.

   01:44 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  And when you say there

   01:44 20   was more information in this -- in the complaint that you

   01:44 21   were aware of, do you mean prior to reading the complaint?

   01:44 22        A.   Yes.

   01:44 23        Q.   And in terms of information that you weren't

   01:44 24   previously aware of before reading the complaint, did that

   01:44 25   include the additional statements that were made by

                                                                      113



   01:44  1   Walgreens concerning the merger?

   01:45  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

   01:45  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  I can correct that.

   01:45  4                  So in terms of information that you weren't

   01:45  5   previously aware of before reading the complaint, were

   01:45  6   there statements and disclosures by Walgreens or Rite Aid

   01:45  7   that are detailed in the complaint that you weren't

   01:45  8   previously aware of?

   01:45  9        A.   Yes, but I can't -- you know, if you ask me to

   01:45 10   recall any, I know that -- I don't know if it was written

   01:45 11   in this one, but there was -- I had read in one of the

   01:45 12   complaints that -- something to do with a plan B in one of

   01:45 13   the documents.  I'm not sure if this was it.

   01:45 14                  But there was -- there's a lot more

   01:45 15   information in here than I was aware of.  I was aware of

   01:46 16   primarily two items, and those are the two items I earlier

   01:46 17   disclosed.

   01:46 18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  And just to be clear

   01:46 19   then, so those two items are the special relationship

   01:46 20   statement --

   01:46 21        A.   Yes.

   01:46 22        Q.   -- that you recall and then no objection by the

   01:46 23   FTC statement that you recall?

   01:46 24        A.   Right.

   01:46 25        Q.   Okay.  Did you conduct any independent

                                                                      114



   01:46  1   investigation of the claims asserted in the complaint?

   01:46  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   01:46  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Again, outside of counsel?

   01:46  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Outside of counsel.

   01:46  5        A.   No.

   01:46  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Other than the complaint, have

   01:46  7   you reviewed any of the filings in the action, this

   01:46  8   action?  And by filings I mean filings with the court.

   01:47  9        A.   I've read what my attorney provided me, and

   01:47 10   there were some filings.

   01:47 11        Q.   Do you know what those filings were?

   01:47 12        A.   I would have to see the document.  There

   01:47 13   was -- I've reviewed many, many documents.  So

   01:47 14   it's -- it's easier for me to see the document and read

   01:47 15   the title of the document so I can identify the document.

   01:47 16        Q.   Uh-huh.  Did you review any of the papers

   01:47 17   submitted to the courts in connection with any motion to

   01:47 18   certify the class that you seek to represent?

   01:47 19        A.   I believe so.

   01:47 20        Q.   Other than -- so I think we have the

   01:47 21   complaint -- you said previously that you reviewed the

   01:47 22   motion to dismiss in preparation for the deposition,

   01:48 23   correct?

   01:48 24        A.   Yes.

   01:48 25        Q.   Did you review the motion to dismiss filings

                                                                      115



   01:48  1   around the time that they were filed, or just in

   01:48  2   preparation for your deposition?

   01:48  3        A.   I don't know -- I don't know if -- if it's the

   01:48  4   time of the filing or -- I have no idea.

   01:48  5        Q.   Okay.

   01:48  6        A.   I reviewed it, but I -- I don't know the time

   01:48  7   frame.

   01:48  8        Q.   Have you reviewed any reports by any experts

   01:48  9   that were submitted in connection with this action?

   01:48 10        A.   Just -- there was one report, but I didn't read

   01:48 11   the whole thing at the time.  I'm sure I can get another

   01:48 12   copy of the report submitted by Mr. Steinholdt, which was

   01:49 13   sort of like a forensic examination of the stock,

   01:49 14   regarding the history and day-to-day activity, purchase

   01:49 15   price.  So...

   01:49 16        Q.   And that wasn't one of the documents that you

   01:49 17   reviewed recently in connection with preparing for your

   01:49 18   deposition?

   01:49 19        A.   It was.

   01:49 20        Q.   Oh, it was.  Was that one of the documents that

   01:49 21   you reviewed yesterday?

   01:49 22                  I'm just going to say you can't look at

   01:49 23   your attorney.

   01:49 24        A.   Okay.

   01:49 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  He can, especially when it

                                                                      116



   01:49  1   involves privileged information.

   01:49  2                  THE WITNESS:  No, I mean --

   01:49  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  So you can answer yes or no

   01:49  4   and not beyond that.

   01:49  5        A.   Yeah, we looked at that.

   01:49  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is -- so previously I had asked

   01:49  7   you to identify the kind of -- in your list the documents

   01:49  8   that you reviewed yesterday in connection with preparing

   01:49  9   for your deposition, and you mentioned four categories.

   01:49 10   Are you now saying there's an additional, fifth?

   01:50 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  He can testify about what --

   01:50 12   what refreshed his recollection.  He also said -- so

   01:50 13   you're misstating his testimony.  He said he doesn't

   01:50 14   remember exactly what he reviewed, but if you mention or

   01:50 15   show him documents, he can testify as to that.  So...

   01:50 16                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm going to object to the

   01:50 17   characterization of his testimony.  That's not what he

   01:50 18   said.

   01:50 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   But, in any event, so what

   01:50 20   refreshed your recollection now about reviewing this

   01:50 21   additional document?

   01:50 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   01:50 23        A.   I thought it would eventually come up

   01:50 24   during -- I thought that that document would -- would come

   01:50 25   up.  But I didn't even think of -- because I've reviewed

                                                                      117



   01:50  1   multiple documents, so, quite frankly, I can't tell you in

   01:50  2   concession, you know, I reviewed this one, I reviewed that

   01:50  3   one.  It's very likely I'm liable to leave one or two out.

   01:50  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  But I asked you earlier

   01:50  5   this morning for your best recollection --

   01:50  6        A.   That was my best --

   01:50  7        Q.   Okay.  You need to let me finish my question,

   01:51  8   Mr. Dayton.

   01:51  9        A.   Sure.

   01:51 10        Q.   Otherwise, it's much harder to get it down.

   01:51 11        A.   Sure.

   01:51 12        Q.   Okay.  So earlier this morning I asked you to

   01:51 13   list to the best of your recollection the set of documents

   01:51 14   that you reviewed just yesterday in connection with

   01:51 15   preparing for this deposition.  Do you recall that?

   01:51 16                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll object to the

   01:51 17   question in general, because he's -- because that's

   01:51 18   privileged information, and he can testify as to what

   01:51 19   refreshed his recollection.  And the questions are now

   01:51 20   bordering -- bordering on harassing, but go ahead.

   01:51 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   There's currently inconsistency

   01:51 22   in the testimony.  I'm offering you -- I'm offering you an

   01:51 23   opportunity to clarify.

   01:51 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the

   01:51 25   characterization of -- there was no inconsistency.

                                                                      118



   01:51  1                  MS. ZALKA:  You need to keep your

   01:51  2   objections to speaking objections.  Okay?

   01:51  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  But when you're

   01:51  4   mischaracterizing what he said, I've got to speak up.  But

   01:51  5   go ahead.

   01:51  6                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm not mischaracterizing what

   01:51  7   he said.  But, anyway, let's ask the witness.  That's what

   01:51  8   we're here for.

   01:51  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Mr. Dayton, I previously asked

   01:51 10   you to the best of your recollection to tell me about the

   01:51 11   documents that you reviewed yesterday in connection with

   01:51 12   preparing for the deposition.

   01:52 13                  Early this morning you answered that

   01:52 14   question, I assume it was to the best of your

   01:52 15   recollection, correct?

   01:52 16        A.   It was.

   01:52 17        Q.   So now you've identified after lunch an

   01:52 18   additional document that you reviewed yesterday, correct?

   01:52 19        A.   Yes.

   01:52 20        Q.   That was the expert report of Mr. Steinholdt.

   01:52 21                  I'm simply asking you what refreshed your

   01:52 22   recollection about this additional document that you did

   01:52 23   not recall just this morning?

   01:52 24        A.   One of the questions that you -- one of the

   01:52 25   questions that you asked me.  I can't -- verbatim, you

                                                                      119



   01:52  1   know, I can't -- if you go back in our questioning, there

   01:52  2   was something that you said that sparked my memory.

   01:52  3        Q.   I see.  So when I asked the question about did

   01:52  4   you review any expert reports, that prompted, in your

   01:52  5   mind, oh, I actually forgot to mention that I did review

   01:52  6   that yesterday?

   01:52  7        A.   Well, there was the expert report that --

   01:52  8        Q.   I see.  Okay.  Thank you for clarifying.

   01:52  9        A.   Okay.

   01:52 10        Q.   Any other documents that you now recall in

   01:53 11   addition to reviewing yesterday?

   01:53 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Again, objection to

   01:53 13   attorney/client privileged information and work product,

   01:53 14   to the extent you're not asking what refreshed his

   01:53 15   recollection.

   01:53 16                  But you can -- you can answer.

   01:53 17        A.   As far as I know, that's the extent of the

   01:53 18   documents.

   01:53 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Do you have a retention

   01:53 20   agreement with your counsel?

   01:53 21        A.   I don't know.

   01:53 22        Q.   You don't know?

   01:53 23        A.   No.

   01:53 24        Q.   Do you know when you retained them?

   01:53 25        A.   Oh, that kind of agreement?  Well, I must have

                                                                      120



   01:53  1   one if I -- well, it was -- it was mentioned to me that my

   01:53  2   memory was -- was sort of fogged, and that I initially

   01:53  3   came to the -- the attorneys in 2015.

   01:53  4        Q.   When you say, It was mentioned to me that my

   01:54  5   memory was sort of fogged, what did you mean?

   01:54  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  You can answer.

   01:54  7        A.   Right.  So the only thing that we had talked

   01:54  8   about, David and myself, during the lunch was that my

   01:54  9   recollection of the date of when I initially contacted

   01:54 10   them was incorrect.

   01:54 11                  I'm terrible with dates, I'm sorry.

   01:54 12   Sometimes I think the older you get, the worse you are

   01:54 13   with dates.  I'm -- I am absolutely terrible.  That's why

   01:54 14   when you ask me dates, I have a hard time with dates.  And

   01:54 15   the further back, it gets worse and worse.

   01:54 16                  MS. ZALKA:  Are you -- are you claiming

   01:54 17   privilege over that conversation?  Because if you are, I

   01:54 18   won't continue, but if you're not, then I will.

   01:54 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  No, go ahead.

   01:55 20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So with respect to your memory

   01:55 21   being sort of fogged, did you raise this question to your

   01:55 22   attorney during the break?

   01:55 23        A.   So I don't remember where it came in.  I

   01:55 24   don't -- I don't think so.  I think the -- I don't

   01:55 25   remember raising it.

                                                                      121



   01:55  1        Q.   Okay.  So you don't remember raising this?

   01:55  2        A.   No.

   01:55  3        Q.   So prior to the lunch break, did you think that

   01:55  4   you had anything incorrect in your testimony?

   01:55  5        A.   Well, I mean, there -- I wasn't sure about the

   01:55  6   date, and there's -- there's other dates that you asked me

   01:55  7   that I answered to the best of my ability of thinking what

   01:55  8   they are, but there could be some errors in -- in the

   01:55  9   dates.  I can't specifically name anything off the top of

   01:56 10   my head.  But that one was way off, as far as I thought it

   01:56 11   was after and it was actually before the -- the class

   01:56 12   action -- before the merger was broken off.

   01:56 13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What aspects --

   01:56 14        A.   Totally my -- my misunderstanding, my fault.

   01:56 15        Q.   Let's start here.

   01:56 16                  What aspects of your testimony from this

   01:56 17   morning do you want to correct?

   01:56 18        A.   That's -- I mean, to my recollection, that's it.

   01:56 19   But I'm not saying that something -- there might be

   01:56 20   another judgment in error -- you know, a judgment -- date

   01:56 21   judgment because, like I said, I'm terrible with the

   01:56 22   dates.

   01:56 23        Q.   What specifically are you correcting?

   01:56 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  He just answered.

   01:57 25        A.   Nothing.  I'm not correcting anything other than

                                                                      122



   01:57  1   when I contacted the attorneys to pursue a case.

   01:57  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So when did you first

   01:57  3   contact attorneys to pursue a case?

   01:57  4        A.   It was sometime back in, I guess, 2015.

   01:57  5        Q.   Okay.  And what cases were you seeking to pursue

   01:57  6   at that time?  Again, I'm not asking for any --

   01:57  7        A.   This was --

   01:57  8        Q.   -- communications with your lawyers.  I'm asking

   01:57  9   you, you personally, what claim were you seeking to --

   01:57 10        A.   Right.

   01:57 11        Q.   -- pursue?

   01:57 12        A.   So I believe it was after the merger was

   01:57 13   announced, and I felt that $9 a share was too low.

   01:57 14        Q.   Okay.  Who did you contact?

   01:57 15        A.   The law firm that was in the news article.

   01:57 16        Q.   Okay.  And when you say that $9 a share was too

   01:58 17   low, you mean the $9 a share for the Rite Aid stock?

   01:58 18        A.   Yes.

   01:58 19        Q.   Okay.  And that was in answer to the original

   01:58 20   merger agreement in October 2015?

   01:58 21        A.   Yes.

   01:58 22        Q.   Did you -- were the claims that you were

   01:58 23   intending to pursue against Walgreens or Rite Aid or both?

   01:58 24        A.   At the time I -- I wanted Rite Aid -- I'm

   01:58 25   sorry -- I wanted Walgreens to pay more for the price of

                                                                      123



   01:58  1   the stock.  And actually, it goes both ways.

   01:58  2                  I didn't want Rite Aid to give in to

   01:58  3   Walgreens, because I felt the price was too low; and I

   01:58  4   wanted Walgreens to increase their price.  So it was

   01:59  5   actually two -- could go either way, twofold.  But I

   01:59  6   didn't think -- I would -- I would have thought it would

   01:59  7   have to be Rite Aid, because I'm the one that owns the

   01:59  8   Rite Aid stock, but I don't know.

   01:59  9        Q.   When you say you would have thought it would

   01:59 10   have to be Rite Aid --

   01:59 11        A.   That I would have to go after Rite Aid, because

   01:59 12   I own the stock, but I -- that might be an incorrect

   01:59 13   statement.

   01:59 14        Q.   Uh-huh.  And why would you think that you would

   01:59 15   have to go after Rite Aid, if it's Rite Aid stock?

   01:59 16        A.   Because I wanted them to hold out for more.  I

   01:59 17   didn't want them to give in to the $9 a share.  I felt

   01:59 18   that the stock was worth more than $9 a share.  And I got

   02:00 19   that information from reading news articles from various

   02:00 20   analysts that felt that -- that they could have paid more.

   02:00 21   There was room for increase.  I think it was saying like

   02:00 22   it was worth $11 or $12 a share, but -- something like

   02:00 23   that.

   02:00 24        Q.   So you were contemplating bringing claims

   02:00 25   against Rite Aid related to --

                                                                      124



   02:00  1        A.   Back then.

   02:00  2        Q.   -- the merger price consideration; is that

   02:00  3   correct?

   02:00  4        A.   Back then.

   02:00  5        Q.   Okay.  And were you -- and were you also

   02:00  6   contemplating bringing claims against Walgreens for that?

   02:00  7        A.   I don't think that came up.

   02:00  8        Q.   Were there any -- at this time in, I guess,

   02:00  9   after the merger was announced, in addition to wanting an

   02:00 10   increase in the merger consideration, were you

   02:01 11   contemplating bringing any claims related to disclosures

   02:01 12   that had been made concerning the deal?

   02:01 13                  MR. KNOTTS:  So this is before talking to

   02:01 14   attorneys.  So with that in mind, you can answer.

   02:01 15        A.   No, I was going by what I was reading in the

   02:01 16   news regarding what the analyst thought that the price of

   02:01 17   the stock should be.  Nothing that any of the insiders of

   02:01 18   the company was saying.

   02:01 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What happened with

   02:01 20   respect to the potential claims that you were considering?

   02:01 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  So don't divulge anything

   02:01 22   discussed with your attorneys.  If you can answer without

   02:01 23   doing that, go ahead, but if -- if it involves --

   02:01 24                  THE WITNESS:  All right.

   02:01 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- discussions with attorneys,

                                                                      125



   02:01  1   I instruct you not to answer.

   02:01  2                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I would need an

   02:02  3   instruction and discussions with the attorney.

   02:02  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  You said it would involve

   02:02  5   discussions --

   02:02  6                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

   02:02  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- with attorneys?  Okay.

   02:02  8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   As a factual matter, did you --

   02:02  9   did you ultimately pursue these claims against Rite Aid?

   02:02 10        A.   No.

   02:02 11        Q.   Why not?

   02:02 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.  It calls

   02:02 13   for --

   02:02 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   If you can answer outside of

   02:02 15   privileged communications --

   02:02 16                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, I think we just covered

   02:02 17   that, but --

   02:02 18        A.   I can't -- I can't answer --

   02:02 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   That's fine.

   02:02 20                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

   02:02 21        A.   -- because -- yeah, I can't answer it.

   02:02 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Did you have any

   02:02 23   conversations with anyone other than your attorneys

   02:02 24   concerning your contemplated claims back in, I guess, end

   02:02 25   of 2015?

                                                                      126



   02:02  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.

   02:02  2        A.   I don't remember.  Not to my knowledge.

   02:02  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   02:02  4        A.   Just a -- the only person I had talked to one

   02:02  5   time, and I had mentioned this earlier, was my mother.

   02:03  6        Q.   Okay.  Do you have an understanding of what your

   02:03  7   current -- current scope of your engagement is with

   02:03  8   counsel?

   02:03  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   02:03 10   attorney/client privileged information.

   02:03 11                  To the extent you can answer without

   02:03 12   divulging conversations with us or the engagement

   02:03 13   agreement itself --

   02:03 14        A.   I don't know how -- I don't know how to answer.

   02:03 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

   02:03 16                  (Exhibit 20 marked.)

   02:03 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I am handing you what has been

   02:03 18   marked as Exhibit 20.

   02:03 19        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   02:04 20                  Okay.  I don't see where -- okay.  That's

   02:04 21   my -- my mother.

   02:04 22        Q.   Okay.  So that's my first question.  So

   02:04 23   jvecchia@webtv.net --

   02:04 24        A.   Yes.

   02:04 25        Q.   -- is that your mother's e-mail address?

                                                                      127



   02:04  1        A.   Yes.  She's -- that's her maiden name, Vecchia.

   02:04  2        Q.   And throbbs@aol.com, that's you?

   02:04  3        A.   Yes.

   02:04  4        Q.   And --

   02:04  5        A.   And that was the only time I ever mentioned

   02:04  6   anything.

   02:04  7        Q.   What do you mean?

   02:04  8        A.   In regarding to suing Rite Aid.

   02:04  9        Q.   So this is the only communication that you had

   02:04 10   with anyone outside of your lawyers by e-mail?

   02:04 11        A.   To my knowledge, yes.

   02:04 12        Q.   Okay.  And I take it your mother is not a

   02:04 13   lawyer, so you weren't sending this to her for any legal

   02:04 14   advice?

   02:04 15        A.   No, no, not at all.

   02:05 16        Q.   Okay.

   02:05 17        A.   Not at all.  Yeah, she was -- just, you know,

   02:05 18   internal to the family.

   02:05 19        Q.   Do you know whether your mother discussed this

   02:05 20   with anybody else?

   02:05 21        A.   Oh, no.  She -- no.  She -- how long ago was

   02:05 22   this?  This was in 2015.  Yeah, she was in -- in her 90s

   02:05 23   there.  I don't even think she owns any stock.  So she

   02:05 24   really doesn't have any interest in stock.  No, she -- she

   02:05 25   didn't discuss this with anybody.

                                                                      128



   02:05  1        Q.   And do you know that for a fact or you're just

   02:05  2   surmising based on --

   02:05  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well, objection, because it

   02:05  4   calls for speculation.

   02:05  5        A.   It is speculation.  I -- I mean, I would -- I

   02:05  6   would almost bet my life on it that she hasn't said

   02:05  7   anything to anybody.  I can't see where she -- where she

   02:06  8   would.  Because she didn't do much e-mails.  She didn't

   02:06  9   talk to anybody about it, as far as I know.  But it is

   02:06 10   speculation; I'm not there the entire time.  I'm not

   02:06 11   following her around.

   02:06 12                  But to do it -- there would be no

   02:06 13   interest -- she would have no interest in saying anything.

   02:06 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why did you send her this

   02:06 15   e-mail?

   02:06 16        A.   Let's see.  Because I -- I was talking to her

   02:06 17   about it, and I said -- I was actually talking to her

   02:06 18   about it on the phone, and then later on I -- this is what

   02:06 19   I said.  And it's -- this is probably after I had -- yeah,

   02:07 20   this was after I had talked to the attorneys regarding a

   02:07 21   possible lawsuit.

   02:07 22        Q.   This is a yes or a no.  Did you discuss the

   02:07 23   content of your communications with your lawyers with your

   02:07 24   mother during that phone call?

   02:07 25        A.   No, not -- not during the phone call, no.

                                                                      129



   02:07  1        Q.   Okay.  So what did you discuss with your mother

   02:07  2   during the call about the fact that you were going to sue

   02:07  3   Rite Aid?

   02:07  4        A.   Nothing.  As far as I know, it was -- it was

   02:07  5   short and sweet.  It was basically -- I probably said to

   02:07  6   her, and I forget what -- something prompted me to say

   02:08  7   something to her why I was dissatisfied, and then this is

   02:08  8   what I came out with.

   02:08  9        Q.   Did you ever have any considerations with anyone

   02:08 10   else in your family concerning your communication with

   02:08 11   your lawyers?

   02:08 12        A.   Not to my knowledge.

   02:08 13                  MR. KNOTTS:  And -- just objection, because

   02:08 14   it mischaracterizes the prior testimony.  But, it's fine.

   02:08 15                  MS. ZALKA:  Fair.

   02:08 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Did you have any communications

   02:08 17   with anyone in your family concerning your communications

   02:08 18   with your lawyers?

   02:08 19        A.   Communications, not to my knowledge.

   02:08 20        Q.   How frequently do you -- what's the -- strike

   02:09 21   that.

   02:09 22                  What steps do you take on an ongoing basis

   02:09 23   to monitor this litigation?  Again, not privileged

   02:09 24   communications, I'm just talking to you about what steps

   02:09 25   you take.

                                                                      130



   02:09  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, so don't -- steps I

   02:09  2   think necessarily involves communications with counsel, so

   02:09  3   don't divulge the substance of our conversations, but you

   02:09  4   can answer, as long as you don't disclose the substance.

   02:09  5        A.   The only steps I take is when the counsel gets

   02:09  6   in contact with me directly.  You have to do this.  You

   02:09  7   have to read that.  Can you sign this?  And we're in

   02:09  8   direct contact.  But I don't -- I don't pursue anything

   02:09  9   regarding this.  I'm leaving this up to my attorney to

   02:09 10   handle all of that.

   02:10 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Do you recall filing a

   02:10 12   certification in this litigation?

   02:10 13        A.   I'm not sure what a certification is.

   02:10 14        Q.   Okay.  Do you recall having to file a statement

   02:10 15   concerning your prior experience as a plaintiff in a

   02:10 16   securities action, your transactions in Rite Aid stock?

   02:10 17        A.   I don't remember.

   02:10 18        Q.   Okay.

   02:11 19                  (Exhibit 21 marked.)

   02:11 20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm handing you what has been

   02:11 21   marked as Exhibit 21.

   02:11 22        A.   Oh, that.  Yeah, I remember that.

   02:11 23        Q.   Okay.  What is this document?

   02:11 24        A.   Certification of named plaintiff pursuant to

   02:11 25   federal security laws.  And, yes, I -- I remember this

                                                                      131



   02:11  1   document, yeah, and it had my number of shares.  Yeah.

   02:11  2   Oh, 8,000, and I said 7,000 before.

   02:11  3        Q.   What are you referencing?

   02:11  4        A.   In our early discussions I said I had 7,000

   02:11  5   shares during the period, but it was really 8,000.

   02:11  6        Q.   Oh, you're -- just for the record, you're

   02:11  7   referring to the securities transactions Schedule A that

   02:12  8   is on the second page?

   02:12  9        A.   Yes.  Yes.  I made a mistake; it was 8,000, not

   02:12 10   7,000.

   02:12 11        Q.   Does this accurately reflect the purchases of

   02:12 12   Rite Aid stock that you made during the proposed class

   02:12 13   period?

   02:12 14        A.   It does, except for one item here, this 24,650.

   02:12 15        Q.   Oh, I was actually referring to -- I was asking

   02:12 16   the transactions --

   02:12 17        A.   Oh, okay.

   02:12 18        Q.   -- on the Schedule A.

   02:12 19        A.   Yeah, this is -- this is correct.

   02:12 20        Q.   Okay.  Is there anything that's not correct in

   02:12 21   the certification?

   02:12 22        A.   Well, it -- it probably could have been worded a

   02:12 23   little differently.  So the number of shares that I own

   02:12 24   are -- if you look at the front, the item number 4, it

   02:12 25   says 24,650 shares.  That's actually not my total number

                                                                      132



   02:13  1   of shares.  It's 24,650 plus 8,000.

   02:13  2        Q.   So it's your testimony that, in fact, paragraph

   02:13  3   4 of your certification should read, Plaintiff holds

   02:13  4   32,650 shares?

   02:13  5        A.   You -- you could have worded it that way, yes.

   02:13  6        Q.   Well, I'm not asking --

   02:13  7        A.   Yes.

   02:13  8        Q.   I'm not trying to put words -- I'm asking you

   02:13  9   what --

   02:13 10        A.   That's how much I own.

   02:13 11        Q.   Okay.

   02:13 12        A.   So, yes.

   02:13 13                  So, basically, it's 24,650 in addition to

   02:13 14   what is listed in Schedule A.

   02:13 15        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever corrected that

   02:14 16   certification?

   02:14 17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

   02:14 18   needs correction.

   02:14 19                  But go ahead.

   02:14 20        A.   I didn't think it really needed -- I felt all

   02:14 21   the information was here, the number of shares, as well as

   02:14 22   the Schedule A; so, no, I never pursued to have it

   02:14 23   corrected.

   02:14 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Am I correct that you

   02:14 25   made no sales of Rite Aid stock during the class period?

                                                                      133



   02:14  1        A.   None.

   02:14  2        Q.   Have you made -- have you sold any Rite Aid

   02:14  3   stock since the end of June 2017?

   02:14  4        A.   No, because I would have a pretty major loss, so

   02:14  5   the answer is no.

   02:14  6        Q.   Let's talk about your transaction on June 20th,

   02:15  7   2017.

   02:15  8        A.   June 20th, okay.

   02:15  9        Q.   What information did you rely upon, consider, in

   02:15 10   connection with that specific decision to purchase 7,000

   02:15 11   shares of Rite Aid stock on June 20th?

   02:15 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form, calls for a

   02:15 13   legal conclusion.

   02:15 14                  But you can answer.

   02:15 15        A.   The price had dropped to a point where I felt

   02:15 16   that it had gone low enough, and that the price would

   02:15 17   start increasing.  So you can see from January 2017, the

   02:15 18   price was $8.17, six -- six months later, it was $3.30.  I

   02:16 19   thought it was a good opportunity.

   02:16 20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What analysis did you do to

   02:16 21   consider whether or not it was a good opportunity?

   02:16 22        A.   I -- I just look at the -- the -- I look at the

   02:16 23   chart -- the chart, the graph, okay, and, you know,

   02:16 24   just the -- the moving averages.  And mind you, I'm -- I'm

   02:16 25   no expert at this at all, and some of it's gut feeling.

                                                                      134



   02:16  1   And then, of course, you know, there's analysts.  I think

   02:16  2   I read a couple -- a couple news articles that they were

   02:17  3   saying that it was -- the price was low enough that it was

   02:17  4   considered a good buy.  So this is in the news.

   02:17  5        Q.   Okay.  Is there anything else that you

   02:17  6   considered, other than your gut feeling and a couple of

   02:17  7   news articles, along with the actual price of the stock,

   02:17  8   that you considered in deciding to make this purchase?

   02:17  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, and this has been

   02:17 10   asked and answered and covered throughout the day.

   02:17 11                  But you can answer.

   02:17 12        A.   Well, I mean, I thought the price was going to

   02:17 13   go up to -- you know, I thought the merger was still going

   02:17 14   to go through, so I thought the price was going to move

   02:17 15   higher.

   02:17 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm asking you specifically

   02:17 17   with respect to what are the sources of information that

   02:17 18   you considered in connection with deciding to make this

   02:17 19   specific acquisition on June 20th.

   02:18 20                  So you've identified news articles, your

   02:18 21   gut feeling and the fact that the stock price was low.

   02:18 22                  Was there anything else --

   02:18 23        A.   No.

   02:18 24        Q.   -- that you recall --

   02:18 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  And you just left out -- you

                                                                      135



   02:18  1   just left out what he testified to.

   02:18  2                  MS. ZALKA:  Let's -- don't object until the

   02:18  3   question and the answer has been done.

   02:18  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So is there anything else that

   02:18  5   you considered in terms of a specific disclosure prior to

   02:18  6   the announcement by Walgreens or Rite Aid, that you

   02:18  7   considered in deciding to rely upon -- sorry; that you

   02:18  8   considered in deciding to purchase these 7,000 shares?

   02:18  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   02:18 10                  But you can answer.

   02:18 11        A.   No, I gave you all the -- no, I gave you all the

   02:18 12   information that I felt was correct.

   02:18 13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you say that I felt -- I

   02:18 14   gave you all the information that I felt was --

   02:18 15        A.   Yeah, those were the sources that I looked at to

   02:19 16   make my decision.

   02:19 17        Q.   Okay.  Can you list those sources again.

   02:19 18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   02:19 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I just want to -- go ahead.

   02:19 20                  MR. KNOTTS:  I mean, you're asking him to

   02:19 21   repeat an answer that he already gave.  I mean, again, you

   02:19 22   can --

   02:19 23                  MS. ZALKA:  You know, David --

   02:19 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- but you said could you list

   02:19 25   those sources again.  He listed them.

                                                                      136



   02:19  1                  But go ahead.

   02:19  2        A.   Okay.  Well, primarily news articles.

   02:19  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   02:19  4        A.   Okay.  That is the primary source, okay.  And I

   02:19  5   also look at the stock chart, okay, and the volume of

   02:19  6   trades.  So those are primarily what I looked at.  A lot

   02:19  7   of it has to do with reading news articles and agreeing

   02:19  8   with some of the analysts' recommendations; this is why

   02:20  9   this is a good buy.

   02:20 10                  But I truly thought that the merger was

   02:20 11   going to go through, which is why I -- I guess, I

   02:20 12   purchased this stock, what, eight days before it was

   02:20 13   decided that the merger wouldn't go through.

   02:20 14                  So I must have really thought that it was

   02:20 15   going to go through.

   02:20 16        Q.   In connection with -- you mentioned there was

   02:20 17   some news articles and agreeing with some of the analysts'

   02:20 18   recommendations.

   02:20 19                  Do you recall, based on the news articles

   02:20 20   that you reviewed, there was a variety of different views

   02:20 21   by analysts?

   02:20 22        A.   There could have been.

   02:20 23        Q.   Which one did you agree with?

   02:20 24        A.   I don't know.  You're talking about quite a long

   02:21 25   time ago.  So something triggered my brain to go ahead and

                                                                      137



   02:21  1   purchase these stocks, okay, which I did.  And I can't

   02:21  2   recall exactly which article I was reading back in June

   02:21  3   20th, 2017.  I'm sorry; I just can't do that.

   02:21  4        Q.   Is there anything else that you can recall about

   02:21  5   what informed your decision to make this purchase on June

   02:21  6   20th, other than what you've already testified to?

   02:21  7        A.   No.  I gave you the full explanation.

   02:21  8        Q.   Okay.  And did you consult anybody --

   02:22  9        A.   No.

   02:22 10        Q.   -- in connection with the decision to purchase?

   02:22 11        A.   No.  No.

   02:22 12        Q.   Would you be able to identify or locate the

   02:22 13   press articles that you reviewed in connection with this

   02:22 14   decision to purchase?

   02:22 15        A.   I -- I'm not sure if -- if I did a search,

   02:22 16   and -- you know, I can't guarantee it's the correct

   02:22 17   article that I read three years ago.

   02:22 18                  You know, a lot -- some of these articles,

   02:22 19   it says the same thing over and over again.  I mean, I've

   02:22 20   even seen, you know, one -- one article -- you know, I've

   02:23 21   seen the same article with different headings on it.  So I

   02:23 22   can't point to an exact article.

   02:23 23        Q.   Okay.  Did you review any public statements by

   02:23 24   Walgreens in connection with your decision to make the

   02:23 25   purchase?

                                                                      138



   02:23  1        A.   I don't remember doing so.

   02:23  2        Q.   Okay.  Did you review any public statements by

   02:23  3   Rite Aid in connection with your decision to make this

   02:23  4   purchase?

   02:23  5        A.   No.  I just thought that the deal -- the merger

   02:23  6   was going to go through.  I was hopeful that the merger

   02:23  7   was going to go through.  That's the main reason why I

   02:23  8   purchased it.

   02:23  9        Q.   But ---

   02:23 10        A.   I was still -- I was still a believer that the

   02:23 11   merger would go through.

   02:23 12        Q.   What was that belief based on?

   02:24 13        A.   That Rite Aid and Walgreens would wait for the

   02:24 14   official decision from the FTC, instead of squashing the

   02:24 15   decision.  I was hoping for the official decision from the

   02:24 16   FTC, and there was never one that came through.  And there

   02:24 17   was some reports that they were -- FT -- that the Federal

   02:24 18   Trade Commission was shorthanded.  They only had a few

   02:24 19   people covering this, and they had a lot of other cases to

   02:24 20   cover.  So that's why I thought that there was a delay in

   02:25 21   the decision.  Okay.  And -- well, that's it.

   02:25 22        Q.   Was -- your belief, therefore, was not based on

   02:25 23   any public statements by Rite Aid or Walgreens that you

   02:25 24   can identify?

   02:25 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

                                                                      139



   02:25  1        A.   Not -- not necessarily on that particular time

   02:25  2   that I did that purchase.  I felt that -- I felt that the

   02:25  3   stock had a lot of potential for movement upwards if the

   02:25  4   deal went through -- or I should say when the deal went

   02:25  5   through, not if.

   02:26  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why would you say -- why should

   02:26  7   you say when the deal went through rather than if the deal

   02:26  8   went through?

   02:26  9        A.   Because I purchased the stock thinking that the

   02:26 10   deal was going to go through.

   02:26 11        Q.   But you would recognize that it was a risk that

   02:26 12   the deal wouldn't go through, right?

   02:26 13        A.   With any stock purchase there's always a risk

   02:26 14   associated with it; so, yes, I realized there was a risk.

   02:26 15        Q.   Did you realize that one of the risks associated

   02:26 16   with your decision to purchase Rite Aid on June 20th was

   02:26 17   that the FTC would not approve the deal?

   02:26 18        A.   I thought that they would either approve the

   02:26 19   deal or come up with some other recommendation to divest

   02:26 20   some of their holdings in order to make the deal go

   02:27 21   through.

   02:27 22        Q.   Sure.  But my question was slightly different.

   02:27 23                  It was:  Did you understand when you

   02:27 24   purchased Rite Aid on June 20th, 2017, that one of the

   02:27 25   risks associated with that purchase would be that the FTC

                                                                      140



   02:27  1   did not approve the deal?

   02:27  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  You asked that question, but

   02:27  3   you can answer again -- or sorry; he answered that

   02:27  4   question.

   02:27  5                  Go ahead.

   02:27  6        A.   I -- I felt that it was a better chance of the

   02:27  7   deal going through than not going through.  Which --

   02:27  8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So by -- sorry; go ahead.

   02:27  9        A.   -- is why I purchased the stock on that date.  I

   02:27 10   would not have purchased the stock on the date if I didn't

   02:27 11   think the deal was going to go through.

   02:27 12        Q.   Sure.  But I think by you saying that you

   02:27 13   thought there was a better chance of the deal going

   02:27 14   through than not going through, obviously, you're

   02:27 15   recognizing that there's a risk that the deal was not

   02:27 16   going to go through?

   02:27 17        A.   Of course there was a risk.  I agree with that.

   02:27 18        Q.   Okay.

   02:27 19        A.   Yes.

   02:27 20        Q.   And did you understand all along that that was a

   02:27 21   risk, that the FTC might not approve the deal?

   02:28 22        A.   No, not all along.

   02:28 23        Q.   When did you first appreciate that there was a

   02:28 24   risk the deal would not go through -- be approved by the

   02:28 25   FTC?

                                                                      141



   02:28  1        A.   Heck, when I was -- way down the road, in -- in

   02:28  2   news articles.  It might have been one of the executives

   02:28  3   of Rite Aid also mentioning that the deal was in jeopardy.

   02:28  4   Then I started seeing more and more, as time went on, that

   02:28  5   they were talking more and more about the possible issues

   02:28  6   with the Federal Trade Commission.

   02:28  7                  They also said that they were shorthanded

   02:28  8   at the moment, which could be one of the reasons why

   02:29  9   the -- they did not come out with the official ruling.

   02:29 10        Q.   So --

   02:29 11        A.   I was waiting for the official ruling.

   02:29 12        Q.   In terms of when you first appreciated a risk of

   02:29 13   the deal not being approved by the FTC, you said that that

   02:29 14   was way down the road and it might have been mentioned by

   02:29 15   one of the executives of Rite Aid, and that you started to

   02:29 16   see more and more as time went on that they were talking

   02:29 17   more and more about possible issues with the FTC.

   02:29 18                  Who's the they who were talking more and

   02:29 19   more as time went on about possible issues with the FTC?

   02:29 20        A.   Various stock analysts.

   02:29 21        Q.   And what were the issues that they were

   02:29 22   mentioning?

   02:29 23        A.   Well, it was mentioned that there was a risk of

   02:29 24   going through, but it was also mentioned that there was a

   02:29 25   good possibility that the Federal Trade Commission would

                                                                      142



   02:30  1   come back and -- and require additional concessions.  And

   02:30  2   that's what I thought could possibly happen, if the -- if

   02:30  3   it -- you know, if the deal didn't go through, they say,

   02:30  4   well, you know, you have to -- you have to sell 1,000

   02:30  5   stores, and we'll let the deal go through or -- and -- but

   02:30  6   that didn't happen.

   02:30  7        Q.   And I know you're bad with dates, I understand

   02:30  8   that.

   02:30  9                  When, though -- do you have -- can you give

   02:30 10   me any insight to when you first started to appreciate the

   02:30 11   risk that the FTC would not approve the deal based on what

   02:30 12   you were observing kind of in the news articles?

   02:30 13        A.   I don't -- I don't remember the dates, to tell

   02:31 14   you the truth.  I'd be speculating.

   02:31 15        Q.   Okay.  So if we think about it maybe in terms

   02:31 16   of, right, the deal was announced October 2015; fast

   02:31 17   forward a year to October 2016.

   02:31 18                  Do you recall it being kind of before or

   02:31 19   after --

   02:31 20        A.   No.  I --

   02:31 21        Q.   -- October 2016?

   02:31 22        A.   It was after October 2016.

   02:31 23        Q.   Okay.  And do you think it was in the end of

   02:31 24   2016 or the beginning of 2017?

   02:31 25        A.   Well, no, closer towards the end of June 2017.

                                                                      143



   02:31  1   You know, I was reading some articles that there was

   02:31  2   a -- some possibility that it would not go through.  But,

   02:31  3   then again, I felt that it would go through.

   02:32  4        Q.   Uh-huh.  You testified that -- I asked you the

   02:32  5   question:  When did you first appreciate there was a risk

   02:32  6   that the deal would not be approved by the FTC?  And you

   02:32  7   answered:  Heck, way down the road, in news articles, it

   02:32  8   may have been one of the executives of Rite Aid mentioning

   02:32  9   that the deal was in jeopardy.  Then I started to see more

   02:32 10   and more as time went on, they were talking more and more

   02:32 11   about the possible issues with the FTC.

   02:32 12                  So are you suggesting that that was at the

   02:32 13   end of the -- in June 2017, or before that?

   02:32 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, vague.  Uncertain,

   02:32 15   but go ahead.

   02:32 16        A.   More towards the end.

   02:32 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So when?

   02:32 18        A.   I don't -- I can't give you that information.

   02:32 19        Q.   Do you think it was before or after the

   02:32 20   amendment to the Merger Agreement in January?

   02:33 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Of?

   02:33 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   There was only one, but January

   02:33 23   of 2017?

   02:33 24        A.   I believe after.

   02:33 25        Q.   Okay.  Do you recall learning about the

                                                                      144



   02:33  1   amendment of the Merger Agreement in January 2017?

   02:33  2        A.   I remember reading about the agreement.  And if

   02:33  3   you're referring to the amendment to the agreement, is

   02:33  4   that where the price goes from the $7 to 6.50?

   02:33  5        Q.   Yes.

   02:33  6        A.   Yeah, I remember that.

   02:33  7        Q.   Okay.

   02:33  8        A.   I don't know when I read it, but I read it.

   02:33  9        Q.   Do you think that would have been -- do you

   02:33 10   think that that was something that you learned about

   02:33 11   relatively close to when it was publicly disclosed?

   02:33 12        A.   I don't -- I don't understand the question.

   02:33 13        Q.   Okay.  So you said you don't recall when you

   02:33 14   learned about it?

   02:33 15        A.   I do not recall when I learned about it, no.  I

   02:33 16   don't know the date.

   02:33 17        Q.   Okay.  And so my follow-up question was:  Well,

   02:34 18   if it was publicly disclosed in the end of January, do you

   02:34 19   think that you learned about it around the same time that

   02:34 20   it was publicly announced, or it could have been months

   02:34 21   later?

   02:34 22        A.   It would have been after.  I mean, it's -- I

   02:34 23   don't know.  I did read about the stock quite frequently,

   02:34 24   so -- but I don't know the -- I don't know the time

   02:34 25   period.

                                                                      145



   02:34  1        Q.   What was your reaction to learning about the

   02:34  2   amendment to the Merger Agreement?

   02:34  3        A.   Well, I thought they were doing that

   02:34  4   specifically to get approval from the FTC, because I

   02:34  5   assumed that they were talking to the FTC.  The FTC said

   02:35  6   we're not going to approve this unless you lower the

   02:35  7   number of stores, and low -- lower the price of the

   02:35  8   -- and -- so, I mean, I wasn't happy about it, because it

   02:35  9   went from $9 to 6.50 a share.  There's -- but I -- there

   02:35 10   wasn't much I could do about it.

   02:35 11        Q.   At that point in time, did the update to the

   02:35 12   amendment to the Merger Agreement give you any indication

   02:35 13   that there could possibly be issues with the FTC process?

   02:35 14        A.   Well, when they -- when they changed -- when

   02:35 15   they changed their plan, yeah, I thought there could have

   02:36 16   been issues with the process -- or the approval by the

   02:36 17   FTC.

   02:36 18        Q.   What were the issues that you thought existed at

   02:36 19   that time?

   02:36 20        A.   Well, I mean, basically that Rite Aid

   02:36 21   would -- no, I'm sorry -- Walgreens would have become the

   02:36 22   number one pharmacy, well ahead of CVS.  So I thought that

   02:36 23   they were just trying to level the playing field, per se,

   02:36 24   to lower the number of stores.  And since they were

   02:36 25   lowering the number of stores, it only -- it only shows

                                                                      146



   02:36  1   that you would have to lower -- probably lower the price,

   02:36  2   because they're not buying as many stores now.

   02:37  3                  So it's not as valuable to Rite Aid because

   02:37  4   the number of stores were lowered.

   02:37  5        Q.   I guess at the time of the -- you -- at the time

   02:37  6   you learned about the amendment to the Merger Agreement,

   02:37  7   did that change your view in any way about the risk that

   02:37  8   the FTC might not approve the deal?

   02:37  9        A.   I knew that there was a risk going into this.

   02:37 10   Okay.  And it's just like any merger, there's always a

   02:37 11   risk that it may not go through.

   02:37 12        Q.   Now, when you said you knew there was a risk

   02:37 13   going into this, do you mean in connection with your

   02:38 14   investment in Rite Aid?

   02:38 15        A.   With -- just in general, with any merger.  Okay.

   02:38 16   I know there's a risk with any merger.  And Rite Aid would

   02:38 17   be no different than -- than any merger.  But, again, the

   02:38 18   fact that I bought stock eight days prior to the deal

   02:38 19   being called off, I thought the deal was actually going to

   02:38 20   happen.

   02:38 21        Q.   But you appreciated the risk that it would not?

   02:38 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   02:38 23        A.   I said yes.

   02:38 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   02:39 25                  (Sotto voce discussion between Ms. Zalka

                                                                      147



   02:39  1                  and Ms. Provey.)

   02:39  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Did you review any public

   02:39  3   statements by Fred's between 2015 and 2017?

   02:39  4        A.   Not -- not necessarily specifically only by

   02:39  5   Fred's executives.  A lot of it was just in news articles

   02:39  6   about Fred's.  You know, I thought it was a smart thing at

   02:39  7   the beginning, you know, when Fred's was going to buy the

   02:39  8   Rite Aid stores.  And even if they had to divest even more

   02:40  9   stores, that they were willing to buy up all the stores

   02:40 10   that Rite Aid had.

   02:40 11                  And I got some information about it, but I

   02:40 12   wasn't -- I wasn't following Fred's all the time.  The

   02:40 13   only time I would follow Fred's is if more than one

   02:40 14   company was mentioned in the news articles, it would come

   02:40 15   over to my e-mail.  So if somebody was writing an article

   02:40 16   about Fred's and they put RAD in there or they put

   02:40 17   Walgreens in there, it would come to my e-mail -- it would

   02:40 18   come to my Ameritrade trade account, because it's the same

   02:40 19   symbol.

   02:40 20        Q.   Did you have news alerts set up, whereby you

   02:41 21   would receive e-mails with like a summary of the --

   02:41 22        A.   No, I had no alerts set up my account.

   02:41 23        Q.   So when you said you would get an e-mail, what

   02:41 24   did you mean?

   02:41 25        A.   So -- so when there's an article, okay, if

                                                                      148



   02:41  1   someone's writing about Fred's, and F-R-E-D is the symbol,

   02:41  2   I believe, Fred's -- so if I own Fred's stock, I would --

   02:41  3   if I went into the Fred's -- if I clicked on Fred's, that

   02:41  4   e-mail would show up -- not e-mail -- that news release

   02:41  5   would show up, okay.

   02:41  6                  So if there was -- if there was an article

   02:41  7   that mentioned Fred's, mentioning Rite Aid, and/or

   02:41  8   mentioning Walgreens, okay, that would show up in my RAD

   02:42  9   folder for Ameritrade.

   02:42 10                  So many times I would get e-mails regarding

   02:42 11   Fred's because Rite Aid was men -- also mentioned in the

   02:42 12   same article.

   02:42 13        Q.   Did you -- did you get an e-mail alert -- strike

   02:42 14   that.

   02:42 15        A.   I don't get any alerts.

   02:42 16        Q.   I was going to say strike the word alerts.

   02:42 17                  I'm trying to understand, if there was an

   02:42 18   article that mentioning -- let's just take Rite Aid, an

   02:42 19   article mentioning Rite Aid, and you said that would show

   02:42 20   up in your RAD folder for Ameritrade, would you then get

   02:42 21   e-mails regarding --

   02:42 22        A.   No.

   02:42 23        Q.   -- that?

   02:42 24        A.   No e-mails.

   02:42 25        Q.   So your testimony was:  So many times I would

                                                                      149



   02:42  1   get e-mails regarding Fred's because Rite Aid was also

   02:42  2   mentioned in the same article?

   02:42  3        A.   Then I corrected myself.

   02:42  4        Q.   Okay.

   02:42  5        A.   And I said news.  It's news.  I --

   02:42  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  I think he said -- he said

   02:43  7   e-mails and then he said news --

   02:43  8                  THE WITNESS:  Right.

   02:43  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- and I think you used the

   02:43 10   word e-mails again.  So...

   02:43 11                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

   02:43 12                  MS. ZALKA:  Yeah.

   02:43 13        A.   So I never get any e-mails.  It's all news.

   02:43 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   02:43 15        A.   Okay.  It's all news.

   02:43 16        Q.   Okay.  So when you say news, this is what

   02:43 17   appears in your RAD folder?

   02:43 18        A.   In my -- in my account, yes.

   02:43 19        Q.   Okay.  In the RAD folder in your Ameritrade

   02:43 20   account, how long does it retain these articles?

   02:43 21        A.   Okay.  I've gone back to look for articles, you

   02:43 22   know, and it only goes -- it can only go back, like, two

   02:43 23   or three months at the most.  I'm not sure if it's

   02:43 24   time-related or the number of news releases that there

   02:44 25   are.  Like, perhaps, you know, if one particular company,

                                                                      150



   02:44  1   there's not much news, there may only be 20 over a period

   02:44  2   of a year.

   02:44  3                  So I think it's the number -- I don't

   02:44  4   necessarily know if it's the day or the number that's in

   02:44  5   your -- that's in your -- your RAD folder, as an example.

   02:44  6                  I don't know as far as differentiating

   02:44  7   between a date or the number of articles in your folder.

   02:44  8        Q.   When you asked Ameritrade to collect certain

   02:44  9   documents for purpose of this litigation, did you ask them

   02:44 10   to collect what had been in your RAD folder either

   02:44 11   currently or historically?

   02:44 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   02:44 13                  But go ahead.

   02:44 14        A.   I only asked them for my statements.

   02:44 15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   02:45 16                  MR. KNOTTS:  We've been going about an

   02:45 17   hour.  It looks like you're about to introduce a new

   02:45 18   document.  Is this a good time to take a break?

   02:45 19                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure, if you want to break.

   02:45 20                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah.

   02:45 21                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

   02:45 22   2:45 p.m.

   02:45 23                  (Recess in the proceedings from 2:45

   02:59 24                  to 2:59 p.m.)

   02:59 25                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on record at

                                                                      151



   03:00  1   2:59 p.m.

   03:00  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm handing you what has been

   03:00  3   marked as Exhibit 23.

   03:00  4                  (Exhibit 23 marked.)

   03:00  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Thanks.

   03:00  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  This is Bates-stamped

   03:00  7   PLAINT0001974 to 1975.

   03:00  8        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:00  9        Q.   Do you recognize this e-mail?

   03:00 10        A.   Yeah, that's my brother.

   03:00 11        Q.   Let's start at the bottom of the chain, which is

   03:00 12   at 1975.

   03:00 13        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:00 14        Q.   So on Monday, June 26th, at 6:27 p.m., you write

   03:00 15   to your brother; is that correct?

   03:00 16        A.   Yeah, possibly.  Yes, uh-huh.

   03:00 17        Q.   That's your e-mail address, throbbs@aol.com,

   03:00 18   and that's your brother's e-mail address,

   03:01 19   cliffordherkin@aol.com?

   03:01 20        A.   Yeah.

   03:01 21        Q.   Okay.  And you write, My Rite Aid stock really

   03:01 22   went up a lot today?

   03:01 23        A.   Uh-huh.  Yeah.

   03:01 24        Q.   Why did you send this e-mail to your brother?

   03:01 25        A.   Because -- very well -- my brother thinks he

                                                                      152



   03:01  1   knows everything about investing in stocks, so I just want

   03:01  2   him -- I just wanted him just to get off my back.  I don't

   03:01  3   know; did it go up that day?  I would have to look.

   03:01  4        Q.   Was your brother on your back about your Rite

   03:01  5   Aid investment?

   03:01  6        A.   No, he -- he -- it's many, many different stocks

   03:01  7   that he -- that's all that he likes -- he likes to do a

   03:01  8   lot of trading.  He's retired and he does a lot of

   03:01  9   trading, okay.  But I never -- I never ask him for any

   03:02 10   trading advice, okay.

   03:02 11                  Because, you know, first of all, I don't

   03:02 12   think -- I don't take advice from other people, and I'm

   03:02 13   certainly not going to take advice from my brother.  And

   03:02 14   he -- and I -- and he's the one that -- even though it's

   03:02 15   not here, I think he's the one that initially sent the

   03:02 16   original e-mail for me to respond to.

   03:02 17        Q.   What do you mean?

   03:02 18        A.   I don't know -- I didn't just re -- I don't

   03:02 19   think I just responded to this out of the blue.  I think

   03:02 20   there's -- maybe there's something before this.

   03:02 21        Q.   You think there was another e-mail --

   03:02 22        A.   I don't know.

   03:02 23        Q.   Okay.

   03:03 24        A.   It was 2017, okay.  And I might have even told

   03:03 25   him just to get off -- just to not to have to hear from

                                                                      153



   03:03  1   him, you know, I might have even told him, hey, I sold my

   03:03  2   stock, just so I didn't have to hear his advice, because

   03:03  3   he always -- he thinks he's a mister know-it-all.

   03:03  4   There's -- there's really no love lost between my brother

   03:03  5   and me.  So I don't -- I don't take his advice.  I would

   03:03  6   never take his advice.  If he told me to purchase

   03:03  7   something, I would not -- I wouldn't purchase it just for

   03:03  8   the fact that he told me to purchase it.

   03:04  9                  So I'm not sure -- so I'm not sure -- I

   03:04 10   mean, the stock must have gone up, because it's -- I said

   03:04 11   it went up.

   03:04 12        Q.   And what did you understand from your brother's

   03:04 13   response?

   03:04 14        A.   I don't know what calls and puts are.

   03:04 15        Q.   Okay.

   03:04 16        A.   Okay.

   03:04 17        Q.   Do you know what the next sentence means?

   03:04 18        A.   This is his analysis, and, you know, if it -- if

   03:04 19   the paper was softer, I would use it for another purpose.

   03:04 20   So he -- I don't -- he does this for -- he does this in

   03:04 21   his spare time at home, and I don't -- he -- he's retired.

   03:05 22   I don't have time to monitor stocks in this way.

   03:05 23   Basically, you know what I do; I buy stock and I hope that

   03:05 24   the price goes up.  I don't do calls.  I don't do puts.

   03:05 25   I -- I know nothing about them, okay.

                                                                      154



   03:05  1                  You -- you have my trading documentation.

   03:05  2   You will never see any calls or puts.  It's just I'm

   03:05  3   either buying where I think that the stock is going to go

   03:05  4   up.  Once in a blue moon, I'll buy it short thinking the

   03:05  5   stock's going to go down.  But I don't do that anymore,

   03:05  6   because I lost my shirt on Netflix.

   03:05  7                  So this -- this right here, I can tell you

   03:06  8   that I didn't -- I probably didn't even read the whole

   03:06  9   e-mail.

   03:06 10        Q.   Okay.  Sitting here today --

   03:06 11        A.   Huh?

   03:06 12        Q.   Sitting here today, can you tell me what is your

   03:06 13   understanding of what your brother wrote?

   03:06 14        A.   No, because I don't understand the terminology.

   03:06 15        Q.   Okay.

   03:06 16        A.   I don't understand the terminology.  All right.

   03:06 17   Leave the gap between 350 and 400.  125,000 calls.  Well,

   03:06 18   I don't know what a call is.  To be honest, I don't, okay.

   03:06 19        Q.   Uh-huh.

   03:06 20        A.   And I certainly -- you know, I work all day.

   03:06 21   You know, a lot of times nine hours a day, ten hours a

   03:06 22   day, and I don't have time to be doing all this.  I'd

   03:06 23   probably get fired if I was online all day long trying to

   03:07 24   trade calls and puts.

   03:07 25                  So I just -- I'm a simple trader.  The

                                                                      155



   03:07  1   stock is going to go up or it's going to go down.

   03:07  2                  But I was -- you know, 99 percent of the

   03:07  3   time, all my stocks pretty much I'm buying with the

   03:07  4   expectation that I'm buying low and selling high.

   03:07  5        Q.   When you bought your Rite Aid stock during the

   03:07  6   class period, so that 8,000 shares purchased on January

   03:07  7   3rd, 1,000 shares and then June 20th, 7,000 shares, were

   03:07  8   you intending to hold them for the long-term?

   03:07  9        A.   Towards the -- at end or during the whole

   03:07 10   period?

   03:07 11        Q.   We can take it one by one.  I guess, you know,

   03:07 12   when you purchased 1,000 Rite Aid shares on January 3rd,

   03:07 13   2017 --

   03:07 14        A.   Right.

   03:07 15        Q.   -- were you intending to hold those shares for

   03:08 16   the long-term?

   03:08 17        A.   Well, they had already announced the merger, so,

   03:08 18   no, I was -- I was planning on -- when -- I was hoping

   03:08 19   when the news came through, okay, I would be bought out.

   03:08 20        Q.   Uh-huh.

   03:08 21        A.   I don't even -- it wasn't even a matter of a

   03:08 22   stock swap; it was a complete buy out.  So, no, I was -- I

   03:08 23   was not -- at this point, I was not planning on a

   03:08 24   long-term investment when I made those purchases.

   03:08 25        Q.   Okay.  Let's go back to the e-mail with your

                                                                      156



   03:08  1   brother.

   03:08  2        A.   Uh-huh.  Yeah.

   03:08  3        Q.   So you write on June 29th at 9:48 a.m.

   03:09  4                  Do you see that?

   03:09  5                  You write, I sold my positions yesterday

   03:09  6   near the high?

   03:09  7        A.   Yeah, just to get him off my -- my back.

   03:09  8        Q.   That was not an accurate statement?

   03:09  9        A.   That was an inaccurate statement --

   03:09 10        Q.   Okay.

   03:09 11        A.   -- just to get him off my back.  Okay.  So this

   03:09 12   way I don't have to hear from him anymore.

   03:09 13                  MR. KNOTTS:  Did it work?

   03:09 14                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

   03:09 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Sorry.

   03:09 16                  THE WITNESS:  It did.

   03:09 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And you did not sell any Rite

   03:09 18   Aid stock, correct?

   03:09 19        A.   I, honest to God, never sold any Rite Aid stock.

   03:09 20        Q.   Okay.

   03:09 21        A.   And my portfolio will show that.

   03:09 22        Q.   So do you write again at 10:59 a.m., they backed

   03:10 23   out of the merger because they were afraid of not getting

   03:10 24   approval by the FTC?

   03:10 25        A.   Yes.

                                                                      157



   03:10  1        Q.   Who's the they in that sentence?

   03:10  2        A.   Well, both Walgreens and Rite Aid.

   03:10  3        Q.   Okay.  What was this statement that you make

   03:10  4   here based on?

   03:10  5        A.   Well, wasn't this after it was announced that it

   03:10  6   wouldn't be approved?

   03:10  7        Q.   Do you think there was disclosure that it

   03:10  8   wouldn't get approved?

   03:10  9        A.   This is after the date, right?

   03:10 10        Q.   So June 29th, 2017, in terms of the termination

   03:10 11   of the merger agreement?

   03:10 12        A.   Right.

   03:10 13        Q.   Yes.

   03:10 14        A.   So that -- that's why I wrote it.

   03:10 15        Q.   But was there anything specific that led you to

   03:10 16   believe that they backed out because they were afraid of

   03:10 17   not getting approval by the FTC?

   03:10 18        A.   Yeah, there was news articles that day that

   03:11 19   that's the reason they backed out.

   03:11 20        Q.   Did you review either Rite Aid's or Walgreens'

   03:11 21   issued disclosures that day?

   03:11 22        A.   Not -- not the company disclosures --

   03:11 23        Q.   Yeah.

   03:11 24        A.   -- just the news articles.

   03:11 25        Q.   Okay.  Did you have any other communications

                                                                      158



   03:11  1   with your brother concerning Walgreens or Rite Aid, to the

   03:11  2   best of your recollection?

   03:11  3        A.   I'm almost sure that I didn't.  I don't remember

   03:11  4   for sure, but I think this -- I think this might have been

   03:11  5   the extent of it.  And then after I told him I liquidated,

   03:11  6   I don't think it came up anymore after that.  Then what he

   03:11  7   probably did, he probably sent me something about another

   03:11  8   stock; hey, you got to buy this stock.  It's like, okay,

   03:12  9   Gary.

   03:12 10        Q.   Did your brother hold Rite Aid stock?

   03:12 11        A.   Yeah, I think he did.  He did purchase Rite Aid

   03:12 12   stock.  Don't ask me how much or how many puts, or

   03:12 13   whatever, I have no idea.  He did it after -- to my

   03:12 14   knowledge, he -- I could have sworn he did his after.  Or

   03:12 15   but maybe not.  Does it say that he -- does it say that he

   03:12 16   -- he bought it here.

   03:12 17                  (Witness reviews document.)

   03:12 18                  No.  He's giving me advice on what I should

   03:12 19   do, but I don't think he bought any at this point in time.

   03:12 20   I think when he bought it, it was after the merger was

   03:12 21   called off.  And -- but -- but, yeah, I remember him

   03:13 22   telling me that he bought some, but I don't know what the

   03:13 23   date was.

   03:13 24        Q.   Okay.  Does your brother know that you're a

   03:13 25   named plaintiff in this lawsuit?

                                                                      159



   03:13  1        A.   Later on, but not -- as far as I know, not then.

   03:13  2   Later on.  I just mentioned it to him.  I didn't show him

   03:13  3   any documents or anything like that.  Whatever it was --

   03:13  4   any discussion I had, it was within my family.  And they

   03:13  5   weren't detailed discussions by any means.

   03:13  6        Q.   Have you had any discussions with your brother

   03:13  7   about kind of the substance of your complaints against

   03:13  8   Walgreens?

   03:13  9        A.   No.

   03:13 10        Q.   Do you know whether your brother's shares -- has

   03:13 11   your brother expressed any views to you about any

   03:14 12   statements made by Walgreens or Rite Aid about the deal?

   03:14 13        A.   No, not to my knowledge.

   03:14 14        Q.   Let's mark Exhibit 22.

   03:15 15                  (Exhibit 22 marked.)

   03:15 16        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   03:15 17                  Okay.

   03:15 18        Q.   Do you recognize this document?

   03:15 19        A.   I'm not sure if I did.  I didn't read it all,

   03:15 20   because it was way, way too much information here.  I

   03:15 21   don't remember.

   03:15 22        Q.   So let me clarify the question.  I'm not asking

   03:15 23   you for purposes of the litigation nor any communications

   03:15 24   you had with your lawyers about disclosures.

   03:15 25                  I'm asking kind of about the time in

                                                                      160



   03:15  1   October -- you know, between October 2015 and June 2017 --

   03:15  2        A.   So --

   03:15  3        Q.   Let me --

   03:15  4        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:15  5        Q.   -- start with that premise of when I'm asking

   03:15  6   you questions about have you reviewed something, it's in

   03:15  7   the context, you know, of that time period, October 2015

   03:15  8   through June 2017?

   03:15  9        A.   Right, okay.  So if you're referring to that I

   03:15 10   took it upon myself to look this particular document up --

   03:15 11        Q.   Yes.

   03:15 12        A.   -- and review it; no, I did not.

   03:16 13        Q.   Okay.  So if I can turn to -- turn to page 11.

   03:16 14        A.   (Witness complies.)

   03:16 15        Q.   Are you familiar with what the risk factors are

   03:16 16   that a public company discloses, generally?

   03:16 17        A.   Well, I know there's risk factors.  I assume

   03:16 18   they have that disclosed, what they are.

   03:16 19                  Page 11?

   03:16 20        Q.   Yes.  And you'll see at the top it says -- and

   03:16 21   just for the record, this is the Form 10-K for fiscal year

   03:16 22   ended August 31st, 2016, filed by Walgreens Boots

   03:16 23   Alliance, Inc.

   03:16 24                  You'll see at the top it says a -- it's in

   03:16 25   the risk factors section.  It says, We may not be able to

                                                                      161



   03:16  1   successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of

   03:16  2   Rite Aid.

   03:16  3                  Do you see that?

   03:16  4        A.   No.

   03:17  5        Q.   Oh, I think you just need to (indicating).

   03:17  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Which page?

   03:17  7                  MS. ZALKA:  Page 11.

   03:17  8                  MR. KNOTTS:  All right.

   03:17  9        A.   What paragraph?

   03:17 10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   The very top of the page.

   03:17 11        A.   Okay.  We may not be able to successfully and

   03:17 12   timely complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid.

   03:17 13                  Okay.  Yeah, that was -- I don't remember

   03:17 14   seeing that in this document.  But what's your question?

   03:17 15        Q.   Okay.  If you turn to the first paragraph.  It

   03:17 16   says, Risks and uncertainties related to our pending

   03:17 17   acquisition of Rite Aid, include, among others, the

   03:17 18   occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that

   03:17 19   could give rise to the termination of the merger

   03:17 20   agreement, including that regulatories or other approvals

   03:18 21   required for the transaction are not obtained.

   03:18 22                  Do you see that?

   03:18 23        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:18 24        Q.   Did you understand at the time that Walgreens

   03:18 25   had disclosed this risk that regulatory or other approvals

                                                                      162



   03:18  1   might not be obtained?

   03:18  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

   03:18  3                  Go ahead.

   03:18  4        A.   I did not read this particular document to see

   03:18  5   that.

   03:18  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You don't dispute, though, that

   03:18  7   that was a disclosure that Walgreens made, right?

   03:18  8        A.   I'm assuming that this filing is correct, so I

   03:18  9   would agree.

   03:18 10        Q.   Okay.

   03:18 11        A.   What's the date of this filing?

   03:18 12        Q.   This is for the fiscal year ending October 31st,

   03:18 13   2016.

   03:18 14        A.   Okay.

   03:18 15        Q.   And if you could just go on to the next

   03:18 16   paragraph.

   03:18 17        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:18 18        Q.   And you can take a minute to read it, and then

   03:18 19   I'll ask you questions.

   03:18 20        A.   The completion of the transaction; that one?

   03:18 21        Q.   Yep.

   03:18 22        A.   Okay.

   03:19 23                  (Witness reviews document.)

   03:19 24                  Okay.

   03:19 25        Q.   So Walgreens disclosed that in deciding whether

                                                                      163



   03:19  1   or not to object to the transaction, regulatory agencies

   03:19  2   have broad discretion in administrating the applicable

   03:19  3   government regulation --

   03:19  4                  Yes.  Sorry; when I'm reading, I go faster.

   03:19  5                  And it goes on to say that, We can provide

   03:19  6   no assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals

   03:19  7   on any particular time table, or at all, or that any such

   03:20  8   conditions that are imposed would not diminish the

   03:20  9   anticipated benefits of the transaction, or result in the

   03:20 10   termination of the transaction.

   03:20 11                  Do you see that?

   03:20 12        A.   Yeah.

   03:20 13        Q.   Did you understand that as a disclosed risk by

   03:20 14   Walgreens during the period?

   03:20 15        A.   Well, I mean, this -- a lot of this, to me,

   03:20 16   looks like a canned statement that you -- you would see in

   03:20 17   any 10-K form, some wording similar to that, because you

   03:20 18   have to disclose what the risks are.

   03:20 19        Q.   And in your view, is Walgreens disclosing what

   03:20 20   the risks are in that statement, as you sit here today?

   03:20 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for a legal

   03:20 22   conclusion, calls for speculation.

   03:20 23                  Go ahead.

   03:20 24        A.   Well, they're -- they're mentioning -- you know,

   03:20 25   it's just like forward-looking statements that you see --

                                                                      164



   03:21  1   they're -- this is what this is, basically, this is a

   03:21  2   forward-looking statement that I would expect any company

   03:21  3   to put out.

   03:21  4                  So, yes, I understand that they -- that

   03:21  5   they would have a statement like this.  I did not read

   03:21  6   this statement.

   03:21  7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And I'm asking -- I understand

   03:21  8   that you didn't read the statement at the time, but I'm

   03:21  9   asking, sitting here today, based on what you were

   03:21 10   reading, right, of the words that were disclosed, does

   03:21 11   this disclose the risk that Walgreens may not timely or

   03:21 12   successfully get regulatory approval for the Rite Aid

   03:21 13   deal?

   03:21 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for a legal

   03:21 15   conclusion, calls for speculation.

   03:21 16                  You can answer.

   03:21 17        A.   Yes -- yeah, this is saying that there is risks.

   03:21 18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Risks of what?

   03:21 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objections.

   03:22 20        A.   That the deal may not go through.  It's like

   03:22 21   any -- any merger there's always a risk that the deal is

   03:22 22   not going to go through.

   03:22 23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   03:22 24        A.   And I just look at this as, you know, the

   03:22 25   forward-looking statement that would be in any legal

                                                                      165



   03:22  1   document.

   03:22  2        Q.   Do you not rely on forward-looking statements or

   03:22  3   consider them?

   03:22  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   03:22  5                  MS. ZALKA:  I'll object for -- I'll strike

   03:22  6   that.

   03:22  7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you consider the disclosures

   03:22  8   the companies make with respect to the risks --

   03:22  9        A.   Yes.

   03:22 10        Q.   -- that face them?

   03:22 11        A.   Yes.  I -- I -- I take -- might take it with a

   03:22 12   little grain of salt, but, yeah, I mean, I can appreciate

   03:22 13   the fact that they're putting this in here.

   03:23 14        Q.   What do you appreciate about it?

   03:23 15        A.   Well, there's some -- you know, they're --

   03:23 16   they're disclosing somewhat, but it's just -- again, it's

   03:23 17   a canned forward-looking statement that you would see in

   03:23 18   any document.  So...

   03:23 19        Q.   What do you mean when you say, Canned

   03:23 20   forward-looking statement?

   03:23 21        A.   Well, you can almost take Rite Aid out and put

   03:23 22   any other company's name in here, change the -- some of

   03:23 23   the dollar amounts and some of the percentages, and dates,

   03:23 24   and it could be any company.

   03:23 25        Q.   Well, this wasn't a disclosure about any

                                                                      166



   03:23  1   company, this was a disclosure by Walgreens about the

   03:23  2   pending acquisition of Rite Aid, correct?

   03:23  3        A.   Yes.  Now that you provided me with this

   03:24  4   document, I understand that.

   03:24  5        Q.   Okay.

   03:24  6        A.   But this is the first time I've seen this

   03:24  7   statement.

   03:24  8        Q.   And I'm just asking you, and I understand you

   03:24  9   didn't read it at the time, but now kind of sitting here

   03:24 10   today, one of the risks that you think Walgreens didn't

   03:24 11   disclose with relation to the FTC approval on the

   03:24 12   acquisition of Rite Aid --

   03:24 13                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for a legal

   03:24 14   conclusion.  I'll instruct you not --

   03:24 15        A.   I don't know what the --

   03:24 16                  MS. ZALKA:  No, no.

   03:24 17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Hold on.  Hold on.  Just let

   03:24 18   me finish my objection.

   03:24 19                  I'll instruct you not to answer to the

   03:24 20   extent it involves things you learned from us during the

   03:24 21   lawsuit, but you can answer to the extent you have had an

   03:24 22   understanding coming in yourself.

   03:24 23        A.   I don't have an answer for you.

   03:24 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I'm not asking for anything

   03:24 25   that your lawyers told you.

                                                                      167



   03:24  1        A.   No.

   03:24  2        Q.   Right?  Just to be clear, I'm not trying to get

   03:24  3   at privileged information.  I'm actually more interested

   03:24  4   in what your understanding is of this disclosure.

   03:24  5                  And so having read it now, sitting here

   03:25  6   today, what do you think that Walgreens did not disclose

   03:25  7   in terms of the risks related to FTC approval of the Rite

   03:25  8   Aid transaction?

   03:25  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  And same objections.  You

   03:25 10   know, don't disclose anything you learned from us or in

   03:25 11   connection with this lawsuit, but you can answer based on

   03:25 12   your own independent understanding.

   03:25 13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Correct.

   03:25 14        A.   Well, they're documents what the risks are in

   03:25 15   this particular document.  And I would expect something

   03:25 16   like that in any legal document.  That's it.

   03:25 17        Q.   Okay.  So what were the risks -- having read

   03:25 18   this document now, what were the risks that you think

   03:25 19   Walgreens did not disclose concerning the possibility that

   03:25 20   the FTC would not approve the transaction?

   03:25 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  The question's been asked

   03:25 22   three times.  Same objection, don't disclose anything that

   03:26 23   you learned from your attorneys during the lawsuit, but

   03:26 24   you can answer to the extent you have anything to add to

   03:26 25   what you said previously.

                                                                      168



   03:26  1        A.   I thought they would have -- they would have had

   03:26  2   the press releases earlier on about the difficulties that

   03:26  3   they were having with the merger.  I didn't see that.

   03:26  4   Okay.

   03:26  5                  This says that it's possible it may not go

   03:26  6   through.  But there were -- evidently there were

   03:26  7   discussions and Rite Aid -- not Rite Aid -- Walgreens knew

   03:26  8   earlier on that this deal may not go through.  But

   03:26  9   I -- it's my interpretation, my understanding that they

   03:26 10   waited to announce the issue -- announce that the deal may

   03:27 11   not go through.

   03:27 12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   This --

   03:27 13        A.   Officially announce.

   03:27 14        Q.   What do you mean officially announce the deal

   03:27 15   would not go through?

   03:27 16        A.   Well, I think they knew the deal wouldn't go

   03:27 17   through earlier than it was formally announced.

   03:27 18        Q.   Okay.  How much earlier?

   03:27 19        A.   I don't know.

   03:27 20        Q.   Roughly?

   03:27 21        A.   I don't know.

   03:27 22        Q.   Are you talking a matter of months?

   03:27 23        A.   Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it could be.

   03:27 24        Q.   Weeks or months?

   03:27 25        A.   Well, I think it could be several weeks.

                                                                      169



   03:27  1        Q.   But not several months?

   03:27  2        A.   Right.

   03:27  3        Q.   Okay.  So you believe that Walgreens knew that

   03:27  4   the FTC wouldn't approve the deal several weeks before it

   03:27  5   was formally announced, but not several months before it

   03:28  6   was formally announced?

   03:28  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll ask you not to

   03:28  8   divulge things that we've talked about or you've learned

   03:28  9   from your attorneys.  She's just asking you about your

   03:28 10   understanding going into this case.  Right?

   03:28 11                  MS. ZALKA:  Uh-huh.

   03:28 12        A.   That was my understanding.

   03:28 13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Is that your

   03:28 14   understanding currently?

   03:28 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.  She's not

   03:28 16   asking for things that we've talked about, or that you've

   03:28 17   learned from us.  But you can answer your own personal

   03:28 18   understanding coming into the case.

   03:28 19        A.   Yes, I think it could have been weeks and not

   03:28 20   months.  I certainly hope it wasn't months.  But I do know

   03:28 21   that there was the time extension.  And I think the

   03:28 22   duration of that time extension, they may have had a good

   03:28 23   idea, whatever the duration of that time extension is.

   03:29 24   And I don't remember what the duration of the time

   03:29 25   extension is.

                                                                      170



   03:29  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you say, The time

   03:29  2   extension, are you referring to the amendment of the

   03:29  3   Merger Agreement in January or something else?

   03:29  4        A.   The second one.  I think there was a -- there

   03:29  5   was a second plan.  This -- this wasn't the original

   03:29  6   agreement.  This was -- there was an extension on the

   03:29  7   agreement.  I don't know when the date of the extension

   03:29  8   was, but I was -- you know, I was waiting for the Federal

   03:29  9   Trade Commission report on this.  And then an article came

   03:29 10   out that said that there's been an extension.  And as far

   03:29 11   as I know, it was a several-month extension.

   03:29 12                  And I don't know that they -- if they knew

   03:30 13   then that the deal wouldn't go through, or if it was a few

   03:30 14   weeks before the deal wouldn't go through.  I don't know.

   03:30 15   I don't have access to that information.  I just don't

   03:30 16   know.

   03:30 17        Q.   Uh-huh.  Now, you mentioned that you recall --

   03:30 18   that the only thing you recall reviewing in terms of a

   03:30 19   disclosure by Walgreens during the 2016 and 2017 period

   03:30 20   was between one and five press releases.

   03:30 21                  Do you recall that from this morning?

   03:30 22        A.   Yeah.

   03:30 23        Q.   Okay.  I want to show you the press release to

   03:30 24   see if that helps refresh your recollection about which

   03:30 25   specific press releases you may have reviewed or you did,

                                                                      171



   03:31  1   in fact, review.  Okay?

   03:31  2        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:31  3                  (Exhibit 24 marked.)

   03:31  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm handing you what has been

   03:31  5   marked as Exhibit 24.  And maybe this will help orient you

   03:31  6   to the document.  So this is the Form 8-K that was filed

   03:32  7   that attaches, you'll see, the press releases as an

   03:32  8   exhibit.

   03:32  9                  So for the record, this is the Form 8-K

   03:32 10   filed January 7, 2017 -- January 7th, 2016.

   03:32 11        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   03:33 12                  I don't remember reading this.

   03:33 13        Q.   You don't think this was one of the press

   03:33 14   releases that you reviewed?

   03:33 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  You can answer.

   03:33 16        A.   No.  I -- I do not remember reading this.

   03:33 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So I am handing you what

   03:33 18   has been marked as Exhibit 25.

   03:33 19                  (Exhibit 25 marked.)

   03:33 20                  MR. KNOTTS:  Thank you.

   03:33 21                  MS. ZALKA:  No worries.

   03:33 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And this is a Form 8-K filed by

   03:33 23   Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., April 5, 2016.

   03:34 24                  This also has a press release attached as

   03:34 25   Exhibit 99.1.  And there is a discussion of the Rite Aid

                                                                      172



   03:34  1   acquisition on page 2 of the press release at the bottom.

   03:34  2        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   03:35  3                  No, I don't remember this one.

   03:35  4        Q.   Okay.  So based on your recollection, you don't

   03:35  5   think you reviewed this press release at the time?

   03:35  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, that's not what he

   03:35  7   said.

   03:35  8        A.   I don't remember.

   03:35  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You don't remember reviewing

   03:35 10   it?

   03:35 11        A.   It's not that I didn't; I just don't remember.

   03:35 12        Q.   Do you have any reason to believe you did?

   03:35 13        A.   I would be speculating.  I would be guessing,

   03:35 14   and I don't want to do that.

   03:35 15        Q.   Okay.  So -- you -- but this statement -- so

   03:35 16   just so the record is clear, Exhibit 25 doesn't contain

   03:36 17   either of the two statements that you mentioned as the

   03:36 18   statements that you took issue with by Walgreens.  So the

   03:36 19   no objection -- there will be no opposition by the FTC

   03:36 20   statement or the special relationship with the FTC

   03:36 21   statement.

   03:36 22        A.   All right.  What paragraph are we talking about

   03:36 23   specifically?

   03:36 24        Q.   You're welcome to read the whole thing.  The

   03:36 25   discussion on the press release is on the second paragraph

                                                                      173



   03:36  1   with respect to the Rite Aid deal -- I mean, the last --

   03:36  2   second page, the last paragraph.

   03:36  3        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   03:36  4                  Oh, I didn't see that page.

   03:37  5                  (Witness reviews document.)

   03:37  6                  Okay, there are certain similarities to the

   03:37  7   statement here, but I can't say that this is the actual

   03:37  8   press release that -- that I read or if it was from a news

   03:37  9   article quoting one of the executives.

   03:37 10        Q.   When you said there were certain similarities to

   03:37 11   the statement here, what did you mean?

   03:37 12        A.   Saying that they're continuing the plan and

   03:37 13   continuing -- continues to expect the transaction to

   03:37 14   close.

   03:37 15        Q.   Is it your testimony that the statement that

   03:38 16   it's continuing integration planning and continues to

   03:38 17   expect the transaction to close in the second half of

   03:38 18   calendar year 2016, is this the statement that you

   03:38 19   referenced earlier with -- by Walgreens, which you said

   03:38 20   that Walgreens stated that there would be no opposition by

   03:38 21   the FTC?

   03:38 22        A.   I -- I don't know if this is the exact

   03:38 23   statement, but this is -- this is along the lines.

   03:38 24        Q.   How are those two things the same or along the

   03:38 25   same lines?

                                                                      174



   03:38  1        A.   Well, because it's saying that they expect the

   03:38  2   transaction to close.  And --

   03:38  3        Q.   Is that a guarantee that the FTC would approve

   03:38  4   it?

   03:38  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, argumentative.

   03:38  6   That's not what he said.

   03:38  7        A.   No, it's not a guarantee.

   03:38  8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is it a statement that there

   03:38  9   would be no opposition or objection by the FTC?

   03:38 10        A.   Not right now, no.  It does not say that.

   03:38 11        Q.   It does not say that.

   03:38 12                  And you do not interpret it that way

   03:38 13   sitting here today?

   03:39 14        A.   I don't -- I just interpret it as they're very

   03:39 15   confident that the deal is going to close.

   03:39 16        Q.   You're interpreting this that way?

   03:39 17        A.   Which, in part, has to do with FTC approval.

   03:39 18        Q.   Why does the statement that they continue to

   03:39 19   expect the transaction to close in the second half of

   03:39 20   calendar 2016, why do you interpret that as an expression

   03:39 21   of very confident that the deal is going to close?

   03:39 22        A.   Because they mention it here.  So I --

   03:39 23        Q.   Do -- go ahead.

   03:39 24        A.   I believe them, but this is not the -- this may

   03:39 25   not be the exact statement that I read.

                                                                      175



   03:39  1        Q.   Okay.

   03:39  2        A.   Okay.  So my interpretation of the statement

   03:39  3   that I read was that the -- that the -- they were

   03:39  4   confident that the deal would go through.

   03:40  5        Q.   And you recall --

   03:40  6        A.   It may not be this exact statement.

   03:40  7        Q.   Yeah.  And I'm just trying to -- so from a

   03:40  8   record perspective, the reason why I'm showing you these

   03:40  9   press releases is I want to understand what specific

   03:40 10   statement it is that you were discussing when you say

   03:40 11   that.

   03:40 12        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:40 13        Q.   So do you think that this press release contains

   03:40 14   the statement you referenced before with respect to either

   03:40 15   the special relationship with the FTC statement or the --

   03:40 16        A.   This does not come out and say they have a

   03:40 17   special relationship with the FTC.  That is -- this only

   03:40 18   says that they're confident that the deal will go through.

   03:40 19        Q.   They say they're confident the deal will go

   03:40 20   through or that they expect the transaction to close?

   03:40 21        A.   Well --

   03:40 22        Q.   Are those two things synonymous to you?

   03:40 23        A.   To me it says the same thing.

   03:40 24        Q.   Okay.  Using different words?

   03:40 25        A.   I think, yeah.

                                                                      176



   03:40  1        Q.   Okay.  But this is not -- based on your best

   03:41  2   recollection, is this the press release that you recall

   03:41  3   reviewing at the time?

   03:41  4        A.   I don't believe so.

   03:41  5        Q.   Okay.

   03:41  6                  (Exhibit 26 marked.)

   03:41  7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Exhibit 26.  So what has been

   03:41  8   marked as Exhibit 26 is the Form 8-K filed by Walgreens

   03:41  9   Boots Alliance July 6th, 2016.

   03:41 10                  And if you look on page 2, going over to

   03:41 11   the top of page 3.

   03:42 12        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   03:43 13                  It's like -- yes, it looks like a

   03:43 14   similar -- looks like a statement I may have read, but it

   03:43 15   may not necessarily have been in the form of an 8-K either

   03:43 16   that I read it.

   03:43 17        Q.   Uh-huh.

   03:43 18        A.   It may have been in the form of an analyst's

   03:43 19   quotation of a -- of the Form 8-K.

   03:43 20                  But, again, it does mention that they

   03:43 21   expect Rite Aid transaction to close in the second half.

   03:43 22                  But, again, it does mention that they

   03:43 23   expect Rite Aid transaction to close in the second half.

   03:43 24        Q.   Do you recall reading this press release at the

   03:44 25   time that it was issued?

                                                                      177



   03:44  1        A.   I -- I may -- I may have read this press

   03:44  2   release, but I -- I don't know for sure.  I -- I did read

   03:44  3   press releases, because the press release would come

   03:44  4   through as a -- as news.

   03:44  5        Q.   When you say come through as news, what do you

   03:44  6   mean?

   03:44  7        A.   It would -- it would come through if I clicked

   03:44  8   on -- on RAD, for instance, it would come through.  If --

   03:44  9   you would -- sometimes I -- I would get press releases

   03:44 10   regarding the company.  And I don't think I ever received

   03:44 11   these as -- directly as a result -- from the company as a

   03:44 12   result of being a shareholder.  I don't think I've

   03:44 13   ever -- I don't think they ever sent me these directly.

   03:45 14                  But I have seen press releases via news

   03:45 15   articles in my Ameritrade account.

   03:45 16        Q.   So do you believe that you reviewed a news

   03:45 17   article that may have quoted this press release or

   03:45 18   reviewed the press release itself?

   03:45 19        A.   I can't say.

   03:45 20        Q.   Okay.  Does this press release contain the

   03:45 21   statement that you take -- one of the two statements that

   03:45 22   take -- strike that.

   03:45 23                  Does this press release contain either of

   03:45 24   the two statements that you have complained about with

   03:45 25   respect to disclosures by Walgreens?

                                                                      178



   03:45  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

   03:45  2   misstates prior testimony.

   03:45  3        A.   Well, it says that the transaction -- they

   03:45  4   expect the transaction to -- to continue.  So, yes, I -- I

   03:46  5   would interpret this as the -- right now things are smooth

   03:46  6   sailing is the way I would interpret that.

   03:46  7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Uh-huh.  Is this telling you

   03:46  8   that -- did you interpret this to be some form of

   03:46  9   guarantee that it would always be smooth sailing?

   03:46 10        A.   No, there was -- there was never any expectation

   03:46 11   of a guarantee.

   03:46 12        Q.   Okay.  Did this imply in any way that it will be

   03:46 13   smooth sailing going forward?

   03:46 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   03:46 15        A.   No, there's -- there's -- there's no -- there's

   03:46 16   no guarantee, but it -- this would come -- this would make

   03:46 17   me feel better -- when this comes directly from the

   03:46 18   company, it -- it would make me feel -- it makes me feel

   03:47 19   better reading it than -- than -- than saying that we --

   03:47 20   we don't expect this transaction is going -- going to go

   03:47 21   through.

   03:47 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Uh-huh.

   03:47 23        A.   And I don't know if they knew one way or another

   03:47 24   when this was -- when this press release -- I know one way

   03:47 25   -- I don't know one way or another what -- what they knew,

                                                                      179



   03:47  1   if -- if this was going to go through or not.

   03:47  2        Q.   Uh-huh.

   03:47  3        A.   I don't know any bumps along the road.  I don't

   03:47  4   remember, at least at the beginning stages, hearing about

   03:47  5   any bumps in the road.

   03:47  6        Q.   Do you --

   03:47  7        A.   Only towards the end I started seeing -- hearing

   03:47  8   about bumps in the road.  And that -- and that was

   03:47  9   basically from news articles of analysts.

   03:47 10        Q.   Was the extension of the time to consummate the

   03:47 11   merger agreement a bump along the road?

   03:48 12        A.   I'm sorry.

   03:48 13        Q.   Was the extension of time --

   03:48 14        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:48 15        Q.   -- to close the merger, to consummate the Merger

   03:48 16   Agreement, was that a bump along the road?

   03:48 17        A.   Yeah, I felt that that was a bump along the

   03:48 18   road.

   03:48 19        Q.   So that would have been -- was that one of the

   03:48 20   first times that you recall being aware of, as you would

   03:48 21   say, bumps along the road or that it wasn't --

   03:48 22        A.   Yes.

   03:48 23        Q.   -- smooth sailing?

   03:48 24        A.   Yes.

   03:48 25        Q.   And that was based on the company's disclosure

                                                                      180



   03:48  1   that they were extending the time to consummate the

   03:48  2   merger?

   03:48  3        A.   Yes.  But then there was one analyst that said

   03:48  4   that the F -- FTC -- there was only like two people

   03:48  5   working at the FTC at the time, and they had a backlog.

   03:48  6   So I also thought that, well, you know, maybe it's -- you

   03:48  7   know, maybe it's taking so long right now because there --

   03:48  8   there's a backlog there.

   03:48  9        Q.   Did Walgreens ever make a statement that it was

   03:48 10   taking longer because there was a backlog at the FTC?

   03:48 11        A.   No, they did not.  This was through an analyst.

   03:49 12        Q.   Okay.  And if you turn to page 6 of the press

   03:49 13   release of Exhibit 26.

   03:49 14        A.   Yeah.

   03:49 15        Q.   And you'll see at the bottom of the long

   03:49 16   paragraph, the italicized paragraph that starts,

   03:49 17   Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.

   03:49 18                  Do you see that at the bottom of page 5 --

   03:49 19        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:49 20        Q.   -- continued on to page 6?

   03:49 21                  I will not -- for the sake of brevity, I

   03:49 22   will say that you are welcome to read the entire thing,

   03:49 23   but I'm going to be pointing you to -- it's at the --

   03:49 24   towards the end of the disclosure on page 6.

   03:49 25        A.   Okay.

                                                                      181



   03:49  1        Q.   And it says -- it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

   03:49  2   10, it's roughly 10 lines up from the bottom.

   03:49  3                  And there is a disclosure that all

   03:49  4   statements in the press release that are not historical,

   03:49  5   including that limitation, those regarding estimates and

   03:49  6   goals for future financial and operation performance, that

   03:50  7   those -- that there are risks associated with

   03:50  8   acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic

   03:50  9   investments, including those relating to our ability to

   03:50 10   satisfy the closing conditions and consummate the pending

   03:50 11   acquisitions of Rite Aid and related matters on a timely

   03:50 12   basis or at all.

   03:50 13                  You see that?

   03:50 14        A.   Yes, I see that.

   03:50 15        Q.   And did you read that -- do you recall reading

   03:50 16   that language at any time?

   03:50 17        A.   No, I don't recall reading it.  It's -- it's

   03:50 18   just forward-looking language that you see in any

   03:50 19   disclosure, especially one that's a company press release.

   03:50 20        Q.   Uh-huh.

   03:50 21        A.   This is a typical statement.

   03:50 22        Q.   And this -- so you're not disputing that at this

   03:50 23   -- in its press release, Walgreens referred readers to the

   03:51 24   potential risks associated, right, with the --

   03:51 25        A.   Well, I would --

                                                                      182



   03:51  1        Q.   -- completion of the Rite Aid deal?

   03:51  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, misstates

   03:51  3   testimony.  I'll ask you not to disclose any

   03:51  4   attorney/client communications, but you can answer.

   03:51  5        A.   I would be surprised if they didn't have

   03:51  6   something in -- like that in here, because it's -- it's --

   03:51  7   it's just standard language that you -- you will see in

   03:51  8   any press release.  It's like if I -- any press release

   03:51  9   that I read of a particular stock, and especially stock

   03:51 10   that I own, they always have statements, similar

   03:51 11   statements.

   03:51 12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you always not read the

   03:51 13   statements?

   03:51 14        A.   Well, it's -- I don't always read the

   03:51 15   statements.  It becomes old, because I -- I do know

   03:52 16   what -- and I -- I do know what -- what it's saying.

   03:52 17   Okay.  Yes, there -- there's certain risk involved, and,

   03:52 18   you know, current performance doesn't necessarily mean

   03:52 19   future performance.  And, yes, I -- I realize that there

   03:52 20   -- there's risk involved.

   03:52 21                  And I would be surprised if a statement

   03:52 22   like this wasn't -- wasn't in there.

   03:52 23        Q.   And did you understand, at the time that you

   03:52 24   made your investments, that Walgreens had disclosed the

   03:52 25   risks that the Rite Aid deal may not actually close?

                                                                      183



   03:52  1        A.   No, I didn't know that.

   03:52  2        Q.   Having read what is Exhibit 22, the form with

   03:52  3   the risk factors (indicating) --

   03:52  4        A.   20 -- oh.

   03:52  5        Q.   -- which is incorporated by -- I'll represent

   03:53  6   that this is incorporated by reference to the press

   03:53  7   release.

   03:53  8        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:53  9                  And?

   03:53 10        Q.   Having read that, do you think that Walgreens by

   03:53 11   making a statement that it expects the transaction to

   03:53 12   close in the second half of 2016 while at the same time

   03:53 13   disclosing that there are risks that the FTC may not

   03:53 14   approve the deal, that Walgreens was somehow implying that

   03:53 15   things would be smooth sailing going forward?

   03:53 16        A.   I interpreted it as it was smooth sailing going

   03:53 17   forward.

   03:53 18        Q.   Is it fair to say that's just your

   03:53 19   interpretation, it's not actually what Walgreens

   03:53 20   disclosed?

   03:53 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  You asked for his

   03:53 22   interpretation.

   03:53 23                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm asking -- I'm following up.

   03:53 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Go ahead.

   03:53 25        A.   Yes.  And -- and that was my interpretation,

                                                                      184



   03:53  1   that -- that the deal would close.  There was no

   03:53  2   opposition currently.  The -- that the deal would close.

   03:54  3   But I -- but I -- I understand that they're legally

   03:54  4   response -- they're legally -- they legally have to put a

   03:54  5   -- a statement like that in here stating the merger may

   03:54  6   not go through.  I -- I understand that.  But -- but that

   03:54  7   is not what was in one of the press releases that -- that

   03:54  8   I read or --

   03:54  9        Q.   Let's go -- keep going on the press releases

   03:54 10   then.  So just if we go back to Exhibit 26, which is the

   03:54 11   press release you just had before you.  We were looking at

   03:54 12   the cautionary note language.

   03:54 13        A.   Okay.  26, yeah.

   03:54 14        Q.   Uh-huh.

   03:54 15        A.   And what page?

   03:54 16        Q.   Page 6.

   03:55 17        A.   Yes.

   03:55 18        Q.   Do you -- do you have an understanding as to how

   03:55 19   what is in Exhibit 22 relates to what is on the bottom of

   03:55 20   page 6?  And if you don't, you can answer yes or no.

   03:55 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

   03:55 22   calls for a legal conclusion.

   03:55 23                  You can just answer --

   03:55 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Yeah.

   03:55 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- based on your current

                                                                      185



   03:55  1   understanding.

   03:55  2        A.   I'm not sure what it means.

   03:55  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So the next press

   03:55  4   release.

   03:55  5                  I'm handing you what's been marked as

   03:55  6   Exhibit 27.

   03:55  7                  (Exhibit 27 marked.)

   03:55  8        Q.   This is the Form 8-K filed by Walgreens Boots

   03:55  9   Alliance on October 20th, 2016.

   03:56 10        A.   Uh-huh.

   03:56 11        Q.   Now, you can take your time, but if you look on

   03:56 12   page 3, there's a discussion about the Rite Aid

   03:56 13   acquisition in the press release that's attached as

   03:56 14   Exhibit 99.1.

   03:56 15        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   03:57 16                  Yes, I remember reading this, but I don't

   03:57 17   know again if it was this actual document or it was a

   03:57 18   quotation from a analyst.  But, yes, I -- I do remember

   03:57 19   the -- the center paragraph where it mentions divesting

   03:57 20   the -- the stores.

   03:57 21        Q.   Is this the press release, or the content of the

   03:57 22   press release that you testified to during your deposition

   03:57 23   today, with respect to a statement by Walgreens that there

   03:57 24   would be no opposition by the FTC?

   03:58 25        A.   This -- this is how I interpret that, again,

                                                                      186



   03:58  1   that -- that -- basically that -- that they will overcome

   03:58  2   any -- any bumps in the road.  There wouldn't be any

   03:58  3   problems.  That's -- that's how I -- how I interpret this.

   03:58  4   For the mere fact that they're diversing -- divesting, I

   03:58  5   should say, the number of stores between 500 and 1,000

   03:58  6   stores.  And I don't know -- I'm not sure if this is when

   03:58  7   Harry's came -- or Fred's came along.  I'm not sure if

   03:59  8   this is the time period.

   03:59  9        Q.   What about the statement is misleading?

   03:59 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.  I'll instruct you

   03:59 11   not to divulge conversations with your attorneys in

   03:59 12   connection with this lawsuit.  But to the extent you have

   03:59 13   an independent understanding, you can answer.

   03:59 14        A.   Well --

   03:59 15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I'm -- and again, I'm only

   03:59 16   asking, and I did say this at the beginning, but let me

   03:59 17   repeat it.

   03:59 18                  I'm asking for your recollection and

   03:59 19   interpretation of the statements between October 2015 and

   03:59 20   the end of the class period on June 2017.

   03:59 21                  So I'm asking for kind of what you actually

   03:59 22   recall thinking, reading, seeing during that period, not

   03:59 23   what you've discussed with counsel for purposes of this

   03:59 24   litigation.

   03:59 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.  So not even after that

                                                                      187



   03:59  1   period, it's just if -- if you saw this statement, what

   03:59  2   did you think -- did you think it was misleading at the

   03:59  3   time you read it.

   03:59  4                  MS. ZALKA:  Correct.

   03:59  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

   03:59  6                  MS. ZALKA:  And he's testified, I think,

   04:00  7   that there was two types of statements that he believed he

   04:00  8   understood as of June 2017 to have been previously

   04:00  9   misleading.

   04:00 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  He's test -- so he's testified

   04:00 11   to more than that.  You focused on two, but he's testified

   04:00 12   to a whole host of statements.

   04:00 13                  MS. ZALKA:  That's not accurate.

   04:00 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  He has, but that's fine.

   04:00 15                  MS. ZALKA:  I mean --

   04:00 16        A.   The -- this right here just -- I mean, basically

   04:00 17   it tells me that they're -- in order for the deal to go

   04:00 18   through, that they have to sell a certain number of

   04:00 19   stores, okay.

   04:00 20                  So they're doing what they can to make sure

   04:00 21   that the deal will go through.  That's my understanding.

   04:00 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And I guess that references

   04:00 23   that all of this is actually pending FTC approval, right?

   04:00 24        A.   Yes.  Yes.  It's pending the FTC approval.

   04:01 25        Q.   So either when you read this at the time or when

                                                                      188



   04:01  1   the Merger Agreement was terminated in June 2017, or you

   04:01  2   read a news article quoting this.  Like, what about this

   04:01  3   is -- is misleading to you?

   04:01  4        A.   It may not be this particular paragraph that was

   04:01  5   misleading to me.  I -- you asked me if I read this

   04:01  6   paragraph.  And I believe I did read this paragraph.  And

   04:01  7   located in some -- somewhere.  I didn't say that I

   04:01  8   felt -- I don't believe I said that I felt that this was

   04:01  9   misleading.

   04:01 10                  I had all the confidence in the world that

   04:01 11   this merger was going to go through.  And to me, it looks

   04:02 12   like they're doing what they can to have the merger go

   04:02 13   through.  I don't -- I'm not saying that this particular

   04:02 14   statement is misleading.

   04:02 15        Q.   Okay.  And so in June 2017, when the merger

   04:02 16   agreement was terminated --

   04:02 17        A.   Uh-huh.

   04:02 18        Q.   -- do you -- at that point, did you think that

   04:02 19   there was something about this statement that simply

   04:02 20   because the Merger Agreement was terminated in June of

   04:02 21   2017, that would be nine months later, that the October

   04:02 22   2016 press release was miss -- became misleading somehow?

   04:02 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Which -- you say this

   04:02 24   statement.

   04:02 25                  MS. ZALKA:  Yeah, the paragraph that we've

                                                                      189



   04:02  1   just been discussing, that Mr. Dayton just read.

   04:02  2        A.   No, I think they -- they were working on trying

   04:02  3   to close the deal.  I mean, that's --

   04:03  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   04:03  5        A.   But I don't know what -- what -- the background,

   04:03  6   you know, behind closed door discussions were with the

   04:03  7   FTC.

   04:03  8        Q.   Next press release, thank you.

   04:03  9                  (Exhibit 28 marked.)

   04:03 10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Exhibit 28.  Okay.  The Form

   04:03 11   8-K filed by Walgreens Boots on December 20th, 2016.  And

   04:03 12   if you look at Exhibit 99.1, there is a press release

   04:03 13   entitled Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid Reach

   04:03 14   Agreement to Sell 865 Rite Aid Stores to Fred's Pharmacy.

   04:03 15        A.   Yeah, I read that.

   04:04 16        Q.   So this is -- do you have a specific

   04:04 17   recollection of reading this press release?

   04:04 18        A.   Oh, yeah.

   04:04 19        Q.   Okay.  So is there any statement in here that

   04:04 20   you believe, sitting here today, was misleading?

   04:04 21        A.   I have to read it.

   04:04 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  So objection.  I'll --

   04:04 23                  MS. ZALKA:  Outside of the conversations

   04:04 24   with counsel.

   04:04 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, don't disclose

                                                                      190



   04:04  1   discussions with attorneys or things that you learned from

   04:04  2   us, but you can answer to your understanding independently

   04:04  3   just coming into the lawsuit.

   04:04  4        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   04:05  5                  Okay.

   04:05  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So is this the press release

   04:06  7   that you mentioned earlier that contains a statement that

   04:06  8   you believe is misleading concerning the special FTC

   04:06  9   relationship or the no opposition by the FTC?

   04:06 10        A.   Well, this -- I don't know if it was this

   04:06 11   particular press release, but I did read about Fred's

   04:06 12   purchasing 865 -- or possibly purchasing 865 Rite Aid

   04:06 13   stores.  And this was ordered in order to be divested and

   04:06 14   able to obtain FTC approval.

   04:06 15        Q.   Did you understand, having read this press

   04:06 16   release that -- as it's reflected in the first sentence --

   04:06 17   the first sentence of the second paragraph, the agreement

   04:07 18   is being entered into to respond to concerns identified by

   04:07 19   the FTC in its review of the proposed acquisition of Rite

   04:07 20   Aid by Walgreens?

   04:07 21        A.   Yes, I -- yes, I agree with that.

   04:07 22        Q.   Did that indicate smooth sailing to you or bumps

   04:07 23   in the road?

   04:07 24        A.   Well, again, it's -- any -- pretty much any

   04:07 25   acquisition of two like companies where you -- it has to

                                                                      191



   04:07  1   go through FTC approval.  So, again, these are

   04:07  2   forward-looking statements that you would -- you would

   04:07  3   want to disclose in -- in any press release just to pretty

   04:07  4   much cover yourself.

   04:07  5        Q.   What about the sentence I just read is

   04:07  6   forward-looking?

   04:07  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for a legal

   04:07  8   conclusion.  Go ahead.

   04:08  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm not asking you as a lawyer.

   04:08 10   I'm just asking you as, like, how does a statement about

   04:08 11   the agreement is being entered into to respond to concerns

   04:08 12   identified by the FTC?

   04:08 13        A.   Well, that's -- okay.  That -- that is -- I

   04:08 14   mean, if that is that they're -- they're -- that they're

   04:08 15   actually responding to something that the F -- FTC asked

   04:08 16   for, then, obviously, that's not forward-looking.

   04:08 17        Q.   Okay.  So did you understand when you read this

   04:08 18   press release at the time --

   04:08 19        A.   Uh-huh.

   04:08 20        Q.   -- that concerns had actually been identified by

   04:08 21   the FTC?

   04:08 22        A.   Yes, I -- I knew that there were some concerns,

   04:08 23   but the -- what I was referring to was the -- the

   04:08 24   transaction is subject to FTC approval, that that -- that

   04:08 25   is pretty much a forward-looking statement.  And the

                                                                      192



   04:09  1   approval and completion of the pending acquisition of Rite

   04:09  2   Aid by Walgreens and other closing -- closing conditions,

   04:09  3   that's the forward-looking statement I was referring to.

   04:09  4                  The other statement is basically either

   04:09  5   Rite Aid and/or Walgreens responding to a concern that the

   04:09  6   FTC had.  And --

   04:09  7        Q.   I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

   04:09  8        A.   And I don't know if it's smooth sailing or not.

   04:09  9   All they're doing is -- basically all they're doing is

   04:09 10   responding to a concern, so...  Yeah.

   04:09 11                  And I thought that the diversing was

   04:10 12   the -- was them answering the F -- FTC concerns.

   04:10 13        Q.   How did your view of the risk that the deal

   04:10 14   might not be approved by the FTC change, if at all, as a

   04:10 15   result of the disclosure that the FTC had concerns?

   04:10 16        A.   Well, I still felt the deal was going to go

   04:10 17   through, especially when -- it's not in this release, I

   04:10 18   believe.  I'm not sure if it is.  But when Fred's agreed

   04:10 19   to buy even more than the 865 stores if they had to

   04:10 20   diverse even more stores in order to get the approval.

   04:10 21        Q.   Why did you short Fred's stock on the same day

   04:11 22   of this announcement?

   04:11 23        A.   I don't know.  Did I?  I don't remember if I did

   04:11 24   or not.  Huh, did I?

   04:11 25        Q.   Why did you take a short position in Fred's

                                                                      193



   04:11  1   stock on the day of this announcement?

   04:11  2        A.   Because if I did short it -- and I don't even

   04:11  3   remember shorting it, but if I did short it, it was

   04:11  4   because they probably couldn't afford to purchase -- I

   04:11  5   didn't think that they could afford to purchase 685 -- or

   04:11  6   865 stores even though that they -- they might get the

   04:11  7   approval.  I don't know, did I short the stock?

   04:11  8        Q.   Do you have any recollection of shorting the

   04:11  9   stock?

   04:11 10        A.   No, I don't remember, to tell you the truth.

   04:11 11        Q.   What's -- what do you hope to do when you short

   04:11 12   a stock, generally?  How does a short position work?

   04:11 13        A.   That the price is going to go down.  And it was

   04:12 14   probably something that I read in one the news articles.

   04:12 15   And I did short it; I decided to short it.

   04:12 16        Q.   So you didn't think they could purchase 865

   04:12 17   stores?

   04:12 18        A.   No.  I thought they could purchase the 865

   04:12 19   stores, but I thought that that would run the -- even

   04:12 20   though they can purchase it, it would still run the stock

   04:12 21   down.

   04:12 22        Q.   So what aspect of this announcement did you

   04:12 23   think would result in a lower stock price for Fred's?

   04:12 24        A.   Because this was a out of pocket.  Purchasing

   04:13 25   865 shares is a lot of money -- or 865 stores, sorry, is a

                                                                      194



   04:13  1   lot of money and that's a lot of out -- pocket expense.

   04:13  2   So at least I felt for the short term -- excuse me -- that

   04:13  3   the price would go down.  It's funny, though, I don't even

   04:13  4   remember shorting it.

   04:13  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, So --

   04:13  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Let's go to Exhibit 15.

   04:13  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, if you don't

   04:13  8   remember --

   04:13  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Oh, Exhibit --

   04:13 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- and I think she's okay with

   04:13 11   this, if -- if -- you can testify as to what you

   04:13 12   remember --

   04:13 13                  THE WITNESS:  Right.

   04:13 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- but don't speculate.  And I

   04:13 15   think she's okay with that instruction.

   04:13 16        A.   Right.  Yeah, I -- I don't remember purchasing

   04:13 17   it.  But if I did, I purchased it thinking that the price

   04:13 18   was going to go down, if I shorted it.

   04:14 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And if we can go to Exhibit 5,

   04:14 20   it's in front of you.

   04:14 21        A.   Is this 5 again, Exhibit 5?

   04:14 22        Q.   Exhibit 5.  It's one -- Exhibit 5.  It's one of

   04:14 23   your Ameritrade statements for your --

   04:14 24        A.   It's in here?

   04:14 25        Q.   Yeah, it will be in your pile.

                                                                      195



   04:14  1        A.   Oh.

   04:14  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, so you just -- you'll

   04:14  3   have to find it in there.

   04:14  4                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

   04:14  5                  15?

   04:14  6                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

   04:14  7   4:14 p.m.

   04:17  8                  (Recess in the proceedings from 4:14

   04:17  9                  to 4:17 p.m.)

   04:17 10                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

   04:17 11   4:17 p.m.

   04:17 12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So we're looking at

   04:17 13   Exhibit 5.

   04:17 14                  Do you recognize this document, Mr. Dayton?

   04:17 15        A.   I recognize the symbol.  I don't remember this

   04:17 16   transaction.  But, obviously, it happened because it's in

   04:17 17   my statement.

   04:17 18        Q.   Okay.  And is this a monthly account statement

   04:17 19   for your Ameritrade account ending in 3791 for December

   04:17 20   2016?

   04:17 21        A.   Yes.

   04:17 22        Q.   Okay.  And if we go to page 3.  It says --

   04:17 23        A.   Uh-huh.

   04:17 24        Q.   -- short stocks Fred?

   04:17 25        A.   Yes, I see it.

                                                                      196



   04:17  1        Q.   Okay.  Can you tell me anything about why you

   04:18  2   decided to short Fred's stock on December 20th, 2016, the

   04:18  3   date of the announcement of the Walgreens/Fred's deal?

   04:18  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

   04:18  5   a couple times.

   04:18  6        A.   Yeah, I don't remember completely.  As I

   04:18  7   mentioned, my thought process was the price of the stock

   04:18  8   was going to go down based on the press release.

   04:18  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Did you ever -- I believe you

   04:18 10   testified that you did not make any transactions in

   04:18 11   Walgreens securities in 2016 --

   04:18 12        A.   I don't remember.

   04:18 13        Q.   -- and 2017.

   04:18 14        A.   I don't remember if I did or not.  I -- I may

   04:18 15   have, but I -- I don't remember.  I have -- I have a lot

   04:18 16   of stocks.  I don't remember completely -- look, I -- I

   04:18 17   didn't remember Fred's.  I don't even remember owning

   04:19 18   Fred's.  So -- so I guess I'm a little haphazard when it

   04:19 19   comes to some things.

   04:19 20                  But this is -- it's funny I -- it's funny.

   04:19 21   I -- I don't remember.  And what was the date on this?

   04:19 22   2016.  Okay.  I don't even remember purchase -- shorting

   04:19 23   Fred's, but -- but I did.  And I may have -- I may

   04:19 24   have -- I think I may have owned Walgreens stock.  At some

   04:19 25   point in my -- my life, I think I may have owned it.

                                                                      197



   04:19  1        Q.   It's more specifically focused on the period of

   04:19  2   2016 and 2017.

   04:19  3        A.   I may have.  If I can look at my statement

   04:19  4   during that time period.  I -- I may have purchased it.

   04:19  5        Q.   Is there a reason why you wouldn't have

   04:19  6   purchased Walgreens at the same time that you were

   04:20  7   purchasing Rite Aid?

   04:20  8        A.   I felt there was more up-side to Rite Aid.

   04:20  9        Q.   Sorry.  Go ahead.

   04:20 10        A.   And Walgreens would be putting out -- it would

   04:20 11   be a huge investment for -- for Walgreens, and any time

   04:20 12   there's a huge investment stocks, you know, can go -- can

   04:20 13   go down.  I thought there was just more upside to -- to

   04:20 14   Rite Aid.

   04:20 15        Q.   So you thought that the deal might, at least, in

   04:20 16   some -- for some time period have a downward pressure

   04:20 17   price -- downward pressure on Walgreens stock price?

   04:20 18        A.   It could have.  And -- and if I -- if I ever

   04:20 19   owned Walgreens, and, you know, perhaps -- I don't want to

   04:21 20   speculate, but, you know, perhaps I purchased it on a dip

   04:21 21   or something, but I don't -- again, just like with Fred's,

   04:21 22   I don't remember specifically.  I may have owned

   04:21 23   Walgreens.  I'm not going to say I did or I didn't.  I --

   04:21 24   I may have.

   04:21 25        Q.   Uh-huh, okay.

                                                                      198



   04:21  1                  As of the end of June of 2017, right, so

   04:21  2   when the termination of the Merger Agreement was

   04:21  3   announced.

   04:21  4        A.   June -- let me -- the termination, okay.

   04:21  5        Q.   Yeah.

   04:21  6        A.   Uh-huh.

   04:21  7        Q.   Why did you think that Walgreens misled

   04:21  8   investors?

   04:21  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   04:22 10   Revealing any discussions with your attorneys, you -- you

   04:22 11   can answer keeping in mind -- keeping in mind that you've

   04:22 12   been asked this question before.

   04:22 13        A.   Oh, yeah, I thought I've answered it several

   04:22 14   times.

   04:22 15                  I thought that -- I thought they were going

   04:22 16   to wait for the FTC approval, formal approval even if the

   04:22 17   time period came up -- or was -- was up.  But I believe

   04:22 18   the FTC had to make a decision before the time period was

   04:22 19   up, that was my understanding, maybe I'm wrong, so I

   04:22 20   thought that they would have -- FTC would make a decision

   04:22 21   before the time period was up, but they didn't wait for

   04:22 22   the decision.

   04:22 23                  And I don't know if they would have

   04:23 24   approved it or not.  I mean, maybe not.  They're the ones

   04:23 25   that were in discussion with the FTC.  But I was waiting

                                                                      199



   04:23  1   for the formal decision from the FTC.  And that's it.

   04:23  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So I asked -- and with

   04:23  3   respect to -- do you have any view or understanding as of,

   04:23  4   again, the termination of the Merger Agreement

   04:23  5   announcement --

   04:23  6        A.   Uh-huh.

   04:23  7        Q.   -- I don't want any conversations you had with

   04:23  8   counsel, but why do you think -- why do you think that

   04:23  9   Walgreens made those misleading statements, meaning -- let

   04:23 10   me clarify it a little bit, to -- what was the reason why

   04:23 11   they did it?  What was the benefit to Walgreens?

   04:23 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   04:23 13   speculation.

   04:23 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm just asking for your

   04:23 15   understanding --

   04:23 16        A.   I don't know.

   04:23 17        Q.   -- if you have any.

   04:23 18        A.   I don't know.  I haven't -- no.  I have no idea

   04:24 19   what -- what their thought process was for that.

   04:24 20        Q.   Uh-huh.

   04:24 21        A.   I -- I don't know.

   04:24 22        Q.   So there's no theory of kind of motive that came

   04:24 23   to your mind in June 2017?

   04:24 24        A.   I don't know.  I'm -- I'm not speculating.

   04:24 25        Q.   I'm just asking -- I'm not asking you to

                                                                      200



   04:24  1   speculate, I'm asking you specifically --

   04:24  2        A.   No, I --

   04:24  3        Q.   -- in June 2017, when the Merger Agreement

   04:24  4   was announced --

   04:24  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll object.

   04:24  6        A.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   -- the termination of the

   04:24  7   Merger Agreement was announced.

   04:24  8                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll object, by

   04:24  9   definition, it calls for speculation.

   04:24 10                  Go ahead.

   04:24 11        A.   Yeah, I don't want to -- I don't want to

   04:24 12   speculate, so I can't answer that question.

   04:24 13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why can't you answer the

   04:24 14   question?

   04:24 15        A.   Because I'll be speculating.

   04:24 16                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.

   04:24 17                  There you go.

   04:24 18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm not asking you to

   04:24 19   speculate.  I'm asking you yes or no, did you form any --

   04:24 20   did you form a view in June of 2017, when the Merger

   04:24 21   Agreement was terminated, as to a theory of motive --

   04:24 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   04:24 23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   -- by Walgreens?

   04:24 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   04:24 25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Just yes or no.  It's not

                                                                      201



   04:25  1   speculation.  You either did or you didn't have a view at

   04:25  2   that point in time.

   04:25  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   04:25  4   speculation.

   04:25  5                  MS. ZALKA:  It doesn't, but okay.  Go

   04:25  6   ahead.

   04:25  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  You're asking about what's in

   04:25  8   others people -- other people's head.

   04:25  9                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm not, I'm asking --

   04:25 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  A motive of someone else.

   04:25 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm asking you.  Mr. Dayton,

   04:25 12   let me just clarify.

   04:25 13                  MS. ZALKA:  And stop.  That's not what I'm

   04:25 14   asking.  Listen to my question.

   04:25 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  I did.

   04:25 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Mr. Dayton, I'm asking you,

   04:25 17   okay, whether in June 2017, when the termination of the

   04:25 18   Merger Agreement was announced, did you think about

   04:25 19   Walgreens' motive in any way, shape or form?  I'm not

   04:25 20   asking you to speculate about what that motive was.  I'm

   04:25 21   asking --

   04:25 22        A.   Okay.

   04:25 23        Q.   -- did you, yes or no?

   04:25 24        A.   I mean --

   04:25 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

                                                                      202



   04:25  1   speculation.

   04:25  2                  MS. ZALKA:  It doesn't, but, okay.

   04:25  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Go ahead.  You can -- do you

   04:25  4   understand my question?

   04:25  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Just ignore my objections and

   04:25  6   -- and he can answer.  It'll be much easier.

   04:25  7                  So objection, calls for speculation.  You

   04:25  8   can answer.

   04:25  9        A.   Okay.  Well, I -- I thought that -- that the --

   04:25 10   the last deal -- I thought they were in -- in the process

   04:25 11   of coming up with another deal.  And come to find out they

   04:26 12   were in the process of coming up with another deal.  And

   04:26 13   that deal was that they would buy, I'm not sure of the

   04:26 14   number, but almost half of Rite Aid stores.

   04:26 15                  So when -- when it was -- when it was

   04:26 16   immediately announced that the deal fell through, I don't

   04:26 17   know what I was thinking.  But after they decided to

   04:26 18   purchase half of the stores, I was thinking, could this

   04:26 19   have been planned?

   04:26 20                  That's what -- that was my -- my thinking.

   04:26 21   Was -- was it planned to -- to work out this way?  I don't

   04:27 22   know.

   04:27 23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Were they planning for the

   04:27 24   merger agreement not to be executed, is that what

   04:27 25   you're --

                                                                      203



   04:27  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   04:27  2   speculation.

   04:27  3                  MS. ZALKA:  Let -- let me just finish my

   04:27  4   question.

   04:27  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay, sorry.

   04:27  6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you said that I was

   04:27  7   thinking could this have been planned, is the "this" in

   04:27  8   that sentence that the Merger Agreement would not be

   04:27  9   actually consummated?

   04:27 10        A.   Only -- only towards the end, not at the

   04:27 11   beginning.

   04:27 12        Q.   Okay.

   04:27 13        A.   And not halfway through.  Just when -- the --

   04:27 14   and I'll use it again, when they start running into what I

   04:27 15   -- what I thought was significant bumps in the road.

   04:27 16        Q.   And were those significant bumps the extension

   04:27 17   of time to consummate and then --

   04:27 18        A.   Uh-huh.

   04:27 19        Q.   -- the amendment of the Merger Agreement?

   04:27 20        A.   Yes.  You know, that extension -- it went from

   04:28 21   bad to worse.

   04:28 22        Q.   And you understood that it was going from bad to

   04:28 23   worse in connection with those disclosures?

   04:28 24        A.   Well, I mean, it was $9 a share, then it went to

   04:28 25   6.50 a share, so that went bad to worse.  And then after

                                                                      204



   04:28  1   that, it went from 6.50 a share to nothing.  And half the

   04:28  2   company would -- would -- would be lost, the entire half

   04:28  3   of the company of -- of Rite Aid would be -- would be

   04:28  4   lost.  The company would -- would be cut in half.  I -- I

   04:28  5   wasn't happy about that at all.

   04:28  6        Q.   Was that the principal thing that you weren't

   04:28  7   happy with upon the announcement of the termination of the

   04:28  8   Merger Agreement?

   04:28  9        A.   There are a lot of things I wasn't happy with.

   04:28 10   There's not one over the other.  It's just an accumulation

   04:29 11   of unhappiness.

   04:29 12        Q.   Beyond them -- beyond the Asset Purchase

   04:29 13   Agreement that was announced on June 29th, and the not

   04:29 14   waiting for the formal decision by the FTC, those are two

   04:29 15   things you weren't happy with, correct?

   04:29 16        A.   Right.

   04:29 17        Q.   What else weren't you happy with, as of the date

   04:29 18   of the announcement of the termination?

   04:29 19        A.   Well, those -- those were primarily the items

   04:29 20   that you mentioned.

   04:29 21        Q.   Okay.  Anything else, as you sit here today,

   04:29 22   that you can recall?

   04:29 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  As of -- as of that date,

   04:29 24   right?

   04:29 25                  MS. ZALKA:  Yep.

                                                                      205



   04:29  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

   04:29  2        A.   No.

   04:29  3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Uh-huh.  And when you -- you

   04:29  4   said that you thought that they may have been planning it,

   04:29  5   meaning the -- some Asset Purchase Agreement, is that

   04:29  6   being planned by Rite Aid or Walgreens or both?

   04:30  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   04:30  8   speculation.

   04:30  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm asking about --

   04:30 10                  MS. ZALKA:  Fair.

   04:30 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm asking about your

   04:30 12   understanding of what you were talking about when you said

   04:30 13   I thought that this --

   04:30 14        A.   I don't know if it was one or the other or both

   04:30 15   in concert.

   04:30 16        Q.   Okay.  So after this press release in Exhibit 28

   04:30 17   -- so I think we've established that you do recall

   04:30 18   specifically reviewing the content of the press release

   04:30 19   that's in Exhibit 28, correct?

   04:30 20        A.   In -- in some manner.

   04:30 21        Q.   Yes.  Well, when you say in some manner, do you

   04:30 22   mean a news article quoting it or the press release itself

   04:30 23   just maybe not the form filed in an 8-K?

   04:30 24        A.   In -- in some manner, which could have been in a

   04:30 25   press release and -- or could have been in a -- it could

                                                                      206



   04:30  1   have been in a company press release or could have been in

   04:31  2   a news article as a -- a quotation.

   04:31  3        Q.   Okay.  And the piece of this that would have

   04:31  4   been quoted or was quoted, as you recall, was the content

   04:31  5   of the second paragraph or anything else?

   04:31  6        A.   No, primarily the second -- is this one about

   04:31  7   Fred's that we're talking about?

   04:31  8        Q.   Yeah.

   04:31  9        A.   Yeah, the -- how many stores -- yeah, it was

   04:31 10   that one.

   04:31 11        Q.   Okay.

   04:31 12                  (Exhibit 29 marked.)

   04:31 13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Exhibit 29.  I'm handing you

   04:31 14   what's been marked as the Form 8-K filed by Walgreens

   04:32 15   Boots Alliance on January 5th, 2017.

   04:32 16        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   04:32 17                  This is the 5th of January, 2017?

   04:32 18        Q.   Uh-huh.

   04:32 19        A.   Okay.

   04:32 20                  And in particular the -- where it says Rite

   04:32 21   Aid acquisition?

   04:32 22        Q.   Uh-huh.

   04:32 23        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   04:33 24                  Okay.

   04:33 25        Q.   Did you read this at the time?

                                                                      207



   04:33  1        A.   In some manner, I -- I may have -- have read

   04:33  2   this.

   04:33  3        Q.   Okay.  Do you have a memory of reading it?

   04:33  4        A.   In some manner, I -- I read it.

   04:33  5        Q.   Okay.

   04:33  6        A.   I was -- I was aware that Walgreens and Rite Aid

   04:33  7   entered into agreement.  And I was aware that the

   04:34  8   agreement included Rite Aid selling to Fred's 865 stores.

   04:34  9   I was aware of that.

   04:34 10                  I was aware that the -- as -- as in any

   04:34 11   state -- you know, it's -- again, it's the same statement

   04:34 12   here, FTC approvals required, yeah, we -- we know that.

   04:34 13        Q.   As of July 2017, did you think that there was

   04:34 14   any aspect of this statement concerning the Rite Aid

   04:34 15   acquisition that was misleading?

   04:34 16        A.   No, I'm -- I'm not sure about that.  I'm not

   04:34 17   sure about this particular paragraph being misleading.

   04:35 18        Q.   When you say you're not sure about it, what did

   04:35 19   you mean?

   04:35 20        A.   I don't think it's -- I don't think it's totally

   04:35 21   misleading.  And just let me see here.

   04:35 22        Q.   Sure.

   04:35 23        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   04:35 24                  I mean, this is where they're basically

   04:35 25   stating that they expect the acquisition to be adjusted.

                                                                      208



   04:35  1   This is where I thought that the price of the Walgreens

   04:35  2   shares could -- could drop based on the -- the

   04:35  3   dilution -- diluting the net earning of the shares.

   04:36  4        Q.   So you thought that the likelihood that the deal

   04:36  5   would close could drive Walgreens stock lower?

   04:36  6        A.   Yeah, just for a brief period.

   04:36  7        Q.   Okay.  And so just to go back.  Is it your

   04:36  8   testimony that these statements as of -- again, this is

   04:36  9   July 2017, after the Merger Agreement was terminated, you

   04:36 10   don't -- you did not think that these statements were

   04:36 11   misleading in this press release?

   04:36 12        A.   No, I think they were accurate from -- from the

   04:36 13   -- at the time that it was printed.

   04:36 14        Q.   Okay.  And why do you think it was accurate at

   04:36 15   the time it was printed?

   04:36 16        A.   I was a believer.  I -- I really was.

   04:36 17        Q.   So -- but my question was:  As of July 2017,

   04:36 18   after the Merger Agreement was terminated?

   04:36 19        A.   Yes.

   04:36 20        Q.   So at that time, did you think that these -- the

   04:37 21   statements in this press release were --

   04:37 22        A.   Not in this press release.

   04:37 23        Q.   -- were misleading?

   04:37 24        A.   No.

   04:37 25        Q.   Okay.

                                                                      209



   04:37  1                  (Exhibit 30 marked.)

   04:37  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Next is Exhibit 30.  I'm

   04:37  3   handing you what's been marked as Exhibit 30.  I think

   04:37  4   that's the one.

   04:37  5        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   04:37  6                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  So for the record, this

   04:37  7   is a Form 8-K filed by Walgreens Boots Alliance January

   04:37  8   26th, 2017.

   04:38  9        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   04:38 10                  Yes, I remember this.

   04:38 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Did you review this press

   04:38 12   release at the time?

   04:38 13        A.   In some form or another.

   04:38 14        Q.   So either news articles quoting the content of

   04:38 15   it or the actual press release itself?

   04:38 16        A.   Yes.

   04:38 17        Q.   Okay.  And you don't recall which?

   04:38 18        A.   I do not recall which.

   04:38 19        Q.   Okay.  Again, same question, as of July 2017,

   04:38 20   after the Merger Agreement had been terminated, what did

   04:38 21   you think about -- was misleading, if anything, about the

   04:38 22   content of these two paragraphs?  And just to be clear for

   04:39 23   the record, we're in Exhibit 99.1 to the 8-K.

   04:39 24        A.   All right.  Well, I -- I thought it could go

   04:39 25   -- I thought it could be one of two things.  One is that

                                                                      210



   04:39  1   they're -- they're planning on reducing based on not

   04:39  2   having to spend as much.  Going from $9 a share to 6.50 a

   04:39  3   share, that's a significant reduction.  It's approximately

   04:39  4   a one-third reduction.  So they wouldn't have had to lay

   04:39  5   out as much capital, which would be a benefit to them, as

   04:39  6   well as not causing the -- have less effect of the stock

   04:39  7   going down.

   04:40  8                  And then my second thought process on this

   04:40  9   was that they're reducing the number of stores to get FTC

   04:40 10   approval.

   04:40 11                  Is this before or after?  This is -- it's

   04:40 12   before, yeah.

   04:40 13        Q.   When you say reducing the number of stores to

   04:40 14   get FTC approval, what did you mean?

   04:40 15        A.   Well, they -- they wanted to buy more than 1200

   04:40 16   stores, correct, initially?  They were going --

   04:40 17        Q.   Who's the they in that sentence?

   04:40 18        A.   Okay.  Well, Walgreens was going to buy all of

   04:40 19   Rite Aid's stores.

   04:40 20        Q.   Uh-huh.

   04:40 21        A.   And now they reduced it to 1200.

   04:40 22        Q.   And that was your understanding at the time?

   04:40 23        A.   Yes.

   04:40 24        Q.   Okay.  So what I had asked you, what aspects of

   04:41 25   this as of July 2017, after the Merger Agreement had been

                                                                      211



   04:41  1   terminated, what aspects of these paragraphs in this press

   04:41  2   release were -- did you think were misleading, if any?

   04:41  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  So objection to the extent

   04:41  4   that it calls for privileged communications.  I think

   04:41  5   she's -- she's just asking what you thought back then.

   04:41  6                  MS. ZALKA:  To be clear, I'm asking as of

   04:41  7   July 2017, which was in the question, but I'm happy to

   04:41  8   rephrase.

   04:41  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   As of July 2017, right, when

   04:41 10   you knew the Merger Agreement had been terminated, I'm

   04:41 11   asking you what then did you think with respect to whether

   04:41 12   any of these statements were misleading?

   04:41 13                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   04:41 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You can you answer.

   04:41 15        A.   Okay.  Okay.  Well, I already told you --

   04:41 16   mentioned what I thought at the time of -- of the release,

   04:42 17   okay.  Now, what I thought after, you know, I -- I sort of

   04:42 18   thought, you know, the same thing, that -- that

   04:42 19   the -- even though they reduced it down to 1200 stores,

   04:42 20   that the FTC wasn't going to approve it, but I was still

   04:42 21   waiting for the formal approval, or the -- the formal

   04:42 22   announcement from the FTC.  The fact that they lowered the

   04:42 23   price again, is -- I had pretty much the same feeling

   04:42 24   during and after the -- the merger was called off.

   04:43 25        Q.   When you say the same feeling before and after

                                                                      212



   04:43  1   the Merger Agreement was terminated, what do you mean by

   04:43  2   that?

   04:43  3        A.   Well, I don't -- I don't know if -- I was

   04:43  4   thinking that, you know, Walgreens sort of felt that they

   04:43  5   initially were biting off more than they could chew.  So

   04:43  6   they ended up having to reduce the price.  It got to the

   04:43  7   point where they didn't want to pay $9 a share for the

   04:43  8   stores.  So they lowered the price and they lowered the

   04:43  9   number of stores that they would be purchasing.

   04:43 10                  And this could go one way or the other.

   04:43 11   This -- they could have been doing this because they

   04:44 12   wanted to get FTC approval or they could have been doing

   04:44 13   this because it was planned all along.

   04:44 14                  I don't know.  It's speculation.

   04:44 15        Q.   And I'm just asking you to specifically identify

   04:44 16   which statements in this release, if any, you believe were

   04:44 17   factually false or misleading as of July 2017, when the

   04:44 18   Merger Agreement had been terminated?

   04:44 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   04:44 20   Don't reveal any attorney/client communications.

   04:44 21                  So I think she's just asking your thoughts

   04:44 22   at the date the merger was terminated.

   04:44 23        A.   Well, I mean, as far as the misleading, I don't

   04:44 24   see anything specifically misleading in -- in -- in the

   04:44 25   statement.  I see things that are being done that I don't

                                                                      213



   04:44  1   like, but, you know, again, it was my interpretation that

   04:45  2   this was being done to assist on the merger going through

   04:45  3   and that the merger would be a success.  And again, I was

   04:45  4   a believer that it would be.

   04:45  5        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Uh-huh.  But -- so there's

   04:45  6   nothing specifically or even generally misleading with

   04:45  7   respect to the specific statements that are in this press

   04:45  8   release in Exhibit 30?

   04:45  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   04:45 10        A.   In general, no.

   04:45 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

   04:45 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Why don't we take a -- take a

   04:45 13   break, since we're going to a new document.  I think we've

   04:45 14   been going for over an hour.

   04:45 15                  MS. ZALKA:  I think I just have one more on

   04:45 16   this vein, so maybe we could just wrap this up, and then I

   04:45 17   could actually figure out how much I have left on the

   04:45 18   break.  Is that okay for you or do you want a break?  If

   04:45 19   you want a break, fine.

   04:45 20                  THE WITNESS:  Well, how -- how much longer

   04:46 21   do we have?

   04:46 22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So what I was going to suggest

   04:46 23   is I just have -- to close the loop on the press release

   04:46 24   front --

   04:46 25        A.   Uh-huh.

                                                                      214



   04:46  1        Q.   -- I just was going to finish up that.  And then

   04:46  2   I was going to suggest that we take a break and I can see

   04:46  3   what I have left in terms of what to cover.

   04:46  4        A.   Okay.

   04:46  5        Q.   Or we can take a break now.  It's up to you.

   04:46  6                  THE WITNESS:  What do you want?  I'm -- I'm

   04:46  7   okay either way.  I do -- the coffee is sort of going

   04:46  8   through me.

   04:46  9                  MS. ZALKA:  Let's take a break.

   04:46 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Let's just take a break, and

   04:46 11   then we can go to that document and figure it out.

   04:46 12                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

   04:46 13   4:46 p.m.

   04:54 14                  (Recess in the proceedings from 4:46

   05:03 15                  to 5:03 p.m.)

   05:03 16                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

   05:03 17   5:03 p.m.

   05:03 18                  (Exhibit 31 marked.)

   05:03 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm handing you what I've

   05:03 20   marked as Exhibit 31, which is -- I think I screwed things

   05:04 21   up for that Corinna -- that Form 8-K filed by Walgreens

   05:04 22   Boots Alliance on April 5th, 2017.

   05:04 23                  And you'll see that there is a press

   05:04 24   release attached as Exhibit 99.1.  And there is a

   05:04 25   discussion of the Rite Aid acquisition on the end of page

                                                                      215



   05:04  1   2, going over to page 3.

   05:04  2        A.   Okay.  So this is primarily the last paragraph

   05:04  3   you're referring to?

   05:04  4        Q.   Well, you're welcome to read the whole thing.

   05:04  5   My question was --

   05:04  6        A.   Yeah, but I don't think I need to.

   05:04  7        Q.   Fair enough.

   05:04  8                  So my question is:  Is this one of the

   05:04  9   press releases that you testified about earlier having

   05:04 10   reviewed at the time it was issued?

   05:04 11        A.   I remember seeing this press release or some

   05:04 12   form of this statement --

   05:04 13        Q.   Okay.

   05:05 14        A.   -- that the merger would be extended and that

   05:05 15   they required more time.  And it was -- it was due to the

   05:05 16   discussions with the FTC.  I do remember that.

   05:05 17        Q.   Okay.  And as of July 2017, what aspects, if

   05:05 18   any, of the statements on the bottom of page 2 and page 3

   05:05 19   did you think were misleading, if any?

   05:05 20        A.   None.

   05:05 21        Q.   Okay.  I'm going to hand you what has been

   05:05 22   marked as Exhibit 32.

   05:05 23                  (Exhibit 32 marked.)

   05:05 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Which is the Form 8-K filed on

   05:06 25   June 29th, 2017, by Walgreens Boots Alliance.

                                                                      216



   05:06  1                  And you'll see there's a press release

   05:06  2   attached as Exhibit 99.1.

   05:06  3        A.   Yes.

   05:06  4        Q.   Okay.  You -- did you review this press release

   05:06  5   at the time it was issued in -- at the end of June of

   05:06  6   2017?

   05:06  7        A.   So this is the day after it was called off?  Is

   05:06  8   -- I'm asking.

   05:06  9        Q.   I don't have to -- I can't answer the question,

   05:06 10   unfortunately.  This is a one-way street, unfortunately.

   05:06 11        A.   Okay.

   05:06 12        Q.   But I do think if you look at the date of the

   05:06 13   press release, perhaps that could --

   05:06 14        A.   Yeah.

   05:06 15        Q.   -- help refresh.

   05:06 16        A.   That's why I asked.

   05:06 17        Q.   So if you look at the Rite Aid acquisition

   05:06 18   update on page 2.

   05:07 19        A.   Yes, okay.

   05:07 20        Q.   And you're -- again, you're welcome to read the

   05:07 21   whole thing, if you would like to.

   05:07 22        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   05:07 23                  Yeah, I remember this.

   05:07 24        Q.   What do you remember about it?

   05:07 25        A.   I remember the announcement and I wasn't too

                                                                      217



   05:07  1   happy that they were going to cut the company in half.  I

   05:07  2   remember this announcement.

   05:07  3        Q.   Okay.  Having reviewed -- did you review any

   05:07  4   other information concerning the termination of the Merger

   05:07  5   Agreement in June 2017?

   05:08  6        A.   I'm not sure, but I remember this

   05:08  7   and -- although I can't say there's anything misleading

   05:08  8   about the statement, it's because this -- this -- at the

   05:08  9   time, this was -- this statement was produced, it was an

   05:08 10   accurate statement.  So I can't say it's misleading.  But

   05:08 11   I know I wasn't happy with the -- what transpired here at

   05:08 12   all.  I was not happy.

   05:08 13        Q.   And what were you not happy with?

   05:08 14        A.   Because I -- they're cutting the company in

   05:08 15   half.  They're decimating the company.

   05:08 16        Q.   And "the company" you're referring to there is

   05:08 17   Rite Aid?

   05:08 18        A.   Yes.

   05:08 19        Q.   Okay.  And when you say, I can't say it's

   05:08 20   misleading, were you referring to the -- this press

   05:09 21   release that's in Exhibit 32?

   05:09 22        A.   What they're doing in this press release is --

   05:09 23   to me, is accurately describing what the new deal is.

   05:09 24        Q.   Did this press release indicate to you that any

   05:09 25   prior statements in the press releases that we have just

                                                                      218



   05:09  1   reviewed were misleading?

   05:09  2        A.   Well, I guess it wasn't clear sailing all --

   05:09  3   after all.  And this is what it led to.  And this was

   05:09  4   certainly not a good decision for Rite Aid stockholders,

   05:09  5   this decision to cut the company in half.

   05:09  6        Q.   Who made that decision?

   05:09  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   05:09  8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   To you extent that you know.

   05:09  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, objection to the

   05:10 10   extent --

   05:10 11                  MS. ZALKA:  I mean, the company -- sorry; I

   05:10 12   -- why don't you go ahead with your objection and then I

   05:10 13   can rephrase.

   05:10 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  If you want to rephrase, go

   05:10 15   ahead.

   05:10 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Sure.  So you say that, you

   05:10 17   know, when you read this, you weren't happy with the

   05:10 18   decision to cut the company in half.

   05:10 19        A.   Right.

   05:10 20        Q.   Who ultimately, to your understanding, was

   05:10 21   responsible for making that decision with respect to, in

   05:10 22   your words, cutting Rite Aid in half?

   05:10 23        A.   I don't know, but it takes two parties to strike

   05:10 24   an agreement.  Okay.  I don't think there's any one party

   05:10 25   necessarily making that decision.  I think it's a

                                                                      219



   05:10  1   collaboration between both companies.

   05:10  2        Q.   Could Walgreens force Rite Aid to cut itself in

   05:10  3   half?

   05:10  4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   05:10  5   speculation, calls for a legal conclusion.

   05:10  6                  Don't divulge anything discussed with your

   05:10  7   attorneys, but you can answer.

   05:10  8        A.   I don't know what Walgreens has over Rite Aid.

   05:10  9   They may have something over Rite Aid that I'm not aware

   05:11 10   of.

   05:11 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   That's just speculation, right,

   05:11 12   though?

   05:11 13        A.   That's right.

   05:11 14        Q.   Okay.  So let's recap those.

   05:11 15                  So to the extent that the announcement of

   05:11 16   the termination of the Merger Agreement in June of 2017,

   05:11 17   what specifically did that tell you in terms of what, if

   05:11 18   any, prior statements about the deal by Walgreens had been

   05:11 19   misleading?

   05:11 20                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

   05:11 21   a couple of times throughout the day.

   05:11 22                  But you can -- to the extent that you have

   05:11 23   anything to add --

   05:11 24                  THE WITNESS:  I have nothing to add from

   05:11 25   the previous statements that I mentioned.

                                                                      220



   05:11  1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Well, so, when we went through

   05:11  2   each of the press releases, I asked you a question with

   05:11  3   respect to as of June -- July 2017, after the announcement

   05:11  4   of the Merger Agreement had been terminated, what did you

   05:11  5   understand or think about which aspects of these specific

   05:11  6   statements were false or misleading.  And we can go

   05:12  7   through it again, but we've just spent probably half an

   05:12  8   hour going through methodically each of the press

   05:12  9   releases.

   05:12 10                  Do you recall that testimony?

   05:12 11        A.   Yes.

   05:12 12        Q.   Okay.  Now, so, having now read the

   05:12 13   announcement, and your testimony was that you could not

   05:12 14   identify anything specifically misleading that you recall

   05:12 15   knowing about as of June 2017 -- actually, strike that.

   05:12 16                  My understanding of your testimony, and you

   05:12 17   correct me if I'm wrong, is having reviewed each of the

   05:12 18   press releases we just went through, it was your testimony

   05:12 19   that as of the end of June 2017 and the announcement of

   05:12 20   the termination of the Merger Agreement, you could not and

   05:12 21   did not identify any specific statements as misleading in

   05:12 22   the press releases that we reviewed; is that correct?

   05:12 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, misleading.

   05:12 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  We're going to have to

   05:12 25   go through them.

                                                                      221



   05:12  1                  I mean, why don't you just answer.  Is that

   05:12  2   correct?

   05:12  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  You're asking him to summarize

   05:12  4   his testimony?

   05:12  5                  MS. ZALKA:  No, I'm -- I'm reminding him

   05:12  6   and I'm asking him if that's different, because he seems

   05:12  7   to be suggesting something different now, having reviewed

   05:13  8   the termination announcement.

   05:13  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well, no, no, no.  Just to be

   05:13 10   clear, your early question said statements; now you're

   05:13 11   asking about the specific press releases that you showed

   05:13 12   him.

   05:13 13                  So just -- just make sure that you're clear

   05:13 14   what you're asking about.

   05:13 15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Are you ready, Mr. Dayton?

   05:13 16        A.   Yeah.

   05:13 17        Q.   Okay.  So you have testified that you did not

   05:13 18   review the earnings calls transcripts or SEC filings

   05:13 19   issued by Walgreens during the periods we're just talking

   05:13 20   about, 2016 and 2017; is that correct?

   05:13 21        A.   Yes.

   05:13 22        Q.   Okay.  And that the only thing that you recall

   05:13 23   reviewing that was actually issued by Walgreens was

   05:13 24   between one and five press releases during the period of

   05:13 25   2016 and 2017.

                                                                      222



   05:13  1                  Do you recall that?

   05:13  2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, that misstates the

   05:13  3   testimony.

   05:13  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   How -- was that accurate, yes

   05:14  5   or no?

   05:14  6        A.   I guess, yes.

   05:14  7        Q.   Okay.  So and with respect to -- and we've just

   05:14  8   walked through what I will represent to you were the press

   05:14  9   releases issued by Walgreens concerning the Rite Aid

   05:14 10   transaction in 2016 and 2017.

   05:14 11        A.   Okay.  Yeah.

   05:14 12        Q.   Okay.  And you identified, I believe, at least

   05:14 13   two, potentially three, and we can check the record, that

   05:14 14   you specifically remember reviewing the actual press

   05:14 15   release and with others, the remaining press releases, you

   05:14 16   thought you might have reviewed in a news article quoting

   05:14 17   the press release, or the press release itself, correct?

   05:14 18        A.   Right.

   05:14 19        Q.   Okay.  So now my question is:  Sitting -- as of

   05:14 20   the announcement of the Merger Agreement termination in

   05:14 21   June 2017, are there any aspects of those statements in

   05:14 22   the press releases that we've reviewed that you believed

   05:14 23   were false or misleading, in light of the fact that

   05:14 24   ultimately, the Merger Agreement had been terminated?

   05:15 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  So, objection.

                                                                      223



   05:15  1                  I'll ask you not to reveal anything that

   05:15  2   you've learned from counsel during litigation.  But you

   05:15  3   can answer your views as to those specific press releases.

   05:15  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And I don't think you retained

   05:15  5   counsel as of June 2017, so I'm not ask -- it couldn't

   05:15  6   call for privileged communications?

   05:15  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  But I think he did.

   05:15  8                  MS. ZALKA:  Not with respect to -- oh, I'm

   05:15  9   sorry.  So are you willing to actually say with respect to

   05:15 10   a retainer agreement going backwards, because that was

   05:15 11   not -- you refused to let him answer that question?

   05:15 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Either way, you can answer to

   05:15 13   the extent that you didn't learn things from your

   05:15 14   attorneys or revealing communications with us.

   05:15 15        A.   Okay.  At the time I read the press releases, I

   05:15 16   thought it -- I thought the information was accurate.  I

   05:15 17   thought it was truthful.  I thought it was accurate, okay?

   05:15 18                  Then after the merger was cancelled, was

   05:15 19   broken off, okay, that was at the point when I felt that

   05:16 20   some of the press releases were not -- were not accurate.

   05:16 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So we're going to have

   05:16 22   to go through the press releases again.

   05:16 23        A.   Well, go ahead.

   05:16 24        Q.   Okay.  Let's take out -- do you --

   05:16 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  So, I mean, I'll object.

                                                                      224



   05:16  1   We've gone through the press releases.  You've asked him

   05:16  2   what was misleading.  He's testified specifically as to

   05:16  3   things that he thought was misleading and then you've

   05:16  4   tried to fight him about it.

   05:16  5                  He's provided you his testimony about the

   05:16  6   press releases.  We aren't even suing about those press

   05:16  7   releases.

   05:16  8                  MS. ZALKA:  Well, it's the only thing

   05:16  9   Mr. Dayton testified that he actually reviewed.

   05:16 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  That's not correct.

   05:16 11                  MS. ZALKA:  That is correct.

   05:16 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  It's not.  If you'll go back

   05:16 13   and check...

   05:16 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Mr. Dayton, you

   05:16 15   previously testified that after the Merger Agreement was

   05:16 16   terminated, and I asked you specifically for at the time

   05:16 17   that you understood that the Merger Agreement had been

   05:17 18   terminated, did you think that any of the statements in

   05:17 19   the press releases were false and misleading.

   05:17 20                  And you answered that with -- should we --

   05:17 21   we're going to go through all of them again.  Okay.  One

   05:17 22   second.

   05:17 23                  Do you want to change any of your testimony

   05:17 24   in that regard?

   05:17 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Are you threatening him to

                                                                      225



   05:17  1   spend more time deposing him if he doesn't change his

   05:17  2   testimony?  Is that what you're doing?

   05:17  3                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm just asking him do you want

   05:17  4   to change your testimony.

   05:17  5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Counsel, this is not

   05:17  6   appropriate.  You can't use more time in a deposition to

   05:17  7   threaten him in order to change his testimony.

   05:17  8                  MS. ZALKA:  There is actually zero aspect

   05:17  9   of what I'm doing that is threatening in any way, shape or

   05:17 10   form, Mr. Knotts.  I suggest you calm down in that regard.

   05:17 11   I'm simply asking -- I'm offering the witness an

   05:17 12   opportunity if he wants to correct any of his testimony.

   05:17 13                  THE WITNESS:  No.

   05:17 14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Upon reviewing the

   05:17 15   announcement of the termination of the Merger Agreement,

   05:18 16   what specific statements, if any, that had been previously

   05:18 17   made by Walgreens did you believe were false and

   05:18 18   misleading?

   05:18 19        A.   That there would be little opposition -- and I

   05:18 20   mentioned this several times -- to the merger.

   05:18 21        Q.   Was that statement that there would be little

   05:18 22   opposition -- so let's just first get the list.

   05:18 23                  Other than the statement that there would

   05:18 24   be little opposition to the merger, is that -- are there

   05:18 25   any other specific statements by Walgreens that you

                                                                      226



   05:18  1   believe were false and misleading, having understood that

   05:18  2   the Merger Agreement was terminated?

   05:18  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

   05:18  4   a few times.

   05:18  5                  I'll ask you not to disclose any

   05:18  6   attorney/client privileged communications, but you can

   05:18  7   answer.

   05:18  8        A.   The only other item was that they had

   05:18  9   special -- well, they had insider information about the

   05:19 10   FTC, and they had a special relationship with them.

   05:19 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is there anything else?

   05:19 12        A.   No.

   05:19 13        Q.   Okay.  With respect to either of those

   05:19 14   statements; one, that there would be little opposition to

   05:19 15   the merger by the FTC; and two, that there was a special

   05:19 16   relationship between the FTC and Walgreens, did either of

   05:19 17   those statements appear in any of the press releases that

   05:19 18   you reviewed in connection with this deposition?

   05:19 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.

   05:19 20        A.   Yes, I believe.  Yes.

   05:19 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Which?

   05:19 22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered a couple

   05:19 23   times.

   05:19 24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I want to know where both of

   05:19 25   those statements appear in the press releases that we've

                                                                      227



   05:19  1   just reviewed?

   05:19  2        A.   Well, okay.  I --

   05:20  3                  (Witness reviews document.)

   05:20  4                  I don't know if you've provided me with all

   05:20  5   the press releases over this period.

   05:20  6        Q.   I'm just asking you of the press releases that

   05:20  7   we've reviewed.

   05:20  8        A.   In what you provided, I -- I don't remember

   05:20  9   the --

   05:20 10        Q.   Exhibits 24 to 31, if that's helpful.

   05:20 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well --

   05:20 12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   But you continue.  Sorry; I

   05:20 13   just saw that you were looking among the documents, so I

   05:20 14   was trying to help.

   05:21 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  You were interrupting him.

   05:21 16        A.   (Witness reviews documents.)

   05:23 17                  Okay.  I found it, what I'm looking for.

   05:24 18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What -- what's the

   05:23 19   exhibit number?

   05:23 20        A.   27.

   05:23 21        Q.   And what is the date of the filing?

   05:23 22        A.   The date of the filing, October 20th, 2016.

   05:23 23        Q.   Okie doke.  Okay.

   05:24 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Which exhibit?

   05:24 25                  MS. ZALKA:  27, I believe Mr. Dayton

                                                                      228



   05:24  1   identified.

   05:24  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What page are you,

   05:24  3   Mr. Dayton?

   05:24  4        A.   Page 3; the middle paragraph.

   05:24  5        Q.   Uh-huh.

   05:24  6        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

   05:24  7        Q.   So on page 3, which statements do you believe

   05:25  8   that as of June 2017, you thought were false and

   05:25  9   misleading?

   05:25 10        A.   Well, I mean, what I believed was that

   05:25 11   the -- that the -- that they were -- Walgreens was engaged

   05:25 12   in discussing the acquisition with the FTC, and that they

   05:25 13   had to divest between 500 and 1,000 stores.  Okay.  And I

   05:25 14   don't -- as far as -- I think that -- that may be an

   05:25 15   accurate statement, what they're saying here --

   05:25 16        Q.   Uh-huh.

   05:25 17        A.   -- okay, but I'm not so sure if it's an accurate

   05:25 18   statement after the deal was called off.

   05:26 19        Q.   What about the deal being called off in June of

   05:26 20   2017 makes this statement on page 3 false, which is

   05:26 21   October 2016?

   05:26 22        A.   Well, it -- it just seems like this is all they

   05:26 23   had to do to get the approval from the FTC, was to diverse

   05:26 24   (sic) the between 500 and 1,000 stores, and -- and as time

   05:26 25   went on, there was very little update from either --

                                                                      229



   05:26  1   from -- primarily from Walgreens on -- no details on how

   05:26  2   the talks were going.

   05:27  3                  And this is lacking detail as well.  But

   05:27  4   this is only -- this is at the beginning stages, so maybe

   05:27  5   that's why it's lacking detail.

   05:27  6                  But as discussions went along, there was

   05:27  7   information that wasn't included in the press releases,

   05:27  8   that possibly should have been included in the press

   05:27  9   releases.

   05:27 10                  So I think it's also their obligation

   05:27 11   to -- you know, I think that it's -- it was -- they were

   05:27 12   under the impression that it's better to say nothing than

   05:27 13   to make any kind of announcement that's going to hurt

   05:27 14   the -- the acquisition, as far as having -- having people

   05:28 15   trading in the stock.

   05:28 16                  So I think it was the lack of information

   05:28 17   that is sort of misleading as well.

   05:28 18        Q.   So what is the lack of information with respect

   05:28 19   to this statement that is misleading that you realized as

   05:28 20   of June 2017?

   05:28 21        A.   Not particularly this statement, but the -- the

   05:28 22   press releases down -- down the line that -- there were no

   05:28 23   statements.

   05:28 24                  There was information that I felt should

   05:28 25   have been in there to inform the stockholders of the

                                                                      230



   05:28  1   detailed discussions that they were having with the FTC.

   05:28  2   I mean, I -- I had no information on the detailed

   05:28  3   discussions.  They had no information on detailed

   05:28  4   discussions with the FTC.

   05:28  5        Q.   What effort did you understand -- did you

   05:28  6   undertake to understand the full universe of information

   05:29  7   that was disclosed by either Walgreens or Rite Aid

   05:29  8   concerning the detailed discussions?

   05:29  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   05:29 10                  You can answer.

   05:29 11        A.   All I -- all I did was read the news releases

   05:29 12   and that's the extent of --

   05:29 13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So sitting here today --

   05:29 14        A.   -- my knowledge.

   05:29 15        Q.   Sorry.  So sitting here today, you have no

   05:29 16   knowledge of what the total universe of information was

   05:29 17   with respect to the discussions, disclosures around the

   05:29 18   FTC process, correct?

   05:29 19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   05:29 20   speculation.

   05:29 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You just said you had -- well,

   05:29 22   I'll let you answer the question.  Go ahead.

   05:29 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah.

   05:29 24        A.   All right.  I do not know what the process is.

   05:29 25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm not asking about the

                                                                      231



   05:29  1   process.  You said, and I quote, there was information

   05:29  2   they felt should have been in there to inform the

   05:29  3   stockholders of the detailed discussions they were having

   05:29  4   with the FTC.  I mean, I had no information on the

   05:29  5   detailed discussions.  They had no information on the

   05:30  6   detailed discussions with the FTC.

   05:30  7                  So my question to you is:  Beyond reading

   05:30  8   the press releases or news articles, sitting here today,

   05:30  9   do you have any understanding of what information was

   05:30 10   disclosed with respect to the detailed discussions with

   05:30 11   the FTC?

   05:30 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

   05:30 13   multiple times today.

   05:30 14        A.   No, I don't.

   05:30 15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So what did you mean when you

   05:30 16   said I had no information on the detailed discussions,

   05:30 17   they had no information on the detailed discussions?

   05:30 18        A.   I would have liked more information on what the

   05:30 19   progress of the talks were.

   05:30 20        Q.   Great.  What effort did you undertake at the

   05:30 21   time to read the disclosures issued by either Walgreens or

   05:30 22   Rite Aid concerning the merger?

   05:30 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   05:30 24                  You can talk about what you read.

   05:30 25        A.   I read the news articles.  That's -- that's what

                                                                      232



   05:30  1   I undertook, reading the news articles.

   05:31  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So sitting here today, you

   05:31  3   don't know whether or not there were in fact more detailed

   05:31  4   discussions made by Walgreens or Rite Aid concerning the

   05:31  5   status of discussions with FTC that you just didn't

   05:31  6   review, correct?

   05:31  7        A.   I didn't review everything, that's a fair

   05:31  8   statement, okay, but I did review quite a bit.  And those

   05:31  9   were in news articles primarily.  It was all -- a lot of

   05:31 10   it was hearsay.  It wasn't concrete information.  This is

   05:31 11   what -- this is how it's going and this is what was

   05:31 12   discussed, and these are the things that we have to do in

   05:31 13   order for the merger to be successful, this is what we

   05:31 14   talked about.

   05:31 15                  Maybe they're not allowed to divulge that

   05:31 16   information.  I don't know.  It's sort of out of my area

   05:32 17   of expertise.  But I was expecting more detailed

   05:32 18   information on how the talks were going that I didn't see.

   05:32 19   And I'm not saying it's not there; it's just that I didn't

   05:32 20   see it.

   05:32 21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So during the class

   05:32 22   period, so October 2016 to June 2017, you were aware of

   05:32 23   the fact that the timing for the close of the Merger

   05:32 24   Agreement had been extended once, correct?

   05:32 25        A.   I was aware that it was extended once, correct.

                                                                      233



   05:32  1        Q.   You were aware of the fact that there had been

   05:32  2   concerns identified by the FTC in its review, correct?

   05:32  3        A.   Yes.

   05:32  4        Q.   You were aware of the fact that the FTC had

   05:33  5   demanded store divestitures?

   05:33  6        A.   But not -- yes.  Not to the detail, no.

   05:33  7        Q.   You were aware of the fact that Walgreens had

   05:33  8   entered into an agreement with Fred's to -- whereby there

   05:33  9   would be a divestiture of 865 stores, correct?

   05:33 10        A.   Yes.  That was at the very beginning.

   05:33 11        Q.   Okay.  You were aware that they had then in

   05:33 12   January extend -- amended the Merger Agreement again, to

   05:33 13   extend the timing, correct?

   05:33 14        A.   Yes.

   05:33 15        Q.   And you were aware that that was in order to

   05:33 16   continue the process with the FTC?

   05:33 17        A.   Yes.

   05:33 18        Q.   Okay.  And you also knew that they had increased

   05:33 19   the number of stores that had to be divested in connection

   05:33 20   with the amendment to the Merger Agreement?

   05:33 21        A.   Yes.

   05:33 22        Q.   Okay.  And you were aware -- I think you

   05:34 23   testified to this this morning -- but you were aware kind

   05:34 24   of from the outset that there was a risk that the FTC

   05:34 25   would not approve the deal, that that's common in any

                                                                      234



   05:34  1   merger?

   05:34  2        A.   That's common in any merger, and I'm aware that

   05:34  3   there's always a risk involved with any merger.

   05:34  4        Q.   Okay.  In connection with your decision to

   05:34  5   purchase 1,000 shares of Walgreens in January of 2017 --

   05:34  6   are you with me -- did you consider any specific

   05:34  7   statements by Walgreens in connection with the decision to

   05:34  8   make that purchase on January 3rd?

   05:34  9        A.   I don't remember.

   05:34 10        Q.   Okay.

   05:34 11        A.   I didn't even remember I shorted Fred's.  So...

   05:34 12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Just stick with the --

   05:34 13                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

   05:34 14                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- questions.

   05:34 15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So you first contemplated suing

   05:34 16   Rite Aid related to the deal, I believe, in 206 -- late

   05:34 17   2015 or early 2016; is that correct?

   05:35 18        A.   Yes.

   05:35 19        Q.   Why did you decide to invest in a company that

   05:35 20   you had contemplated suing?

   05:35 21        A.   It was -- the reason for that was I felt that

   05:35 22   the stock price was too low.  That was the only reason.

   05:35 23        Q.   Did it make any difference to you in deciding

   05:35 24   whether or not to invest in Rite Aid that you had actually

   05:35 25   contemplated suing them?

                                                                      235



   05:35  1        A.   Yes.

   05:35  2        Q.   But you got over that?

   05:35  3        A.   Yes, I did.

   05:35  4        Q.   And how did you --

   05:35  5        A.   Because I had -- I had already -- I had shares

   05:35  6   that I owned previously.  All -- I think dating all the

   05:35  7   way back to 2013.  Okay.  And so, you know, I -- I was

   05:35  8   taking a risk, but I felt that -- I felt that the third

   05:35  9   largest drug store in the U.S. was worth more than $9 a

   05:36 10   share.

   05:36 11        Q.   And what was the risk that you were taking?

   05:36 12        A.   Well, the risk I was taking was that -- it's

   05:36 13   with any stock, you purchase a stock and you're taking a

   05:36 14   risk.  Okay.  It's not a sure thing, okay.  And I wasn't

   05:36 15   sure if the rest of the shareholders or, you know, even if

   05:36 16   the analysts -- the analysts didn't think that $9 was good

   05:36 17   enough.  The analyst thought that it should be more than

   05:36 18   that, and I agreed with the analyst.

   05:36 19        Q.   Was that the analysts you -- either the time you

   05:36 20   made your purchase in January 2017?

   05:36 21        A.   I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't remember.

   05:37 22        Q.   Was that the analyst's view -- what was the

   05:37 23   analyst's view when you purchased in June 2017?

   05:37 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   05:37 25   speculation.

                                                                      236



   05:37  1        A.   I don't remember.

   05:37  2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   To the extent that you --

   05:37  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Just let me get my objection

   05:37  4   out.

   05:37  5                  THE WITNESS:  Sorry.

   05:37  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  I know we're getting late in

   05:37  7   the day.  Go ahead.

   05:37  8        A.   I'm sorry; I don't remember.

   05:37  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  And to be clear, and

   05:37 10   just to reframe in light of the objection, did you

   05:37 11   actually review any analysts' views that you can recall in

   05:37 12   connection with the June 2017 purchase?

   05:37 13        A.   June 2017?  No.  On that one I may have done

   05:37 14   that one on my own.  But I do remember reading that the --

   05:37 15   that it was -- it was a -- it was at a good level to

   05:37 16   purchase the stock.  I think it was $3 a share, something

   05:38 17   like that.

   05:38 18                  So that was at a good level.  I felt if the

   05:38 19   merger would go through, that the $3 would eventually be

   05:38 20   the $9, or at least 6.50.

   05:38 21        Q.   That was going to be my next question.

   05:38 22                  So -- okay.  What did you think about if

   05:38 23   the merger wouldn't go through?

   05:38 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

   05:38 25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So you testified that it was at

                                                                      237



   05:38  1   a good level.  I felt if the merger would go through, that

   05:38  2   the $3 would eventually be the 9, or at least 6.50.

   05:38  3        A.   Yes.

   05:38  4        Q.   What did you think about the risks that the

   05:39  5   merger wouldn't go through?

   05:39  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

   05:39  7        A.   I thought the -- I thought there was less --

   05:39  8   less of a risk of it -- I was more confident that it would

   05:39  9   go through than not go through, which is why I purchased

   05:39 10   it.

   05:39 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You were taking a chance that

   05:39 12   the merger would go through?

   05:39 13        A.   I was taking a chance that the merger would go

   05:39 14   through.

   05:39 15        Q.   Okay.  With respect to the events between the

   05:39 16   announcement of the Merger Agreement in 2015 and the end

   05:39 17   of 2017, did you take any -- I believe you testified that

   05:39 18   you were -- that you have no expertise in the FTC process;

   05:40 19   is that correct?

   05:40 20        A.   Yes.

   05:40 21        Q.   That you haven't taken any courses on regulatory

   05:40 22   approval of mergers --

   05:40 23        A.   No.

   05:40 24        Q.   -- FTC specifically?

   05:40 25        A.   No, I haven't.

                                                                      238



   05:40  1        Q.   I think you testified you know just a little

   05:40  2   enough to be dangerous?

   05:40  3        A.   I do recall saying that.

   05:40  4        Q.   Okay.  So what did you do, if anything, during

   05:40  5   this time period to understand the FTC process and the

   05:40  6   risks attending to it?

   05:40  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

   05:40  8   multiple times.

   05:40  9                  You know, I think, Counsel, we're getting

   05:40 10   very, very redundant to material that -- that we've

   05:40 11   covered, and that you've asked specifically.  You started

   05:40 12   out with this -- with the same question.  You asked the

   05:40 13   question again a few minutes ago, and you're asking it

   05:40 14   again now.

   05:40 15                  You can answer to the extent you have

   05:40 16   anything to add.

   05:40 17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you remember the question?

   05:40 18        A.   Yeah, I remember the question.

   05:40 19                  I have nothing else to add from what I

   05:40 20   previously said.

   05:40 21        Q.   So I don't think I actually previously asked

   05:41 22   this, so let me just be very clear.  If you could listen

   05:41 23   to this question.

   05:41 24                  What did you do, if anything, during the

   05:41 25   2015, 2016, 2017 time period to understand, as a general

                                                                      239



   05:41  1   matter, not specifically with respect to this transaction,

   05:41  2   just the FTC process and the risks that go along with it?

   05:41  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Oh, okay.  And I didn't

   05:41  4   understand the question.  Just generally the FTC

   05:41  5   process --

   05:41  6                  MS. ZALKA:  Correct.

   05:41  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- of merger reviews, not this

   05:41  8   one.

   05:41  9                  You can answer.

   05:41 10        A.   I didn't do anything regarding that particular

   05:41 11   area.  The only thing was reading the news chatter, okay,

   05:41 12   and different analysts giving different reasons; this is

   05:41 13   why this could happen, this is why that could happen.  But

   05:41 14   that's the only thing that -- that's the only training

   05:41 15   that I had, was just reading the news.

   05:42 16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And I think there's one

   05:42 17   article -- and let's just make sure we have the record

   05:42 18   complete.

   05:42 19                  You mentioned, I think, by name one

   05:42 20   article.  Was it a Bloomberg article?

   05:42 21        A.   Well, I -- yeah, I remember that there were

   05:42 22   probably more than one Bloomberg article.

   05:42 23        Q.   Okay.  So I --

   05:42 24                  MR. KNOTTS:  He mentioned the names of a

   05:42 25   couple publications, more than Bloomberg, earlier today.

                                                                      240



   05:42  1   So I just -- I don't want you to --

   05:42  2                  MS. ZALKA:  Fair enough.

   05:42  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- misstate that.

   05:42  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So let me just -- what were the

   05:42  5   news sources that you reviewed in connection with

   05:42  6   monitoring Rite Aid and Walgreens and the deal during this

   05:42  7   time period?

   05:42  8                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.

   05:42  9        A.   Okay.

   05:42 10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What were they?

   05:42 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.  We've

   05:42 12   covered this.

   05:42 13        A.   I -- the -- the Bloomberg for sure.  I believe

   05:43 14   there were some Wall Street Journal, there were various

   05:43 15   Yahoo articles, but Yahoo's not necessarily the author of

   05:43 16   those articles.

   05:43 17                  I read many articles from many different

   05:43 18   analysts.

   05:43 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  When did you learn the

   05:43 20   truth?

   05:43 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, vague.

   05:43 22        A.   What truth?

   05:43 23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So you're claiming that

   05:43 24   Walgreens made false statements, correct?

   05:43 25        A.   Uh-huh.

                                                                      241



   05:43  1        Q.   You are?

   05:44  2        A.   I'm saying --

   05:44  3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   05:44  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Go ahead.

   05:44  5        A.   I -- I answered those questions already, right?

   05:44  6                  So I answered those questions already.  So,

   05:44  7   in hindsight, there was -- there was some

   05:44  8   misrepresentations, I think, in hindsight.

   05:44  9        Q.   When did you learn that?

   05:44 10        A.   Well, I learned that after -- I don't know

   05:44 11   the -- the days, but I learned that after the

   05:44 12   acquisition -- or after the merger broke up, in various

   05:44 13   news articles.

   05:44 14        Q.   Okay.  So is it your testimony that you learned

   05:44 15   the truth -- and by that I mean that Walgreens statements

   05:45 16   had been, according to you, previously misleading.

   05:45 17        A.   Uh-huh.

   05:45 18        Q.   Do you understand what I'm saying?

   05:45 19        A.   Uh-huh.

   05:45 20        Q.   Okay.  So when did you first learn that?

   05:45 21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

   05:45 22        A.   I don't know.

   05:45 23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You don't know?

   05:45 24        A.   No, I don't remember.

   05:45 25        Q.   Do you recall how long it was after --

                                                                      242



   05:45  1        A.   No.

   05:45  2        Q.   -- the announcement of the Merger Agreement?

   05:45  3        A.   I don't recall.

   05:45  4        Q.   Was the first time that you learned that, of the

   05:45  5   truth, quote/unquote --

   05:45  6        A.   Uh-huh.

   05:45  7        Q.   -- was that after the announcement of the Merger

   05:45  8   Agreement termination?

   05:45  9        A.   Yes.

   05:45 10        Q.   Okay.  How long after the announcement of the

   05:45 11   termination of the Merger Agreement announcement?

   05:45 12        A.   I don't know.

   05:45 13        Q.   Did the termination announcement in and of

   05:45 14   itself reveal the truth to you?

   05:45 15        A.   In a way, yes.  As far as -- no, it did -- as

   05:45 16   far as the -- you know, I thought that the -- during the

   05:46 17   time I was reading the statements, I thought it was

   05:46 18   truthful.  After the merger broke up, okay, I started

   05:46 19   thinking that some of the statements may not have been

   05:46 20   truthful.

   05:46 21        Q.   And that was --

   05:46 22        A.   And I don't know --

   05:46 23        Q.   Sorry.  Go ahead.

   05:46 24        A.   -- what the date is or how long after, but it

   05:46 25   was after the merger was cancelled.

                                                                      243



   05:46  1        Q.   Okay.  Did you learn the truth because the

   05:46  2   Merger Agreement was terminated?

   05:46  3        A.   I learned the truth after the agreement was

   05:46  4   terminated.  That's -- and reading articles about it also

   05:46  5   triggered memory.

   05:46  6        Q.   Got it.  What was the truth that you learned?

   05:46  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

   05:46  8                  I'll ask you not to divulge any

   05:46  9   communications with counsel.  I think she's just asking

   05:47 10   your independent understanding apart from what we've

   05:47 11   discussed about this lawsuit.

   05:47 12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Correct.

   05:47 13        A.   All right.  That -- again, it was that the

   05:47 14   merger would be successful.  That's what I thought at the

   05:47 15   beginning, okay.  And that's how I felt that Walgreens was

   05:47 16   communicating it to the shareholders, that it would be

   05:47 17   successful.  Then towards the end, they weren't

   05:47 18   communicating enough.  I was -- I felt like I was starved

   05:47 19   for information on how the merger was going.

   05:47 20                  But I kept with it.  And as I have already

   05:47 21   mentioned, I was expecting that the -- there would be a

   05:47 22   formal announcement that if the FTC didn't approve the

   05:48 23   merger, that that's how it would be, a formal announcement

   05:48 24   .  I didn't know that they were going to terminate it

   05:48 25   beforehand.  I mean, hindsight is 20/20.  If I knew they

                                                                      244



   05:48  1   were going to terminate it beforehand, I would have sold

   05:48  2   my stock.

   05:48  3        Q.   Do you think that if Walgreens was going to --

   05:48  4   knew that they were not going to get FTC approval

   05:48  5   beforehand, they would have undertaken all of the effort

   05:48  6   over the course of two years to get FTC approval?

   05:48  7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

   05:48  8   speculation.

   05:48  9        A.   I don't know what they would have done.  I

   05:48 10   can't --

   05:48 11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Does that make sense to you?

   05:48 12        A.   I can't put myself in their shoes, in their

   05:48 13   position.  It is speculating on my part.  I'm -- I can't

   05:48 14   answer that question.

   05:48 15        Q.   Okay.  So going back to when you learned the

   05:48 16   truth.

   05:49 17                  You -- I asked you specifically what was

   05:49 18   the truth that you learned, and counsel instructed you not

   05:49 19   to divulge privileged communication.  I agreed with that

   05:49 20   instruction, and you said the following:  It was the

   05:49 21   merger would be successful, that's what I thought at the

   05:49 22   beginning, and that's how you felt that Walgreen's was

   05:49 23   communicating it to the shareholders, that it would be

   05:49 24   successful.

   05:49 25                  Towards the end, they weren't

                                                                      245



   05:49  1   communicating, I felt like I was starved for information

   05:49  2   how this merger was going.  But I kept with it.  And as

   05:49  3   I've already mentioned, I was expecting that there would

   05:49  4   be a formal announcement, that if the FTC didn't approve

   05:49  5   the merger, that is how it would be, a formal

   05:49  6   announcement.  I didn't know they were going to terminate

   05:49  7   it beforehand.  I mean, in hindsight, it's 20/20.

   05:49  8                  What about that revealed the truth that had

   05:49  9   been previously concealed from you?

   05:49 10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same instruction about not

   05:49 11   revealing communications with counsel or information that

   05:49 12   you've learned from counsel in connection with this

   05:49 13   lawsuit.  But you can answer based on your own independent

   05:50 14   views.

   05:50 15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Again, I'm just asking about

   05:50 16   specifically what you recall thinking at the time, having

   05:50 17   read the disclosures, not about what you discussed with

   05:50 18   your lawyers.

   05:50 19        A.   No, no.  It's just -- no, this has nothing to do

   05:50 20   with what I discussed with attorneys.

   05:50 21                  You know, this -- I felt that there was

   05:50 22   information that could have been shared with the

   05:50 23   shareholders so the shareholder can make a better informed

   05:50 24   decision on which way to go with the stock.

   05:50 25        Q.   When was the truth revealed to you?

                                                                      246



   05:50  1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

   05:50  2   multiple times.

   05:50  3                  MS. ZALKA:  I was going to say you've not

   05:50  4   answered my questions, and that's why I keep on having to

   05:51  5   ask it.

   05:51  6                  MR. KNOTTS:  He said he didn't remember.

   05:51  7        A.   I don't remember; I'm sorry.  I don't remember;

   05:51  8   I'm sorry.

   05:51  9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Putting aside when, what

   05:51 10   was the truth --

   05:51 11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Now, this is --

   05:51 12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   -- that you learned about that

   05:51 13   you think was previously concealed by Walgreens'

   05:51 14   statements that you reviewed at the time?

   05:51 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered a number of

   05:51 16   times.  And again, I'll ask you not to divulge

   05:51 17   attorney/client communications.  But you can answer to the

   05:51 18   extent that you have anything to add to what you

   05:51 19   previously said.

   05:51 20        A.   At this point, I have nothing to add to what I

   05:51 21   previously said.  It -- I've said it five different ways,

   05:51 22   the same thing.

   05:51 23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton, I

   05:51 24   don't think you've answered my question.

   05:51 25                  MR. KNOTTS:  You just don't like his

                                                                      247



   05:51  1   answer.  But he's answered.

   05:51  2                  MS. ZALKA:  No.  I'm perfect -- I -- he

   05:51  3   can --

   05:51  4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I -- I'm always here to hear

   05:51  5   what you have to say.  Right.

   05:51  6        A.   Sure.

   05:51  7        Q.   It's your testimony that counts.  Our lawyer

   05:51  8   bickering back and forth does not.  That can be up for the

   05:52  9   Judge to resolve.

   05:52 10                  What I want to understand is, you're

   05:52 11   sitting here today, you're, you know, suing for securities

   05:52 12   fraud against Walgreens.  And, right, I want to understand

   05:52 13   when and what led you to understand the truth that you

   05:52 14   think Walgreens lied about.

   05:52 15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objections.

   05:52 16                  I instruct you not to divulge

   05:52 17   communications with your attorneys.  But to the extent you

   05:52 18   had an independent understanding, you can answer.

   05:52 19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And if you had no independent

   05:52 20   understanding of that until you had conversations with

   05:52 21   your attorneys, you can just say that.  I'm just -- I just

   05:52 22   want to understand what the basis was.

   05:52 23        A.   No, I -- I -- I thought that there was -- there

   05:52 24   could have been more information disclosed that wasn't

   05:52 25   disclosed.  That's it.  If I -- if there was more

                                                                      248



   05:53  1   information disclosed, I could have made a better informed

   05:53  2   decision on what to do with my stock.

   05:53  3        Q.   What was the information that you claim should

   05:53  4   have been disclosed?

   05:53  5        A.   Basically, a detailed explanation of how the

   05:53  6   talks were going.  And I didn't see that.  I just saw

   05:53  7   one-liners, talks are going well.  You know, that -- I

   05:53  8   didn't see anything detailed to help me make an informed

   05:53  9   decision.

   05:54 10                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  I have no further

   05:54 11   questions.

   05:54 12                  I'm going to make a formal request on the

   05:54 13   record that Plaintiffs produce all of the Ameritrade

   05:54 14   monthly account statements during the period between

   05:54 15   October 2015 and 2017.  I also think that there appears to

   05:54 16   have been a folder called the RAD folder that exists

   05:54 17   within Mr. Dayton's Ameritrade account that has not been

   05:54 18   produced.  That needs to be produced.  I also want to --

   05:54 19   we should schedule a meet and confer very promptly with

   05:54 20   respect to when those documents will be produced, because

   05:54 21   we're going to want to continue the deposition until

   05:54 22   they're produced.

   05:54 23                  MR. KNOTTS:  So we've already talked about

   05:55 24   trading records.  We'll get back to you on that.  And the

   05:55 25   folder that you're talking about, he testified clearly

                                                                      249



   05:55  1   that there's not currently information on the TD

   05:55  2   Ameritrade screen about the things that he was reading

   05:55  3   during the time period.  But to the extent -- but we're

   05:55  4   happy to look into those sorts of things.

   05:55  5                  I think you maybe -- you may have misheard

   05:55  6   what he said on that particular issue, but we'll look into

   05:55  7   all of this, and we're happy to meet and confer.

   05:55  8                  MS. ZALKA:  Great.

   05:55  9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.  Off the record.

   05:55 10                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

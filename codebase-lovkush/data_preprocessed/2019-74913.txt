              1                   JAMES P. PENTOLIROS,

              2       having been satisfactorily identified by the

              3       production of his driver's license, and

              4       duly sworn by the court reporter, was deposed

              5       and testified as follows:

              6                       EXAMINATION

              7   BY MR. ADAMS:

              8       Q.  Good morning, Mr. Pentoliros.

              9       A.  Good morning.

             10       Q.  How are you?

             11       A.  Not too bad.

             12       Q.  Today is Day 2 of your deposition?

             13       A.  Pardon me?

             14       Q.  Today is Day 2 of your deposition?

             15       A.  Yes.

             16       Q.  You were just sworn in?

             17       A.  Yes.

             18       Q.  I just want to remind you of the ground

             19   rules.  It's important that we try not to speak over

             20   one another.  If you could please let me finish my

             21   question before you answer, I'd appreciate it.

             22               Okay, sir?

             23       A.  Yes, sir.

             24       Q.  And I'll do the same.  I'll let you answer




                                                               268

              1   before I start my new question.

              2       A.  Yes, sir.

              3       Q.  Responses need to be verbal.  They just

              4   can't be a nod of the head or, you know, some sort

              5   of grunting noise.

              6       A.  So when you ask me a question, I'm going to

              7   answer it "yes" or "no."  That's it.  I'm not going

              8   to tell you any stories.

              9       Q.  Okay.  We'll see how that goes.

             10       A.  I'll do the best I can.

             11       Q.  And then, again, if you need to take a

             12   break, let me know.

             13               Mr. Pentoliros, have you taken any

             14   medication today?

             15       A.  No.

             16       Q.  How are you feeling right now?

             17       A.  I'm feeling very uncomfortable.  I've got

             18   anxiety and I'm feeling very nervous.  I'm telling

             19   you the truth.  I'm not used to this.

             20       Q.  Is there any reason why you didn't take

             21   your anxiety medication this morning?

             22       A.  I didn't need it.  I only take it when I

             23   need it.

             24       Q.  Okay.  But you said you're feeling anxious




                                                               269

              1   right now.

              2       A.  Yeah.  I can fight it without it.  I can

              3   fight it.

              4       Q.  Do you feel that you'll be able to testify

              5   accurately today?

              6       A.  Yes.

              7               MR. ADAMS:  Okay.  Very good.  This is

              8   the first exhibit I'd like to mark, please.

              9                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 5 was marked

             10                     for identification.)

             11       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, what's been marked as

             12   Exhibit No. 5 to your deposition, it's right in

             13   front of you.  I'd like to have you take a look at

             14   that document, please.

             15               Mr. Pentoliros, if you'd like, you can

             16   read every word of this document, but I'm going to

             17   bring your attention to, when you're all set, to a

             18   couple pages here and just ask you a few questions.

             19   So when you're ready, just look up, please.

             20               Are you all set, sir?

             21       A.  I didn't read this whole thing.

             22       Q.  And I'm saying, I don't think it's

             23   necessary.  If you feel like you need to, you

             24   certainly can.  But I'm just going to ask you a few




                                                               270

              1   questions.  And as you're trying to answer the

              2   questions, if you feel like you need to refer back

              3   to the document, let me know.

              4               Okay, sir?

              5       A.  Yes.

              6       Q.  Do you see on page one, sir, that this is a

              7   promissory note dated May 15, 2013?

              8       A.  Yes.

              9       Q.  Do you see that on the document?

             10       A.  Yes.

             11       Q.  And do you also see that it's in the amount

             12   of $340,000?

             13       A.  Yes, sir.

             14       Q.  And if you flip to the fourth page of this

             15   document, sir, please.

             16       A.  It doesn't have these marked pages.

             17       Q.  So the very bottom of that fourth page will

             18   have a label that ends with 375 on the bottom right-

             19   hand corner.  That's the page I'm looking at and I'd

             20   like you to look at.  Yes, that's the page.

             21               Do you see that page, sir?

             22       A.  Yes.

             23       Q.  And do you see that this was signed by

             24   Michael DeLuca?




                                                               271

              1       A.  Yes.

              2       Q.  And it looks like he signed it individually

              3   and as trustee of the Duke Realty Trust.

              4               Do you see that?

              5       A.  Yes.

              6       Q.  And it looks like it was witnessed by Paul

              7   Magliocchetti?

              8       A.  Yes.

              9       Q.  Do you see that, sir?

             10       A.  I see it, yes.

             11       Q.  And at the time, was Paul Magliocchetti

             12   your lawyer with respect to this promissory note,

             13   this document?

             14       A.  Yes.

             15       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, what exactly is this

             16   document?

             17       A.  What's this document?

             18       Q.  Yes.  What is this document?

             19       A.  This document is that I helped somebody

             20   out, needed money and I gave the person money.

             21       Q.  And who did you help out and what amount of

             22   money did you give them?

             23       A.  I don't remember.

             24       Q.  Well, I'd like you to look at this document,




                                                               272

              1   please, to refresh your recollection.

              2       A.  The first page?

              3       Q.  Yeah, please.

              4       A.  I can't remember.

              5       Q.  So on page 1 of this document, the

              6   promissory note, it looks like the amount of this

              7   note, the loan that you're making, to Michael DeLuca

              8   and Duke Realty is $340,000.

              9               Does that refresh your memory?

             10       A.  I can't remember.

             11       Q.  Do you remember this document?

             12       A.  Pardon me?

             13       Q.  Do you remember this document?

             14       A.  Do I remember this document?

             15       Q.  Yes.

             16       A.  No, I don't.

             17       Q.  I'd like you to read the first paragraph of

             18   this document, please.

             19       A.  Do you want me to read it out loud?

             20       Q.  No.  You can read it to yourself.

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  So from reading the first paragraph of this

             23   promissory note, what's been marked as Exhibit 5,

             24   does that refresh your memory as to what this




                                                               273

              1   document is?

              2       A.  Can I answer that question?

              3               MR. TRETTER:  Yeah.  Answer the

              4   question.  Does it refresh your memory?

              5       A.  I remember his name was Gino DeLuca, not

              6   Michael DeLuca.  He needed some help and I gave it

              7   to him.  What more can I tell you?  That's it.

              8       Q.  Now, was "Gino" a nickname for Michael?

              9       A.  I never -- I just knew him as Gino DeLuca.

             10       Q.  Do you know if his formal name was Michael?

             11       A.  No.

             12       Q.  You don't know?

             13       A.  No, I don't know.

             14       Q.  And from having read this first paragraph,

             15   does this refresh your memory that you loaned Gino

             16   DeLuca $340,000?

             17       A.  I don't know.  No, I don't know really.

             18       Q.  Do you have any memory of loaning Michael

             19   DeLuca or Gino DeLuca $340,000?

             20       A.  No.  No, I don't.

             21       Q.  As you sit here today, you don't remember

             22   making a loan to Gino DeLuca?

             23       A.  I remember --

             24       Q.  Hold on a second.  We're going to stop this




                                                               274

              1   right now.  Again, Mr. Pentoliros, we can't speak

              2   over one another.

              3               Okay, sir?

              4       A.  Yes.

              5       Q.  I will let you finish before I ask you a

              6   new question; I ask for the same courtesy in return.

              7   Okay, sir?

              8       A.  Yeah, I got you.

              9       Q.  So as you sit here right now, you don't

             10   remember making a loan for $340,000 to Gino DeLuca?

             11       A.  No, I don't.

             12       Q.  Do you have any reason to believe that this

             13   document is not accurate?

             14       A.  No.

             15       Q.  And I'll let you know, Mr. Pentoliros, that

             16   this is a document that your attorney produced in

             17   response to some discovery questions that we asked,

             18   okay, sir?  Do you understand that?

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  From reading this first paragraph, do you

             21   know the terms of this loan to Mr. DeLuca?

             22       A.  No.

             23       Q.  Again, if I can direct you to the first

             24   paragraph of this document, sir, I'd like you to




                                                               275

              1   look at it, please.

              2       A.  Do you want me to read it again?

              3       Q.  If you need to, sir.

              4       A.  I read it, yeah.

              5       Q.  And does this first paragraph indicate that

              6   this is a loan for $340,000 that's due and payable

              7   on June 1 of 2014 with a 12 percent interest rate

              8   per year?

              9       A.  I don't know.

             10       Q.  Well, is that what the first paragraph says?

             11       A.  That's what it says but I don't know.

             12   I don't remember.

             13       Q.  You don't remember, okay.  And, again, you

             14   see the date here is May 15 of 2013?

             15       A.  Which one?  The second paragraph?

             16       Q.  The first page at the very top it says

             17   May 15, 2013?

             18       A.  I don't remember, I told you.

             19       Q.  Do you remember meeting with your attorney,

             20   Paul Magliocchetti, to discuss a loan to Gino DeLuca?

             21       A.  Yes, I do.

             22       Q.  And what year do you remember meeting with

             23   Paul Magliocchetti to make that loan?

             24       A.  I don't remember, no.




                                                               276

              1       Q.  And, again, you don't have any reason to

              2   dispute the validity of this document?

              3       A.  No.

              4       Q.  If you could turn to the fourth page again,

              5   which has the label 375 at the bottom right-hand

              6   corner.

              7       A.  Do you want me to read this page?

              8       Q.  No.  I'm just going to ask you, do you

              9   recognize that as Gino DeLuca's signature?

             10       A.  No.

             11       Q.  And do you have a memory of Gino DeLuca

             12   being the trustee of the Duke Realty Trust?

             13       A.  Yes.

             14       Q.  And at the bottom of that page, you'll see

             15   that this loan, this note is secured by mortgages

             16   and a deed in lieu on four different properties.

             17               Do you see that, sir?

             18       A.  Yes.

             19       Q.  And do you have a memory of making a loan

             20   to Mr. DeLuca that was secured by mortgages and a

             21   deed in lieu?

             22       A.  Yes, I do.

             23               MR. ADAMS:  This will be the next

             24   exhibit, please.




                                                               277

              1                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 6 was marked

              2                     for identification.)

              3       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, what we've marked as

              4   Exhibit No. 6 to your deposition is a document that

              5   is titled "Mortgage and security agreement."

              6               Do you see that, sir?

              7       A.  What, the page she gave me, the young lady?

              8       Q.  Yes.  It's been marked as Exhibit 6.  Do

              9   you see that, sir?

             10       A.  I see that, yes.

             11       Q.  And do you see that the document's titled

             12   "Mortgage and security agreement"?

             13       A.  Yes, I do.

             14       Q.  And do you see, sir, on the first page of

             15   that document where it says that this mortgage and

             16   security agreement is putting a mortgage on a

             17   property at 14 Mt. Vernon Street in Haverhill,

             18   Massachusetts?

             19       A.  I see that, yes.

             20       Q.  And it's to secure a loan that you made to

             21   Mr. DeLuca in the amount of $340,000; do you see

             22   that, sir?

             23       A.  Yes.

             24       Q.  I'd like to have you turn back to Exhibit 5




                                                               278

              1   on page 4.  And do you see that property listed:

              2   14 Mt. Vernon Street, Haverhill, Massachusetts?

              3       A.  Yes.

              4       Q.  And if you look at Exhibit 6, please,

              5   if you turn to page --

              6       A.  The page 6, you said?

              7       Q.  If you look at Exhibit 6.

              8       A.  What do you want me to look at here?

              9       Q.  And turn to page 9, please, which has that

             10   label 152 on the bottom right-hand corner.

             11       A.  What page, did you say?  9?

             12       Q.  Page 9, please.

             13       A.  Huh?

             14       Q.  Page 9.

             15       A.  Page 9.  What, are these stuck together,

             16   sir?

             17       Q.  Let me see if I can help you.

             18       A.  Thank you.

             19       Q.  Page 9.  You're welcome.

             20       A.  What do you want me to read here?

             21       Q.  Do you see on page 9 a signature at the

             22   very bottom?

             23       A.  Yes, I do.

             24       Q.  And who signed that?




                                                               279

              1       A.  It says Michael DeLuca.

              2       Q.  And it looks like he's signing as trustee

              3   of the Duke Realty Trust?

              4       A.  Um.

              5       Q.  And what's the date of his signature?

              6       A.  "Executed as a sealed instrument this 15th

              7   day May 2013."

              8       Q.  And, again, this May 15, 2013, it's also

              9   the same date as the promissory note which is on

             10   Exhibit 5; do you see that, sir?

             11       A.  Yes, I do.

             12       Q.  From having looked at this document which

             13   you have in your hands, the mortgage and security

             14   agreement that's been marked as Exhibit 6, does that

             15   refresh your memory that Mr. DeLuca granted this

             16   mortgage to you to secure that loan for $340,000?

             17       A.  No.

             18       Q.  It didn't refresh your memory?

             19       A.  I don't remember, no.

             20       Q.  Do you have any reason to dispute the

             21   validity of this mortgage and security agreement

             22   which has been marked as Exhibit 6?

             23       A.  Say that again.

             24       Q.  Do you have any reason to doubt the validity




                                                               280

              1   of this mortgage and security agreement which we

              2   marked as Exhibit 6?

              3       A.  No.  I have no reason to dispute it.

              4       Q.  Did you ever go to 14 Mt. Vernon Street,

              5   Haverhill --

              6       A.  No.

              7       Q.  -- to visit the property?

              8       A.  No, I never did.

              9               MR. ADAMS:  Next one, please.

             10                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 7 was marked

             11                     for identification.)

             12       Q.  All right, Mr. Pentoliros, what's been

             13   marked as Exhibit No. 7 is another document with a

             14   label "Mortgage and security agreement."

             15               Do you see that, sir?

             16       A.  Yes, I'm reading it.

             17       Q.  And from looking at the first page on this

             18   mortgage and security agreement, do you see that

             19   this is a mortgage that Mr. DeLuca granted to you on

             20   the property of 12 Coates Lane in Haverhill,

             21   Massachusetts to secure that $340,000 loan that you

             22   lent him?

             23       A.  Yes.

             24       Q.  Do you see that?




                                                               281

              1       A.  Yes.

              2       Q.  And if I could have you, please --

              3   Actually, sir, at the top left-hand corner, you'll

              4   see a label, and this label is both on this exhibit,

              5   7, as well as Exhibit 6 -- right here?

              6       A.  You said on top of the left-hand?

              7       Q.  Yes.

              8       A.  Right here it says "Sheehan, Schiavoni,

              9   Jutras and Magliocchetti, 70 Bailey Boulevard,

             10   Haverhill, Mass."

             11       Q.  And those were your attorneys, right?

             12       A.  My attorney was Paul Magliocchetti.  That

             13   was my attorney.

             14       Q.  Sure.  And the document you have in your

             15   hand, if you could please turn to page 9.

             16       A.  I can't understand why I'm having trouble

             17   with 7, 8, and 9 here.  Am I doing something wrong

             18   here?

             19       Q.  Yes, I think -- let me see.  Let me help

             20   you out.

             21       A.  Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?

             22       Q.  Yeah.  So focus on the number at the bottom

             23   right there, this number.

             24       A.  That's 5.




                                                               282

              1       Q.  Yeah, so a few more pages.

              2       A.  That's 7.

              3       Q.  There you go.

              4       A.  What are they, in different order or

              5   something?

              6       Q.  That's a production label.  Your counsel

              7   prepared that number just as part of the document

              8   production.  But this is the actual page on this

              9   mortgage.

             10       A.  Once the pages after 7, I couldn't get the

             11   next page to 9.  That's why.

             12       Q.  Do you see a signature at the bottom of

             13   page 9, sir?

             14       A.  Yes, I do.

             15       Q.  And do you see that being Michael DeLuca's

             16   signature?

             17       A.  Yes, sir.

             18       Q.  And he signed that as trustee of the Duke

             19   Realty Trust?

             20       A.  Yes, sir.

             21       Q.  And, again, this mortgage and security

             22   agreement is dated May 15, 2013?

             23       A.  Yes, sir.

             24       Q.  And that's the same date as the promissory




                                                               283

              1   note that we looked at before?

              2       A.  Yes.

              3       Q.  After having looked at this mortgage on the

              4   property at 12 Coates Lane, does this refresh your

              5   memory that Mr. DeLuca granted this mortgage to you?

              6       A.  No.  This doesn't refresh my memory at all,

              7   sir.

              8       Q.  Do you have any reason to doubt the validity

              9   or the accuracy of this document?

             10       A.  No.

             11       Q.  And if I could have you look at Exhibit 5,

             12   which was the promissory note, do you see on the

             13   fourth page which has the label 375 that the

             14   12 Coates Lane, Haverhill property is listed as one

             15   of the -- one of the properties that has a mortgage

             16   on it?

             17       A.  Yes, I see Costas [sic] Lane, Haverhill,

             18   amaze.

             19       Q.  And that's Coates Lane, correct?

             20       A.  Yes.

             21                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 8 was marked

             22                     for identification.)

             23       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, what's been marked as

             24   Exhibit No. 8 to your deposition right in front of




                                                               284

              1   you, it's another mortgage and security agreement.

              2               Do you see in the upper left-hand corner

              3   the label with your attorney's name?

              4       A.  Yes, I do.

              5       Q.  And, again, once again here, your attorney

              6   was Paul Magliocchetti?

              7       A.  Yes, sir.

              8       Q.  And do you see where this says "Mortgage

              9   and security agreement"?

             10       A.  Yes.

             11       Q.  And you see that this was a mortgage that

             12   was granted by Mr. DeLuca at a property at 34 Grand

             13   Avenue, Haverhill, Massachusetts to secure the loan

             14   that you made him for $340,000?

             15       A.  Yes.

             16       Q.  Again, if I could have you turn to page 9,

             17   please.

             18       A.  Yes, sir, go ahead.

             19       Q.  And you do see who signed this mortgage?

             20       A.  Michael DeLuca.

             21       Q.  And it looks like he signed it

             22   individually, not in his capacity as a trustee of a

             23   realty trust.

             24               Do you see that?




                                                               285

              1       A.  I see down here by Michael DeLuca -- What

              2   else do you want me to look for?

              3       Q.  No.  I was just noting that it doesn't look

              4   like he was signing on behalf of a trust.  It looks

              5   like he's signing just for himself.

              6       A.  I can't tell you.

              7       Q.  That's fine.  Do you see that this is dated

              8   May 15, 2013?

              9       A.  Yes.

             10       Q.  After having looked at this mortgage and

             11   security agreement, does this refresh your memory of

             12   Mr. DeLuca granting a mortgage to secure that

             13   $340,000 loan?

             14       A.  Yes.

             15       Q.  It does refresh your memory?

             16       A.  I don't know.  It does and it doesn't.

             17   I don't know how to answer that question.

             18       Q.  Let me ask you this.  And I'll just preface

             19   it with this.  I understand that we're going back

             20   over six years.

             21       A.  Yeah.  That's a long time, sir.

             22       Q.  I understand.  This is May of 2013, so over

             23   six years ago.  That's why I'm showing you these

             24   documents --




                                                               286

              1       A.  Yeah.

              2       Q.  -- to see if it can help you remember.

              3       A.  Um.

              4       Q.  Thinking back to May of 2013, the spring of

              5   2013, do you have a memory of Mr. DeLuca asking you

              6   for a substantial loan and then you saying, Yes, as

              7   long as you secure it with some properties that you

              8   own?

              9       A.  Yes, I remember that.

             10       Q.  So you remember that?

             11       A.  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember that.

             12       Q.  And what do you remember about how that

             13   conversation went and kind of the process involved?

             14       A.  I really can't remember, sir.  That's the

             15   truth.  I can't remember.

             16       Q.  Do you remember Mr. DeLuca explaining to

             17   you why he needed this loan?

             18       A.  I had my attorney, Paul Magliocchetti,

             19   explain things to me.

             20       Q.  Yep.

             21       A.  And I trust Paul very much.  And he knew

             22   Gino DeLuca for a long time.

             23       Q.  "He" being Paul Magliocchetti knew Gino?

             24       A.  Paul Magliocchetti had known Gino DeLuca.




                                                               287

              1   And Paul told me --

              2               MR. TRETTER:  Well, you don't need to

              3   disclose what your attorney told you.

              4               THE WITNESS:  Yeah, all right.

              5       Q.  So you remember at some point in the spring

              6   of 2013 speaking with your attorney about this loan

              7   that you were going to make Mr. DeLuca, correct?

              8       A.  Going back to 2013, sir, I can't remember a

              9   thing.  I took electric shock treatment, 19

             10   treatments.  And I'm still -- and I still haven't

             11   recovered over this whole deal that I've been

             12   through.  I can't say any more.

             13       Q.  Is a loan in the amount of $340,000, in

             14   your opinion, a sizable loan?

             15       A.  Yes.

             16       Q.  And a loan of that amount of money you

             17   would want to speak with your attorney about to

             18   protect your interest, correct?

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  And do you have a memory of speaking with

             21   your attorney about this loan that you were going to

             22   make to Mr. DeLuca?

             23       A.  Yes.

             24       Q.  And do you have a memory of speaking and




                                                               288

              1   meeting with your attorney to go over the mortgage

              2   and security agreement?

              3       A.  No, I don't remember that.

              4       Q.  Do you have a memory of meeting with

              5   Mr. Magliocchetti to talk about the terms of this

              6   loan, i.e., the promissory note and how much

              7   interest you'd be able to accrue on a yearly basis

              8   based on this loan?

              9       A.  No, I don't remember.

             10       Q.  So do you have any reason to doubt the

             11   validity of this document that we've marked as

             12   Exhibit No. 8?

             13       A.  No.

             14       Q.  And if you could look at page 4, again, of

             15   Exhibit No. 5, which is the promissory note, and do

             16   you see here at the bottom here of the list of

             17   properties that 34 Grand Avenue is listed?

             18       A.  Yes.

             19       Q.  Was Gino DeLuca a friend of yours?

             20       A.  No.

             21       Q.  How did you meet Mr. DeLuca?

             22       A.  Through Paul Magliocchetti.

             23                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 9 was marked

             24                     for identification.)




                                                               289

              1       A.  I don't remember this at all, no.

              2       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, what we've marked as

              3   Exhibit No. 9 is a one-page document with a label

              4   168 at the bottom right-hand corner.

              5       A.  What --

              6       Q.  Just one second, sir.  Just a second.  It's

              7   a document that you have in your hand.  It looks

              8   like it's a copy of a piece of paper with a date

              9   January 14, 2014; do you see that, sir?

             10       A.  I see that, yes, sir.

             11       Q.  And can you tell what this is, sir?

             12       A.  Huh?

             13       Q.  Can you tell what this is?  Do you know

             14   what this is?

             15       A.  I have no memory of this at all.  I'm being

             16   honest with you.

             17       Q.  And you see that this looks like a

             18   handwritten note that says, "I, James Silva, agree

             19   to pay J.P. Pentoliros $8,000 at a rate of $1,100

             20   per week for eight consecutive weeks starting

             21   January 22, 2014."

             22               And then it's signed by James A. Silva.

             23               This doesn't --

             24       A.  Not at all.




                                                               290

              1       Q.  -- refresh your memory?

              2       A.  No.

              3       Q.  Do you have a memory of making an $8,000

              4   loan to Mr. Silva?

              5       A.  No.  I don't remember.

              6       Q.  Does that appear to be Mr. Silva's

              7   signature on this piece of paper?

              8       A.  I don't know.

              9       Q.  You're not familiar with his signature?

             10       A.  No.

             11       Q.  Do you have any memory of making a loan to

             12   Mr. Silva in January of 2014?

             13       A.  No.

             14       Q.  Do you have a memory of making any loans to

             15   Mr. Silva?

             16       A.  No.

             17       Q.  So as you sit here today, you have no

             18   memory of ever making a single loan to Mr. Silva?

             19       A.  No.

             20       Q.  Do you have a memory of Mr. Silva ever

             21   scribbling down any sort of agreement in front of

             22   you concerning any agreements or deals that you made

             23   with him?

             24       A.  No.




                                                               291

              1       Q.  Have you ever seen this --

              2       A.  No.

              3       Q.  -- document before?

              4       A.  Never.

              5       Q.  Do you have a file cabinet or any folders

              6   or any areas at your house where you keep your

              7   records?

              8       A.  I had all my records up at Westgate,

              9   Santander Bank had everything I had had, all my

             10   records.  All my records are gone.  They're all

             11   shredded.

             12       Q.  But I'm not talking about any records that

             13   involve Santander Bank.  I'm talking about at your

             14   house, do you have anyplace where you keep any other

             15   documents, papers, records of any of your business

             16   transactions?

             17       A.  I had all my papers with Santander Bank,

             18   everything.  All my papers, everything.

             19       Q.  So as you sit here today, is it your belief

             20   that every document that you had, even documents

             21   that had nothing to do with Santander Bank, that you

             22   kept at Westgate plaza?

             23       A.  Yes, everything.

              1                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 10 was marked

              2                     for identification.)

              3       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, what we've marked as

              4   Exhibit No. 10 --

              5       A.  Yes.

              6       Q.  -- is a document with the title "Mortgage

              7   and security agreement."

              8       A.  Yes.

              9       Q.  If you could, sir, just take a look at the

             10   language contained on that front page.  And while

             11   you're doing that, I'm going to organize some of

             12   these documents here.

             13       A.  You want me to read the first page?

             14       Q.  Yes.  Read the first page.

             15                     (Telephone interruption.)

             16       A.  You don't want me to answer the phone.

             17       Q.  If it's an emergency.  If you have to take

             18   it, you have to take it.

             19       A.  Let me read this.

             20               MR. ADAMS:  Off the record, please.

             21                     (Discussion off the record.)

             22               MR. ADAMS:  Back on the record, please.

             23       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, have you had a chance to

             24   look at the first page of what's been marked as




                                                               293

              1   Exhibit No. 10?

              2       A.  Yes.

              3       Q.  And what is this, sir?

              4       A.  Pardon me?

              5       Q.  What is this document, sir?

              6       A.  To be honest with you, I don't know.

              7       Q.  From reading the first page of this

              8   document, does it appear to you that this is a

              9   mortgage that was granted by Mr. DeLuca on property

             10   at 12 -- at 34 Grand Avenue in Haverhill to secure a

             11   loan that you made to him in the amount of $300,000?

             12   Do you see where it says that, sir?

             13       A.  Yes, I do.

             14       Q.  Do you have a memory -- and actually, if I

             15   could have you flip to page 9 again, please.  I'm

             16   sorry.  Page 10 this time.  Page 10.

             17       A.  Yeah.

             18       Q.  And do you see on page 10 that this is a

             19   document that's dated November 3, 2014 at the top of

             20   the page?

             21       A.  Yes, sir.

             22       Q.  And it looks like it was signed by

             23   Mr. DeLuca individually and in his capacity as

             24   manager of MED Properties, LLC.




                                                               294

              1               Do you see that, sir?

              2       A.  Yes.

              3       Q.  And then at the very bottom, it looks like

              4   this was acknowledged by your attorney, Paul

              5   Magliocchetti.

              6               Do you see that, sir?

              7       A.  Yes.

              8       Q.  Back to page 1, please.  Do you have a

              9   memory in November of 2014 of making a loan to

             10   Mr. DeLuca in the amount of $300,000?

             11       A.  I don't remember.

             12       Q.  Do you have a general memory of making

             13   another sizable loan to Mr. DeLuca?

             14       A.  I don't remember, to tell you the truth.

             15       Q.  And, again, you would view a loan in the

             16   amount of $300,000 to be a sizable loan?

             17       A.  Pardon me?

             18       Q.  Would you view a loan in the amount of

             19   $300,000 to be a sizable or --

             20       A.  Yes.

             21       Q.  -- substantial loan?

             22       A.  Yes.

             23       Q.  And do you have any memory of meeting with

             24   Attorney Magliocchetti about a loan to Mr. DeLuca in




                                                               295

              1   the amount of $300,000?

              2       A.  I don't remember, sir, to be honest with

              3   you.  I don't remember.

              4       Q.  Would you have met with your lawyer,

              5   Attorney Magliocchetti, to help you prepare documents

              6   related to a loan to Mr. DeLuca in the amount of

              7   $300,000?

              8       A.  Yes, I would.

              9       Q.  Do you remember a company called MED

             10   Properties, LLC?

             11       A.  No.

             12       Q.  You have no memory of that company?

             13       A.  Not at all.

             14       Q.  Do you have any memory of making any loans

             15   in 2014?

             16       A.  I don't remember, no.

             17       Q.  So as you sit here right now, you don't

             18   have any memory of making any loans in 2014?

             19       A.  I have no memory, no, of it.

             20       Q.  Do you have any reason to dispute the

             21   validity of this document, sir?

             22       A.  Which document are we talking about?

             23       Q.  The one that's right in front of you,

             24   what's been marked as Exhibit 10, the mortgage and




                                                               296

              1   security agreement.

              2       A.  I can't remember.  Yes, I can't remember

              3   the thing at all.  I can't remember.

              4       Q.  This document that's been signed by

              5   Mr. DeLuca and witnessed and acknowledged by

              6   Attorney Magliocchetti that details a loan that you

              7   made to Mr. DeLuca and a mortgage he granted to you

              8   to secure that loan for $300,000, as you sit here

              9   right now, do you have any reason to dispute the

             10   accuracy of this document?

             11       A.  I can't remember.

             12                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 11 was marked

             13                     for identification.)

             14       A.  I'm not supposed to get into a story.

             15       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, what we've marked as

             16   Exhibit 11 is a document, a single-page document

             17   with the title "Loan agreement."  At the bottom

             18   right-hand corner is a label that ends in the

             19   No. 172.

             20               Do you see that document, sir?  Do you

             21   see the bottom right-hand corner has the No. 172.

             22       A.  Oh, I see it on the corner: 172.

             23       Q.  And do you see at the top of the document

             24   where it says "Loan agreement"?




                                                               297

              1       A.  Yes.

              2       Q.  This document, the language details a loan

              3   that you made to James Silva and a consulting group

              4   which is spelled K-j-m-t-y-l-e-r, with Silva and the

              5   consulting group being the borrower, you being the

              6   lender in the amount of $50,000.  And, again, this

              7   is dated January 7 of 2015.

              8               Do you have a memory of making a loan to

              9   Mr. Silva in January of 2015?

             10       A.  No.

             11       Q.  Do you have a memory of making a loan to

             12   Mr. Silva and/or this consulting group in the amount

             13   of $50,000?

             14       A.  No.

             15       Q.  And as you sit here today, do you have any

             16   memory of ever making any loans to Mr. Silva?

             17       A.  No.

             18       Q.  Can you tell me about your relationship

             19   with Mr. Silva.

             20       A.  I'm not supposed to get into a story.

             21       Q.  Well, Mr. Pentoliros, you are here to

             22   answer questions.  So I'm asking you a question,

             23   what your relationship with Mr. Silva was.

             24       A.  My mother left the diner to Larry and




                                                               298

              1   Perry.  We had four people in the diner.  They all

              2   went out of business.  I knew Mr. Silva many years

              3   ago.  I knew him casually from my mother and father.

              4   And he was in the restaurant business.  He had

              5   Memory Lane.

              6               So he had asked my brother Larry and me

              7   if he could take over the diner.  We said yes.  We

              8   knew he was successful.  There were already four

              9   other people in there.  None of them made any money.

             10   They couldn't pay us.  I was never in the restaurant

             11   business.  Mr. Silva was in the restaurant business.

             12   I knew that.  But I really didn't know him.  My

             13   mother and father knew him.  I didn't know the man.

             14       Q.  And so how did Mr. Silva do with running

             15   the diner?

             16       A.  Basically what I saw, he was busy.  He was

             17   doing a good business.  Basically what I saw.

             18       Q.  Was the business successful?

             19       A.  I would say he was successful at the time.

             20       Q.  Do you know if he ever had to take out any

             21   loans to keep the diner afloat?

             22       A.  I don't know.

             23       Q.  And, again, as you sit here right now, do

             24   you have any memory of you ever loaning money to




                                                               299

              1   Mr. Silva to assist with the diner?

              2       A.  No.

              3       Q.  Have you ever seen this loan agreement

              4   before, which has been marked as Exhibit 11?

              5       A.  This one right here?

              6       Q.  Yeah.

              7       A.  No, I haven't, sir.

              8       Q.  So as you sit here today, this is the first

              9   time you've seen this?

             10       A.  First time I've seen it, yeah.  To my

             11   knowledge.

             12               I'd like to speak to my lawyer outside

             13   for a minute, sir, if I may.

             14               MR. ADAMS:  Yeah, you can.

             15                     (Recess at 9:49 a.m.,

             16                     resumed at 9:57 a.m.)

             17       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, we're back on the

             18   record.  And let me remind you, sir, you understand

             19   that you're under oath and that you're required to

             20   tell the truth here?

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  You understand that, sir?

             23       A.  Yes, I do.

             24       Q.  I'm going to ask you again, what's been




                                                               300

              1   marked as Exhibit 11, this loan agreement which is

              2   right in front of you, have you seen this before?

              3       A.  I don't know.  With Silva?  Is that the one

              4   with Silva, sir?

              5               MR. TRETTER:  It's right there in front

              6   of you.

              7       A.  I don't remember this, no.

              8       Q.  Have you ever seen this document before?

              9       A.  I don't remember seeing it, no.

             10       Q.  And you don't have any memory of ever

             11   making a loan to Silva?

             12       A.  No.

             13       Q.  Do you have any reason to dispute the

             14   accuracy of this document that's right in front of

             15   you?

             16       A.  I never saw it before.  What am I supposed

             17   to tell you?

             18       Q.  Okay.  Well, I'm just asking.  Do you have

             19   any reason --

             20       A.  I have no recollection of that paper at

             21   all, none.

             22                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 12 was marked

             23                     for identification.)

             24       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, what's been marked as




                                                               301

              1   Exhibit 12 to your deposition is a document with the

              2   label -- or the title "Mortgage and security

              3   agreement."

              4               If you could, sir, I'd like you to look

              5   at the first page of this document, please.

              6       A.  Do you want me to read the first page?

              7       Q.  Just the first, say -- first half of it,

              8   please.

              9       A.  Yes, I do remember this.

             10       Q.  And if you could turn to page 10, please,

             11   of the document.  Do you see, sir, at the top of

             12   page 10 that this document was signed by Michael

             13   Malvers individually and as -- in his capacity as

             14   manager of the Hill Street Bridge, LLC?

             15       A.  I see that, yes.

             16       Q.  And do you see this document is dated

             17   August 3 of 2015?

             18       A.  Yes.

             19       Q.  And do you see at the bottom the notary

             20   public signature by Paul Magliocchetti?

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  Could you turn back to page 1, please.

             23       A.  Turn back to page 1?

             24       Q.  Yes.  The very first page.  From having




                                                               302

              1   read this document, do you see that this is a

              2   mortgage that was granted to you by Michael Malvers

              3   on the property at 114 Hale Street in Haverhill to

              4   secure a loan that you made to him in the amount of

              5   $250,000?

              6               Do you see that, sir?

              7       A.  Yes, I do.

              8       Q.  And do you have a memory of making a loan

              9   to Michael Malvers in the amount of $250,000?

             10       A.  I remember I gave him a loan, but I don't

             11   remember how much.

             12       Q.  Does the amount of a quarter of a million,

             13   $250,000, seem accurate?

             14       A.  It could be accurate.  It couldn't be

             15   accurate.  How do I answer the question?  I can't

             16   remember.

             17               MR. TRETTER:  Can I just -- I don't mean

             18   to interrupt your train of thought.  And it's

             19   minute, but it was 114 Hale Street and 112 Hale

             20   Street, just --

             21               MR. ADAMS:  Thank you.  I appreciate

             22   that, Tom.

             23       Q.  So just for the record, this mortgage as is

             24   included on page 1 of what's marked as Exhibit 12




                                                               303

              1   indicates that this is a mortgage on two properties:

              2   one, 114 Hale Street and the second 112 Hale Street.

              3               Were loans in the amount of a quarter of

              4   a million dollars something that you frequently did

              5   in the 2013-2014-2015 time frame?

              6       A.  To be honest with you, I can't remember,

              7   sir.

              8       Q.  So as you --

              9       A.  I really can't remember.

             10       Q.  So you would agree with me that a loan for

             11   $250,000 is a substantial and sizable loan?

             12       A.  I'd say it's a large sum of money.

             13       Q.  But as you sit here right now, you don't

             14   have any memory of making a loan for $250,000?

             15       A.  I remember making a loan, but I can't

             16   remember how much.

             17       Q.  But you remember making a loan to Michael

             18   Malvers?

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  And can you tell me about how this loan

             21   came to be?

             22       A.  I talked to Paul Magliocchetti.  Paul

             23   Magliocchetti evidently knew this gentleman,

             24   Mr. Malvers.  And he asked me if I wanted to help




                                                               304

              1   him out.  He said everything would be secure, I

              2   wouldn't lose a dime, my investment was good.  And I

              3   did it because I trusted Paul Magliocchetti.

              4       Q.  And Paul Magliocchetti was your lawyer,

              5   correct?

              6       A.  Pardon me?

              7       Q.  Paul was your lawyer, correct?

              8       A.  He was my lawyer, yes.

              9       Q.  And do you have a memory of Paul preparing

             10   this mortgage and security agreement?

             11       A.  I have no record -- I have no recollection

             12   of it, no.  I can't remember.

             13       Q.  Do you have any reason to dispute the

             14   validity or the accuracy of this mortgage that's

             15   been marked as Exhibit No. 12?

             16       A.  Do I have any what?

             17       Q.  Reason to dispute the accuracy of this

             18   mortgage.

             19       A.  No.

             20                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 13 was marked

             21                     for identification.)

             22       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, what's been marked as

             23   Exhibit 13 and what's in front of you right now is

             24   another mortgage and security agreement.  If you




                                                               305

              1   could, sir, if you could read the first half of this

              2   page.  And then when you're done with that, if you

              3   could turn to page 9 and page 10 to look at the date

              4   and the signature on this document.

              5       A.  And you said to turn to page 9, sir?

              6       Q.  Pages 9 and 10, please.  And just look at

              7   the date and the signatures on those pages, please.

              8       A.  These are 9 and 10?

              9       Q.  Do you see on --

             10       A.  It's a different signature from 10.

             11       Q.  On page 9, do you see that this is a

             12   document that's dated June 8 of 2017?  If you look

             13   at the very bottom, it says, "Executed as a sealed

             14   instrument this 8th day of June" --

             15       A.  Oh, I see it, yes.

             16       Q.  And it looks like there's some initials

             17   right below that, correct?

             18       A.  There's initials.  I don't know whose

             19   initials those are.

             20       Q.  And do you see on the next page, page 10,

             21   that it looks like it was signed by a Michael DeLuca

             22   in his capacity as a manager for MED Properties, LLC?

             23       A.  We're looking at 10, you said, right?

             24       Q.  Top of page 10.




                                                               306

              1       A.  Yeah.  It says, Michael DeLuca, manager,

              2   duly authorized.  Yeah, I see that, yes.

              3       Q.  And do you see a signature?

              4       A.  I see a signature, yes.

              5       Q.  And do you see also "MED Properties, LLC"

              6   right below his signature, right?

              7       A.  Underneath his signature?

              8       Q.  No.  Right above his signature.  It says

              9   "MED Properties, LLC."  At the very top of the page.

             10       A.  Oh, MED Properties, LLC?

             11       Q.  Yes.

             12       A.  I see it here.

             13       Q.  And halfway down you see that this document

             14   was notarized, it looks like that's the signature of

             15   Paul Magliocchetti?

             16       A.  Yes.

             17       Q.  If you could turn to the first page, please.

             18   Do you have a memory of making a loan to MED

             19   Properties in June of 2017 in the amount of $120,000?

             20       A.  What year was this?

             21       Q.  2017, June of 2017.

             22       A.  Supposedly who did I make that loan to, sir?

             23       Q.  It looks like you made the loan to MED

             24   Properties, LLC, and the person who you were




                                                               307

              1   probably dealing with looks like it's Michael DeLuca

              2   since he was the manager.

              3       A.  And this was '17?

              4       Q.  June of 2017.

              5       A.  I think I got out of the nuthouse in -- I

              6   think I got out -- I think I got out in May of '17.

              7   I just got out of the nuthouse at the time.  I can't

              8   remember.

              9       Q.  So as you sit here today, you don't recall

             10   making a loan in the amount of $120,000 in June of

             11   2017?

             12       A.  I can't remember, sir.

             13       Q.  Do you recall a loan that you made that was

             14   secured by a mortgage on property at 16 Flora Street

             15   here in Haverhill?

             16       A.  16 what?

             17       Q.  Flora, F-l-o-r-a.  And that address is

             18   right here.

             19       A.  And I made a loan out to "16 Flora Street,

             20   Haverhill, Mass." --

             21       Q.  So this --

             22       A.  -- "as further described in Exhibit A,

             23   attached and made a part hereof to secure" --

             24       Q.  So this is --




                                                               308

              1       A.  -- "the payment of $120,000 with interest."

              2               I don't remember.  I can't remember.

              3   I can't remember.  I can't tell you why I can't

              4   remember.

              5       Q.  Have you ever been to 16 Flora Street?

              6       A.  No.

              7       Q.  So just to be clear, you don't remember

              8   making any loan to an MED Properties in the amount

              9   of $120,000 that was secured by a mortgage on

             10   property located at 16 Flora Street in Haverhill?

             11       A.  No, I don't remember.

             12       Q.  Do you remember meeting with Attorney

             13   Magliocchetti in June of 2017 to discuss a loan that

             14   you would be making?

             15       A.  No, I don't remember it at all.

             16       Q.  Okay.

             17       A.  No recollection whatsoever.

             18       Q.  And do you have any recollection of meeting

             19   with Attorney Magliocchetti about a mortgage that

             20   would be granted to you to secure a loan?

             21       A.  I don't remember, no.

             22       Q.  And as you sit here today, after looking at

             23   this mortgage agreement that we marked as Exhibit 13,

             24   do you have any reason to dispute the accuracy of




                                                               309

              1   this document which was signed by -- or notarized by

              2   your Attorney Magliocchetti?

              3       A.  No.  I have no reason not to agree with it,

              4   no.

              5                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 14 was marked

              6                     for identification.)

              7       Q.  And what's been marked as Exhibit 14 is

              8   another mortgage and security agreement, and it

              9   looks like it concerns another property which was --

             10   a mortgage was granted on it to secure that same

             11   loan of $120,000.

             12               If you could just take a look at the

             13   first page, please, and then when you're done, turn

             14   to page -- to page 10 and review that page, please.

             15       A.  And, sir, who was this -- who was this made

             16   out -- who did I give -- supposedly I gave money --

             17   does it say a name here?

             18       Q.  So if you look at the first page --

             19       A.  I'm reading it.  I don't see anybody's name

             20   on it except my name.  I see mine.  But I don't see

             21   the other person's name.  Where would I look for the

             22   other person's name, sir?

             23       Q.  Why don't you do this.  If you've finished

             24   looking at page 1, if I could have you turn to




                                                               310

              1   page 10, please.

              2       A.  Okay.  I've got it, sir.

              3       Q.  Do you see that this is a mortgage which

              4   was dated June 14 of 2017?

              5       A.  Yes, sir.

              6       Q.  And do you see that this was signed by

              7   Michael DeLuca as the manager for MED Properties,

              8   LLC?

              9       A.  Yes, sir.

             10       Q.  And that this document was notarized by

             11   your attorney, Paul Magliocchetti?

             12       A.  Yes, sir.

             13       Q.  Do you see all those things?

             14       A.  Yes, sir.

             15       Q.  All right.  So if you could turn back to

             16   page 1, please.

             17       A.  Yes, sir.  I don't see Paul Magliocchetti's

             18   name here, first page here.

             19       Q.  So do you see on the first page where it

             20   says that MED Properties is granting a mortgage to

             21   you in consideration of a loan in the amount of

             22   $120,000.

             23               Do you see that, sir?

             24       A.  You said provided a promissory note, sir?




                                                               311

              1       Q.  Yeah.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, you see on this

              2   document where it says --

              3       A.  "MED Properties, LLC, a Massachusetts

              4   limited liability company, with a principal place of

              5   business at 5 Lake Avenue, Haverhill, Essex County

              6   01830, hereafter referred to herein as the mortgage

              7   [sic] for consideration paid hereby grant to

              8   J. Perry Pentoliros, a private lender."

              9               What does this mean, sir?  I don't know.

             10       Q.  It's saying here that MED Properties is

             11   granting a mortgage to you -- you're the lender --

             12       A.  So I supposedly lent --

             13       Q.  If I could finish.

             14               MR. TRETTER:  Let him finish.

             15       Q.  So MED Properties is granting a mortgage to

             16   you because you're the private lender and the

             17   mortgage is on the property located at 49 Ashworth

             18   Terrace in Haverhill and 75-77 Riverview Street in

             19   Haverhill as well to secure a loan in the amount of

             20   $120,000 that you made to MED properties.

             21               Do you see where it says that in the

             22   document, sir?

             23       A.  I see it.  And I can't remember it, sir.

             24   I can't remember.




                                                               312

              1       Q.  And that was going to be my next question.

              2   Do you remember making a loan in the amount of

              3   $120,000 in June of 2017 to MED Properties?

              4       A.  No.

              5       Q.  Did you ever visit properties located at

              6   49 Ashworth Terrace here in Haverhill or

              7   75-77 Riverview Street?

              8       A.  No, sir.

              9       Q.  Do you know if the loans referred to in

             10   Exhibits 13 --

             11       A.  Um.

             12       Q.  -- which again is noted at $120,000, and

             13   then the loan referenced in Exhibit 14, which is

             14   again $120,000 --

             15       A.  $120,000, yeah.

             16       Q.  -- as you sit here today, do you have any

             17   knowledge or information or memory as to whether or

             18   not this was the same loan or a different loan?

             19       A.  I have no recollection.

             20       Q.  You have no idea.  As you sit here today?

             21       A.  Yes.  I have no recollection.  None.  You

             22   can always check if you need to -- Let me keep my

             23   mouth shut.  You can always check with McLean's

             24   Hospital.  They can tell you how sick I was.  Very,




                                                               313

              1   very sick man, major depressing disorder, very, very

              2   depressed disorder.

              3               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, there's no

              4   question.

              5       A.  I can't remember.

              6               MR. TRETTER:  We established --

              7       A.  I can't remember, sir --

              8               MR. TRETTER:  We've established you've

              9   been at McLean's.

             10       A.  -- you know.  And we're talking a lot of

             11   money.

             12               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

             13       A.  We're talking a lot of money.

             14               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, there's no

             15   question.

             16       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, I know you said that

             17   you left McLean's in May of 2017; is that --

             18       A.  May of '17, yes.  And I remember I was in

             19   the Holy Family Hospital in Haverhill, Mass.  I went

             20   in there -- I came out of there in '16.  I think I

             21   was in there a month.  I think I went in there in

             22   late December and I came out in January.  I was

             23   there for a whole month there --

             24       Q.  So --




                                                               314

              1       A.  -- for a very severe depressive disorder

              2   with all the things that happened to me.  I just got

              3   sick.

              4       Q.  So that's okay.  That's okay.  So May of

              5   2017 is when you received your treatment from

              6   McLean's?

              7       A.  That's when I got out.  I took treatments

              8   right along while I was in there.  Every week I took

              9   a shock treatment.

             10       Q.  Yep.  Can you describe for me your state of

             11   mind and how you felt and how you were doing in

             12   June of 2017 after you had left McLean's?

             13       A.  I didn't feel good at all.

             14       Q.  Were you still dealing with depression?

             15       A.  I went to a doctor -- I went to a doctor in

             16   Amesbury, Colin White, and I was still dealing with

             17   severe depression.  I didn't feel well at all.  I

             18   wasn't ready to actually leave that hospital, but I

             19   think my insurance -- so I had to be out of there.

             20   So that was why -- but I was far from being well

             21   when I got out of there.  I wasn't well.

             22       Q.  Okay.

             23       A.  I wasn't well for a long time.

             24       Q.  Do you remember getting involved or making




                                                               315

              1   loans soon after leaving McLean's?

              2       A.  I don't remember any of it -- To be honest

              3   with you, I don't remember anything.

              4       Q.  Okay.

              5       A.  I don't remember.

              6       Q.  Bringing your attention back to what's been

              7   marked as Exhibit 14, do you have any reason to --

              8               Well, strike the question, please.  Let

              9   me start again.

             10       A.  Go ahead.

             11       Q.  Do you remember meeting with Attorney

             12   Magliocchetti to discuss a loan to MED Properties

             13   which was secured by a mortgage on the properties

             14   located here at 49 Ashworth Terrace and

             15   75-77 Riverview Street?

             16       A.  I don't remember, no, sir.

             17       Q.  Do you have any reason to dispute the

             18   accuracy of this mortgage which has been marked as

             19   Exhibit 14?

             20       A.  No, I have no reason to dispute it.

             21       Q.  Do you consider yourself a successful

             22   businessman?

             23       A.  Yes.

             24       Q.  And one of your businesses that you engaged




                                                               316

              1   in over the years was making private loans to

              2   individuals and to their companies, correct?

              3       A.  No.

              4       Q.  No?

              5       A.  No.

              6       Q.  Okay.  Based on the documents we just

              7   looked at, these documents suggest that over a two-

              8   to three- to four-year period of time, you made in

              9   excess of $1 million worth of loans to people.

             10       A.  Hmm.  I don't remember.  But meanwhile --

             11               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, answer the

             12   question.

             13       A.  Like I said, my father and mother were

             14   dead.  All this started.  But we had to find a

             15   lawyer.  I found Paul Magliocchetti.  And I trusted

             16   him with everything.  He took care of things.  And I

             17   never made any loans to anybody that I can recall

             18   since I met Paul Magliocchetti.

             19               And I must have asked him, because I had

             20   money in the bank, instead of getting 1 percent or

             21   2 percent, do you know how you can make some money,

             22   to the best of my ability.  But I was never in the

             23   loaning business in my life, never.

             24       Q.  Okay.




                                                               317

              1       A.  Like I said, when I got here on account of

              2   my father and mother leaving the property, that's

              3   how I got involved with Paul Magliocchetti.  He took

              4   care of everything for me, whatever, and I asked

              5   him, Paul, do you have any investments for me?

              6               Because I had some money and the banks

              7   were paying nothing.  And that's how he got involved

              8   in the loans.  But I never was in the loaning

              9   business in my whole life.

             10       Q.  Through your interactions with your legal

             11   counsel, Attorney Magliocchetti, you made a number

             12   of loans to individuals, correct?

             13       A.  With Paul Magliocchetti, yes, sir.

             14       Q.  And do you recall the interest rates that

             15   you would charge that are related to these loans?

             16       A.  I don't remember, no, sir.

             17       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, I'm going to hand you what

             18   we previously looked at and marked as Exhibit No. 5.

             19   And again this was a promissory note that was dated

             20   May 15 of 2013.  And it was a document that you'll

             21   see on, you know, one of the last pages was

             22   witnessed by Paul Magliocchetti.

             23       A.  Here, read this last paragraph, sir?

             24       Q.  You can look at the entire first page if




                                                               318

              1   you'd like.  You don't have to but you can look at

              2   what you need to look at.

              3       A.  I'll be honest with you, sir.  I can't

              4   remember anything in 1913 [sic].  I can't remember.

              5   I know I had a lot of problems.  I was very sick.

              6   And I can't remember.  I really can't.

              7               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, why don't you wait

              8   for the next question.

              9       Q.  So you don't remember anything from 2013?

             10       A.  No, I don't remember anything.

             11       Q.  Do you remember anything from 2014?

             12       A.  I don't remember really anything from 2014

             13   or '15 either, to be honest with you.

             14       Q.  What's been marked as Exhibit 5, this

             15   promissory note, which was, we believe, prepared by

             16   Attorney Magliocchetti --

             17       A.  Correct.

             18       Q.  -- this details a loan in the amount of

             19   $340,000, that you, Mr. Pentoliros, as a private

             20   lender, made to Michael DeLuca or as you refer to

             21   him as Gino DeLuca?

             22       A.  Um.

             23       Q.  Correct, sir?

             24       A.  Yes, sir.  I don't remember this, no.




                                                               319

              1       Q.  So if you look at the first page, it looks

              2   like this loan -- again, which is dated May of

              3   2013 -- is due and payable on June 1, 2014, together

              4   with the interest thereon at the rate of 12 percent.

              5               Do you see that, sir --

              6       A.  Yes, sir.

              7       Q.  -- in the first paragraph?

              8               This loan for this amount with the

              9   interest rate of 12 percent, do you recall if this

             10   was the type of business dealings that you engaged

             11   in with the assistance of Attorney Magliocchetti as

             12   a way of making money?

             13       A.  In my lifetime, I never did this.

             14       Q.  Well, you did it here, correct?

             15       A.  I did it here because the interest rates at

             16   the bank were very low.  And I had some money and I

             17   asked Paul if he knew how I could make some money.

             18   And he told me.  Then I asked him, Would my money be

             19   safe.

             20               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, you don't have to

             21   talk about exactly what your attorney said.

             22       Q.  Yeah.  Mr. Pentoliros, I don't want to know

             23   what Attorney Magliocchetti told you.  That's

             24   privileged.  That's protected.  You don't have to




                                                               320

              1   tell me that.

              2               But my question to you is, this

              3   promissory note, which is a sizable loan with an

              4   interest rate of 12 percent, is this the type of

              5   transaction and loans secured by mortgages with an

              6   interest rate of this amount, 12 percent?  Is this

              7   the typical type of business transaction that you

              8   engaged in with the assistance of Attorney

              9   Magliocchetti as a way of generating income?

             10       A.  I remember that, yes, that I gave large

             11   amounts of money.  And Paul Magliocchetti knew these

             12   people.  And I asked him if my money was safe, and

             13   he told me it was 100 percent safe.

             14       Q.  Okay.

             15       A.  I didn't have to worry about it.  And I felt

             16   good about it.

             17       Q.  So on a loan like this, you had the money

             18   available to loan and then you charged an interest

             19   rate of at least 12 percent and then you made money

             20   off of this loan, correct?

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  And that's good business, correct?

             23       A.  Yes.

             24       Q.  As long as you got paid back?




                                                               321

              1       A.  Yes.

              2       Q.  All right.  And this promissory note's

              3   dated May of 2013?

              4       A.  Um.

              5       Q.  So as early as May of 2013, you were

              6   working with Attorney Magliocchetti with these types

              7   of business loans, correct?

              8       A.  To be honest with you, I know my -- I don't

              9   know when my mother died or my father died at the

             10   time.  But we had a lot of stress with the diner.

             11   We have Christianson, a lawyer in Swampscott was

             12   down with this and that.  And he had my brother and

             13   me out in left field.

             14               And like I said, I can't remember in '13.

             15   Like I said, I've been through a lot since then.

             16   I don't feel good every day.  I get up one day at a

             17   time.  I don't go nowhere.  I just live my life

             18   until I'm going to die.  That's it.  That's the way

             19   I live it.  I haven't made any investments,

             20   nothing --

             21       Q.  So --

             22       A.  You know, now.

             23       Q.  -- as of May 15, 2013, which is the date of

             24   this promissory note, you would agree with me that




                                                               322

              1   as of this date, you were working with Attorney

              2   Magliocchetti with these types of loans, correct?

              3       A.  Yes, I was.

              4       Q.  Do you know if you had worked with Attorney

              5   Magliocchetti on a similar type of loan prior to

              6   May of 2013?

              7       A.  I don't remember, no.  I don't even

              8   remember --

              9               MR. TRETTER:  You answered the question,

             10   Perry.

             11       A.  What's the question again?

             12       Q.  Let me ask you a new one.  Any subsequent

             13   loan that you made after you started -- after you

             14   first started working with Attorney Magliocchetti,

             15   would it have been your practice to obtain the legal

             16   assistance and guidance of Attorney Magliocchetti

             17   moving forward?

             18       A.  Yes.

             19       Q.  Why is that?

             20       A.  I trusted him.  I had some money.  The

             21   banks were paying no interest.  And I asked him if

             22   he had any ideas the way -- you know, I invested in

             23   the stock market or whatever.  He was an attorney.

             24   I knew he was smart.




                                                               323

              1               And I asked him if there were any ways I

              2   could make any money legally.  And he told me -- he

              3   gave me -- he knew evidently these people, whoever.

              4   And they were good.  They'd pay and I wouldn't have

              5   to worry about nothing.  Or if they didn't pay, I

              6   had property that was worth money.  I didn't have to

              7   worry about nothing, he told me.  That's what

              8   happened.

              9       Q.  So you trusted Attorney Magliocchetti's --

             10       A.  I trusted him 100 percent, sir.

             11       Q.  And you felt comfortable going to Attorney

             12   Magliocchetti when it came to lending money, correct?

             13       A.  I felt completely comfortable, safe.

             14   I didn't feel nervous or nothing.  I felt completely

             15   safe.

             16       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, we're going to pivot

             17   here and turn our discussion back to Nick Kakouris,

             18   okay?

             19       A.  Um-hum.  Yes.

             20       Q.  I'm going to slide in front of you a

             21   document that we previously marked as Exhibit 4.

             22   And I'd ask that you take a look at this document,

             23   please.

             24       A.  I remember this, yes.  This is true.




                                                               324

              1       Q.  And this document, it's dated June 4 of

              2   2014, correct?

              3       A.  Yes.

              4       Q.  And --

              5       A.  I remember this one, yeah.

              6       Q.  And do you recognize the signatures on that

              7   page?

              8       A.  Yes.

              9       Q.  And whose signatures are they?

             10       A.  Nicholas Kakouris and my name.

             11       Q.  Is that your signature?

             12       A.  Yes.

             13       Q.  And what is this one-page document?  What

             14   is this?

             15       A.  This one that I got?

             16       Q.  Yes.

             17       A.  I helped Nick Kakouris.  I gave him some

             18   money to help him.

             19       Q.  And this document, does this represent a

             20   written confirmation or agreement between you and

             21   Mr. Kakouris that he owed you $150,000 after you had

             22   loaned him that money previously?

             23       A.  I had gone to Mark Boyce in Westgate branch

             24   in Haverhill.  And I had first -- first I had seen




                                                               325

              1   Paul Frank.  I had given him $25,000 at that time

              2   and I asked Paul Frank --

              3       Q.  You had given Mr. Kakouris $25,000?

              4       A.  I gave Mr. Kakouris -- I went to Paul Frank

              5   with Mr. Kakouris.

              6       Q.  Yes.

              7       A.  And I asked Paul Frank -- we were friends --

              8   I knew him for 100 years.  But that's all irrelevant.

              9   Meanwhile, I asked him if this was safe; would you

             10   do it?  And he said, Yes I would.  So I did.

             11       Q.  So you had previously loaned $25,000 to

             12   Mr. Kakouris?

             13       A.  Yes.

             14       Q.  And then you loaned him a second $25,000,

             15   to Mr. Kakouris?

             16       A.  Yes.

             17       Q.  And then in --

             18       A.  And I did that with Mark Boyce, I saw him.

             19               MR. TRETTER:  Wait for the question.

             20       Q.  And then in March of 2014, you had loaned

             21   Mr. Kakouris $100,000, correct?

             22       A.  Yes, sir.

             23       Q.  So this document which we've marked as

             24   Exhibit 4 -- and tell me if I'm correct -- but does




                                                               326

              1   this document reflect the agreement that

              2   Mr. Kakouris owed you $150,000 from those three

              3   prior loans which totaled $150,000?

              4       A.  Yes, sir.

              5       Q.  Who prepared this document?

              6       A.  I have no idea.  I don't know.

              7       Q.  Who came up with the terms contained in

              8   this document?

              9       A.  Who came up with the terms?

             10       Q.  Yeah.  So the terms here state that the

             11   loan is to be paid back weekly in the amount of

             12   $1,300 per week.  The length of the loan is 104

             13   weeks with an end balloon payment on June 4 of 2016.

             14       A.  I recall Mark Boyce at Westgate branch, sir.

             15       Q.  So are you saying that with certainty or

             16   are you guessing?

             17       A.  I'm not guessing.  It was certain --

             18   100 percent true.

             19       Q.  So it's your testimony that Mark Boyce came

             20   up with these terms?

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  Did he discuss these terms with you?

             23       A.  No.

             24       Q.  Did you --




                                                               327

              1       A.  I just -- I don't know how to say it.

              2   I can't tell you --

              3               MR. TRETTER:  You answered the question,

              4   Did he discuss terms with you.  You said no.  And

              5   Mr. Adams has another question, so let's let him ask

              6   the question.

              7       Q.  Where were you when you signed this

              8   document?

              9       A.  I was at the Westgate branch with Mark

             10   Boyce.

             11       Q.  Did you and Mr. Kakouris speak about him

             12   paying you back $1,300 per week?

             13       A.  I had got a call on the phone from Nick

             14   Kakouris asking me for another $100,000.  I told

             15   Nick Kakouris I did not have another $100,000 to

             16   loan him.  End of story.

             17               I got a call from Mark Boyce maybe a

             18   week later.  And Mark Boyce -- I was just asking

             19   him, do you have any investments I can make with

             20   stocks and so forth.  If you do, let me know.

             21               Meanwhile, when I walked into the bank,

             22   I saw Nick Kakouris sitting down with Mark Boyce.

             23   I walked in there.  I don't know why I was in there.

             24   I first said, I don't have the money.  I told Nick,




                                                               328

              1   I don't have any money.  I haven't got any more

              2   money to loan you.  I stayed in there.  He kept

              3   saying he needed a loan.

              4               Mark Royce was insisting, Perry, it's a

              5   very good deal.  You won't get hurt, and I would do

              6   the deal.  And I still didn't want to do the deal.

              7   But I was in there about an hour.

              8               And Nick had tears in his eyes.  Mark

              9   Boyce was there.  And I went along with it.  I

             10   really couldn't afford it at the time but I gave it

             11   to him.  I trusted him.  I trusted him for a large

             12   sum of money.  I was into the game.  I was in.

             13       Q.  You trusted Nick?

             14       A.  I trusted Mark Boyce with his knowledge of

             15   banking, he was steering me in the right direction.

             16   He liked me; I liked him.

             17       Q.  So did you and Nick talk about the $1,300

             18   per week payment that was included in this agreement?

             19       A.  At the time I think, sir, that Nick Kakouris

             20   was going up to the Santander Bank in Westgate and

             21   he was giving that money to the bank.  When he gave

             22   the money to the bank, the slips went in Mark

             23   Boyce's safe.  Every time he brought money up there,

             24   they put it in Mark's safe.




                                                               329

              1       Q.  But my question is, Mr. Pentoliros, what's

              2   been marked as Exhibit 4 includes a term which says

              3   that "This loan is to be paid back weekly in the

              4   amount of $1,300 per week."

              5               Before signing this agreement, did you

              6   and Mr. Kakouris discuss this term?

              7       A.  No.  I don't remember.  I can't remember

              8   that, sir.

              9       Q.  And before you signed this agreement, do

             10   you remember talking with Mr. Kakouris about the

             11   length of the loan, which is indicated here as

             12   104 weeks?

             13       A.  No, I don't remember that, sir.

             14       Q.  Did you read this before you signed it?

             15       A.  To be honest with you, no -- I don't

             16   remember.

             17       Q.  You don't remember?

             18       A.  No.

             19       Q.  Is this the type of document that you would

             20   have read before signing it?

             21       A.  What do you mean "before," sir?

             22       Q.  So is this the kind of agreement, what's

             23   been marked as Exhibit 4, the typical type of

             24   agreement that you would have read before signing it?




                                                               330

              1       A.  Oh, yeah.  It's the type of agreement I

              2   would have read.  Yes.

              3       Q.  So, again, this is dated June 4 of 2014.

              4       A.  Um.

              5       Q.  And this concerns a loan that you've made

              6   to Mr. Kakouris in the amount of $150,000, correct?

              7       A.  Yes, sir.

              8       Q.  Would you view a loan in the amount of

              9   $150,000 to be a substantial loan?

             10       A.  Yes, I do.  Very substantial, yes.

             11       Q.  Now, we've established that as of May 15 of

             12   2013, you had been working with Attorney

             13   Magliocchetti when it came to lending out

             14   substantial amounts of loans, correct?

             15       A.  This all started with my father and mother,

             16   the diner.  This all started with the diner.

             17       Q.  But my question though, sir, is in May of

             18   2013, we've already established you had been working

             19   with Attorney Magliocchetti when it came to making

             20   loans relative to substantial amounts of money,

             21   correct?

             22       A.  Yes.  That's when I got involved in big

             23   loans.

             24       Q.  Yeah.




                                                               331

              1       A.  Before that, none.

              2       Q.  So, again, that's May of 2013.  And it's at

              3   least the earliest day.  It could be earlier.  But

              4   we know, May of 2013, you were working with Attorney

              5   Magliocchetti?

              6       A.  Correct.

              7       Q.  On Exhibit 4 here, when dealing with a

              8   substantial loan in the amount of $150,000 to

              9   Mr. Kakouris, over a year after you had started

             10   working with Attorney Magliocchetti, why didn't you

             11   go to Attorney Magliocchetti to get help with a loan

             12   in the amount of $150,000 that you made to Nick

             13   Kakouris?

             14       A.  Why didn't I go to who?

             15       Q.  Attorney Magliocchetti.

             16       A.  When I wasn't getting paid, you mean?

             17       Q.  No.  My question is, on June 4, 2014, you

             18   signed this document.

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  And this concerns a loan in the amount of

             21   $150,000?

             22       A.  Yes.

             23       Q.  A substantial amount of money, correct?

             24       A.  Yes, yes.




                                                               332

              1       Q.  Why didn't you seek legal guidance from

              2   Attorney Magliocchetti with respect to this loan?

              3       A.  When I was at the bank, I told Paul -- Mark

              4   Boyce at the time, I want to get in touch with my

              5   attorney so my attorney can look at this before I do

              6   anything.

              7               And Mark Boyce told me I didn't need no

              8   attorney.  I was safe, 100 percent safe.  He was a

              9   banker for a long period of time.  And I had nothing

             10   to worry about.  So I believed Mark -- I went along

             11   with Mark Boyce.  I didn't have my lawyer, Paul

             12   Magliocchetti with me.

             13       Q.  At the time, what was Mark's working

             14   relationship with Nick Kakouris?

             15       A.  I don't know.  They were seeing each other.

             16   I had lent money -- I had borrowed -- Nick had

             17   borrowed money from me and I was with Mark Kakouris

             18   [sic].  That's how -- Mark Boyce got involved with

             19   Nick Kakouris.  Before that, Mark Boyce did not know

             20   Nick Kakouris before this all happened.

             21       Q.  This loan in the amount of $150,000 that

             22   you made to Nick Kakouris, were you protected at all

             23   through this loan, i.e., was there any sort of

             24   mortgage on any property?




                                                               333

              1       A.  No.  I had no -- I just -- I had his word,

              2   I trusted him.  I knew him.  I had the money.  And I

              3   didn't want to give -- I didn't want to give that

              4   last $100,000.  I didn't want to give it.  But Mark

              5   Boyce convinced me to do it: that my money was safe.

              6   It was better than me getting 2 percent in the bank

              7   or 1 percent in the bank.

              8               And I had the money.  I had the money in

              9   my checking account.  Then, like I say, I gave him

             10   $100,000.  I gave him $150,000 off of Mark Boyce,

             11   his recommendation to do it.

             12       Q.  Did you consult with Attorney Magliocchetti

             13   about this loan that you were making to Mr. Kakouris?

             14               MR. TRETTER:  This is a "yes" or "no"

             15   question.  You don't have to say any conversation.

             16   The question is, did you consult with Attorney

             17   Magliocchetti about a loan to Mr. Kakouris.

             18       A.  No.

             19       Q.  Why not?

             20       A.  I wanted to.  I was up at the bank.  And I

             21   told Mark Boyce to call up Paul Magliocchetti, see

             22   what he thought.  He told me I did not have to see --

             23   talk to Attorney Magliocchetti, that my money was

             24   completely safe.  And I trusted the bank.  I never




                                                               334

              1   had a problem with a banker in my life.  They always

              2   steered me right from a kid.  I always respected

              3   bankers, lawyers, and doctors, whatever.

              4       Q.  Did Mark Boyce or Nick Kakouris prevent you

              5   from leaving the office in order to go consult with

              6   Attorney Magliocchetti?

              7       A.  No.

              8       Q.  You were free to not sign this document and

              9   first consult with Attorney Magliocchetti first,

             10   right?

             11       A.  To be honest with you, I told you when I

             12   said I wanted to call Paul Magliocchetti, Mark Boyce

             13   told me I didn't have to and that I was all right, I

             14   was completely safe.  And he was a banker.  And I

             15   trusted him.  I used to see him all the time.  I'd

             16   go in the bank all the time and see him.  And we'd

             17   talk.

             18               And my brother invested a large sum of

             19   money with Mark Boyce with some brokerage company,

             20   three or four or $500,000.  Mark Boyce introduced my

             21   brother to this gentleman.  I don't know who he is.

             22   But my brother had a large investment because of

             23   Mark Boyce told him to do it.  And he did it.

             24       Q.  Do you remember what time of day it was on




                                                               335

              1   June 4, 2014 when you signed this document?  Was if

              2   in the morning?  In the afternoon?

              3       A.  I think it was late morning.  Late morning

              4   maybe.  It could have been 12:00 o'clock or

              5   11:00 o'clock.  I don't remember the time.  But I

              6   think it was early, I think.

              7       Q.  Were you forced to sign this document?

              8       A.  No.

              9       Q.  Were you pressured to sign this document?

             10       A.  No.

             11       Q.  Were you under duress when you signed this

             12   document?

             13       A.  What do you mean?

             14       Q.  Under duress.  Under pressure, under any

             15   outside forces to sign this document?

             16       A.  No.

             17       Q.  Were you under the influence of alcohol

             18   when you signed this document?

             19       A.  Yes.  I had alcohol in me, yes.

             20       Q.  And were you drunk at the time you signed

             21   this document?

             22       A.  I had drank all night.  In the morning I

             23   had -- I don't know -- about five or six vodkas

             24   before I went up there.  And I could hold my liquor




                                                               336

              1   and you wouldn't even know I was drinking.

              2               And I remember Nick Kakouris telling me

              3   for years I'm going to die if I keep drinking.  I

              4   didn't listen to him.  This was when we -- before I

              5   had given him any money.  He was my acquaintance; I

              6   knew him.

              7       Q.  And in signing this agreement with Nick

              8   Kakouris, did you expect Mr. Kakouris to pay you

              9   back?

             10       A.  Yes, I did.

             11       Q.  At any point, did you approach Nick

             12   Kakouris or anybody for that matter, to discuss

             13   undoing or somehow cancelling this agreement that

             14   you signed?

             15       A.  No.

             16       Q.  Did you ever ask Nick Kakouris, Hey, you

             17   know, I want my $150,000 back?

             18       A.  No.  I never begged him for my money back.

             19   Like I said, the gentleman was going to the bank and

             20   paying.  I had nothing to worry about.  I thought I

             21   was 150 percent safe.  The man was a hard worker,

             22   good family.  I just felt completely safe with him.

             23   And that's why I did it.  Or I wouldn't have done it.

             24       Q.  Did you ever consider asking Mr. Kakouris




                                                               337

              1   to grant a mortgage on his home in Atkinson in your

              2   name to protect you with respect to this loan?

              3       A.  No.

              4       Q.  Or any loan that you ever made him?

              5       A.  No.  In fact, can I say something?

              6       Q.  Sure.

              7       A.  (To Mr. Tretter:)  You don't want me to say

              8   anything?

              9               MR. TRETTER:  You answered the question.

             10   If it helps -- if it answers the question, answer

             11   the question.  If it's something different than the

             12   answer, then no, you don't have to answer.

             13       Q.  It's up to you.  You can add more if you'd

             14   like.

             15       A.  No, I don't want to say anything.  Because

             16   it's not going to really help me out.

             17               MR. ADAMS:  So we're going to mark this

             18   15, please.

             19                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 15 was marked

             20                     for identification.)

             21       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, what's been marked as

             22   Exhibit 15 -- and it's a document right in front of

             23   you, if you can take a look at this, please.

             24       A.  Yes, sir, I'm looking at it.




                                                               338

              1       Q.  So through this document, you'll see

              2   there's the date on it of October 10, 2014?

              3       A.  I see up here 10/10/2014.

              4       Q.  And do you see that it looks like there's a

              5   check or money order paid in Nick Kakouris's name

              6   for the amount of $100,000?

              7       A.  Yes, sir, I see it.

              8       Q.  And you see at the top of the page, it looks

              9   like the money came from your account as the account

             10   holder.

             11               Do you see that, sir?

             12       A.  Yes, sir.

             13       Q.  Do you remember on October 10 of 2014

             14   making an additional loan to Mr. Kakouris?

             15       A.  I remember I gave him $100,000 at Sovereign

             16   Bank at Westgate.  I remember that.

             17       Q.  Do you have a specific memory of making

             18   that loan for $100,000?

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  And this is in 2014?

             21       A.  I remember this, yes.

             22       Q.  Okay.

             23       A.  I don't know the year, but I remember

             24   giving him the money.  But I don't remember the




                                                               339

              1   year, no.

              2       Q.  But you remember the specific amount?

              3       A.  I remember the amount, yes, sir.

              4       Q.  And do you have that memory separate from

              5   having just reviewed this document?

              6       A.  No.  I have -- Nick Kakouris and I were

              7   friends for a long time.  And whatever happened to

              8   me with the shock treatment or whatever, I knew Nick

              9   way back.  And I remembered Nick.  Like I said, he

             10   was my friend.  He came and seen me in the hospital.

             11   And we were friends.  And like I said, I had no

             12   problems.  The man ran into problems, all kinds of

             13   problems.  I don't want to get into his story.

             14       Q.  I understand.  So do you remember in

             15   October of 2014 being approached to make this loan

             16   of $100,000 to Nick Kakouris?

             17       A.  I remember Nick Kakouris called me up on

             18   the telephone and he asked me for $100,000 three or

             19   four times.  I says, Nick, I don't have $100,000.

             20   I don't have the money.  I just don't have it.

             21       Q.  So --

             22       A.  Meanwhile, I get a call a week or two later,

             23   I think.  I went up -- Mark Boyce called me up on

             24   the phone and he told me he had a terrific investment




                                                               340

              1   for me.  He had a great investment for me.  So I

              2   figured the banker was going to give me a good deal,

              3   whatever I was going to get -- I don't know --

              4   whether with a broker, like my brother.  I have no

              5   idea.

              6               But when I saw Nick Kakouris sitting in

              7   the chair, I knew why I was there.  He must have

              8   called Mark Boyce and they were both sitting there.

              9   Mark kept influencing me to give Nick $100,000.

             10   He said it a hundred times.  And I gave him the

             11   $100,000.  After an hour, I gave him the $100,000.

             12       Q.  So we know that in March of 2014, you made

             13   your first $100,000 loan to Mr. Kakouris, correct?

             14       A.  Yes.

             15       Q.  Then it looks like in October of 2014, you

             16   made a second loan in the amount of $100,000 to

             17   Mr. Kakouris, correct?

             18       A.  Yes.  Meanwhile, do you have the other two

             19   things on the first 225 and the -- with, you know,

             20   borrowed --

             21       Q.  Yeah.

             22       A.  Now you know.

             23       Q.  So we have the first loan of $25,000, second

             24   loan of $25,000, third loan in March of 2014 in the




                                                               341

              1   amount of $100.000 --

              2       A.  So you have all that already.

              3               MR. TRETTER:  Let him finish.

              4       Q.  -- a third loan in the amount of $100,000

              5   to Mr. Kakouris, and now in October of 2014, it

              6   looks like there was a fourth loan which was in the

              7   amount of $100,000 to Mr. Kakouris?

              8       A.  Yes, sir.

              9       Q.  And do you remember that, sir?

             10       A.  Yes, sir.

             11       Q.  And with respect to the second loan for

             12   $100,000, is it your memory that Mr. Kakouris called

             13   you on the phone first to ask for this loan for

             14   $100,000?

             15       A.  I remember he called me on the phone and I

             16   told him that I didn't have any more money.  I have

             17   no more money.  And then I got a call, I couldn't

             18   believe, Mark Boyce called me up on the phone and

             19   said he had a terrific investment for me.

             20       Q.  And that's when you went down to the branch?

             21       A.  Yeah.  I went right down to the bank.

             22   Put my clothes on, went down to the bank.  And as I

             23   walked in, I couldn't believe I saw Nick Kakouris

             24   sitting down with Mark Boyce.




                                                               342

              1               And when I sat down with them, Nick

              2   Kakouris said he needed -- I says, Nick, I don't

              3   have $100,000 to give you.  And Mark Boyce kept

              4   edging me, Give him the $100,000.  Give him the

              5   $100,000.  Give him the $100,000.  I was there for

              6   one hour.  I did not want to give him $100,000.

              7   I was very leery.  And Mark Boyce told me my money

              8   was safe.  I believed him.  I did it, end of story.

              9       Q.  So with respect to this loan from October

             10   of 2014, did you consult with Attorney Magliocchetti

             11   before making this loan?

             12       A.  No.  But Mark Boyce told me I didn't have

             13   to call anybody, I was safe.  And I trusted him.

             14       Q.  Now, prior to that date, you had worked

             15   with Attorney Magliocchetti on similar large amounts

             16   of monies that you loaned?

             17       A.  I think when I first got involved with Nick

             18   Kakouris, I didn't do any business with -- I don't

             19   think I did any business with Paul at the time.

             20   I think when I first got involved with him, I don't

             21   think I was -- I needed a lawyer for my mother and

             22   father's estate with the state.

             23               I don't think I had anything to do with

             24   Paul Frank at that time -- I mean, with Paul




                                                               343

              1   Magliocchetti when I first gave Nick money.  I don't

              2   think I had anything to do with Paul.  I think.  I

              3   can't remember.  But I think I didn't have anything

              4   to do with Paul at the time.

              5       Q.  Can I see the documents you have in front

              6   of you?  Ah.  There it is.

              7               Well, again, Mr. Pentoliros, this

              8   promissory note is dated May 15 of 2013.  It's in

              9   the amount -- it's a loan that you made for $340,000

             10   to DeLuca, Mr. DeLuca.  And this document right here

             11   was witnessed by Paul Magliocchetti.

             12       A.  Hmm.

             13       Q.  This has a date of May 15 of 2013.  And you

             14   agree that that's before you made your loans to

             15   Mr. Kakouris, right?

             16       A.  I think that was -- I think that was after,

             17   not before.  I think -- I gave Nick Kakouris -- I

             18   think I gave him money before this.  I think I gave

             19   him money before this.  I think.

             20       Q.  Well, the documents are showing that that's

             21   not correct.  So --

             22       A.  So when I gave him the first $25,000, what

             23   was the date on that?

             24       Q.  Well, according to your complaint, it's in




                                                               344

              1   2013.

              2       A.  Hmm.

              3       Q.  But, Mr. Pentoliros, if we look right here

              4   at this document, again, it's dated October 10 of

              5   2014 for $100,000, and that's after the May 15, 2013

              6   date which involved the loan that Attorney

              7   Magliocchetti was involved in?

              8       A.  Where's the $25,000, first $25,000?

              9   Where's that?

             10       Q.  Well, let me ask you about this document.

             11       A.  I'm asking you a question.  Where's the

             12   first one for 25?  I told you, I don't remember.

             13   I think I gave Nick Kakouris -- I think -- I can't

             14   remember -- I think I gave him $25,000 before I knew

             15   Paul Magliocchetti.  I think.  I don't know.  I

             16   really don't know, sir.

             17       Q.  But, Mr. Pentoliros, you would agree with

             18   me that at the time that you made the second loan of

             19   $100,000 to Mr. Kakouris, which is October 10 of

             20   2014, you would agree with me that based on this

             21   document right here, the date May 15, 2013, the

             22   promissory note, which is Exhibit 5, that you had --

             23   you in fact had a relationship with Attorney

             24   Magliocchetti prior to the time you made this loan




                                                               345

              1   of $100,000 to Mr. Kakouris?

              2       A.  But I don't think I told Paul anything

              3   about Nick Kakouris, nothing to Paul until when I

              4   gave him -- I gave him the $100,000, I was in the

              5   hospital.  I was in McLean's Hospital.  And when I

              6   got out, he wasn't making -- he couldn't make any

              7   more payments, he told me.  A man had done a number

              8   on him.  That he was going -- I gave him the money

              9   supposedly for business.  And I knew the guy was a

             10   good businessman.

             11               And Nick Kakouris -- and Nick Kakouris

             12   did business with this gentleman, and he gave this

             13   money to this gentleman.  And this gentleman was

             14   shooting heroin up his arm.  That's what happened.

             15   My money went right up this guy's arm.  And a lot of

             16   other people's money went up this guy's arm.

             17               MR. TRETTER:  Mr. Pentoliros, answer the

             18   question now.

             19       A.  What's the question?

             20       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, again, we have Exhibit 15

             21   in front of you, which has a date of October 10 of

             22   2014.  And this evidences the loan of $100,000 that

             23   you made to Mr. Kakouris.  Again, that date is

             24   October 10, 2014.




                                                               346

              1               Then as Exhibit 4 demonstrates, on

              2   June 4 of 2014, you entered into a binding agreement

              3   evidencing a loan of $150,000 that you made to

              4   Mr. Kakouris.

              5               Both of these documents are dated after

              6   Document No. 5, Exhibit 5, which is a promissory

              7   note from May 15 of 2013, which evidences a loan you

              8   made for $340,000, which was witnessed and aided by

              9   your legal counsel, Attorney Magliocchetti.

             10               So my question is this.  If you were

             11   working with Attorney Magliocchetti before you made

             12   these two loans to Mr. Kakouris, why didn't you

             13   consult with Attorney Magliocchetti before making

             14   these loans?

             15       A.  I should have but I didn't.  I trusted Nick

             16   Kakouris that much.  I should have but I didn't.  I

             17   trusted him.  I knew him for a long time.  And I

             18   trusted him.  He's a very good businessman.

             19       Q.  You trusted him.  He was your friend; you

             20   knew him for 20 years, correct?

             21       A.  And the man had beautiful kids, a beautiful

             22   home, beautiful business.  He had everything.  And I

             23   trusted him.  What can I tell you?  I trusted him.

             24   And I had the money.




                                                               347

              1       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, when you loaned that second

              2   $100,000 to Mr. Kakouris on October 10 of 2014, were

              3   you forced to make that loan?

              4       A.  No.

              5       Q.  Could you have said, No, I'm not going to

              6   make the loan?

              7       A.  Yes, I could have said no.

              8       Q.  Could you have stood up and walked out of

              9   that branch, the Santander branch, and made the

             10   ultimate decision that you didn't want to loan any

             11   more money to Mr. Kakouris?

             12       A.  Yes, I could have.

             13       Q.  At that time, was Mr. Kakouris timely

             14   making his loan repayments to you?

             15       A.  Pardon me?

             16       Q.  At that time in October of 2014, had

             17   Mr. Kakouris been making his weekly payments to you

             18   in the amount of $1,300?

             19       A.  Yes.  He was going up to the Santander

             20   Bank, putting the money -- giving it to the girl,

             21   getting a slip like this.  Mark would take it and

             22   put it in the safe.  That's it.

             23       Q.  So as of October 2014, as you sit here, you

             24   think Mr. Kakouris was making good on his promise to




                                                               348

              1   pay you back?

              2       A.  Yes.  But I couldn't believe -- he was

              3   making very good, paying me, I had nothing to worry

              4   about, felt safe.  And I was a happy man.

              5       Q.  Were you pressured to make this loan, the

              6   second $100,000 loan to Mr. Kakouris?

              7       A.  When I had gone to Mark Boyce, I trusted

              8   him 100 percent.  If I didn't trust him, I would not

              9   have given Nick the money.  He told me I was secure

             10   and safe and to do it.  And I did it.

             11       Q.  So --

             12       A.  And I didn't want to do it but I did it.

             13       Q.  Who did you have greater trust in?  A bank

             14   broker or a bank manager or your legal counsel who

             15   had already assisted you with making these types of

             16   transactions?

             17       A.  I think I -- when I -- when I gave the

             18   transaction to -- when I gave the last $100,000 to

             19   Nick Kakouris, I don't even know -- I don't think in

             20   my mind that I ever -- I don't think in my mind that

             21   I ever mentioned to Paul Magliocchetti about Nick

             22   Kakouris.

             23               I think I mentioned -- I mentioned Nick

             24   Kakouris when he couldn't pay me.  And that's when I




                                                               349

              1   think I mentioned to Paul Magliocchetti that he

              2   wasn't paying me anymore.

              3               MR. TRETTER:  I think --

              4       Q.  So my question is this.

              5               MR. TRETTER:  Listen to the question.

              6       Q.  My question is this, Mr. Pentoliros.  Who

              7   did you have more trust in: Mark Boyce, who was a

              8   branch manager at Santander, or Paul Magliocchetti,

              9   who at that time had already assisted you in making

             10   large loans and protecting your interests while

             11   making those large loans?

             12       A.  Paul Magliocchetti never forced me into a

             13   thing.  Nothing.  He never forced me into a thing.

             14       Q.  That's not my question.

             15       A.  What was the question?

             16       Q.  Who did you trust more?

             17       A.  I trusted them both.  I've trusted bankers

             18   my whole life.  I never had a banker ever hurt me.

             19   Paul Frank, I did business with him for 25 years.

             20   Any banker I did business with I trusted all my life

             21   from a young man.  I always trust bankers, lawyers,

             22   or whatever.  I always trusted them.  Bankers know

             23   all about investment.

             24               MR. TRETTER:  Okay.  You answered the




                                                               350

              1   question, Perry.

              2       Q.  With respect to the second loan for

              3   $100,000, did you expect to be paid back by

              4   Mr. Kakouris?

              5       A.  Yes.

              6       Q.  Did anybody else besides Mr. Kakouris owe

              7   you any money with respect to this second loan of

              8   $100,000?

              9       A.  I don't know if those other two, when I got

             10   involved with -- Paul told me about investing --

             11   I don't remember, sir, any -- I don't remember.

             12   I can't remember.

             13       Q.  So I think I asked you a bad question.

             14   With respect to this second loan of $100,000 that

             15   you made to Mr. Kakouris, did you expect anybody

             16   else other than Mr. Kakouris to pay you back that

             17   money?

             18       A.  No.  I expected my guy, Nick Kakouris, to

             19   pay me back the money.  That's what I expected, yes.

             20                     (Recess at 11:00 a.m.,

             21                     resumed at 11:26 a.m.)

             22                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 16 was marked

             23                     for identification.)

             24       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, we're back on the




                                                               351

              1   record.  What we've marked as Exhibit 16 is now in

              2   front of you.  I'd like you to read that, please.

              3   To yourself.

              4       A.  Yes, sir.  What do you want me to say to

              5   answer this one?

              6       Q.  Do you recognize the signatures on this

              7   document?

              8       A.  Yes, I do.

              9       Q.  Whose signatures do you see?

             10       A.  Nick Kakouris' and mine.

             11       Q.  And this document indicates that on

             12   October 10 of 2014, that you lent Mr. Kakouris an

             13   additional $150,000; do you see that, sir?

             14       A.  Oh, I see that up there.  "In addition

             15   received $150,000."

             16       Q.  So I'd like to show you the document we

             17   were looking at just before we went on the break.

             18   Do you remember this document right here, which is

             19   Exhibit 15?  And, again, we're dealing with

             20   October 10 of 2014.

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  These look like they're the bank records

             23   showing that $100,000 was transferred from your

             24   account and then sent to Nick Kakouris.




                                                               352

              1               Do you see that?

              2       A.  Yes.

              3                     (Discussion off the record.)

              4       Q.  So, again, looking at Exhibit 16 and

              5   comparing it to Exhibit 15, so Exhibit 16 indicates

              6   that on that same day, October 10, 2014, that you

              7   had loaned Mr. Kakouris $150,000, yet the bank

              8   records show that you had loaned $100,000 on

              9   October 10, 2014.

             10       A.  Um.

             11       Q.  What is your memory of the amount of money

             12   that was loaned to Mr. Kakouris on October 10, 2014?

             13       A.  I know this, as I can remember, that Paul

             14   Magliocchetti, before I got involved with -- I was

             15   involved -- I think I was involved with Nick

             16   Kakouris before I got involved with Paul.  I don't

             17   think Paul knew anything about it.  But I had told

             18   Paul --

             19               MR. TRETTER:  Wait a second, Perry.

             20   You're getting into attorney-client conversations.

             21   I believe the question, if we could have it back --

             22   do you mind.

             23               MR. ADAMS:  No.  I'll reask it.

             24               MR. TRETTER:  Okay.




                                                               353

              1               MR. ADAMS:  I'll reask it.

              2       Q.  So the question is, Mr. Pentoliros, on

              3   October 10 of 2014, do you know what amount you

              4   loaned to Mr. Kakouris?  Was it $100,000 as the bank

              5   records in Exhibit 15 suggest, or do you know if it

              6   was $150,000 as this agreement, which has been

              7   marked as Exhibit 16, indicates?

              8               Do you know?

              9       A.  Sir, you have the checks.  I've had a lot

             10   on my mind.  The only way I can answer, I don't know.

             11       Q.  Okay.

             12       A.  I really from the bottom of my heart,

             13   I don't know.

             14       Q.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Do you remember

             15   signing this document which has been marked as

             16   Exhibit 16?

             17       A.  I don't remember signing -- I don't

             18   remember even signing that, reading that.  I don't

             19   remember, sir.

             20       Q.  So do you have a memory of ever seeing this

             21   document before?

             22       A.  I don't have any memory of it, no.

             23       Q.  And Exhibit 16, this "binding agreement"

             24   between you and Mr. Kakouris indicates that he's




                                                               354

              1   required to pay you $1,300 per week?

              2       A.  Yes.

              3       Q.  Did you discuss that term with Mr. Kakouris

              4   prior to signing this agreement?

              5       A.  Yes.  I discussed it with him, yes.  And

              6   the gentleman was putting $1,300 in the Santander

              7   Bank every week like clockwork, and I had nothing to

              8   worry about.

              9       Q.  Okay.

             10       A.  I felt very comfortable.

             11       Q.  You felt very comfortable with Mr. Kakouris?

             12       A.  I felt very comfortable with the first loan.

             13   I didn't feel comfortable with that last $100,000

             14   that Mark Boyce was saying, You've got a good

             15   investment.  Don't worry about it.  That one I felt

             16   very nervous about.  But I knew I had been in for

             17   quite a bit of money.  I went up to his place in

             18   Littlefield [sic], New Hampshire, or whatever.

             19   I saw the place.

             20               It looked like a terrific business.

             21   Nick wasn't going to just take his money and throw

             22   it away.  He said he had a gentleman that knew the

             23   restaurant business very well.  And then when Nick

             24   wasn't paying me at the time -- because I gave




                                                               355

              1   him -- before I had gone to the hospital because I

              2   wasn't feeling well, they told me to get my account

              3   out of the Santander Bank.

              4               There was a man that was the manager six

              5   months in North Andover -- I don't know what his

              6   name is or whatever -- but the man in North Andover,

              7   I talked to him on the phone.  I don't know what it

              8   was about.  But meanwhile, after I talked to him on

              9   the phone, he told me he wanted me to get all my

             10   money out of the Santander Bank.

             11               I was happy with the Santander Bank.

             12   I had been there for years.  Out of the blue sky,

             13   the gentleman told me, Get every penny out of here

             14   in three days or five days or whatever.

             15               So then I went to Bank of America, which

             16   I had done business with many years ago.  But I was

             17   very happy with Santander Bank.  I had no intentions

             18   of leaving there, nothing.  Even with Kakouris at

             19   the time.  Paul knew nothing about it.

             20               And Mark and I were pretty -- we got

             21   friendly.  I'd see Mark every day.  I'd go up and

             22   say, Hi, Mark.  How are you.  Have a cup of coffee.

             23   And I used to tell him to look at my account.  Am I

             24   all right, this and that and everything.  And he'd




                                                               356

              1   say, You're all right there, you're fine.  I was

              2   always worried about going broke because I had

              3   nothing when I started.

              4               So even to this day, I still think about

              5   going broke.  It scares the hell out of me.  I'm

              6   73 years old.  I'm not a young man.  What am I going

              7   to do now at 73 years old?  So it just -- I started

              8   with nothing, I had nothing.  When I started saving

              9   my money, I never took no trips, never did nothing.

             10   I just saved my money.  I didn't want to be broke in

             11   life.  I don't know how to explain it to you.

             12       Q.  How much money do you have in your bank

             13   accounts now?

             14       A.  Huh?

             15       Q.  How much money do you have in your bank

             16   accounts now?

             17       A.  Pardon me, I'd rather really not get into

             18   that, sir.

             19       Q.  How about a ballpark?

             20       A.  I'd rather really not get into that.

             21       Q.  Well, it's a question.

             22               MR. TRETTER:  It's a legitimate question.

             23       A.  How much money do I have in the bank?

             24       Q.  How much money do you have in your banks




                                                               357

              1   right now, total?

              2       A.  Huh?

              3       Q.  How much money do you have in the banks

              4   total right now, ballpark?

              5       A.  What?  In the banks right now?  How much do

              6   I have total in the banks right now?

              7       Q.  Yeah.

              8               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, it doesn't mean at

              9   trial a jury's going to hear how much money you have

             10   in the bank.  But, you know, this is discovery so --

             11   and it's not a privileged question.  You can answer

             12   the question.  And we've already given your Bank of

             13   America records, so you can answer the question.

             14       A.  Yeah, I can tell you what I'm worth right

             15   now, sir?

             16       Q.  Yeah.

             17               MR. TRETTER:  Not what you're worth.

             18   What's in -- I don't want to --

             19               MR. ADAMS:  That's going to be my --

             20       A.  I don't know how -- I don't know how to

             21   answer this question.  I have property -- I have

             22   property.  People owe me a lot of money.  They

             23   haven't paid me the rents, whatever.  Like I say,

             24   but I've got money in the bank but I've been getting




                                                               358

              1   very -- I've been getting hurt now.  I have tenants

              2   not paying me.

              3               I've got to go to court tomorrow.  This

              4   lady won't leave.  I don't want to get into that.

              5   It's a very stressful business when you buy property

              6   and collect rents.  The worst business in the world

              7   I ever did.  But that's what I did before I start --

              8   before I got involved with Nick Kakouris, Paul, I

              9   had property.  And every -- I've had property for

             10   years.  I had problems -- always had problems.

             11       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, how much money do you

             12   have in your bank accounts now?  How much money do

             13   you have put away in your bank right now?

             14       A.  Am I supposed to tell him?

             15       Q.  Yes.

             16               MR. TRETTER:  It's a legitimate question

             17   that you should answer.

             18       A.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Do you follow

             19   what I'm trying to say?  I have no reason to lie to

             20   you.

             21       Q.  And, Mr. Pentoliros, I have no desire to go

             22   share this information with anybody.

             23       A.  That's what I'm just going to say.  I've

             24   got over $3 million in the bank and I've got




                                                               359

              1   property or whatever.  I'm probably worth over

              2   $4 million now, sir.

              3       Q.  Do you remember speaking with Mr. Kakouris

              4   about the term that the loan would be paid back over

              5   156 weeks to be paid in full on October 10, 2017?

              6       A.  What do you mean, did I talk to Nick about

              7   that?

              8       Q.  Yeah.  Do you remember talking to Nick about

              9   that?

             10       A.  When I did the thing, Nick was paying

             11   steadily.  I had nothing to worry about.  But when I

             12   got out of McLean's Hospital --

             13       Q.  Hold on one second, Mr. Pentoliros.  I'm

             14   sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Pentoliros.  I'm just

             15   trying to keep us focused here --

             16       A.  Well, I --

             17       Q.  -- so you can get out of here.

             18       A.  I don't want to say anything wrong here.

             19       Q.  No, no, I get it.  I'm just trying to keep

             20   you focused here so we all can leave sooner.

             21   My question was specific.  Prior to signing this

             22   document, do you remember talking to Nick about the

             23   length of the loan being 156 weeks to be paid in

             24   full on October 10, 2017?




                                                               360

              1       A.  I never discussed that, no.

              2       Q.  So you don't have a memory of talking to

              3   him?

              4       A.  But I was going to tell you something else.

              5               MR. TRETTER:  Just answer the question,

              6   Perry.

              7       A.  I can't answer --

              8       Q.  I have more questions for you.  I think

              9   you'll have a chance to tell me what you probably

             10   are about to tell me.

             11               Did you consult with Attorney

             12   Magliocchetti before signing this document?

             13       A.  No.

             14       Q.  So we've detailed four different loans that

             15   you made to Mr. Kakouris.  As you sit here right

             16   now, what is your belief as to the total amount of

             17   money that you loaned Nick Kakouris?

             18       A.  To be honest with you, I don't know.  It's

             19   a complete blank.  In fact, when I mentioned this to

             20   Paul at the time -- because I never -- I don't think

             21   when I gave Nick Kakouris, I don't think I ever told

             22   Paul anything about Nick Kakouris.

             23               But when I wasn't getting paid from Nick

             24   Kakouris, I had given -- when I got my money out of




                                                               361

              1   the Santander Bank, when they told me to get it out

              2   of there, I gave it to Bank of America, every penny.

              3               Meanwhile, he was paying Santander Bank

              4   at the time, he was giving them money every week.

              5   And I wasn't feeling -- I was not feeling too well

              6   at the time.  And I gave Nick Kakouris my checking

              7   account number and I told him, go to Bank of America

              8   every week, the way you went to Santander Bank every

              9   week, and put the money in Santander Bank.

             10               Meanwhile, I used to call Santander Bank

             11   up, ask if Nick put the money in there and they'd

             12   tell me he did.  When I gave him my checking account

             13   number, I was having awful anxieties.  I wasn't

             14   feeling well.  And meanwhile, I think he made --

             15   I think I had gone to the hospital or something,

             16   I think he had made five payments at the Bank of

             17   America.  I think he made five payments there.

             18               So then I confronted him, I called him

             19   and said, Nick, you haven't been paying me.  What's

             20   going on?  You know, put the money in the bank like

             21   you're supposed to.  And he told me how he ran into

             22   a lot of trouble, owed money, couldn't pay me.

             23   I didn't force it.  I told you, I liked the guy,

             24   this and that.  We were friends.  He told me he was




                                                               362

              1   in a lot of trouble.

              2               Meanwhile I didn't know -- I thought,

              3   when I gave him the money, I was the only one that

              4   gave him money.  I never thought anybody else ever

              5   gave him any money.  That's why I gave him the

              6   money.  I could afford to give it to him.  He was a

              7   nice guy, but I never knew that he had a lot of

              8   money borrowed everywhere.

              9               And all the money supposedly, he told

             10   me -- I believe him -- that this guy that was going

             11   to run the place up there for him, which I put all

             12   the money in, was a dope addict, he was shooting

             13   heroin in his arm, cocaine, everything.  He went to

             14   his family, went to them for his money.  Nobody

             15   helped him, nobody gave him back.  And the man, like

             16   I said, he's broke, he doesn't have any money.  He

             17   doesn't have a dime.

             18       Q.  So how many loans did you make to Nick

             19   Kakouris in total?  How many loans?

             20       A.  I think it was maybe three or four.

             21       Q.  So we know there was a loan for $25,000,

             22   correct?

             23       A.  Um.

             24       Q.  The first one?




                                                               363

              1       A.  Um.

              2       Q.  The second one for $25,000, correct?

              3       A.  Um, yeah.

              4       Q.  Then there was a third loan for $100,000,

              5   correct?

              6       A.  Yes.

              7       Q.  And then there was a fourth loan for

              8   $100,000, correct?

              9       A.  Yes.

             10       Q.  Do you have any memory of making any other

             11   loans --

             12       A.  No.

             13       Q.  -- to Mr. Kakouris?

             14       A.  Not at all.  The only other loans I made I

             15   did with Paul other than Nick Kakouris.  I never

             16   made any loans with other people.

             17       Q.  But you don't recall making any other loans

             18   specifically to Nick Kakouris other than those four?

             19       A.  No.  I don't remember, sir.  I really don't

             20   remember, no.

             21       Q.  So at some point, I think you've been

             22   starting to tell me about you approached Attorney

             23   Magliocchetti to talk --

             24       A.  Yeah.




                                                               364

              1       Q.  -- to talk about these loans that you made

              2   to Nick Kakouris --

              3       A.  Yes, sir.

              4       Q.  -- right?

              5       A.  Yes, sir.

              6       Q.  And why did you approach Attorney

              7   Magliocchetti?

              8       A.  Because Nick wasn't paying, and I asked

              9   Nick, what could I -- I asked Paul, what could I do.

             10   And Paul told me that Mark Boyce should not have

             11   told me these things, they should have never --

             12               MR. TRETTER:  Hold on a second, Perry.

             13   You're talking about stuff that Paul told you.

             14               THE WITNESS:  Huh?

             15               MR. TRETTER:  First of all, you're not

             16   responding to the question.  Second of all, you're

             17   disclosing attorney-client conversations.  You have

             18   a privilege --

             19       A.  I'm trying to tell him the truth.

             20               MR. TRETTER:  Can I get the question

             21   again.

             22       A.  What was the question?

             23               MR. ADAMS:  I'll reask it.

             24       A.  What was that question again, sir?




                                                               365

              1               MR. ADAMS:  It was a long question.

              2   Let me ask you this.

              3               Why don't we mark this as the next

              4   exhibit, please.

              5                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 17 was marked

              6                     for identification.)

              7       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, so what's been marked as

              8   Exhibit 17 --

              9       A.  This one here, sir?

             10       Q.  Yes.  It has the sticker that says

             11   Exhibit 17.  Do you see that, sir?

             12       A.  Let me take a look, sir.

             13       Q.  Yes.

             14       A.  Exhibit 17, yes, sir.

             15       Q.  Do you see the title of the document,

             16   "Confirmatory promissory note"?

             17       A.  Yes, sir.

             18       Q.  Do you see that's dated December 21, 2015?

             19       A.  Yes, sir.

             20       Q.  And do you see that the amount of the

             21   confirmatory promissory note is $250,000?

             22       A.  I see that, sir.

             23       Q.  If you could, Mr. Pentoliros, if you could

             24   just flip through this document --




                                                               366

              1       A.  What page, sir?

              2       Q.  The first page and then I'll have you look

              3   at the last page.

              4       A.  Read the first page?

              5       Q.  Yeah.  Just look at the first couple

              6   paragraphs on the first page and then flip to the

              7   last page, please.

              8               MR. TRETTER:  Actually, I want to move

              9   to strike any references to conversations with

             10   Attorney Magliocchetti that are in response to the

             11   last question or even any other question today.

             12       A.  I'm going to tell you the truth, sir, now.

             13               MR. TRETTER:  There's no question

             14   pending.

             15       A.  It doesn't matter.  He's going to ask me

             16   the question again.

             17       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, can you turn to the

             18   last page, please.  Do you recognize the signatures

             19   at the bottom of this page?

             20       A.  I see "Nick Kakouris" here --

             21       Q.  Yes.

             22       A.  -- on the right.  And I think that's "Paul

             23   Magliocchetti" on the left.  Is that true or . . .

             24       Q.  It looks like it to me.




                                                               367

              1       A.  Huh?

              2       Q.  Yeah, it looks like Paul Magliocchetti's

              3   signature there.

              4       A.  I can't really visualize it that good.  Can

              5   you?

              6       Q.  I think it does say that.

              7       A.  Huh?

              8       Q.  Yes, I think it says that.

              9       A.  That's what I think it says here.

             10       Q.  So you see that's dated December 21, 2015,

             11   correct?

             12       A.  Um.

             13       Q.  What is this document, Mr. Pentoliros?

             14       A.  Which one?

             15       Q.  The one that you have in front of you in

             16   your hands.

             17       A.  To be honest with you, I don't know --

             18   I can't -- I don't know, sir.

             19       Q.  Did you read the first --

             20       A.  Yes.

             21       Q.  -- couple paragraphs of page 1?

             22       A.  Yes.  I read it.  I'm out in left field

             23   here.

             24       Q.  Take a look at it, maybe read a couple




                                                               368

              1   paragraphs again.  And then let me know when you've

              2   read those two paragraphs.

              3       A.  There's only one way I can answer it, sir.

              4   Is this is true, it's true.  I can't remember.

              5   I'm being honest with you.

              6       Q.  So do you --

              7       A.  That's the truth.

              8       Q.  -- do you remember approaching Attorney

              9   Magliocchetti at some point prior to December 21 of

             10   2015 to talk about the loans that you had made to

             11   Mr. Kakouris?

             12       A.  I don't think I have.  I don't know.

             13   I don't remember.  That's the truth.

             14       Q.  So let me ask it a different way.  At some

             15   point, did Mr. Kakouris default on his loan payments

             16   to you?

             17       A.  Mr. Kakouris defaulted loans to me.  When I

             18   was with the Santander Bank, he made all the

             19   payments, no problem.  When the bank -- the banker

             20   told me to get my money out of -- the guy that was

             21   there for six months in North Andover, told me to

             22   get my money out.  He didn't want my business no

             23   more.

             24       Q.  Okay.




                                                               369

              1       A.  I had to give my money to Bank of America,

              2   and now I had to deal with Nick.  But Nick was going

              3   into the Santander Bank.  The girls were giving Mark

              4   Boyce my slip that he paid me.  And I wasn't feeling

              5   well at all.

              6               And I gave Nick, I figured I could trust

              7   him, he paid me right along, I'd get paid the rest

              8   of my money.  I gave him my checking account number.

              9   And I told him, Go into the bank every week, Nick.

             10   You don't have to see me or talk to anything.  I

             11   trust you.  Just put the money in -- like you did

             12   with the money at the Santander Bank, put the money

             13   in Bank of America every week.

             14               Meanwhile, I think I got sick at the

             15   time.  I wasn't well.  I wasn't feeling good.  And I

             16   wasn't really calling Santander Bank like I called

             17   Santander -- I mean, the Bank of America, I wasn't

             18   calling Bank of America to make sure that Nick was

             19   putting the money in the bank.

             20               But I did call Santander Bank at the

             21   time when he was putting money in there, I called up

             22   every week and they said, He came in there, gave

             23   Mark Boyce -- gave it to the girls, and the girls

             24   gave it to Mark Boyce.  But I did not do that when I




                                                               370

              1   gave him my checking account with Bank of America.

              2       Q.  So at some point, Mr. Kakouris defaulted on

              3   his loan repayments to you, right?

              4       A.  Yes.

              5       Q.  And do you remember when that was?

              6       A.  I don't know if it was after -- I don't

              7   know if it was before.  I thought he was paying me

              8   at Bank of America.  I wasn't calling and checking,

              9   sir, to make sure that he was paying me weekly.

             10       Q.  So --

             11       A.  I think when I got out of McLean's

             12   Hospital, I checked and I saw maybe four or five

             13   payments, Bank of America, that Nick had made, I

             14   think it was four, five, six payments, something

             15   like that.  But he was very nice.  I was very nice

             16   with him.  He told me what happened.

             17       Q.  So at some point after Mr. Kakouris

             18   defaulted on his loan payments to you, did you go

             19   speak with Attorney Magliocchetti about, you know,

             20   what recourse or what options you have?

             21       A.  I think I talked to Paul Magliocchetti

             22   about Nick wasn't paying me.  I told him I lent Nick

             23   money and the guy can't pay me.  And then I told him

             24   what happened.




                                                               371

              1       Q.  The question is, after Nick defaulted, did

              2   you speak with Paul Magliocchetti?

              3               And I move to strike any direct

              4   conversations of what my client told Attorney

              5   Magliocchetti.  And excuse me if I mis-summarized

              6   the question.

              7               So what's been marked as Exhibit 17,

              8   have you seen this document before?

              9       A.  No.  Not that I can recall.

             10       Q.  Okay.

             11       A.  Meanwhile, with Paul Magliocchetti --

             12   I'll be honest with you right -- I don't know how

             13   I -- I know Nick owed me money.  And, you know, so I

             14   happened to mention to Paul about, you know, that he

             15   owed me money or whatever.

             16       Q.  Um-hum.

             17       A.  And after that, I can't remember what

             18   happened.

             19       Q.  So the first paragraph in what's been

             20   marked as Exhibit 17, it indicates that "The purpose

             21   of this note is to confirm prior loans made to the

             22   maker by J. Perry Pentoliros in the total amount of

             23   $250,000.  The debt is being consolidated and

             24   formalized subject to the terms herein."




                                                               372

              1               Do you understand that this confirmatory

              2   promissory note was -- the purpose was to consolidate

              3   your prior loans that you had made to Nick Kakouris?

              4       A.  What do you mean, that I put them all

              5   together?

              6       Q.  Yeah.

              7       A.  I think I -- to be honest with you, I think

              8   I did.

              9       Q.  Okay.

             10       A.  I think I did.

             11       Q.  And, again, the total amount here is

             12   $250,000, which matches up with the $25,000 loan,

             13   second $25,000 loan, $100,000 loan, and then the

             14   fourth loan which was $100,000.  You add those all

             15   up and it equals $250,000, right?

             16       A.  Yes, sir.

             17       Q.  And do you recall meeting with Attorney

             18   Magliocchetti to get his assistance with protecting

             19   your interests as to those loans that you made to

             20   Mr. Kakouris?

             21       A.  To be honest with you, sir, I don't remember

             22   if I told Paul anything about Nick Kakouris.

             23   I don't remember.

             24       Q.  Well, at some point you did?




                                                               373

              1       A.  I mean, I remember at the end I said he

              2   wasn't paying me.  And I told him I was with

              3   Santander Bank.  I told Paul that they told me to

              4   get my account out of there.  And I told him what

              5   the bank manager told me, that I had a safe loan.

              6   End of story.  Whatever.

              7       Q.  And you recall Attorney Magliocchetti

              8   helping you with consolidating all those loans that

              9   you had made to Mr. Kakouris, correct?

             10       A.  I mentioned to him, like I said at the end --

             11               MR. TRETTER:  I --

             12       Q.  Let me just -- I'll have the question

             13   reasked.  And just listen carefully to the question.

             14   I'm not -- I'm not asking you to tell me what you

             15   told him or what he told you back.

             16       A.  Hmm.

             17               MR. ADAMS:  So can you read the

             18   question, please, Kim.

             19                     (Record read as requested.)

             20       A.  I want to answer this correctly, sir.

             21   I don't want to lie to you.  I can't remember.

             22   I'm being honest with you.  I'm not going to lie to

             23   you.

             24       Q.  Do you know whether or not Attorney




                                                               374

              1   Magliocchetti met with Mr. Kakouris at any point?

              2       A.  I think I -- I think -- I don't know for

              3   sure -- I think Nick Kakouris came into the office.

              4   Paul was there.  I was there.  And Nick Kakouris was

              5   there.

              6       Q.  You were there?

              7       A.  I think.  I think.  I think Paul was there,

              8   I was there, Nick Kakouris.  I think.  I don't know

              9   for sure.  But that's what I think.

             10       Q.  And what happened?

             11       A.  I don't know how we discussed it or what we

             12   did or whatever.  I don't remember.  I can't

             13   remember, sir.

             14       Q.  Did the topic concern the loans you had --

             15       A.  I guess that's what it must have been

             16   because why else would Nick be in there.

             17       Q.  So I just want to get my question out.

             18               MR. TRETTER:  Can I -- I hate to

             19   interrupt your question.  I just want to clarify for

             20   my client.  If you're in a room, Nick is in a room,

             21   and Paul is in a room, then there's no attorney-

             22   client privilege because Nick is there.

             23       A.  Um.

             24               MR. TRETTER:  When it's just you and




                                                               375

              1   Paul, there's attorney-client privilege.

              2       A.  Um.

              3               I told you, sir --

              4               MR. TRETTER:  Mr. Adams has a question.

              5       A.  Go ahead.

              6       Q.  So when you were meeting with Paul and

              7   Nick, was that here in this building?

              8       A.  That was here in this building.

              9       Q.  What was discussed and what was the purpose

             10   of that meeting?

             11       A.  Let me tell you, sir, maybe it could have

             12   been something else, the three of us -- because he

             13   said it's client privilege or whatever.  Maybe the

             14   three of us sat down there and we didn't discuss

             15   that at all.  Do you follow me?  Because I know

             16   Paul's a very good lawyer.  And he wouldn't do

             17   anything illegal at all.

             18               Maybe I -- and I said I think we were in

             19   there once.  I don't really know.  I've been through

             20   a lot.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Everything's

             21   vague to me now.  Everything that's been happening

             22   to me, this is all vague.  I never thought in

             23   a million years this would happen to me, and it

             24   happened.  I don't know nothing about it.




                                                               376

              1       Q.  So do you have a memory of coming to this

              2   office and being present here with Nick and Paul?

              3       A.  I know Paul doesn't do anything illegal.

              4   If we were sitting down together, the three of us,

              5   discussing something, was that illegal or legal

              6   or . . .

              7       Q.  My question though is, do you have a memory

              8   of being in this office and having a meeting with

              9   Nick and Paul?

             10       A.  I don't remember discussing anything about

             11   a loan, money, or anything when Nick was in the

             12   office with Paul and me, if he was in the office

             13   with Paul and me.  Because I really don't know for

             14   sure.  My mind doesn't really know for sure.

             15       Q.  Okay.

             16       A.  And I don't know -- if we were there,

             17   I don't know what we talked about.

             18       Q.  As you sit here right now, do you have a

             19   memory of being in this office together with Nick

             20   and Paul?  "Yes" or "no"?

             21       A.  No, I don't -- I told you the first, but I

             22   can't say for sure, no.  I can't say for sure, sir.

             23   I can't say for sure.  My memory is fogged up.  And

             24   I'm taking one particular pill now that I'm on that




                                                               377

              1   is not good for your memory.

              2               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

              3       A.  Not good for your memory, whatever.

              4               MR. TRETTER:  -- the question is --

              5       A.  I think that we were -- I think we were in

              6   there one time together.  I don't know for sure.

              7   And I can't remember what we talked about.  But I

              8   know we didn't talk about anything illegal because

              9   Paul's a reputable lawyer and a very good lawyer.

             10   So if he was in there with me, I have no idea what

             11   we discussed.

             12       Q.  You read the first page of --

             13       A.  Yes, I did.

             14       Q.  You read the first page of the confirmatory

             15   promissory note that we marked as Exhibit 17?

             16       A.  Yes, sir.

             17       Q.  Do you have a memory of reaching an

             18   agreement with Mr. Kakouris where he agreed to repay

             19   you the sum of $250,000 by October 10 of 2017?

             20       A.  I don't recall that but I know for sure

             21   Paul Magliocchetti -- I don't think he was in on

             22   that.  I don't know.  I really can't tell you.

             23   I don't remember.

             24       Q.  So if I went through any of the terms




                                                               378

              1   listed in this document which is marked as

              2   Exhibit 17, would you have any knowledge or specific

              3   memory as to the terms that Nick agreed to in

              4   signing this document?

              5       A.  To be honest with you, no, sir.

              6               I forgot a lot of things, sir.  Forgot

              7   an awful lot of things.

              8               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

              9       Q.  But you didn't forget the exact amounts you

             10   loaned --

             11       A.  No, I didn't forget.  Would you forget?

             12   Even going back, I told you, going back again out of

             13   the hospital --

             14               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, there's no question

             15   in front of you.

             16       Q.  Well, Mr. Pentoliros, you told me that you

             17   don't remember anything from 2013.

             18       A.  I said those treatments -- I forgot things

             19   when I played football in high school.  I forgot

             20   things, what I did in life.  I forgot a lot of

             21   things.

             22       Q.  So help me understand this, Mr. Pentoliros.

             23   When I showed you loan documents and mortgages

             24   related to loans that you made to Gino DeLuca from




                                                               379

              1   2013, you said you don't remember anything from 2013.

              2       A.  I don't remember.  I really don't remember.

              3       Q.  And then I showed you loan documents

              4   evidencing loans that you made to James Silva and,

              5   again, Mr. DeLuca from 2014, and you told me you

              6   don't remember any of the amounts or any of the

              7   loans.

              8       A.  I don't really remember the amounts of the

              9   loans.  But I do remember -- I do remember

             10   investing -- Paul had some -- because I asked him at

             11   the time, we're talking at the time, we're not

             12   talking right now -- at the time, I was drinking

             13   heavy, on a lot of booze.

             14               I really wasn't thinking right on these

             15   deals because if I had to do this all over today now

             16   I wouldn't have done nothing.  Nothing at all.

             17   I wouldn't have invested in nothing --

             18               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

             19       A.  -- with any of these deals now.  I wouldn't

             20   have done a thing.  I was always very conservative,

             21   did my own thing.  Never asked anybody for anything.

             22   I always did my own thing.  Or if I could ask you

             23   for some advice, I listen to your advice.  If I

             24   liked it, fine; if I didn't like it, fine.  But I




                                                               380

              1   always asked.

              2               When I did all these things here, I was

              3   in a lot of stress with and everything and I never

              4   knew Paul Magliocchetti, I knew no lawyer.  I had a

              5   lawyer, Herbert Finbury, when I was a kid, he liked

              6   my brother and me very much, the greatest guy in the

              7   world.  He died -- I don't know if you ever heard of

              8   him, but he died at 85.  But he was a very good

              9   friend of the family's.  I never needed a lawyer.

             10   When he died, I had no lawyer.

             11               And I had gone to my accountant at the

             12   time because we had problems with the state with --

             13   my mother had property and I had a brother in the

             14   will, whatever.  And I asked my accountant if he

             15   knew a lawyer.  He called Attorney Cleary up.

             16   Attorney Cleary called Attorney Sullivan up.  I had

             17   gone and seen Attorney Sullivan, told him the

             18   situation about my mother, and what the state's

             19   doing.  And he wanted $10,000, he told me.

             20               MR. TRETTER:  All right.  Can I --

             21   Perry, there's no question in front of you that

             22   you're responding to.  Attorney Sullivan -- you

             23   don't have to talk about what you told Attorney

             24   Sullivan or the fees to Attorney Sullivan.




                                                               381

              1               Can I take five minutes to talk to my

              2   client?

              3               MR. ADAMS:  That's fine.  Yeah, go ahead.

              4               THE WITNESS:  Well, I was going to tell

              5   you, I got involved with Paul Magliocchetti and --

              6               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, we're off the

              7   record.

              8                     (Recess at 12:02 p.m.,

              9                     resumed at 12:07 p.m.)

             10       A.  Where were we at, sir?

             11               MR. ADAMS:  Back on the record.

             12       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, you told me earlier today

             13   when I showed you loan documents evidencing loans

             14   that you had made to Gino DeLuca, to James Silva,

             15   to Mr. Malvers in the amounts of $340,000, $200,000,

             16   $8,000, $300,000, $50,000, $250,000, and $120,000

             17   during the years 2013 through 2017, and your

             18   response to me was, I don't remember any of the

             19   details of those loans because of the electric shock

             20   therapy I received at McLean's in May of 2017.

             21               My question to you is, how is it that

             22   you can sit here now and remember the specific

             23   amounts and the details of the loans that you made

             24   to Mr. Kakouris that occurred in the years 2013 and




                                                               382

              1   2014?

              2       A.  Some things I recall and some things I

              3   don't recall.  That's the way I can answer the

              4   question.  I can't answer it any other way, sir.

              5   Some things I recall; some things I don't recall.

              6       Q.  Were you present -- Again, turning to

              7   what's been marked as Exhibit 17, were you present

              8   when Nick Kakouris signed this document?

              9       A.  I don't really know.

             10       Q.  Did you have conversations with Nick

             11   Kakouris about having him sign this confirmatory

             12   promissory note?

             13       A.  Say that again.

             14       Q.  Did you have conversations with Nick

             15   Kakouris about having him sign this confirmatory

             16   promissory note?

             17       A.  Well, we didn't have no conversation on it,

             18   no.  Not that I recall.

             19       Q.  Did you talk to Nick at all about the need

             20   to have him consolidate those loans into one loan

             21   and have him sign an agreement?

             22       A.  The gentleman had told me --

             23       Q.  What gentleman?

             24       A.  Nick Kakouris.




                                                               383

              1       Q.  Okay.

              2       A.  -- that he would open a new business, he

              3   needed help.  I knew the guy.  I started with a

              4   small amount of money.  And then it got into a big

              5   amount of money.  Or I can't answer the question any

              6   other way, sir.

              7               MR. ADAMS:  Kim, can you reask the

              8   question, please.

              9               MR. TRETTER:  Listen to the question,

             10   Perry.

             11                     (Record read as requested.)

             12       A.  And I told you I really don't know, sir.

             13   I don't know.

             14       Q.  Do you remember being concerned about

             15   Mr. Kakouris's ability to repay the loans after he

             16   had ceased making the $1,300 a week payments?

             17       A.  Yes.  I was very, very concerned at the

             18   time.

             19       Q.  Okay.

             20       A.  And I told you about I wasn't feeling good

             21   at that time, I had anxiety, I wasn't feeling good.

             22       Q.  Yeah.

             23       A.  And I never checked -- I knew he was paying

             24   me all that time at the Santander Bank.  I would




                                                               384

              1   have never left the Santander Bank.  And I had a

              2   feeling when I left the Santander Bank, you know, it

              3   wasn't the same like I had it with Mark Boyce.  It

              4   was in a safe every week.

              5               I was feeling sick when I went to the

              6   Bank of America.  Santander Bank made me very sick

              7   when they told me to get all that money out of the

              8   bank.  And what if they make a mistake?  I've got a

              9   lot of money in here.  I've got an awful lot of

             10   money in here.  What if they make a mistake when I

             11   give it to Bank of America?

             12               Then I had obsessive-compulsive real bad.

             13   And I was calling the Bank of America up.  Did the

             14   money come in?  Did the money come in?  I had -- it

             15   was driving me crazy.  If I had stayed at Santander

             16   Bank, this would have never happened.

             17               This whole deal would have never

             18   happened if I had stayed with Santander Bank.

             19   Because who knows, maybe Nick would have continued

             20   paying.  I don't know.  I don't know the answer to

             21   that.  But this all happened when I got out of

             22   Santander Bank.  And I was with them for a long

             23   time.  You can check, sir.

             24       Q.  I'll represent to you that your relationship




                                                               385

              1   with the bank ended around June of 2015.

              2               Does that sound accurate to you?

              3       A.  I had it with -- I had been with Bank of

              4   America when I got out of Santander, when they told

              5   me to get out of there.  I don't really know what

              6   year it was.  It must have been '15, if it's down

              7   they got all of '15.  I can always call the bank up

              8   and ask them when did I first put the money in --

              9       Q.  So I'm representing to you as the bank's

             10   lawyer that it was June of 2015.  Does that sound

             11   accurate to you?

             12       A.  That sounds about accurate, yes, sir.

             13       Q.  So was it shortly after that time that

             14   Mr. Kakouris stopped making payments?

             15       A.  When I gave him my checking account number

             16   for Bank of America --

             17       Q.  Um-hum.

             18       A.  -- he made one payment, two payments, three

             19   payments, four payments.  And I don't know if I got

             20   sick, I wasn't well at the time.  But I wasn't

             21   checking because I figured I was safe with them.

             22   But I wasn't feeling good.  I wasn't thinking about

             23   money at that time when I was ill.  I wasn't feeling

             24   well.  I couldn't drive my car home.  I was having




                                                               386

              1   anxieties.  I couldn't eat for a week.  I was very

              2   sick, very, very sick.  I don't remember nothing.

              3               MR. TRETTER:  The question is, Perry --

              4               MR. ADAMS:  He's fine.

              5               MR. TRETTER:  -- does the date sound

              6   correct?

              7               THE WITNESS:  Yes.  The date sounds

              8   correct, sir.  That date sounds correct, sir.

              9       Q.  So after that when Mr. Kakouris defaulted

             10   on his payments to you, did you consider filing suit

             11   against him to collect the amount that he owed you?

             12       A.  No, I didn't.  I didn't consider that, sir.

             13       Q.  Why not?

             14       A.  I just didn't consider it.  I didn't

             15   consider it.

             16       Q.  Okay.

             17       A.  I really didn't consider it.  I liked the

             18   guy and didn't consider it.

             19       Q.  At that point, were you concerned about how

             20   secure your loan was?

             21       A.  I figured -- at that particular time, sir,

             22   I figured when Nick started making some money or

             23   whatever, Nick would start paying me.  That's what I

             24   figured.  He was that kind of a person.  So that's




                                                               387

              1   what I figured in my mind.  I was wrong.  What would

              2   anybody think?  I didn't want to forget it.

              3               MR. TRETTER:  Done.

              4       Q.  So according to what's been marked as

              5   Exhibit 17, the confirmatory promissory note,

              6   Mr. Kakouris was required to start making payments

              7   to you again on this consolidated debt in the amount

              8   of $250,000.

              9               Is that your understanding of this

             10   document?

             11       A.  Yes.

             12       Q.  And did he start making payments to you

             13   again?

             14       A.  Is this when I got out of the Santander

             15   Bank?

             16       Q.  No.  So this document, this note is dated

             17   December 21 of 2015.  So what is your

             18   understanding --

             19       A.  It's got to be -- if it was 2015, yes, it's

             20   got to be --

             21       Q.  So what is your understanding as to

             22   Mr. Kakouris's payments to you after he executed

             23   this confirmatory promissory note?  Did he resume

             24   making payments to you?




                                                               388

              1       A.  Yes, he did.

              2       Q.  And how much he was paying to you per week?

              3       A.  I don't have any memory.  I don't remember.

              4   I don't know if I was at Bank of America or

              5   Santander -- because I got out of -- when did I get

              6   out of Santander?

              7       Q.  Again, I'm representing to you and I'll

              8   show you something later on, June of 2015 is when

              9   your relationship with Santander ended.

             10       A.  June '15?

             11       Q.  So this is dated December of 2015.  So my

             12   question to you is, did Mr. Kakouris resume making

             13   payments to you after he signed this confirmatory

             14   promissory note?

             15       A.  I would say he did if the date is there

             16   because I left -- I was with Bank of America, and we

             17   got the date there.  So I would say he was

             18   continuing making the payments.

             19       Q.  And how many payments did he make after he

             20   executed this confirmatory promissory note?

             21       A.  I don't know.  Maybe -- when I was with the

             22   Bank of America, I think he made maybe five or six

             23   payments.  That's it.

             24       Q.  And his last payment would have been




                                                               389

              1   sometime in early 2016?

              2       A.  And that's when I ended up in the hospital,

              3   Holy Family Hospital.  I wasn't concerned at that

              4   particular time, sir, about money, how much money

              5   I had, what I had, what I didn't have.  I was very

              6   sick.  And I wasn't thinking about anything about

              7   money.  That was the last thing on my mind, was

              8   money, when I was sick.  I know how sick I was.

              9   I was that sick.

             10               When they tell you in a hospital,

             11   a doctor says, If you don't take electric shock

             12   treatment -- you can check this -- you're going to

             13   turn into a zombie.  That's what he told me.

             14   Because I didn't want to take electric shock.

             15   I know how bad they were.

             16               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, I think he asked

             17   you about whether the date was correct or not.

             18               THE WITNESS:  I think it was correct,

             19   yes.

             20               MR. TRETTER:  We don't need to hear

             21   about the hospital.

             22               THE WITNESS:  No.  If I was thinking in

             23   my right mind at the time, I would have never gave --

             24               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --




                                                               390

              1               THE WITNESS:  -- Nick any money.

              2               MR. TRETTER:  -- we're not here to talk

              3   about your life story.

              4               THE WITNESS:  No, I know.

              5               MR. TRETTER:  We're here to answer

              6   questions.

              7               THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I'm trying to

              8   answer them the best way I can.

              9       Q.  So at what point did you become concerned

             10   about the fact that Mr. Kakouris was no longer

             11   making payments to you?

             12       A.  Now, I can't remember, sir, when I got out

             13   of the hospital, before I went in the hospital if I

             14   had known that he hadn't been making payments and I

             15   had talked to him on the phone, You're not making no

             16   payments, Nick, or whatever.

             17               I don't know if I did that or not.  But

             18   if I was in my right mind, I think I would have.

             19       Q.  So you'd agree that the $250,000 was a loan

             20   that you made to Mr. Kakouris --

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  -- correct?

             23       A.  Yes.

             24       Q.  You would agree that it was Mr. Kakouris




                                                               391

              1   who benefitted from the $250,000, correct?

              2       A.  I don't know if he benefitted.  He gave the

              3   money to supposedly his partner.  And the partner

              4   took all his money.  He's broke today.  Nick don't

              5   have a dime in his pocket.  He's walking around

              6   broke.  He doesn't have a quarter.

              7       Q.  How do you know that?

              8       A.  Well, I've been to his house.  I've gone

              9   out with him.  We've gone out, whatever.  And the

             10   guy, like I said, the guy -- he says it's going to

             11   take him a long time -- he told me -- if he ever

             12   gets himself out of this mess that he got himself

             13   into.  That's what the gentleman told me.  I believe

             14   him.  He wouldn't lie to me.  He's not a liar.  He's

             15   not a liar.  I believe him.

             16       Q.  So you would agree that Mr. Kakouris

             17   benefitted from the money that you loaned him and

             18   not Santander Bank, correct?

             19       A.  I don't think he benefitted from the money

             20   because the money's gone.  If he had the money, he

             21   wouldn't be in any trouble.  I thought I did the man

             22   a favor.  I was going to help him out.  Like if you

             23   are a friend and I could help you out, I'd help you

             24   out.  If I could help you out.




                                                               392

              1       Q.  Sure.

              2       A.  At that time, I could help him out.

              3       Q.  Sure.  The $250,000 that you loaned to

              4   Mr. Kakouris, that's money that he owes you, correct?

              5       A.  Yes.

              6       Q.  And you've talked to him before about him

              7   repaying you, correct?

              8       A.  Yes.

              9       Q.  You didn't loan any money to Santander Bank,

             10   did you?

             11       A.  No, I never loaned any money to Santander

             12   Bank.  How can you loan money to a bank?

             13       Q.  And it was Mr. Kakouris who defaulted under

             14   the terms of the promissory note, correct?

             15       A.  Yes.

             16       Q.  Not Santander Bank, correct?

             17       A.  But Santander Bank had got me into this

             18   trouble.  I would have -- if I hadn't given Nick

             19   that last money with Santander Bank telling me to do

             20   it, I wouldn't be in this mess today.  I wouldn't be

             21   in this mess today.

             22               And Santander took all my money out of

             23   the bank that I was there for many years with -- my

             24   mother had her money in there.  And when they said




                                                               393

              1   they wanted my papers, because I had no papers, he

              2   had everything in his safe.

              3               All the papers I had going back from way

              4   back, and they shredded.  This guy in North Andover

              5   that was there, he shredded all my papers, shredded

              6   everything.  He didn't leave me a paper.  Why?

              7   I don't know.

              8               MR. ADAMS:  Mark that, please.

              9       A.  Do you know who that manager was that was

             10   there?

             11               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, Attorney Adams

             12   doesn't answer any questions other than, Can you

             13   repeat the question; I didn't understand the

             14   question.  Other than that, no --

             15               THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

             16               MR. TRETTER:  -- no questions to him.

             17                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 18 was marked

             18                     for identification.)

             19       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, we've marked as Exhibit 18

             20   the summons and complaint that was filed in this

             21   case.  And I'd like to --

             22       A.  Where do I look here?

             23       Q.  I'd like you to flip to the fourth page,

             24   please.




                                                               394

              1       A.  So this is the fourth page right here, sir,

              2   where it says "Nick Kakouris needed additional money

              3   and sought another $25,000" --

              4       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, I'll show you the page.

              5   I'm happy to show you the fourth page, here.

              6       A.  Thank you.

              7       Q.  So I flipped four pages into this document,

              8   which is the first page of the actual complaint

              9   which has the caption.

             10       A.  Okay.  Now, what do I --

             11       Q.  And do you see, sir, in the box where it

             12   says your name --

             13       A.  Yes, I do.

             14       Q.  -- "James Pentoliros vs. Santander Bank and

             15   Mark Boyce" --

             16       A.  Yes.

             17       Q.  Do you see that, sir?

             18       A.  Yes, I do, sir.

             19       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, you would agree with me

             20   that you loaned $250,000 to Mr. Kakouris?

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  And you would agree with me that it was

             23   Mr. Kakouris who defaulted on those loan repayments

             24   to you, correct?




                                                               395

              1       A.  Yes.

              2       Q.  And you would agree that it's Mr. Kakouris

              3   who owes you the $250 [sic] that you loaned him that

              4   he hasn't paid you back?

              5       A.  Yes.  But he has paid me back something.

              6       Q.  But he owes you money?

              7       A.  Yeah.  I don't know how much was in that --

              8   I don't know how much was in that -- I don't know

              9   how much.

             10       Q.  But it's Mr. Kakouris who owes you that

             11   money?

             12       A.  Yes.

             13       Q.  So why is it that when you brought this

             14   lawsuit, that you didn't sue Mr. Kakouris since he's

             15   the one who owes you the money?

             16       A.  I had Santander Bank, which I trusted

             17   100 percent, there for years, I trusted Mark Boyce

             18   to give him that $100,000 which I said I didn't have

             19   for an hour.  I was half intoxicated.  And Nick

             20   started crying that he needed the money that bad.

             21               And I got a good heart.  I got no wife,

             22   no kids, got no family, nothing.  I'm alone.  And I

             23   had money.  I had money.  I had money.  I wasn't

             24   broke.  And I knew this guy was not a bum.  I wasn't




                                                               396

              1   dealing with some bum on the street.  I was dealing

              2   with a reputable nice guy.

              3               To this day, he feels bad to this day

              4   what happened.  He feels bad to this day.  He feels

              5   that bad.  That bad.  I don't know how to explain it

              6   to you.  But if I borrowed money from you or anybody,

              7   like if the lawyers, if I owe you money, you get

              8   paid.  I'll pay you one way or another.  I'll pay

              9   you.  I'm the type of guy that will pay -- This guy

             10   got himself involved for so much money, he can't pay.

             11               And I thought I was the only one that

             12   gave him the money at the time.  I saw what he had.

             13   I figured I got a real secure safe investment.

             14   That's what I figured.

             15               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, answer the question

             16   if you can answer it.  If you can't answer it or you

             17   don't know.  But listen to the question, please.

             18       Q.  The question was, you had loaned

             19   Mr. Kakouris $250,000 and it was Mr. Kakouris who

             20   had defaulted on those loan repayments back to you.

             21   And it's Mr. Kakouris who presently owes you a

             22   substantial amount of money.  Yet when you brought

             23   this lawsuit, you didn't sue Mr. Kakouris.

             24               Why is that?




                                                               397

              1       A.  I didn't --

              2               MR. TRETTER:  Objection.

              3               THE WITNESS:  What?

              4               MR. TRETTER:  I'm objecting to the form

              5   of the question.

              6               You can answer it.

              7               THE WITNESS:  Can I answer it?

              8               MR. TRETTER:  Yes.

              9       A.  I didn't sue Mr. Kakouris because, let's

             10   say if Santander Bank hadn't got me out of there,

             11   hadn't told me to get my money out of there -- when

             12   they told me to get my money out of there, I was

             13   sick.  I had a lot of money in there.  And you just

             14   don't move that kind of money out in a minute.

             15               And this guy told me he wanted my money

             16   out of there, very frank with me.  And then when I

             17   wanted my papers so I could have them for my records

             18   because I was going to Bank of America, he came down

             19   to the bank at Westgate and he shredded everything.

             20   I don't know what -- but he shredded every paper

             21   that I had for years, 20-25 years over in that safe

             22   because I was a good customer for years.

             23               That's why I'm suing Santander Bank.

             24   And if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have had a




                                                               398

              1   nervous breakdown.  I wouldn't have been in the

              2   nuthouse.  That $100,000 killed me.  And it was

              3   Santander Bank, Mark Boyce that did that to me.

              4               He did it to me.  He did it.  He conned

              5   me -- I don't know why -- he conned me.  The reason

              6   was, I have no idea.  Maybe he wanted me to lose my

              7   money.  I have no idea.  Maybe he was jealous of me.

              8   I don't know what to tell you.

              9       Q.  So I'm going to ask --

             10       A.  He knew I had money.  He knew I had money.

             11   He knew my brother had money.

             12       Q.  So I'm going to ask you for the third time.

             13   My question is different.  My question is, you

             14   loaned the money to Mr. Kakouris.  He defaulted.

             15   He never paid you back.  He owes you a substantial

             16   amount of money.

             17               Yet when you brought a lawsuit, even

             18   though it's Mr. Kakouris who owes you the money, you

             19   didn't name him as a defendant in this lawsuit.

             20               Why didn't you sue Mr. Kakouris even

             21   though he's the one who owes you the money?

             22       A.  Because I figured Santander did this to me.

             23   That's what I figured.

             24       Q.  Was it because Mr. Kakouris was a friend?




                                                               399

              1       A.  No.  No.  I figured Santander Bank did this

              2   to me 100 percent.  When I knew they shredded every

              3   paper I had from a kid, something was wrong.  When

              4   the guy told me to get my money out of there,

              5   something was wrong.

              6               Nobody would want that kind of money

              7   taken out of their bank.  I have no idea what the

              8   reason was.  I was very pissed.  Very sick over

              9   Santander Bank because I wasn't leaving Santander

             10   Bank.  I was going to stay there for the rest of my

             11   life.  I wasn't going to leave there.  I had no

             12   reason to leave there.

             13               He told me, Get your money the hell out

             14   of here.  And he was very fresh with me.  That guy

             15   in Andover was very fresh with me.  He gave me no

             16   explanation, nothing.  Get your money the hell out

             17   of here.  That's what he told me at Santander Bank.

             18   How would you like it if Santander Bank told you

             19   that after all as a customer, my mother, my father,

             20   everybody were customers there.

             21               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, settle down.  You

             22   answered the question.

             23       Q.  Do you remember a manager at Santander

             24   branch, maybe Westgate, by the name of Karine?




                                                               400

              1       A.  Who?

              2       Q.  Karine.

              3       A.  I don't remember no Karine.

              4       Q.  How about the name Karine Pogoysan

              5   P-o-g-o-y-s-a-n?

              6       A.  No.  I never remember no manager Karine

              7   whatever you said.  I don't remember one, no.

              8       Q.  Did you ever ask out on a date any employee

              9   of Santander Bank?

             10       A.  I think maybe quite a while ago, there was

             11   a blonde there.  And I didn't know if she was

             12   married or not.  And I might have asked if she

             13   wanted to go out for lunch.

             14       Q.  Okay.

             15       A.  But I don't know.  I think it was a blonde

             16   that worked there.  I don't know -- I don't remember

             17   what her name was.  But I did nothing illegal.  I

             18   don't rape people.  I don't touch people.  I got no

             19   history, like the guy that was worth a zillion

             20   dollars, fooling around with little kids.  I never

             21   fooled around with anybody.

             22               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

             23       A.  I got no rap sheet.

             24               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --




                                                               401

              1       A.  -- on rape or anything.  Why, does somebody

              2   say I raped somebody there now?  I don't like the

              3   question.

              4               MR. TRETTER:  The question was just --

              5       A.  If I ask somebody -- if I ask somebody to

              6   go out, I don't know if they're single, married, or

              7   what.  Did I do something wrong?  I'm a single man.

              8   Do I do something wrong if I ask somebody out for a

              9   date?

             10               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, you're not here to

             11   ask questions.  The question is, did you ask somebody

             12   out for a date.

             13       A.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  I don't

             14   remember.  I might have.  I don't know.

             15       Q.  In what branch, what location did this bank

             16   employee work that you --

             17       A.  I think it was Westgate -- I think it was

             18   Westgate where I had my money in the Santander Bank

             19   where I used to go -- I think it was there.  I don't

             20   remember even what her name was, nothing.  I can't

             21   believe they'd have something like this down.

             22   I can't -- I can't believe it.

             23       Q.  Did you ask any Santander employee to have

             24   any sort of intimate engagement?




                                                               402

              1       A.  No, never.

              2       Q.  Did you ever indicate to an employee of the

              3   bank that you refused to work with Puerto Ricans?

              4       A.  No.  I never mentioned that, no.

              5       Q.  Did you make any sort of comment or

              6   statement that you refused to work with somebody

              7   based on their race or their background at any

              8   Santander branch?

              9       A.  No.  I remember one time I got a phone

             10   call.  I was talking to a gentleman I do business

             11   with.  And I was very mad.  And the gentleman called

             12   me up and I used a vulgar language.  I used some

             13   vulgar language.  Meanwhile, it was Santander Bank,

             14   there was a young lady that worked there.  And I

             15   didn't think it was her.  But like I say, I

             16   apologized.  I didn't know it was her.

             17               I went to Paul Frank and I apologized if

             18   I said something because I didn't think it was that

             19   particular girl.  And I don't know who the girl was.

             20   But I do remember, I picked the phone up, I was very

             21   mad and I used vulgar language.  I thought it was

             22   the gentleman I was doing business with.  End of

             23   story.

             24               I can't tell you any more.  But I




                                                               403

              1   remember that.  But I don't remember chasing

              2   hundreds of women in the Santander Bank.  What, did

              3   somebody say I raped them?  Did somebody say I raped

              4   them too now?  Like you know the guy that's in

              5   trouble here --

              6               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

              7       A.  What, do they want all my money?

              8               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

              9       A.  Want to put me in jail?  I can't believe.

             10   Is it against the law --

             11               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

             12               Can we take a break?

             13       A.  -- is it against the law --

             14               MR. ADAMS:  Yes, you can.

             15       A.  Is it against the law to ask somebody for a

             16   date?

             17               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

             18       A.  Is it against the law --

             19               MR. TRETTER:  We're going to take a

             20   five-minute break.

             21       A.  This I can't -- I'm a single man.  I've

             22   never been married.  I went out with women my whole

             23   life.  I never got in trouble.

             24               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, we're not -- We're




                                                               404

              1   breaking.

              2       A.  I can't believe that I asked them.  I don't

              3   remember who.  I've asked a lot of women out.

              4                     (Whereupon at 12:32 p.m.,

              2                                     (1:05 p.m.)

              3               MR. ADAMS:  Let's go back on the record,

              4   please.

              5                   JAMES P. PENTOLIROS,

              6       the witness at the time of recess, having

              7       been previously duly sworn, was further

              8       deposed and testified as follows:

              9                 EXAMINATION (continued)

             10       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, the document you have in

             11   front of you is what we marked as Exhibit 18.

             12   I actually want to rephrase a question I asked you

             13   before.

             14       A.  18.

             15       Q.  No.  It's the document right there in front

             16   of you.

             17       A.  This is 18 right here?

             18       Q.  So I just want to rephrase a question I

             19   asked you.  Because I think I could have done a

             20   better job.  In this case, you sued Santander Bank

             21   and Mark Boyce.

             22       A.  Yes.

             23       Q.  My question is, why not sue Nick Kakouris

             24   in addition to suing Santander and Mark Boyce?




                                                               406

              1       A.  Because I'm the type of guy when I got a

              2   friend, I got a friend.  Just like whoever I played

              3   football with, baseball with, whatever, we'd die for

              4   each other.  Like me being in the service, and I'm

              5   in combat with somebody.  I'd die for anybody I

              6   played with.  I played with all good ballplayers.

              7   We all love each other.  We see each other every

              8   year.  I'd die for any one of them guys.

              9       Q.  Yes.

             10       A.  And this guy here, I'd die for him.  I like

             11   him.  I'd die for Nick Kakouris.

             12               MR. TRETTER:  Okay.

             13       A.  I'm 73 years old.  He's 50 years old.

             14   I see where he's got four kids, got a house, got a

             15   business, he's in there working seven days a week.

             16   And because of this, he hasn't got a nickel.  He

             17   hasn't got a dime.  Because of this.  Not because of

             18   me.  Because he got a lot of money from a lot of

             19   people, which I never knew about.  I would have

             20   never gave him a dime if I knew that.

             21       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, have you ever made any

             22   derogatory or racist comments while in a Santander

             23   branch to any Santander employee?

             24       A.  Never.  Never.




                                                               407

              1       Q.  At any point while visiting a Santander

              2   branch, did you ever become agitated, loud, or

              3   aggressive?

              4       A.  Never.

              5       Q.  Did you ever yell at any employees?

              6       A.  Never.  All strictly business.  That was it.

              7   I didn't have two dollars in there.  I had already

              8   got some money --

              9               MR. TRETTER:  All right --

             10       A.  -- you got to be a gentleman --

             11               MR. TRETTER:  -- Perry, you've got to

             12   answer the question.

             13       A.  You've got to be a gentleman when you got

             14   some money.

             15       Q.  While you were a customer at Santander

             16   Bank, did you ever yell at any of the bank employees?

             17       A.  No, I never did.

             18       Q.  Were you ever asked to leave a Santander

             19   branch --

             20       A.  Never.

             21       Q.  -- by any Santander employee?

             22       A.  Never.

             23       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, you said before that

             24   the bank destroyed your records.




                                                               408

              1       A.  Yes.  I'm very upset about that.  I don't

              2   have a record for when I was 30 years old.  I don't

              3   have a record.  It was all in the bank.  I don't

              4   have a record, nothing.  Why do they have to shred

              5   my papers?  Why didn't they give me my papers?  They

              6   wanted me out of the bank.

              7               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, you answered the

              8   question.  The answer is yes.

              9       A.  I just answered the question for you.  They

             10   didn't have to do that.

             11       Q.  Did you ever see anybody shred any of your

             12   documents?

             13       A.  I went up to the bank, sir, and I said I

             14   wanted my documents, all of them that's in that

             15   safe.  They told me -- I don't remember who told

             16   me -- they said they shredded them because there was

             17   a few tellers up there that didn't like me very

             18   much.

             19               I was a gentleman -- there was a few of

             20   them that liked me.  And they told me they shredded

             21   all my papers, all of them.  Or do you think I'm

             22   lying about that?

             23               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, answer the

             24   question, please.




                                                               409

              1       A.  They shredded all of my papers.  Why?

              2   We'll ask a jury why they shredded my payments.

              3   I'd like to know why.  Did they need them?

              4       Q.  So did you ever see them shred your papers?

              5       A.  No.  I never saw them shred them.  Would

              6   they shred them right in front of me.  Would anybody

              7   do that?  Would I tear your papers up right in front

              8   of you.

              9       Q.  So what documents did you want to get back

             10   from the bank that you never did.  What were the

             11   documents that you --

             12       A.  I wanted everything back.  I had all my

             13   things from this bank from where I had everything in

             14   their safe, all my belongings, all my personal

             15   belongings were in there.  If I needed something

             16   now, I have no belongings, none.  They're all

             17   shredded.

             18       Q.  So what are these belongings and documents

             19   that the bank had that they shredded, in your mind?

             20       A.  Oh, my money.

             21       Q.  They shredded your money?

             22       A.  No.  They shredded papers telling me how

             23   much money I had.  What I was doing here.  What I

             24   was doing there.  I even gave them the things that I




                                                               410

              1   had in stocks.  I even gave them the things.  He put

              2   them in there.  I don't have nothing.  I gave them

              3   all my personal belongings.  Just like me giving you

              4   everything today that I got in my pocket --

              5               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

              6       A.  -- I gave them my personal belongings,

              7   everything.  I have no belongings now.

              8               MR. TRETTER:  -- have a seat.  Answer

              9   the question.

             10       A.  And I have no idea how much money I lost

             11   when Santander Bank sent the money over to Bank of

             12   America.  I got a feeling that they even screwed me

             13   there.

             14       Q.  So --

             15       A.  I didn't want to do that.

             16               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, answer the

             17   questions, okay?  No speeches.

             18       Q.  My question is this.  What specific

             19   documents or belongings that the bank had that you

             20   claim that they never returned to you?

             21       A.  All my personal belongings.

             22       Q.  What are they specifically?

             23       A.  End of story.

             24       Q.  What things?




                                                               411

              1       A.  End of story.  Anything I had personal.

              2       Q.  What?

              3       A.  My personal papers, different papers.

              4   Papers that I had 30 years ago.

              5       Q.  What papers?

              6       A.  Papers.  When I bought houses, whatever I

              7   did, all my personal -- my titles, everything I had

              8   in the bank there of my property.  My titles.  You

              9   know, my titles.  If I bought a house, I had

             10   everything up there.

             11       Q.  So you're saying a deed to --

             12       A.  I had the deeds to all my property right in

             13   the safe there, all my deeds, everything was there.

             14   I had a big safe and I had -- and I trusted them.

             15   That's why I'm sick.  I have no -- I don't have a

             16   deed today, nothing.

             17       Q.  So deeds to properties.  What else?

             18       A.  Personal papers.

             19       Q.  What kind of personal papers?

             20       A.  I can't remember.

             21       Q.  Like a birth certificate?  Like what

             22   personal papers?

             23       A.  Personal papers that I had.  Personal papers.

             24   You must have personal papers in your house,




                                                               412

              1   personal papers that you have.

              2       Q.  Well, I mean, are you talking like a birth

              3   certificate, Social Security card?  What are we

              4   talking about?

              5       A.  You got me on that.  You really got me on

              6   that.  I really don't know how to -- I said all my

              7   personal belongings that I had were in that -- that

              8   were valuable that I needed, whatever, and offhand I

              9   can't think about --

             10       Q.  I just want to know --

             11       A.  Because I had banks, I had done business

             12   with banks before, different banks I had done

             13   business with.  Would you like me to write them all

             14   down for you, all the banks, so you can go to them,

             15   different banks I had done business with?

             16               I had done different businesses with

             17   brokerage firms.  I had stocks.  I had my stocks in

             18   a safe, what I had.  These are all important things.

             19   I didn't have -- I had important things in that

             20   safe.  That's what I had.

             21       Q.  So you had -- you identified deeds to

             22   properties, you are saying was contained in your

             23   file at Santander Bank.  Your stocks --

             24       A.  I had my brokerage papers in there.




                                                               413

              1       Q.  Brokerage papers.

              2       A.  All my brokerage papers.

              3       Q.  Were there stocks and bonds?

              4       A.  I had all my investments, all my investments

              5   that I made, that I had up to today, which I --

              6   I had everything in that safe there.  Because I told

              7   you, I don't keep papers.  I get my checking account

              8   statements every month or whatever, I throw them

              9   away at the end of the year.  I go to the bank, they

             10   give me whatever I need.  I don't keep papers.

             11   I never did and I never will.

             12       Q.  So deeds to properties, brokerage papers,

             13   and investment-type papers.

             14       A.  Yeah.  All my personal papers that were

             15   value -- anything of value to me I had -- that's how

             16   it -- anything of value to me was in that safe.

             17       Q.  So other than deeds to properties,

             18   brokerage papers, and investment papers, what else?

             19       A.  Whatever I needed, sir.  I can't answer the

             20   question anymore.  All my valuables were in there.

             21   Whatever I needed in life to show, if somebody said,

             22   I need this or I need that, I don't have -- I have

             23   to go find it.  I don't -- I don't have any papers.

             24   Nothing.




                                                               414

              1       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, you're clearly upset

              2   that you wanted to get your --

              3       A.  Papers.  I wanted them back.

              4       Q.  You wanted to get some papers back.

              5       A.  I wanted them all back.

              6       Q.  You're upset that you wanted to get some

              7   papers back that you are saying that were kept in a

              8   safe at Santander Bank.

              9       A.  Yes.

             10       Q.  And I've asked you to identify what they

             11   are.  And so far you've said deeds to properties,

             12   brokerage papers, and investments.  Here's your

             13   chance to tell me what other papers that were kept

             14   in that safe.

             15       A.  What Nick Kakouris gave me.

             16       Q.  Which was what?

             17       A.  He didn't give me, he was to put it in the

             18   bank.

             19       Q.  Which was what?

             20       A.  What he was supposed to give me -- I don't

             21   remember -- $1,300 at the time.

             22       Q.  So invoices or deposit slips?

             23       A.  Yeah.  They gave him a sheet like this.

             24   Every time he went in there, they gave him a sheet




                                                               415

              1   this big and it said $1,300.

              2       Q.  Like a deposit slip?

              3       A.  No, but it was a big slip.  It wasn't a

              4   small little slip.  A big slip.

              5       Q.  So a piece of paper evidencing Nick

              6   Kakouris's weekly payment to you --

              7       A.  Yes.

              8       Q.  -- in the amount of $1,300?

              9       A.  All those things were in there.

             10   Everything -- everything that I had financially or

             11   whatever that was important to me was in that safe.

             12       Q.  So what else?

             13       A.  What else?

             14       Q.  Yeah.  What specific documents?  What else?

             15       A.  Everything -- it's all the jury has to ask

             16   me.  I had whatever papers I had, whatever papers I

             17   had in life I had in that safe.  And you don't --

             18   you don't make $4 million, sir, you don't make that

             19   without being smart.  You don't make that without

             20   being bright.  We can tell the jury how a guy who

             21   didn't have a dime.  I started with nothing.

             22               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

             23       A.  My daddy didn't send me to any schools.

             24   Nothing.




                                                               416

              1               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

              2       A.  My father was in that diner 20 hours a day,

              3   seven days a week.

              4               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, you just need to

              5   answer the question.

              6       Q.  Are you a sophisticated businessman?

              7       A.  What's that?

              8       Q.  Are you a sophisticated businessman?

              9       A.  I can play any part, sir.  I can play the

             10   part of anybody.  I'm sophisticated with the right

             11   people, with the wrong people.  When I don't like

             12   people, I don't like them.  And I let them know I

             13   don't like them.  And when I like somebody, I like

             14   them.

             15       Q.  Are you a sophisticated businessman?

             16       A.  And I really don't like this right here.

             17   I don't like this at all.  I'm a very sophisticated

             18   businessman.  Very sophisticated.  You go to Bank of

             19   America, they love me.  They used to love me at the

             20   Santander Bank, couldn't wait for me to put money in

             21   there.  They loved me.

             22       Q.  So what is your response to somebody who

             23   calls you an unsophisticated businessman?

             24       A.  Nothing.  I don't care what they call me, I




                                                               417

              1   don't care what they say about me or nothing.  I

              2   don't care what you think of me.  I could care less.

              3   I'm not embarrassed about taking a shock treatment.

              4   I'm not embarrassed about being in that nuthouse.

              5               I'm 73 years old, sir.  You worry about

              6   stuff like that when you're 16 years old.  The kids

              7   all laugh at you: He's in the nuthouse.  73 years

              8   old, what's going to bother me?  I can drop dead

              9   today and -- walk out here and drop dead of a

             10   massive heart attack.

             11               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, answer the question.

             12       A.  Can I?  I can walk out of here and die

             13   today.  I lived my life.  My life's over now.

             14   I'm an old man.  I'm not out chasing girls anymore.

             15               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, just answer the

             16   questions.  You're going on about --

             17       A.  I told him --

             18                     (Indiscernible crosstalk.)

             19       A.  -- whatever I had in that safe deposit -- I

             20   had everything, my personal papers, whatever I had

             21   that was value to me was in there.  I don't remember

             22   what I -- all the other things.  I just -- all my

             23   papers were in there from the Santander Bank.

             24       Q.  Okay.




                                                               418

              1       A.  So whatever.

              2       Q.  Let me ask you this.  Deeds to properties,

              3   have you tried printing copies of those deeds from

              4   the Registry of Deeds website?

              5       A.  I haven't needed to go get any copies

              6   because like I said, if I need them, it's all I have

              7   to do -- my lawyer can get me a deed if I need it in

              8   a minute.

              9       Q.  But you understand that a deed to a

             10   property, we can get a copy of that at any point?

             11   You can get a copy of that at any point?

             12       A.  Anybody can get a copy.  I know you can get

             13   a copy of a deed.  But they were in the safe over

             14   there.  I put them there instead of saving them at

             15   my house.

             16       Q.  So your brokerage papers --

             17       A.  My brokerage papers were all in the thing.

             18   When I bought stocks or whatever I did, they were

             19   all in the safe over there.

             20       Q.  So can you reach out to your broker to get

             21   copies of --

             22       A.  No, I can't.  I told you -- I had Olde

             23   Discount Brokerage for years.  I got papers, I made

             24   money.  I never kept the papers.  I gave them to the




                                                               419

              1   bank.

              2       Q.  So you're saying you're not able to keep

              3   track of what stocks --

              4       A.  I gave whatever I had, my personal

              5   situations, to the bank that were important.  Like

              6   when I sold a stock or whatever, they went into the

              7   bank.  What else can I tell you?  My personal

              8   belongings with papers were in there.  Other than

              9   that, I can't answer more questions.

             10       Q.  My question though is, with respect to any

             11   brokerage papers evidencing your stocks, bonds,

             12   investments, as you sit here right now, are you able

             13   to track your investments as of today?

             14       A.  What do you mean, track my investments?

             15       Q.  Do you know where you've invested your

             16   money in?

             17       A.  I know where my money is, sure.  I know

             18   where it is.

             19       Q.  Do you know what stocks --

             20       A.  But I don't know what papers -- what papers

             21   I put in the bank with fees, this, that, checking

             22   account.  They were all up there.  I didn't keep

             23   none of that.

             24       Q.  So the fees would be owed to who?  What




                                                               420

              1   fees?

              2       A.  What do you mean, fees?  I told you, when I

              3   got checks, when I got checks or deposits, I always

              4   gave it to the bank.  I gave it to them, Here, put

              5   these in your safe.  Everything.  Anything I have

              6   financially, I can't remember what I bought 10 years

              7   ago, but if it was important, I gave it -- I put it

              8   in the safe over there.  I have everything over

              9   there.

             10       Q.  Have you attempted to contact any of your

             11   present brokers or any of the people who assist you

             12   with your brokerage investments or stocks and bonds?

             13       A.  No, I don't have to.  I know exactly -- I

             14   know exactly -- when I throw the papers away, I know

             15   exactly what I got in my head.  I know what I got in

             16   my head.

             17               I took the shock treatment, I forgot an

             18   awful lot because of the shock therapy.  But other

             19   than that, I had a very, very good memory.  Very

             20   good.  I had a very good memory.

             21       Q.  So as you sit here right now, you remember

             22   your investments in your stocks?

             23       A.  I remember my investments, what I got right

             24   now.  I can't go back 20 years or 15 years.




                                                               421

              1       Q.  That's fine.

              2       A.  I can't go back that far.  I can't go back

              3   that far.

              4       Q.  So as you sit here right now, can you think

              5   of any other documents that you say were contained

              6   in the safe that was kept at Santander?

              7       A.  I can't think of anything else, no.

              8       Q.  I mean, a lot of these documents you

              9   described -- the brokerage papers, the investments,

             10   the deeds to the properties -- would you agree that

             11   they have nothing to do with Santander Bank?

             12       A.  Sure they have something to do with

             13   Santander Bank.  I had a large amount of -- I had

             14   all my money in that bank.  Every dime I had in the

             15   world.  I trusted that bank 100 percent.  My mother

             16   had her money before she died.  She had millions in

             17   the Santander Bank there before she died.

             18       Q.  I'm not --

             19       A.  This Paul Frank liked the family.  I only

             20   had my money in here because they had Paul Frank in

             21   there.  And I knew him from 16 years old as the

             22   Arlington Trust Bank.  He was there.  I couldn't

             23   believe it when he left there.  He left there for

             24   Haverhill Bank.  That's why I'm telling you about




                                                               422

              1   this.

              2       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, nobody's disputing that

              3   you had --

              4       A.  I liked the Santander Bank.

              5               MR. TRETTER:  Will you listen to the

              6   question and let him finish.

              7       Q.  Let's just get through this, all right?

              8       A.  What's that?

              9       Q.  Let's just get through this.

             10       A.  Yeah.  I want to get through it.  I really

             11   want to get through it, I want to get out of here.

             12       Q.  Nobody is disputing that you had bank

             13   accounts at Santander or even that your family did,

             14   for that matter.

             15       A.  Yeah.

             16       Q.  My question is though, your brokerage

             17   papers concerning investments with -- through your

             18   broker and investments in different companies and

             19   stocks and bonds and deeds to properties that you

             20   bought, whether the property was in your name or in

             21   somebody else's name --

             22       A.  They were in my name.

             23       Q.  -- but those documents had no direct

             24   correlation to Santander Bank.  So my question is,




                                                               423

              1   why were those documents kept with Santander Bank?

              2       A.  Because I trusted Mark Boyce.  He said he'd

              3   put my papers in -- he put the papers in there, all

              4   my papers.  I trusted him.  I didn't think he was

              5   going to be gone.  He told me he had a lifetime job

              6   there, that's what he told me.  He was all set.  He

              7   was going to be there forever.  I couldn't believe

              8   it when it all happened, when they got rid of him.

              9       Q.  With respect to these documents that you

             10   say were kept in the safe at Santander that you

             11   never got back --

             12       A.  Why did they shred them; can you tell me?

             13   Why?

             14       Q.  -- my question to you is, how have you been

             15   harmed by not getting those documents back?

             16       A.  Those were personal papers, things that I

             17   needed, things I would have had.  I would have known

             18   today what Nick owed me, whatever.  I don't know.

             19   I have no idea.  They're gone.  They were in a safe.

             20   They were in Mark Boyce's safe.  Every time he gave

             21   me a paper like this, he put -- they put it in a

             22   safe.  I don't even know how much Nick gave me back.

             23   I have no idea.  You must have an idea, huh?

             24       Q.  So your concern is about the deposit slips




                                                               424

              1   related to Nick's weekly $1,300 payment to you,

              2   correct?

              3       A.  What he gave me at the Santander Bank.

              4   What he put in there, yes.  Every penny.  Every cent.

              5       Q.  Would you agree with me that the documents

              6   related to deeds that you had in your name and

              7   brokerage papers that you had from your investments,

              8   that because you have that information stored in

              9   your head or because you can download a deed off the

             10   Internet --

             11       A.  How about that I'm not -- I come from the

             12   old school, I don't know nothing about Internets,

             13   cell phones.  That's not my thing, sir.

             14               MR. TRETTER:  Will you let him finish

             15   the question.

             16       A.  I'm 73.  I'm willing to die.  I'm on my way

             17   out.  I've lived my life.  I'm on third base, coming

             18   home.  Do you know what I'm trying to tell you?

             19   I'm a dead man.  I realize that.

             20               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, just answer the

             21   questions.

             22       A.  I don't like getting screwed.  And I got

             23   screwed.  Santander screwed me bad, real bad.

             24   I would have never left there, never.




                                                               425

              1               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, there's no question

              2   in front of you.  Answer the questions.  That's it.

              3       Q.  So I'm going to ask it again.  Would you

              4   agree with me that the deeds to properties that your

              5   attorneys can print for you and give you copies of

              6   and that your brokerage papers which identify the

              7   investments that you have in your memory, because

              8   you either have that information or you can gain

              9   access to that information with the assistance of

             10   somebody else, that you haven't been damaged if,

             11   in fact, those documents were destroyed?

             12       A.  I'll never forget that till my dying day --

             13       Q.  That's not my question.

             14       A.  -- that they shredded my papers.  I'm going

             15   to start looking for papers, what I had, if I got a

             16   call tomorrow that I need something, that somebody's

             17   dead and buried.

             18               MR. TRETTER:  Can I take a couple

             19   minutes?

             20               MR. ADAMS:  I'd like an answer to the

             21   question.

             22       Q.  And it wasn't whether or not you're going

             23   to forget.  It's whether or not because --

             24       A.  What do you want me to tell you?  What




                                                               426

              1   would you like me to tell you to make you happy?

              2   You don't want --

              3               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

              4       A.  -- to pay me nothing.

              5               MR. TRETTER:  -- he didn't ask you that

              6   question.

              7       A.  I'll go to a jury and not have a chance of

              8   getting paid.

              9               MR. TRETTER:  Perry --

             10       A.  If I don't get paid, I don't get paid.

             11   It's not the end of the world.  I'm 73.  I lived my

             12   life.  I don't like getting screwed.  I never wanted

             13   to get screwed in my life.  And nobody ever screwed

             14   me.

             15               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, just let

             16   Mr. Adams --

             17               THE WITNESS:  The guy's doing his job.

             18   He's trying to win for the Santander Bank.  I don't

             19   like being interrogated anymore.

             20               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, stop editorializing

             21   and making speeches.  Mr. Adams is going to ask you

             22   a question; you're going to answer the question to

             23   the best of your ability.

             24               THE WITNESS:  I told him about I had the




                                                               427

              1   papers in the safe.  I don't know what I had, what I

              2   didn't.  Like I said, I can go down to the lawyers,

              3   fine, 100 lawyers from 10 years ago and ask them for

              4   the papers.  I can't do that.

              5               MR. TRETTER:  If you're looking for

              6   something, can I just have a few minutes?

              7               THE WITNESS:  I can't do that.  I don't

              8   know what papers I had in there.

              9               MR. ADAMS:  That's fine, that's good

             10   enough.  The answer is clear.

             11       Q.  So let me ask you about your concern about

             12   deposit slips or papers that evidence Nick Kakouris

             13   making weekly payments to you and to your account to

             14   pay off the loan that you made him.

             15               In this case, your lawyer provided

             16   documents in response to questions that I asked.

             17               I'm going to slide over to you -- I'm

             18   not going to mark it as an exhibit -- but I'm going

             19   to slide over to you what was produced.  And it's a

             20   Bates range 326 to 394.  So we're looking at about --

             21   there's 68 pages of documents with the exception of

             22   four pages in the middle.  And these, Mr. Pentoliros,

             23   I'm going to represent to you, are --

             24       A.  So I got 68 pages --




                                                               428

              1       Q.  Let me finish.

              2       A.  I got 68 pages I'm looking at?

              3       Q.  I'm just going to have you thumb through it

              4   and show you that these are records of the $1,300

              5   per week deposits that Nick Kakouris made to your

              6   account.  I'm just going to slide them over to you.

              7   You can take a look at them.  And you don't have to

              8   read every page.  You can thumb through it.

              9       A.  I got something here for $1,400, 602 Main

             10   Street, I have no idea what that is.  None.  I have

             11   no idea.

             12       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, just thumb through it,

             13   please, just to get the overall theme of the

             14   documents I'm showing you.

             15       A.  Now, they're all the same.  They're all

             16   $1,300.  What do I have to look through the whole

             17   thing for?  I mean, are they all -- I'm not

             18   retarded.  I got $1,300, $1,300.  Are they all

             19   $1,300?  You read them.  Do I have to read them all?

             20               MR. TRETTER:  Why don't you wait for the

             21   next question, Perry.

             22       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, from the documents you

             23   flipped through, those appear to be --

             24       A.  Appear to be what they are, right.




                                                               429

              1       Q.  -- do they appear to be --

              2       A.  Yeah.

              3       Q.  -- the copies of the papers --

              4       A.  Yes.

              5       Q.  -- that evidence Mr. Kakouris's weekly

              6   payments to you?

              7       A.  Yes.

              8       Q.  Does that seem accurate to you?

              9       A.  Yes.  Yes.

             10       Q.  And you were talking a second ago about one

             11   of your concerns about papers that had been put in

             12   your file and kept in a safe at the bank, not

             13   getting those papers back, that you somehow lost

             14   evidence or documents showing that Nick had made

             15   payments, right?

             16       A.  Yes.

             17       Q.  So I'm showing you that that, in fact, is

             18   not the case because I showed you, you know,

             19   68-70 pages --

             20       A.  You don't have all the papers I had in my

             21   thing.

             22       Q.  I'm showing you documents evidencing many

             23   of Nick Kakouris's weekly payments that he made to

             24   you, correct?




                                                               430

              1       A.  Correct.

              2       Q.  So would you not agree then that your

              3   concern about not having access to Mr. Kakouris's

              4   weekly deposits that he made to you is -- it's not

              5   accurate?  These are documents that your attorney

              6   produced.

              7       A.  What do you want me to tell you now?  What

              8   would you like me to say?  Can I say "yes" or "no"?

              9   Yes, you're right.  Yes, you're right.  Yes, you're

             10   right on everything.  You're right, yes.  You've got

             11   papers for the jury; you're all set.

             12               I know what happened to me.  It happened

             13   to me because of Santander Bank.

             14       Q.  So any other documents, as you sit here

             15   right now --

             16       A.  I don't remember nothing else.  I don't

             17   remember.

             18       Q.  Are you saying you don't remember nothing

             19   else right now because you don't want to answer any

             20   more questions?

             21       A.  What do you mean, I don't want to answer --

             22   Ask me questions and I'll say "yes" or "no."

             23       Q.  Okay.

             24       A.  Go ahead.




                                                               431

              1       Q.  So other than the documents we've discussed

              2   thus far that you believe were kept in your file,

              3   kept in a safe at the bank, can you think of anything

              4   else?

              5       A.  No, I can't think of anything else.

              6       Q.  So the fact that you can get a deed from

              7   your attorneys, the fact that you know what your

              8   investments are because you have them in your

              9   memory, the fact that we now have -- and I showed

             10   you -- the deposit slips that were kept in your

             11   safe -- kept in your file in the safe evidencing

             12   Nick's weekly payments to you, do you now recognize

             13   that the documents that you say you don't have

             14   access to anymore you, in fact, have access to?

             15       A.  I see it.  They're right there, yes.

             16       Q.  Did you ever refer to a branch manager at

             17   the bank as a debutante with red lipstick and high

             18   heels?

             19       A.  Did I ever what?  Did I ever do what?  Say

             20   that again.

             21       Q.  Did you ever refer to a branch manager as a

             22   debutante --

             23       A.  You mean I saw a branch manager, me, and

             24   she had red lipstick on?  Say that again.




                                                               432

              1       Q.  Did you ever refer to a branch manager or

              2   any employee of the bank as a debutante with red

              3   lipstick and high heels?

              4       A.  Can you tell me what that means?

              5       Q.  Did you ever say that?

              6       A.  No.  No, I never said that.  Jeez, I can't

              7   believe this one.  Jesus Christ, huh?

              8               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, just answer the

              9   question.

             10       Q.  So how is it that your relationship with

             11   the bank was terminated?  What's your understanding

             12   of --

             13       A.  I had a very good relationship with the

             14   bank until that man in North Andover came in here.

             15   I had called him for two or three reasons -- I can't

             16   remember why -- but I had a very good relationship

             17   with the Santander Bank.  I couldn't have had a

             18   better relationship with -- very good.

             19               All of a sudden this guy -- I don't know

             20   what I talked to him about two, three times, or

             21   whatever.  Evidently he didn't like what I said, and

             22   the gentleman told me, Get your money out of the

             23   bank.  And when I got my money out of the bank --

             24   I didn't ask him no questions, he wanted me out;




                                                               433

              1   he only gave me two or three days to get my money

              2   out of the bank.

              3       Q.  Did he --

              4       A.  This was very stressful for me, knowing I

              5   didn't have two dollars in there.  I mean, I had

              6   some money in there.  And to this day I don't know

              7   if I got the right money at Bank of America or not

              8   because I don't trust Santander Bank after what they

              9   did to me.  Because no other bank would have done

             10   what Santander Bank did to me.

             11               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, just answer the

             12   question, please.

             13       A.  That's the end of my question [sic].

             14       Q.  Were you told why?

             15       A.  They didn't tell me why, no.  They just

             16   tell me, Get your money out.  Nobody told me why to

             17   get it out of there.  Nobody mentioned that, no.

             18       Q.  Did you ever receive any correspondence

             19   from the bank informing you that their relationship

             20   with you was being terminated?

             21       A.  No.  Not that I know of.  Not that I can

             22   remember.

             23               MR. ADAMS:  This will be 19, please.

             24




                                                               434

              1                     (Pentoliros Exhibit 19 was marked

              2                     for identification.)

              3       Q.  Mr. Pentoliros, we've marked as Exhibit 19

              4   a letter dated June 10, 2015.  Can you take a

              5   second, please, and read this to yourself.

              6       A.  Read it.

              7       Q.  You can hold onto it, sir.  You can hold

              8   onto it.

              9       A.  Yes.

             10       Q.  My question is, do you recall an incident

             11   at the Plaistow branch of Santander Bank on May 29,

             12   2015?

             13       A.  No, I don't.

             14       Q.  Do you remember any incident that occurred

             15   in the Plaistow branch?

             16       A.  No, I don't.

             17       Q.  You have no memory of any incident --

             18       A.  No, none, no.  I never did anything in the

             19   bank, no.

             20       Q.  Have you ever seen this letter before?

             21       A.  No.  Not that I can remember, no.

             22       Q.  Okay.

             23       A.  Not that I can remember.  I notice they

             24   don't have it signed here.  There's no signature.




                                                               435

              1   Usually somebody sends you a letter, usually they

              2   sign it.  I mean, that's always brought up, you

              3   know, from the third grade you learn that.  You

              4   write a letter, you put your name down.  There's no

              5   name.  I guess they didn't have to put no name down,

              6   huh?  There's no name down there.  "Sincerely" who?

              7               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, you answered the

              8   question.

              9       Q.  And, again, this letter's dated June 10 of

             10   2015.  Was it around June 10, 2015 that you were

             11   informed that your account with the bank was being

             12   terminated?

             13       A.  Yes.  Yeah.

             14       Q.  And did you speak with any employee of the

             15   bank either by phone or in person regarding any sort

             16   of inappropriate behavior or, you know, actions by

             17   you in any branch which was the causation of your

             18   termination?

             19       A.  Not that I can remember, no.

             20       Q.  Did you ever file a lawsuit against James

             21   Silva?

             22       A.  No.

             23       Q.  You never brought litigation against him?

             24       A.  No.  I saw Paul Frank -- I mean, I saw Paul




                                                               436

              1   and I let it go.  I let it go.  I was drunk that day

              2   when I came in here.  And I wanted to file suit

              3   against him.  The next day -- the next day I just

              4   forgot -- I just forgot.  I paid my fee.  I paid my

              5   fee and I let it go.

              6       Q.  Why did you --

              7       A.  I let it go.  That's all.

              8       Q.  Why did you want to file suit against James

              9   Silva?

             10       A.  Because I went to a house -- I went to one

             11   of my houses.  When I went to one of my houses, I

             12   banged on the door and the lady came out and I said,

             13   I came here for my rent.  That's what I said.  The

             14   lady told me, You're not the landlord here.  I just

             15   paid the landlord.  I just paid the landlord.  She

             16   says, I paid the owner.  When that happened, I blew

             17   my stack.  It was my money.

             18       Q.  Because you were the owner of the property?

             19       A.  I was the owner of the property.  Yeah.  If

             20   you own property and somebody bangs on the door and

             21   says, I'm here to pick up rent and they tell you, I

             22   just gave the money to the owner.  I gave the money

             23   to the owner.  That's exactly what happened.  Then I

             24   went out, drank a quart of vodka, came down to




                                                               437

              1   Paul's office here, and we filled out papers,

              2   whatever.

              3               I want -- the next day I didn't want to

              4   get him.  I knew who it was, the whole deal.  And I

              5   let it go.  I took a loss.  I gave that $5,000 here

              6   for nothing because I let it go.  I didn't take him

              7   to court, nothing.  I let it go.  I let the whole

              8   thing go.

              9       Q.  And you're talking about a tenant paying

             10   money to James Silva?

             11       A.  Yeah.  A tenant I had that paid Jim Silva

             12   and said that they owned the place.  That tenant is

             13   no longer around.  I sold that house.  But we can't

             14   find that tenant now.  If you're going to try to

             15   find her, I hope you can find her.  I hope you can

             16   find her.  Because I went there for my money, like

             17   you would.  Like you would go there for your money.

             18       Q.  If somebody owes you money, you want to go

             19   get it?  Is that what you're saying?

             20       A.  If I got a tenant that owes me money, I go

             21   and pick up my rent.  Something illegal about that

             22   or not right about that?

             23       Q.  No.  If your tenant doesn't pay you, then

             24   what do you do?




                                                               438

              1       A.  My mother had a diner up in Plaistow, when

              2   my father retired after 35 years, seven days a week

              3   in there, they rented the diner out to Eggies Diner.

              4   I used to go up to the guy that was running the

              5   place with my father or alone and pick up the check

              6   every month.  Is there something illegal about that?

              7       Q.  If somebody doesn't pay you money --

              8       A.  What?

              9       Q.  If somebody doesn't pay you money that

             10   you're owed, what do you do?

             11       A.  Nothing.  We can't do nothing about it.

             12   Somebody who owes me money and you can't pay me,

             13   I can't do nothing about it.  That's it.  I lost my

             14   money, that's life.

             15               I got tenants now owe me money, owe me

             16   all kinds of money.  I'm -- what do you call it?

             17   I'm going to court.  I go to court, I win.  They owe

             18   me 14, $15,000.  I never get paid and I write it off.

             19               They ruined my place at 602 Main Street

             20   upstairs.  I'm going to court tomorrow.  The lady

             21   owes me $7,000.  She ruined my place.  I had a

             22   carpenter fix the place last year, this year.  And

             23   like I said, I just write it off.  What can I do?

             24   Somebody don't pay me, I go to court.  How are you




                                                               439

              1   going to get any money if somebody hasn't got a dime.

              2       Q.  You said that was 602 Main Street?

              3       A.  Yeah.  You can check on that.  I got a court

              4   date tomorrow morning at 9:00 o'clock.  I want you

              5   to check that out so you won't know -- so you'll

              6   know I'm not lying to you.

              7       Q.  Where?  What court?

              8       A.  Lawrence District Court.

              9               MR. TRETTER:  Northeast Housing Court.

             10               THE WITNESS:  Huh?

             11               MR. TRETTER:  Northeast Housing --

             12               THE WITNESS:  Northeast Housing Court.

             13               MR. TRETTER:  Perry, just answer the

             14   questions.

             15       Q.  Are you represented by counsel in that case?

             16       A.  No, I'm doing it myself.  I'm doing it

             17   myself.

             18       Q.  Have you ever talked to Nick Kakouris about

             19   working out a payment arrangement so that he can

             20   start paying you back?

             21       A.  I never -- I've been with Nick Kakouris

             22   many times, been to his house.  I never mentioned

             23   nothing about it.  I know the man owes a lot of

             24   money here and there.




                                                               440

              1               Like I told you, if I had known that, I

              2   wouldn't have given him any money.  I thought I was

              3   the only one that gave him money.  I got fooled.

              4   But no, I never mentioned nothing to him.  He's a

              5   fine gentleman.  Like I say --

              6       Q.  Yeah, but he --

              7       A.  -- nobody knows what's going to happen in

              8   the future, nobody knows who's going to die, who's

              9   going to live or whatever.  Like the guy, broke, he

             10   hasn't got a dime.  I feel bad for him.  I can't do

             11   anything to help him now.  I can't do anything to

             12   help the guy now.

             13       Q.  Well, he has a -- he has a business, right?

             14       A.  Yeah.  He has a business.  He's in there

             15   seven days a week working.  And I guess everything

             16   he makes he's got to pay out all different kinds of

             17   places.  I guess he's got to pay money to everybody.

             18   I don't know who he owes money to.

             19       Q.  Have you talked to him about whether or not

             20   he can start paying you back?

             21       A.  I never told him, Can you start paying me

             22   back.  I never --

             23       Q.  So here's a guy who owes you six figures

             24   and you never talked to him about paying you back?




                                                               441

              1       A.  No.  I never talked to him about paying me

              2   back.  And the guy can't believe it, the guy is --

              3   other people, like I say, he owes money to, they

              4   bother him, they call him up.  I never bothered him

              5   once, not one time.  Not once.  You can ask him,

              6   sir.  I never bothered him once.  Because if he

              7   could have paid me, he would have paid me.  He would

              8   have gave me some money.

              9               Like if you owe me some money and you

             10   can't pay me, then you can't pay me.  I can't get

             11   something that somebody hasn't got, like the

             12   tenants.  They can't pay me.  The judge says for

             13   them to pay me.  They don't pay me nothing.

             14               MR. ADAMS:  Tom, I'm all set.

             15               MR. TRETTER:  All right.  I have a

             16   couple follow-up questions.  I'd like to take a

             17   break first.  I'll try to be brief.

             18                     (Recess at 1:45 p.m.,

             19                     resumed at 1:58 p.m.)

             20               MR. TRETTER:  I have a few questions for

             21   you, Mr. Pentoliros.

             22                       EXAMINATION

             23   BY MR. TRETTER:

             24       Q.  Earlier today Attorney Adams showed you




                                                               442

              1   some documents.  Do you recall this promissory note,

              2   Exhibit 5, where you loaned Mike DeLuca, as trustee

              3   of the Duke Realty Trust some money in 2013; do you

              4   recall that?

              5       A.  Yes.  Yes.

              6       Q.  Did Mr. DeLuca ever pay you back on that?

              7       A.  Yes.

              8       Q.  And so there were a number of loans that

              9   were shown to you and mortgages.  Has Mr. DeLuca

             10   ever not paid you back?

             11       A.  He always paid me back.

             12       Q.  How about Mr. Malvers?  Do you remember

             13   seeing a mortgage --

             14       A.  Yes.  He always paid me back.

             15       Q.  You've got to let me finish the question,

             16   okay?

             17               Now, earlier today Mr. Adams showed you

             18   what was marked as Exhibit No. 18, which was a copy

             19   of the complaint in this case, and asked you why you

             20   didn't sue Mr. Kakouris.

             21               Do you remember that?

             22       A.  Yes.

             23       Q.  Has Mr. Kakouris, or Nick, ever denied that

             24   he owes you money?




                                                               443

              1       A.  No, he's never denied it, no.  But we

              2   haven't really talked.  The man don't want to talk

              3   about that.

              4       Q.  But he's never denied that?

              5       A.  Never denied it.

              6       Q.  And Attorney Adams also showed you what was

              7   marked as Exhibit No. 5.  Do you remember what that

              8   is?

              9       A.  I don't remember, no.

             10       Q.  Do you want to put on your glasses and take

             11   a look, please.  Do you recall seeing that document,

             12   Exhibit No. 5 today?

             13       A.  Yes, I remember seeing this today.

             14       Q.  And do you recall it states in the first --

             15   you know, I strike that.

             16               MR. ADAMS:  You want Exhibit 17.

             17               MR. TRETTER:  I want Exhibit 17.  Okay.

             18       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, do you recall seeing

             19   this document here marked as Exhibit 17 today?

             20       A.  Let me take a look at it, Tom.

             21       Q.  So, Mr. Pentoliros, do you recall seeing

             22   that document today?

             23       A.  I don't recall it.  To be honest with you,

             24   believe it or not, I don't recall it.




                                                               444

              1       Q.  Do you recall seeing it today?

              2       A.  I don't recall seeing it today, no.

              3       Q.  Do you see at the bottom where it's marked

              4   Exhibit No. 17?

              5       A.  Yeah.  If I read it I said I saw it -- It's

              6   amazing, huh?  I don't remember seeing this one.

              7       Q.  Well, in any event, do you know what a

              8   contract under seal is?

              9       A.  A what?

             10       Q.  A contract under seal.

             11       A.  No, I don't know.

             12       Q.  Do you know how long a person has to sue on

             13   a contract under seal?

             14       A.  No, I don't know.

             15       Q.  Are you aware that Nick Kakouris has been

             16   made a third party defendant in this case by

             17   Santander?

             18       A.  No.  I don't know anything about that, no.

             19       Q.  Are you aware that you now have a claim, a

             20   direct claim in this case against Nick Kakouris for

             21   his failure to pay you back?  Were you aware of that?

             22       A.  I didn't know that, no.

             23       Q.  I'm showing you what was Exhibit 1 from

             24   your deposition on August 2.




                                                               445

              1       A.  Um.

              2       Q.  Do you recall seeing that document on

              3   August 2?

              4       A.  Do you want me to read the whole thing?

              5       Q.  No.  I'm just asking you if you recall

              6   seeing that on August 2?

              7       A.  I'll be honest with you.  I don't recall it,

              8   no.

              9       Q.  Now, do you recall testifying today that

             10   you don't keep any documents regarding your finances?

             11   Do you recall --

             12       A.  No.  I don't usually keep any documents, no.

             13       Q.  Do you know the difference between keeping

             14   stuff and storing stuff?

             15       A.  Sure.  I know all about it.  A lot of

             16   people store papers, they have a place they keep

             17   them, this and that.  I don't store papers.  I don't

             18   store -- I guess I'm very -- I'm not good at that at

             19   all.

             20       Q.  So with respect to your tax returns, you

             21   keep copies -- do you store copies of those?

             22       A.  I give them to Mike Reilly, my accountant.

             23       Q.  Now, is it possible that some of the

             24   records from Santander regarding your transactions




                                                               446

              1   with Mr. Kakouris you kept at your home for a while?

              2       A.  I'll be honest with you.  I was drinking a

              3   lot of booze at the time.  I can't remember where

              4   anything is.  I couldn't remember -- when I sold the

              5   house, I couldn't remember where anything was.  What

              6   can I tell you?

              7       Q.  Well, Mr. Adams showed you about 60 pages

              8   today --

              9       A.  I saw it, and I told you -- I used to give

             10   Mark Boyce a paper -- remember he kept the paper and

             11   he gave me a paper.  And I must have kept it for

             12   him -- the gentleman to have them.  I must have kept

             13   them.

             14       Q.  Well, if this office produced Santander

             15   documents such as Exhibit 15 that was marked here

             16   today to Santander, we would have gotten those

             17   documents from you; isn't that correct?

             18               MR. ADAMS:  Objection.

             19       A.  Yes.  That's correct.

             20       Q.  So you may have kept some copies of the

             21   documents regarding this transaction?

             22       A.  I really can tell you honestly I don't

             23   remember.  I'm telling you truthfully.  Again, I

             24   can't lie about it.

              1               MR. TRETTER:  I don't have any other

              2   questions.

              3               MR. ADAMS:  Nope.  All set.  We're all

              4   set.  All done.

              5               THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

              6               MR. TRETTER:  Thank you.

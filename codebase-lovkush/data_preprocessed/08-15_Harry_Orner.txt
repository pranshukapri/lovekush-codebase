          11   BY MR. GALLAGHER:

          12   Q.     Good morning, Mr. Orner.  My name is Mike

          13   Gallagher.  I'm an attorney.  I represent Carla Brietman

          14   with respect to a motor vehicle accident that occurred on

          15   May 24th, 2018, in Haverford, Pennsylvania, at or near the

          16   intersection of Bon Air Avenue and Eagle Road.  Does that

          17   date and location sound familiar to you?

          18   A.     It's not Eagle, but -- that's actually my house,

          19   the corner of Bon Air and Grand.

          20   Q.     Okay.  So is it -- would it be --

          21   A.     Grand Avenue.

          22   Q.     It's on Grand Avenue and --

          23   A.     605 Grand Avenue is my house, and I was parked on

          24   the side.

          25   Q.     We'll get into that.  Nevertheless, that general
                                                                      5



           1   location, Grand Avenue, Bon Air, Eagle Road, right in that

           2   vicinity, is that where the accident occurred?

           3   A.     Eagle is not even near that.

           4   Q.     All right.  I'm going by the police report.

           5   A.     Okay.  I'm just saying --

           6   Q.     Why don't we cut to the chase.  Where did -- where

           7   do you think it happened?

           8   A.     Bon Air and Grand.

           9   Q.     All right.  So May 24th, 2018, Bon Air and Grand

          10   Avenue is where the accident occurred?

          11   A.     Correct.

          12   Q.     I'm going to be asking you some questions about

          13   that accident today, all right?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     I'm going to give you instructions before we begin.

          16   These instructions were probably given to you by your

          17   attorney, but I want to make sure on the record that you

          18   hear them from me, you understand them, and then we'll

          19   move forward, okay?

          20   A.     Yup.

          21   Q.     All right.  First of all, number one, don't answer

          22   any questions you don't understand, all right?  It's my

          23   job to formulate a question that you understand --

          24   A.     Okay.

          25   Q.     -- not your attorney, not Ms. Brietman, not the
                                                                      6



           1   court reporter, that only you understand.  So if you don't

           2   understand my question, just say, "Mike, I don't

           3   understand.  Could you please rephrase it," and I'll do

           4   so, all right?

           5   A.     Correct.

           6   Q.     Another instruction:  You need to wait until I'm

           7   finished answering (sic) my question before you begin to

           8   answer.

           9   A.     Okay.

          10   Q.     The reason for that is because everything that's

          11   being said on the record is being taken down by the court

          12   reporter --

          13   A.     Right, each time.

          14   Q.     -- to your right.  So we cannot speak over one

          15   another --

          16   A.     Okay.

          17   Q.     -- as we would do normally, say, over a cup of

          18   coffee or a beer at a bar, okay?

          19   A.     I'll have to work on that.  That's --

          20   Q.     That's fine.

          21   A.     -- gonna be tough for me.

          22   Q.     Your attorney or myself or even the court reporter

          23   may remind you from time to time, but it's really -- we're

          24   not trying to be rude.  It's really important that you try

          25   to stick to that.  Just wait 'til I'm done.  I know you're
                                                                      7



           1   gonna anticipate what I'm saying --

           2   A.     Okay.

           3   Q.     -- but you need to wait, all right?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     All your answers need to be verbal.  You're doing

           6   fine so far.  You can move your hands, shake your head,

           7   shrug your shoulders, do whatever you want, but you have

           8   to accompany that with a word.  Do you understand?

           9   A.     Correct.

          10   Q.     Try to avoid things like "uh-uh," "uh-huh," "nah,"

          11   "yeah."  We know what you mean, but sometimes that doesn't

          12   get transcribed well on the -- on the record, all right?

          13   A.     Correct.

          14   Q.     Don't guess at anything, okay?  It's perfectly fine

          15   if you don't recall.  This, you know, happened what?

          16   almost like a year and -- and several months ago, so if --

          17   if certain things don't come to mind, that's perfectly

          18   okay.  I may ask some -- a follow-up question to jog your

          19   memory, but if you still don't remember, don't outright

          20   guess.

          21                  But the difference between an outright

          22   guess and knowing something but not every detail is this:

          23   If I asked you what you had for dinner last year on August

          24   15th, even though you have pizza four times a week, you

          25   probably don't know exactly what you had that last year on
                                                                      8



           1   this particular date, correct?

           2   A.     Possibly.

           3   Q.     Right.  Maybe you did.  Maybe it was an anniversary

           4   or something.  But normally, people don't remember what

           5   they had for dinner a year ago.  That's an outright guess

           6   usually.

           7                  But if I asked you something like, "How did

           8   you get here today?" you might not know every turn, every

           9   road, every street, but you probably can give me a good

          10   idea how you got here, correct?

          11   A.     Correct.

          12   Q.     All right.  That's the difference between an

          13   outright guess and maybe not every detail, but you know

          14   the gist of what I'm asking, all right?

          15   A.     Uh-uh.

          16   Q.     You feel comfortable with that?

          17   A.     Yeah.

          18   Q.     You can take a break if you'd like.  I just ask

          19   that if a question is pending, that you wait -- that

          20   you -- that you answer the question before you take that

          21   break, all right?

          22   A.     Yeah.  I don't think we need a break.

          23   Q.     Fine.  But maybe you'll get a phone call or you

          24   need to --

          25   A.     I don't have a phone.
                                                                      9



           1   Q.     All right.  Well, in any event, you are not being

           2   held hostage here today.

           3   A.     Okay.

           4   Q.     Okay?  So if you need to take a bathroom break,

           5   whatever you need to do, stretch your legs, whatever --

           6   A.     We're good.

           7   Q.     -- we can take a break.  I don't expect this to be

           8   very long, okay?  I don't really have many questions for

           9   you.  Keep this in mind:  Number one, have you ever had

          10   your deposition taken before?

          11   A.     No.

          12   Q.     All right.  So this is all new to you, okay?

          13   Right?

          14   A.     Yeah.  It's a little scary, intimidating.

          15   Q.     Don't be.  Just a conversation between me and you,

          16   all right?

          17   A.     Okay.

          18   Q.     I'm just asking you about the accident.  I'm gonna

          19   ask some background stuff about -- about your life, not

          20   many, but it's really just a conversation between me and

          21   you.  The only difference is that we're in a -- you know,

          22   we have a court reporter here.  We're in a conference

          23   room.  But it really is just a conversation, me asking you

          24   questions about this accident.  And then you're done, and

          25   you go on with your life, all right?
                                                                     10



           1   A.     Okay.

           2   Q.     Is there any reason that you can think of that

           3   would give you difficulty in understanding me today and

           4   providing truthful and accurate answers?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     The oath that you took today, do you

           7   understand that that --

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Hold on.  Hold on.  I know you know where I'm

          10   going.

          11                  The oath that you took today, you

          12   understand that's -- that's the kind of oath you -- well,

          13   it is the oath that you would take in a court of law, in

          14   front of judge and/or jury, right?

          15   A.     Correct.

          16   Q.     And that requires you to tell the truth under

          17   penalty of perjury.

          18   A.     Correct.

          19   Q.     Don't feel intimidated by it.  I tell that to

          20   everybody.

          21   A.     Okay.

          22   Q.     Are you on any medications today?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     All right.  Have you reviewed any -- any documents

          25   or -- or things in preparation for this deposition?
                                                                     11



           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     Are you ready to start?

                                                                     12



           1   A.     605 Grand Avenue, which was a rental property at

           2   the time of the accident, and it will be in the spring of

           3   next year.

           4   Q.     All right.  You say "Grand Avenue."  Where's --

           5   where's that located?

           6   A.     Bon Air and Grand, where the accident happened.

           7   Q.     Would that be Havertown Township?

           8   A.     Havertown, PA.

           9   Q.     Havertown, PA or Haverford, PA?

          10   A.     Havertown.

          11   Q.     Havertown.  I'm not familiar with this --

          12   A.     Delaware County.

          13   Q.     Okay.  So nearby, right?  You're not going to

          14   Europe or anything like that?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     All right.  Are you employed?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Have you ever been employed?

          19   A.     Last time I was employed was 2014.

          20   Q.     And what did you do?

          21   A.     I was a -- I worked at the garden center, watering

          22   plants.

          23   Q.     How long did you have that job?

          24   A.     Off and on, 20 years.

          25   Q.     I'm gonna ask you a question I ask every witness,
                                                                     13



           1   okay?  And your attorney is probably gonna ask my client

           2   this.  Have you ever been convicted of a crime of

           3   falsehood or dishonesty within the last four -- ten years?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     All right.  Such things as -- I'll give examples --

           6   forgery, perjury, fraud.

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     Let's just jump right to the day of the accident,

           9   okay?  We agree that it's May 24th, 2018?

          10   A.     I guess.  That's -- would sound right, May 24th.

          11   Q.     Do you disagree with it?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     I'm just going by the police report.  I'm not

          14   trying to trick you.

          15   A.     No.  It's fine, if that's what it says.

          16   Q.     What time of day did this happen?

          17   A.     Around 5:00 o'clock p.m.

          18   Q.     And I understand that the location of this accident

          19   was outside of your residence; is that right?

          20   A.     I was at my house, doing spring cleanup.  I was

          21   there all day, filling trash cans and cutting firewood.

          22   And I was basically there for about seven hours.  And I

          23   was preparing to go up the street --

          24                  MS. KRENICKY:  Listen to what he asked you.

          25                  THE WITNESS:  Oh.
                                                                     14



           1   BY MR. GALLAGHER:

           2   Q.     I'm gonna break it down for you, okay?

           3   A.     I'm sorry.

           4   Q.     It's okay.

           5   A.     I was running -- running off there.

           6   Q.     No.  It's okay.  I know you want to get your story

           7   out.  That's fine.  But I'm -- I'm gonna break it down for

           8   you, and we'll just do it in pieces, okay?

           9   A.     Pieces.

          10   Q.     Right.

          11   A.     What was the question?

          12   Q.     No.  You answered it.

          13   A.     Okay.

          14   Q.     You mentioned that the location of the -- the

          15   impact, that was on Grand Avenue?

          16   A.     No.  It was -- it was on Bon Air.

          17   Q.     It was on Bon Air, okay.  And Bon Air, is that a --

          18   a two-lane street, a one-way street?

          19   A.     I would say it's a three-lane street, one side for

          20   parking, and the other side is for going up and back.

          21   Q.     And say the five minutes before this impact

          22   occurred, where was your vehicle with respect to -- to Bon

          23   Air Avenue?

          24   A.     It was parked on my normal parking spot on Bon Air,

          25   by the bushes.  You know, I think there's a photograph
                                                                     15



           1   somewhere of it.

           2                  MS. KRENICKY:  He's talking about this.

           3                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Yeah.  Can I use this?

           4                  MS. KRENICKY:  Yes.

           5                  THE WITNESS:  That's where I was parked at

           6   this day of the accident.  That's pretty much the same

           7   spot.

           8                  MR. GALLAGHER:  We'll have this marked as

           9   Orner-1.  I do have a copy of this in black and white, but

          10   I'll hand you the -- the color copy.

          11                  (Exhibit Orner-1 marked for

          12   identification.)

          13                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah, that's me.

          14   BY MR. GALLAGHER:

          15   Q.     All right.  Let me ask you some questions.  The

          16   location of your -- your -- is that your truck?

          17   A.     Correct.

          18   Q.     The location of your truck in -- in Orner-1, is

          19   that where it was, say, five minutes before the impact

          20   occurred?

          21   A.     Within a foot or two.

          22   Q.     In the -- roughly the same area, correct?

          23   A.     I park there every time I -- every time I come,

          24   I -- I park there unless there's a car there.

          25   Q.     And the lane of travel directly next to your truck,
                                                                     16



           1   is that to come down the street toward the left of the

           2   photograph?

           3   A.     Correct.

           4   Q.     All right.  And the lane next to that, which I'll

           5   say what would be to the right of -- of the lane we just

           6   spoke about, going up to the right top of the photograph,

           7   is -- is -- is that direction -- the direction for that

           8   lane of travel?

           9   A.     Correct.

          10   Q.     And just to cut to the chase:  My understanding is

          11   that my client's vehicle was traveling in the lane

          12   directly next to your vehicle, heading down toward the

          13   left of the photograph, correct?

          14   A.     Correct.  She came down here and stopped at the

          15   stop sign.

          16   Q.     Right.  And I was gonna get to that.  At this

          17   intersection, I'll call it, there's a stop sign?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     All right.  Is it -- and how many -- I can't tell

          20   from this photograph.  How many lanes of travel are at

          21   this intersection?  Like how many lanes intersect?

          22   A.     It's a four-way -- it's a four-way stop.

          23   Q.     All right.  And that -- that truck, is that a Ford

          24   F-150?

          25   A.     Correct.
                                                                     17



           1   Q.     And according to the police report, it's -- the

           2   year is 1985?

           3   A.     Correct.

           4   Q.     And do you know who took this photograph?

           5   A.     Google.

           6   Q.     All right.  Did you take -- I mean did you take it

           7   from Google, meaning did you --

           8   A.     I --

           9   Q.     -- did you print it out from Google?

          10   A.     Today is the first day I saw that photograph.

          11   Q.     All right.  It appears from this photograph that

          12   there might be some -- and I can't tell if it's a bush in

          13   the background or in your vehicle, but --

          14   A.     Let me see.

          15   Q.     Let's just -- was this taken on the day of the

          16   accident?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Okay.

          19   A.     Can I see it?  No.  There's only a board in the

          20   back.

          21   Q.     Let's -- let's go back to the day of the accident.

          22   Was there debris, material, anything like that in the back

          23   of your vehicle, in the -- in the bed of the truck?

          24   A.     I'm not sure.  I was thinking about that last

          25   night, and I'm really not sure whether there were trash
                                                                     18



           1   cans in the back of the truck or not, because I'd been

           2   cleaning all day and I'd been filling tash cans out.  And

           3   I had a bunch of trash cans over here.

           4                  And usually, what I do is I put them in the

           5   back of the truck, and then I take them to the garden

           6   center because we have a dumpster there.  So I don't know

           7   if I had any in there.  I don't -- I could have put some

           8   in there during the day.  I'm not sure.  I'm not a hundred

           9   percent sure.

          10   Q.     That's fine.  Again, like I said, if you don't

          11   remember --

          12   A.     I'm not -- yeah.  I'm not sure.  I know there was

          13   three over here, but there could have been two in the

          14   back.  Can't -- I can't --

          15   Q.     When you say "back," you mean the back of your

          16   truck, the bed of the truck?

          17   A.     Could have been in the back of the truck, which may

          18   have obstructed my view.

          19   Q.     All right.  That's fine.

          20   A.     I just -- I'm not a hundred percent sure of that.

          21   Q.     It's fine, okay?  Let's go back to the day of the

          22   accident, okay?  Did you have a side-view mirror on each

          23   side of your vehicle, your side and the passenger side?

          24   A.     Yeah, there's -- there's side-view mirrors on both

          25   sides, and then there's the main mirror, which -- which
                                                                     19



           1   would, you know, see through this grate.

           2   Q.     All right.  So you had a -- a driver's side-view

           3   mirror, a passenger side-view mirror, and a rearview

           4   mirror in the -- in the cab of the truck, right?

           5   A.     Correct.  What I did, though, is I turned around

           6   and looked through the grate when I backed up.

           7   Q.     When you say "the grate," what do you mean?

           8   A.     There's a metal grate there in case, you know, like

           9   debris, if you got in an accident, it would come through

          10   the back window and possibly kill you.

          11   Q.     All right.  So the grate --

          12   A.     There's a -- there's a big, metal, black grate.

          13   Q.     The grate protects -- the grate is the rear of the

          14   cab, which protects --

          15   A.     The grate's addition.  It's a metal diamond plate.

          16   Q.     All right.  But I'm just trying to describe for the

          17   record, because I know what it is --

          18   A.     Okay.

          19   Q.     -- you know what it is, but so when we go back and

          20   read it five months from now --

          21   A.     All right.

          22   Q.     -- we know what it is.

          23   A.     Okay.

          24   Q.     You say that it's a grate.  You're saying "grate"?

          25   A.     Yeah.  It's a black diamond -- little diamonds.
                                                                     20



           1   Q.     All right.

           2   A.     Yeah.

           3   Q.     And that protects the -- the window that's behind

           4   the driver and the passenger in the cab, correct?

           5   A.     Yeah.  It protects the passenger against debris.

           6   Q.     And are you able to see from your rearview mirror,

           7   if you're looking through the rearview mirror, through

           8   that grate?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     It doesn't impede your vision at all?

          11   A.     No, but I usually look.  Well, I have a habit of

          12   turning around like this when I back up.

          13   Q.     All right.

          14                  MS. KRENICKY:  Over his shoulder, for the

          15   record.

          16                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Over his right shoulder,

          17   right.

          18                  THE WITNESS:  That's my m.o. with --

          19   BY MR. GALLAGHER:

          20   Q.     Were -- were any of the mirrors that we just

          21   mentioned, the three mirrors, were any of them inoperable

          22   on the day of the accident?

          23   A.     No.  They all work.

          24   Q.     None of them were hanging or broken or --

          25   A.     No, I don't think so.  I mean can you see the

           1   mirrors in that picture?

           2   Q.     Well, no.  And this wasn't taken on the day of the

           3   accident, so it really doesn't matter.

           4   A.     No.  I -- my mirrors are fine.

           5   Q.     Okay.  At any rate, why don't you tell me what you

           6   recall about how the accident occurred.

           7   A.     Well, I got in the truck, and I was gonna back up a

           8   little bit so I could get closer to my trash cans.  And I

           9   was moving probably about two to three miles an hour.  And

          10   I backed up approximately one car length, and that's when

          11   the truck stopped moving.

          12   Q.     Why?

          13   A.     Well, I got out and I -- I saw Carla.

          14   Q.     Did you -- did you -- did you know at that point

          15   when it stopped moving that you had come in contact with

          16   another vehicle?

          17   A.     I never felt contact with another vehicle.  I was

          18   backing up very slowly, and I felt resistance, I would

          19   say.

          20   Q.     When you put the -- your --

          21   A.     It was no -- there was no impact on -- on my part.

          22   Q.     You -- when you put your vehicle in reverse --

          23   A.     I put it in park at that point.

          24   Q.     No.  Look, let me finish.

          25                  MS. KRENICKY:  He's a couple steps earlier.
                                                                     22



           1   BY MR. GALLAGHER:

           2   Q.     I'm going back a little earlier, before the impact.

           3   A.     Okay.

           4   Q.     Car is parked.  You get in.  Did I say "car"?

           5   Truck is parked.  You get in.  You intend to back up.  You

           6   put it in reverse, correct?

           7   A.     Well, I looked first to see if I --

           8   Q.     Just answer my question.  You put it in reverse?

           9   A.     Yeah.

          10   Q.     Did you apply pressure to the gas pedal?

          11   A.     Well, it's -- it's on a hill, but I still needed to

          12   apply a little bit of pressure.

          13   Q.     All right.  So the answer is yes, you did?

          14   A.     Correct, but very little pressure, because I was

          15   backing up.

          16   Q.     All right.  Let's go back again to when you first

          17   got in your truck before the impact.  You said you looked

          18   behind you?

          19   A.     I did.

          20   Q.     How did you look behind you?  What did you do?

          21   A.     Well, as I was getting in the truck, I did a visual

          22   look to see what was going on.  And, you know, I could

          23   see -- I could see -- see, this is open in here.  I could

          24   see -- I could basically see what's going on.

          25                  I jumped in the truck.  I started it, and
                                                                     23



           1   then I paused for a little bit to let it warm up just a

           2   hair.  And then I turned around and looked, and it looked

           3   clear.

           4   Q.     Let me ask you this:  My client is coming from the

           5   right-hand side of the picture, toward the left, correct?

           6   A.     Correct.

           7   Q.     Meaning she would have --

           8   A.     Drove by me.

           9   Q.      -- driven by you?

          10   A.     Correct.

          11   Q.     Meaning you would have been looking in the

          12   direction she would be coming from; is that correct?

          13   A.     That's correct.

          14   Q.     All right.  Did you -- at any point before impact,

          15   did you see my client's vehicle?

          16   A.     No, never saw it.

          17   Q.     Now let's go back again.  You said you looked back?

          18   A.     I did look back.

          19   Q.     All right.  You look back -- you looked at your

          20   general surroundings before you got in your truck,

          21   correct?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     And you did not see my client's vehicle at that

          24   point?

          25   A.     I never saw -- I never saw her vehicle.
                                                                     24



           1   Q.     All right.  And you got in your truck, and then you

           2   said you looked back.  How did you look back, driver's

           3   side mirror, rearview mirror, passenger side mirror, all

           4   three?

           5   A.     Arm on the bench seat, and I turned and looked

           6   through the rear window.

           7   Q.     And you saw nothing at that point?

           8   A.     I didn't see her car.

           9   Q.     Again, but you don't recall whether or not there

          10   were some trash cans in the back of your vehicle?

          11   A.     I don't know.

          12   Q.     But it's possible?

          13   A.     It's very possible.

          14   Q.     Nevertheless, you never saw my client's vehicle?

          15   A.     I never saw her vehicle --

          16   Q.     And then you --

          17   A.     -- nor -- nor did I see her pass me.

          18   Q.     Right.  We got that.  Then you back up, and then

          19   you feel resistance?

          20   A.     I back up approximately ten feet, at a very slow

          21   rate.  And then, the truck stops moving.

          22   Q.     What did you do next?

          23   A.     Put it in park, got out, and saw her car and -- and

          24   her outside of the vehicle, standing by the -- her door --

          25   passenger door or whatever.
                                                                     25



           1   Q.     At that point, did you go around and -- and take

           2   a -- a visual, a look at where the vehicles came in

           3   contact?

           4   A.     At that point, she said that I ran into her -- or

           5   that I hit her.  And I decided I would go and look.  I

           6   wasn't sure.

           7   Q.     So your answer is yes, you went and looked?

           8   A.     I went and looked.

           9   Q.     At that point, what did you see when you looked?

          10   A.     I saw my truck alongside of her car, alongside of

          11   it, not behind it.

          12   Q.     When you say "your truck," tell me, in your words,

          13   what part of your truck was in contact with her vehicle.

          14   A.     My bumper was in contact with her rear taillight

          15   maybe.

          16   Q.     What part of your bumper, driver's side, middle, or

          17   passenger side bumper of your vehicle?

          18   A.     The passenger side bumper was -- was making contact

          19   with her rear panel.

          20   Q.     Rear panel.  What side of her vehicle?

          21   A.     Passenger side on her car.

          22   Q.     After you saw that, what did you do?

          23   A.     Well, I wasn't sure how -- how, you know, much

          24   damage there may have been, so I decided to move my truck

          25   back into my parking spot.
                                                                     26



           1   Q.     Take it a step back.  When -- before you did that,

           2   and you're taking the first visual of the contact of --

           3   between your vehicle and my client's vehicle, what damage,

           4   if any, did you see?

           5   A.     No damage.

           6   Q.     None at all?

           7   A.     No damage.

           8   Q.     All right.  So then you -- I think you said you --

           9   you went around and got back in your vehicle?

          10   A.     Well, I told -- I told Carla that I was gonna move

          11   the truck back into my parking spot.

          12   Q.     And did you do that?

          13   A.     I did that.

          14   Q.     And what happened, if anything, when you did that?

          15   A.     The bumper came off of her vehicle.

          16   Q.     All right.  We're gonna have marked collectively --

          17   I'll have these marked collectively as Orner-2.  But

          18   before I do that, I'm gonna ask you this:  After you moved

          19   your vehicle back to the parking spot and you said that

          20   the bumper of her vehicle came off, did -- at any point

          21   after that, did you go outside of your vehicle and take a

          22   look at my client's vehicle?

          23   A.     Oh, yeah.  When I got -- when I parked the vehicle,

          24   I got out, and that's clearly the damage that's in the

          25   picture.
                                                                     27

           2   identification.)

           3   BY MR. GALLAGHER:

           4   Q.     And now I'm gonna show you four photographs which

           5   we had marked as Orner-4 (sic).  And take -- just take a

           6   moment and don't say anything.  Just look at them.

           7                  MR. GALLAGHER:  You have them.  You gave

           8   them to me.

           9                  MS. KRENICKY:  I have them.  I have some...

          10                  THE WITNESS:  Were these taken at the --

          11                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Well, just -- just take a

          12   look at them.

          13                  THE WITNESS:  They're all the same,

          14   basically.  I don't know what this one is.

          15                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Don't say anything, 'cause

          16   your attorney is gonna get mad at you.

          17                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I'm not saying

          18   anything.

          19                  MS. KRENICKY:  Just look.

          20                  THE WITNESS:  I'm looking.

          21                  MR. GALLAGHER:  Tell me when you're -- tell

          22   me when you're -- you're comfortable to ask -- to answer a

          23   question.

          24                  THE WITNESS:  All right.  Go ahead.

          25   BY MR. GALLAGHER:
                                                                     28



           1   Q.     All right.  When you got out of your vehicle after

           2   pulling into your parking space and you went and looked at

           3   my client's vehicle, is this the damage that you -- you

           4   saw to her vehicle?

           5   A.     Yeah.  This looks exactly -- I mean I don't know if

           6   this is Grand and Bon Air.

           7   Q.     I didn't ask that.  Just listen to my question.  Is

           8   that the damage you saw to my client's vehicle when you

           9   got out the second time from your vehicle?

          10   A.     Yeah.  Sounds right.

          11   Q.     That's all I have for you for these -- these

          12   photographs.  All right.

          13                  Other than the -- the -- I'll say

          14   conversation or -- or words exchanged that you've already

          15   spoke about between yourself and my client, was anything

          16   else said between you and my client at any point at the

          17   accident scene?

          18   A.     Yeah, there was things said.

          19   Q.     What -- what happened?  Tell me what was said.

          20   A.     Well, she said that I hit her vehicle.  She said

          21   that she tried to beep and use the horn, I guess, to warn

          22   me.  I told her that I didn't hear the horn.  I told her I

          23   never saw her and that I was sorry that I backed into her.

          24   Q.     You talked about a horn.  Are you saying today you

          25   never heard a horn --
                                                                     29



           1   A.     Never heard a horn --

           2   Q.     -- beep?

           3   A.     -- nope.  She said she had hit the horn though.

           4   Q.     Do you recall giving a statement to the insurance

           5   company at some point following this accident -- to your

           6   insurance company?

           7   A.     I called when I got home.  And they asked me a

           8   bunch of stuff and said that they would --

           9   Q.     Do you recall -- okay.

          10   A.     -- write an accident --

          11   Q.     Do you recall -- do you recall speaking to a -- a

          12   man named Chris at the insurance company?

          13   A.     I don't know his name.

          14   Q.     Do you recall -- so this conversation -- well, let

          15   me ask you this:  This conversation you had when you got

          16   home with the insurance company, was it your understanding

          17   it was being recorded?

          18   A.     Probably.

          19   Q.     Well, "probably" is not an answer.  Is it "yes,"

          20   "no," "I don't know"?

          21   A.     I don't know.

          22   Q.     All right.  Did they inform you -- let me -- it's a

          23   different question but kind of the same.  I just want to

          24   make sure:  Did they inform you -- do you recall being

          25   informed that it was being recorded?
                                                                     30



           1   A.     I don't remember.

           2   Q.     At any rate, on page two --

           3                  MR. GALLAGHER:  What we'll have marked as

           4   Orner-3, by the way.

           5                  (Exhibit Orner-3 marked for

           6   identification.)

           7   BY MR. GALLAGHER:

           8   Q.     At line 51, your answer to a question was:

           9                  "I didn't see her.  I started -- I backed

          10   out of the spot, and she said she beeped the horn.  Umm.

          11                  "QUESTION:  Uh-huh.

          12                  "ANSWER:  I heard a horn.  I looked again

          13   and I still couldn't see her, because I'm in a truck and

          14   she's in this little car."

          15                  After we -- after me having read that to

          16   you, what I'm gonna purport is a statement provided by

          17   your attorney in your responses to my discovery request,

          18   do you still maintain today that you never heard a horn?

          19   A.     I didn't hear a horn.

          20   Q.     All right.  So that's -- that sentence I just read

          21   of your recorded statement, that's incorrect?

          22   A.     That's -- that's got to be a -- a misstatement.  I

          23   never heard a horn.

          24   Q.     All right.  On page 14 of this -- of the recorded

          25   statement that we're -- we're speaking about, at line --
                                                                     31



           1   at line 565, your answer to a question about the accident

           2   was:

           3                  "She chose -- she chose -- she -- she --

           4   she saw me backing up, and she -- and she chose to use the

           5   horn.

           6                  "QUESTION:  So she did honk the horn?

           7                  "ANSWER:  She honked the horn, correct.

           8                  "QUESTION:  And you did hear it?

           9                  "ANSWER:  I heard a horn, and I looked

          10   around, and I still didn't see her."

          11   A.     I don't --

          12   Q.     Hold on.

          13                  "QUESTION:  Okay.

          14                  "ANSWER:  I looked.  I looked both ways and

          15   I didn't see anything.  I'm like, What -- what is this

          16   horn thing going on?"

          17                  All right.  So now we've talked about two

          18   instances where you discuss a horn, the second one at

          19   length, in this recorded statement.  And so as you sit

          20   here today, you're still saying you didn't hear a horn?

          21   A.     I don't remember hearing a horn.  I remember her

          22   telling me she honked the horn.  That's why the horn thing

          23   is in -- in my head, because she said she was honking the

          24   horn.  I don't remember hearing the horn.  Usually, if I

          25   hear a horn, I hit the brakes immediately.
                                                                     32



           1   Q.     But would you agree with me that these questions

           2   and answers I just read to you, they -- the questions and

           3   answers I just read to you reflect that you did hear a

           4   horn that day?  I mean just from what I read.

           5   A.     I disagree.

           6   Q.     All right.

           7   A.     I disagree.

           8   Q.     And this was given --

           9   A.     This was --

          10   Q.     This was given the day of the accident, this

          11   statement?

          12   A.     This was after the accident.

          13   Q.     But the same day, this statement was given?

          14   A.     Yeah, I think it was the same day.

          15   Q.     All right.

          16   A.     It was after the accident.  I don't remember

          17   hearing a horn.  I brought the horn up because she told me

          18   she was hitting the horn.  Maybe I misspoke to the

          19   Progressive guy about the horn, but I don't remember

          20   hearing a horn and I don't remember seeing her.

          21                  I didn't see her drive by me.  I never saw

          22   her at the -- at the intersection.  The only -- the first

          23   time I knew she was there is when the truck stopped.

          24   Q.     All right.  Let me ask you this.  I'm just gonna

          25   get to the end point here.  Do you admit that it was your
                                                                     33



           1   fault, this impact?

           2                  MS. KRENICKY:  I'll object to the form.

           3                  You can answer.

           4                  THE WITNESS:  I believe it is my -- was my

           5   fault, and I even told her that at the accident, because

           6   she was upset about the accident.  And I said, "I'm sorry.

           7   It was my fault.  I backed into you."

           8                  MR. GALLAGHER:  All right.  That's all the

           9   questions I have.  All right.  Thank you.

          10                  MS. KRENICKY:  That's it.

          11                  (Witness excused.)

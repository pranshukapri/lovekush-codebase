             3                     DONALD RAY LOOPER,

             4  having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:

             5                        EXAMINATION

             6  BY MR. WAWRO:

             7      Q.   Good morning, Mr. Looper.  Can you give your

             8  full name for the record, please?

             9      A.   Donald Ray Looper.

            10      Q.   And where do you work?

            11      A.   At Looper Goodwine.

            12      Q.   And you have been tendered as an expert witness

            13  in the case on behalf of the defendant, correct?

            14      A.   On behalf of NRP, yeah.

            15      Q.   Yeah.  Have you ever testified before?

            16      A.   I have testified before.

            17      Q.   In what circumstances?

            18      A.   As a witness.

            19      Q.   Expert witness or fact witness?

            20      A.   Well, both.  I mean, I have testified as a fact

            21  witness; and they also qualified me as a expert on

            22  certain issues.

            23      Q.   And what was the subject matter of your

            24  expertise in that other matter?

            25      A.   It was corporate law.  I think it was only



                                                                       5

             1  once, and it was a corporate law matter related to the

             2  dissolution of a company and whether the -- what the

             3  extent of liability was for the transferees under the

             4  dissolution matter.

             5      Q.   And what was the name of that case?

             6      A.   I am trying to remember.  Forrest Wynn was the

             7  lawyer, so you could ask him; but I've forgotten the

             8  name of the company.

             9      Q.   And had you been involved in the transaction

            10  that that lawsuit was about where you gave testimony?

            11      A.   Yes.

            12      Q.   In what capacity?

            13      A.   I was the lawyer for the party that was being

            14  liquidated.  I've just forgotten the name of the

            15  company.

            16      Q.   And what was the nature of the lawsuit?

            17      A.   There were five or six partners that hired us,

            18  hired Looper Goodwine, to represent them in drafting a

            19  limited liability company agreement.  Excuse me.

            20                One of the parties was from Equatorial

            21  Guinea.  And I've forgotten whether he was a US citizen

            22  or not, but he was in the US routinely.

            23                But they -- it was our understanding that

            24  they all got together and decided to make the investment

            25  in an oil well.  The -- and then we drafted the LLC



                                                                       6

             1  agreement.

             2                One of them, the guy from Equatorial

             3  Guinea contended that he was sold a limited liability

             4  company agreement.  The jury agreed with him.  But it

             5  was as a result of certain emails that were exchanged

             6  before the -- before he signed the contract.

             7      Q.   Was that lawsuit in state court or federal

             8  court?

             9      A.   State court.

            10      Q.   Here in Harris County?

            11      A.   Yes.

            12      Q.   Do you remember who the judge was or what the

            13  court was?

            14      A.   Judge Baker.

            15      Q.   Caroline Baker?

            16      A.   Yes.

            17      Q.   And how long ago was that case?

            18      A.   Two or three years ago.

            19      Q.   Your resume is attached as part of your report

            20  in this case, correct?

            21      A.   Yes.

            22      Q.   That testimony as an expert is not listed on

            23  your resume, is it?

            24      A.   That's correct.  It was not a significant

            25  transaction.



                                                                       7

             1      Q.   And what was the nature of your opinion in that

             2  case insofar as it involved expert opinion?

             3      A.   For the expert part of the opinion, it had to

             4  deal -- do with the exposure of a transferee.  Part of

             5  the case dealt with a deposit of escrowed funds into --

             6  into our law firm account.  And I had -- the factual

             7  part was we had agreed to hold the money for the other

             8  five in this escrow until the other guy had agreed to

             9  this additional payment, working interest payment.

            10                And the -- I told all of them we would

            11  give the money back to them.  It wasn't in the company.

            12  We would give the money back to them if the last guy

            13  didn't come in with his working interest share.  He

            14  didn't, so we gave the money back.  That was the factual

            15  part of the testimony.

            16                On the legal side -- the company then

            17  dissolved, I believe.  And then the legal piece of it

            18  was what is the liability exposure for the transferees

            19  of any money that came out of the liquidation.

            20      Q.   And you had in the underlying transaction

            21  represented the liquidee?

            22      A.   Yes.

            23      Q.   And you don't remember the name of that

            24  company?

            25      A.   Yeah.  Just right now I just can't remember the



                                                                       8

             1  name of that company.

             2      Q.   And who were the other parties?  Do you

             3  remember any of them?

             4      A.   Yes.  The -- one of the partners was Kevin

             5  Diber.  One of the partners was -- I think his name was

             6  Friedman.  He was from Israel.  Another partner was from

             7  Morocco.  And right now I can't remember his -- I'm just

             8  drawing a blank on his name right now.

             9      Q.   And Kevin Diber, how do you spell his name?

            10      A.   D-i-b-e-r.

            11      Q.   Diber, okay.

            12      A.   And then the -- the party that brought the --

            13  the mineral property to the table and was the operator,

            14  I've forgotten his name as well.

            15      Q.   Okay.

            16      A.   I'm sorry, I can't -- you know, if I could pull

            17  the file, I could look at their names quickly.

            18      Q.   You could get that information from the files

            19  you maintain at Looper Goodwine?

            20      A.   Yes.

            21                MR. WAWRO:  And I'd request that we get

            22  that information.

            23                MR. PATRICK:  We'll look into it.

            24      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Did you give a deposition in

            25  that case?



                                                                       9

             1      A.   I don't believe I did.  I don't -- I don't

             2  remember one.

             3      Q.   If there is a transcript of either a

             4  deposition, if you did give one, and the trial

             5  testimony, we'd request that to be produced to us.

             6      A.   Okay.

             7      Q.   What was your opinion in that case?

             8      A.   The opinion for the expert opinion?

             9      Q.   The -- the expert opinion that you gave.

            10      A.   The transferee liability, the State of Texas

            11  has a two-year statute -- I believe that's right -- for

            12  extending to the liability of the transferees.  So a --

            13  a party has two years if they object to the distribution

            14  that's going out to those party -- the party has two

            15  years to go at them.  But their exposure is limited to

            16  the amount of the interest or property that they

            17  received.

            18      Q.   And that expertise was -- how would you

            19  characterize the area of law that that expertise applied

            20  to?

            21      A.   Corporate law.

            22      Q.   Just generally corporate law?

            23      A.   Yeah.

            24      Q.   Not fraudulent transfer?

            25      A.   No.



                                                                      10

             1      Q.   Do you recall whether anyone was asserting in

             2  that case that the transfer of funds was a fraudulent

             3  transfer?

             4      A.   Their lawyer alleged virtually everything, so

             5  I'm not -- she may have.

             6      Q.   Okay.

             7      A.   She may have the --

             8      Q.   Who was the lawyer on the other side?

             9      A.   I've forgotten her name as well.

            10      Q.   Okay.  Let me hand you what we've marked as

            11  Exhibit 182.

            12                (Exhibit 182 marked.)

            13      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And is that a copy of a report

            14  you prepared for this case?

            15      A.   Okay.

            16      Q.   And is that a copy of a report you prepared for

            17  the case?

            18                I'm sorry.  Is that a -- I didn't --

            19      A.   Oh.

            20      Q.   -- hear the answer.

            21      A.   I didn't hear a question.

            22      Q.   Yeah.  Is that a copy of the report you

            23  prepared for this case?

            24      A.   Yes.

            25      Q.   Okay.  Thank you.



                                                                      11

             1                Going back to the matter in which you

             2  testified in part as an expert.  Is it listed or

             3  referred to anywhere on the resume that's attached here?

             4  There's a section on your resume called Representative

             5  Experience, for example.

             6      A.   Yes.

             7      Q.   Is it anywhere touched on in there --

             8      A.   No.

             9      Q.   -- or elsewhere in your resume?

            10      A.   (Witness shakes head.)

            11      Q.   Okay.  And had you advised the company that was

            12  liquidated with respect to the issues that you later

            13  testified about?

            14      A.   Yes.

            15      Q.   Okay.  And who -- at the time you testified in

            16  that case, who controlled the privilege for that

            17  company?

            18      A.   The --

            19                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

            20      A.   -- limited liability company.

            21      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  The liquidee?

            22      A.   Yes.

            23      Q.   The same management in liquidation that it had

            24  when you were advising it?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                      12

             1      Q.   Okay.  And did -- was there a person who had

             2  authority to waive the privilege?

             3                MR. PATRICK:  Form.

             4      A.   Certainly there was a person who had the

             5  authority to waive the privilege.

             6      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And do you remember who that

             7  was?

             8                MR. PATRICK:  Form.

             9      A.   It would have been the, you know, Kevin Diber

            10  was the senior with the -- I've forgotten whether it was

            11  manager managed the LLC or member managed, but Kevin

            12  Diber was, as I recall, the president of the company but

            13  a senior executive officer.

            14      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Could you have given the

            15  testimony that you did give either as a fact witness or

            16  as an expert witness without the entity you advised

            17  waiving the privilege?

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Form.

            19      A.   I could not have given the testimony about the

            20  factual circumstances and the legal advice if they had

            21  not waived the privilege.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.

            23      A.   That's right.

            24      Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

            25                So in forming opinions about this case,



                                                                      13

             1  you say in your report that you're basing it -- your

             2  opinion on your experience as a tax and transactional

             3  attorney with expertise negotiating and drafting earnout

             4  provisions and so forth.

             5      A.   (Witness nods head.)

             6      Q.   You know that?

             7      A.   Yes.

             8                MR. PATRICK:  Form.

             9      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  So here's my question, because

            10  I don't want to get -- make life uncomfortable for you,

            11  but I take it that you're not going to be able to tell

            12  me specifics about the basis of that expertise unless

            13  some other client waives the privilege with respect to

            14  what you discuss with them and why.

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Form.

            16      A.   That would be -- that would be correct.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.

            18      A.   The only thing that I'm pausing on is that one

            19  of those companies has now been sold and the owner

            20  deceased.  So it's possible that there is no one to

            21  claim a privilege any longer, but -- and certainly, they

            22  wouldn't mind if I discussed it, but...

            23      Q.   You're talking about --

            24      A.   Any --

            25      Q.   -- the -- the case you testified in before?



                                                                      14

             1      A.   No.  No.  An earnout clause.

             2      Q.   So there's just one instance of working on an

             3  earnout clause?

             4      A.   No.  One instance where -- the question is --

             5  your question related to whether I would -- could reveal

             6  privileged communication.  And I'm -- I'm just thinking

             7  that that would be true on all of them except

             8  possibly --

             9      Q.   Except possibly?

            10      A.   -- one that was where the owner is deceased,

            11  the company was sold.  And now even that company is no

            12  longer in existence.

            13      Q.   But as to the rest of the basis of your

            14  experience, the privilege would prevent me from getting

            15  into specifics with you?

            16                MR. PATRICK:  Form.

            17      A.   Yes.  Specific as to parties' names, yes.

            18      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Right.  And I ask that because

            19  I'm -- I'm not supposed to ask questions that call for

            20  the disclosure of privileged information, and I'm going

            21  to try to avoid doing that because I understand the

            22  situation you're in.

            23                If, however, inadvertently I do do that,

            24  please just call it to my attention, let me know that

            25  I've done that.



                                                                      15

             1      A.   Okay.

             2      Q.   All right?

             3      A.   I mean, if you guys can agree -- if we discuss

             4  through the privilege -- I don't mind talking about the

             5  one where the man is deceased.  But -- but the rest of

             6  them they're like -- they would be either ongoing

             7  companies or --

             8      Q.   Which is the one where the person is deceased?

             9      A.   Steve Turner is the man that died.

            10      Q.   And is the -- the work you did with respect to

            11  Mr. Turner in an earnout provision, is that referred to

            12  on your resume?

            13      A.   You have looked at it since I have, so, and...

            14                No, it's not.

            15      Q.   Okay.  While you've got the resume there, can

            16  you point me to those listed aspects of your experience

            17  that did involve a negotiation of an earnout provision?

            18      A.   The second one, the Mexico project.  The -- I

            19  mean, the general reference to the private equity

            20  projects, I mean, I don't name the client, but one of

            21  those had earnouts in some of their deals.

            22                For Jala Group, we were negotiating one

            23  that the deal fell through, so the contract was never

            24  entered.

            25      Q.   I'm trying to find that one.  Oh.



                                                                      16

             1      A.   It's midway down on the right side.

             2      Q.   You checked --

             3      A.   Where it references Gowan and Jala Group.

             4      Q.   Understood.  Okay.

             5      A.   The Hamburg refinery was sort of.  It was more

             6  -- it was sort of an earnout, but it was related

             7  exclusively to environmental liability.  Yeah, I mean,

             8  that's all that are listed on here.

             9      Q.   Were there others than those that are listed --

            10      A.   Yes.

            11      Q.   -- that you worked on that had earnout

            12  provisions?

            13      A.   Yes.

            14      Q.   Okay.  So going back to the first one, you say

            15  there was an earnout provision involved in your

            16  representation of a private equity funded management

            17  team in 2016 to pursue midstream projects in Mexico,

            18  right?

            19      A.   Okay.

            20      Q.   Who did you represent in a transaction that

            21  involved an earnout provision with respect to that

            22  engagement?

            23                MR. PATRICK:  Caution the witness not to

            24  reveal privileged information of those clients.

            25      A.   Actually, the -- the one -- the one in Mexico



                                                                      17

             1  that I was thinking about is actually when I saw it is

             2  over here on the CPC Mexico pipe project that had a more

             3  formal earnout.  The one in 2016 was a management team

             4  waterfall type structure.

             5                So you -- you may or may not think of that

             6  as an earnout because it wasn't a sale and earnout.  It

             7  was more of a private equity waterfall --

             8      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.

             9      A.   -- in the sense of their -- their earnings were

            10  going to depend -- their revenue is going to depend upon

            11  the success of the venture.

            12                And I represented the management team.

            13      Q.   And who was on the other side of that?

            14                MR. PATRICK:  Same admonition not to

            15  reveal privileged information of those clients.

            16                THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

            17      A.   VE represented the private equity fund out of

            18  London, and I was representing the management team.

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And describe the earnout

            20  provision or what you characterize as somewhat like an

            21  earnout provision.

            22      A.   This -- this was more of a waterfall provision

            23  where their earnings are going to -- their compensation

            24  is going -- their interest in the transaction is going

            25  to depend upon the success.  That's why I said it.  You



                                                                      18

             1  might not characterize that as a earnout similar to this

             2  transaction.

             3      Q.   But do -- do you think it's an earnout similar

             4  to this transaction?

             5      A.   It is -- it's a transaction that is -- instead

             6  of a -- this particular transaction is a sale and

             7  determining the purchase price of the sale.  That type

             8  of transaction is a mutual investment, and their share

             9  increases based upon the earnings of the company.

            10      Q.   All right.  Were there any contingent

            11  provisions in that earnout or waterfall provision that

            12  you worked on negotiating?

            13      A.   Continued employment.

            14      Q.   Pardon me?

            15      A.   Continued employment.

            16      Q.   That was the only contingency?

            17      A.   Yes.

            18      Q.   Was there a term to the provision?

            19      A.   Yes, but I've forgotten if it was three or five

            20  years.

            21      Q.   And is that a -- is that provision contained in

            22  an agreement that memorialized the transaction that's

            23  written?

            24      A.   Yes.

            25      Q.   And is that something that you can provide me?



                                                                      19

             1      A.   No.

             2      Q.   Because it's privileged?

             3      A.   Yes.

             4      Q.   Okay.  And then you -- when we started talking

             5  about that, you said you were -- you'd actually been

             6  thinking about a different company.  Is that the CNPC

             7  one at the bottom?

             8      A.   No.  It's the CPC Mexico pipe project.

             9      Q.   Oh, I see, on the -- on the second page --

            10      A.   Yeah.

            11      Q.   -- or third page of your resume, I see, where

            12  it says -- let me find it again -- M&A and corporate

            13  divisions, including CPC Mexico pipe manufacturing,

            14  1994.  Is that the one?

            15      A.   Yes.

            16      Q.   Okay.  So tell me about the earnout provision

            17  there.

            18      A.   I mean, I don't remember a lot about it.  It

            19  was Chevron Phillips Chemical Company buying a pipe

            20  facility down in Mexico, but I don't remember a lot

            21  about the details of the -- of the transaction.  But I

            22  recall it had an earnout to it as to what the purchase

            23  price was going to be.

            24      Q.   And who did you represent?

            25      A.   Chevron Phillips Chemical.



                                                                      20

             1      Q.   And that transaction was in 1994?

             2      A.   Yes.

             3      Q.   Okay.  How did that earnout provision work?

             4      A.   I don't remember the details of it.

             5      Q.   Was it based on revenues, earnings or some

             6  other metric?

             7      A.   I do not remember the details of it.

             8      Q.   Did it have any contingencies in it?

             9      A.   I don't remember the details of it.

            10      Q.   Do you have access to a copy of the document

            11  memorializing the earnout provision?

            12      A.   No.

            13      Q.   Is that when you were at a different firm?

            14      A.   Yes.

            15      Q.   Which firm?

            16      A.   Looper Reed.

            17      Q.   What happened to the files of Looper Reed?

            18      A.   That one, I'd have no idea because they've --

            19  Chevron Phillips is gone.  I think they were bought, and

            20  then the clients that came with us to Looper Goodwine

            21  came with us.  But this one was not a ongoing client.

            22      Q.   Okay.  Another one you said involved -- that

            23  you list on your resume that involved an earnout

            24  provision was a private equity project finance for

            25  either a marina company or an amusement park.  Which



                                                                      21

             1  one?

             2      A.   Well, the -- the -- the client is an existing

             3  company in Houston, and I no longer represent them.  So

             4  I'm really not going to talk about that.

             5      Q.   Oh, because you view that as confidential --

             6      A.   Yeah.

             7      Q.   -- information that you --

             8      A.   Yes.

             9      Q.   -- can't reveal?

            10      A.   Yes.

            11      Q.   Okay.

            12      A.   The only one that I can think of that I

            13  wouldn't have a privilege on is the one with Steve

            14  Turner's company, and I could -- I mean, they -- they

            15  would not care.  The daughter, who is now the owner, and

            16  they wouldn't care at all if I revealed everything about

            17  that transaction, but...

            18      Q.   Okay.  I'll get to that in a second, but I want

            19  to keep going through.

            20                You said you also worked on an earnout

            21  provision involving tax planning for Jala Group?

            22      A.   Yeah.  We -- we were looking at buying a

            23  telephone company in Bolivia, and the -- the transaction

            24  didn't go through.  But the earnout was where we had

            25  gotten to in the negotiations trying to reach agreement



                                                                      22

             1  on that.

             2                And then it would have involved a use of a

             3  direct hardwired internet line from the ocean floor.

             4  And in the middle of that -- going through Chile.

             5                And then in the middle of it, Peru entered

             6  a contract with the state telephone company and to use

             7  their direct link and so our client backed out of the

             8  transaction.

             9      Q.   Okay.  I may have misunderstood something you

            10  said earlier about it.  You had gotten to the point of

            11  negotiating an earnout provision when your client backed

            12  out of the transaction?

            13      A.   Yes.

            14      Q.   Did they back out in part because they couldn't

            15  come to terms on an earnout provision?

            16      A.   No.  They backed out because the -- it was no

            17  longer going to be cost effective to pay to buy the

            18  direct link to the internet from the ocean floor.

            19      Q.   So did that earnout provision get fully

            20  negotiated before they --

            21      A.   No.

            22      Q.   -- backed out?

            23      A.   No.

            24      Q.   Okay.  You also mentioned the experience

            25  involving a Hamburg refinery, an acquisition from Esso,



                                                                      23

             1  as involving sort of an earnout provision.

             2      A.   Yeah.  It related to the environmental

             3  liability.  It's -- it's not how -- what you would think

             4  of as an earnout in this transaction, but it related to

             5  what was going to be the exposure.

             6                Exxon contended it was World War II, and

             7  our purchaser contended that it was oil and gas leaks

             8  under the tanks and -- but the -- the issue was almost a

             9  reverse.  That if we -- we got -- our client would get

            10  up to 20 million back if Exxon was not hit for

            11  liability.  So that's kind of a reverse of a -- of an

            12  earnout.

            13      Q.   So describe how that provision worked.

            14      A.   I mean, I don't -- I don't remember a lot of

            15  the details of it.  I remember the transaction well, but

            16  I don't remember the specific details of the -- of the

            17  acquisition.

            18      Q.   In general, it was a provision that called for

            19  the acquirer -- well, who was the acquirer in that?  I'm

            20  sorry.  Withdraw.

            21                Who was the acquirer in that transaction?

            22      A.   A -- Holborn Oil Trading, Ltd.

            23      Q.   Is that who you represented?

            24      A.   Yes.

            25      Q.   And Esso was the seller?



                                                                      24

             1      A.   Yes.

             2      Q.   And the provision that we're talking about

             3  called for a return of some portion of the purchase

             4  price depending on the amount of liability that Esso

             5  experienced?

             6      A.   The provision paid the purchase price, and a

             7  piece of it went into escrow.  And the -- at the end of

             8  the day, if Esso were hit for liability, they would have

             9  gotten that additional 20 million and -- or whatever

            10  piece of it was -- actually had to be paid out as

            11  environmental liability.

            12                And then if there were no liabilities or

            13  not 20 million, then that 20 million would be returned

            14  back to the purchaser.

            15      Q.   Okay.  Do you consider that as an earnout

            16  provision, too?

            17      A.   I mean, you know, an earnout provision is -- is

            18  a -- and the way I understand -- the way we use

            19  typically in negotiating contracts is an earnout

            20  provision is the method by which you end up striking a

            21  -- an arrangement between the buyer and the seller.

            22                When the buyer sees the price, that being

            23  X, and the seller sees -- I mean, the buyer -- the

            24  seller sees it as X and the buyer perceives market or

            25  operations risk, in that case, environmental risk.  But



                                                                      25

             1  that it's a way to create a formula, get the deal closed

             2  and allow both parties to wait on future operations or

             3  market conditions to determine whether -- who was right

             4  on the price.

             5      Q.   So you would consider that an earnout

             6  provision?

             7      A.   I mean, it's -- it's a -- it's a provision, as

             8  I said, in a way that's a reverse earnout.  But it's --

             9  it's a way to create the difference between the buyer's

            10  ask and the seller's belief in what the price should be.

            11      Q.   Was there a term to that provision in the --

            12      A.   Yes.

            13      Q.   -- refinery acquisition?

            14      A.   And that was a long time ago, but I think it

            15  was 10 years.  But it was -- it was a long term.

            16      Q.   Were there contingencies included in the

            17  provision?

            18      A.   There were four reverse contingencies.  But the

            19  one that was really significant was that if the -- if

            20  our client, the purchaser, was able to obtain from the

            21  government of Germany a release of Esso Argon, then the

            22  remaining amount in the escrow would be returned.

            23      Q.   Okay.  That was one contingency.  What were the

            24  other contingencies?

            25      A.   I've forgotten what the others were.  They were



                                                                      26

             1  all things that were insisted by the seller that

             2  basically was impossible to achieve, but the one was

             3  very significant.  I remember it well because it was a

             4  very hard fought issue that we ended up resolving in the

             5  US.

             6      Q.   In what sense were the other ones impossible to

             7  achieve?

             8      A.   You know, I mean, I don't really recall what

             9  they were; but it would be like an example, proving that

            10  there's no environmental liability, there's no

            11  environmental exposure, you know, things that you could

            12  never do.

            13                But I don't remember now what -- exactly

            14  what the -- I just remember there were three, and the

            15  one that we fought for very hard was the one that we

            16  ended up succeeding on.

            17      Q.   And is that a -- is the document memorializing

            18  that transaction something you can provide to me?

            19      A.   No.

            20      Q.   Why not?

            21      A.   Because I don't have it.

            22      Q.   Who -- who were you working for at the time you

            23  negotiated that?

            24      A.   Holborn Oil Trading, Ltd.

            25      Q.   I'm sorry.  What -- what law firm were you



                                                                      27

             1  working for?

             2      A.   Looper Reed.

             3      Q.   Do you know --

             4      A.   Looper Reed McGraw.

             5      Q.   But you have not kept that document?

             6      A.   No.

             7      Q.   Okay.  And then you mentioned the case

             8  involving Steve Turner.

             9      A.   I will -- I will say I don't think I have it.

            10      Q.   Will you check for me and let me know?

            11      A.   Yes, I'll see if I can find that.

            12      Q.   Great.

            13                You then mentioned --

            14      A.   Can you --

            15      Q.   You then mentioned a --

            16      A.   If this whole day is going to go this way, I'm

            17  not going to remember that, you know what I mean.

            18      Q.   You mentioned a matter involving Steve

            19  Turner --

            20      A.   Yes.

            21      Q.   -- involving an earnout provision.

            22                Tell me a little bit more about what that

            23  transaction is.

            24      A.   I actually think if you will let me make a

            25  phone call right now, I will get their approval to



                                                                      28

             1  discuss that transaction with the client if you want

             2  me --

             3      Q.   Why don't we --

             4      A.   -- to do that.  But I don't think I should do

             5  it before calling them.

             6      Q.   Fair enough.  We'll come back to that.  We'll

             7  take a break at some --

             8      A.   Okay.

             9      Q.   You know, not too long from now, and you can

            10  try that.

            11      A.   Yeah.  I'm sure they -- they wouldn't object.

            12      Q.   Okay.  But don't let me forget to come back to

            13  that.

            14      A.   Okay.  I'll put that on his list.

            15      Q.   Okay.  On page 3 of your report, which is

            16  Exhibit 182, I'd like to ask you a question about a few

            17  things you say there.

            18                In the third full paragraph, the third

            19  sentence says, "Additional bases for my opinions may

            20  exist beyond those specifically described in this

            21  report."

            22                Do you know of any at this point?

            23      A.   All I meant by that was -- I think all I meant

            24  by that was I'm not -- I'm not referring -- I mean, take

            25  the Steve Turner example.  I'm not referring to in the



                                                                      29

             1  report my experience, but the experience constitutes the

             2  basis of me reaching the conclusions that I've reached.

             3      Q.   Fair enough.

             4                Here's -- I just want to nail this down,

             5  though.  I reviewed the report, and I hope the report

             6  explains what your opinions are and the bases for your

             7  opinions.

             8                So that sentence made me wonder, well, are

             9  there other bases for your opinion that you know about

            10  that are not described in the report.

            11      A.   Experiences that -- that I've had representing

            12  clients negotiating contracts throughout my career.

            13      Q.   Okay.  And you didn't put those in your report

            14  for what reason?

            15      A.   Those are the basis of my experience in working

            16  for clients.  I don't know how to answer that.

            17      Q.   Okay.  Well, are there opinions you think you

            18  may give at trial that are not described in the report?

            19      A.   No.

            20      Q.   Is there anything you know of now that you

            21  would say to justify your opinions that is not described

            22  in the report?

            23      A.   The experiences that you have in practicing law

            24  and how parties conclude acquisition transactions are

            25  experiences that are not described in the report.



                                                                      30

             1      Q.   Okay.  Why I'm asking the question is, I don't

             2  want to be surprised at trial --

             3      A.   Okay.

             4      Q.   -- by something that you're relying on to make

             5  your point that you haven't told me about.

             6      A.   Okay.

             7      Q.   And the deposition is my chance to find out if

             8  there is anything that isn't in your report that you're

             9  going to say here's a good example of why I'm right, for

            10  example.

            11      A.   Okay.

            12      Q.   So can you think of anything like that now?

            13      A.   Can I think of anything like what?

            14      Q.   That you would point to to say here's why I'm

            15  right about this that isn't in your report.

            16      A.   No.

            17      Q.   Okay.  If you come up with something, will you

            18  make sure your counsel knows so they can let us know

            19  that you've supplemented your opinion?

            20      A.   Yes.

            21      Q.   Your report says your rate is -- your customary

            22  rate is $630 an hour; is that right?

            23      A.   Yes.

            24      Q.   Do you ever charge more than that?

            25      A.   No.



                                                                      31

             1      Q.   Do you ever charge less than that?

             2      A.   No.

             3      Q.   How many hours have you spent so far on this

             4  work?

             5      A.   I did anticipate that question, and now you're

             6  saying so far.  What I anticipated was by the time I

             7  finished the report because that was the question that

             8  your expert was asked.

             9                And it was 38 something hours, plus I had

            10  some -- one of my associates helped me review and

            11  disseminate the documents to get -- so that I was

            12  focused on just the pertinent provisions, and so he had

            13  some additional time.  But mine was about 38 hours by

            14  the time we finished drafting the report.

            15      Q.   Okay.  And the associate who worked on the

            16  report, who was that?

            17      A.   Mark Nawfal, N-a-w-f-a-l.

            18      Q.   And what's his billing rate?

            19      A.   I think it's 410.

            20      Q.   And how much time did he spend up through the

            21  completion of the report?

            22      A.   The total bill was about 60,000.

            23      Q.   Not just for his time but for both of your

            24  time?

            25      A.   I gave you hours on mine.



                                                                      32

             1      Q.   Yeah.

             2      A.   I should have been giving you dollars.  The

             3  dollars on mine was about $38,000, and his were about

             4  22,000.

             5      Q.   And that's through a completion of the report?

             6      A.   Yes.

             7      Q.   Since then, what have you done?

             8      A.   Nothing until this week.  Read the report

             9  again, read Professor Coates' deposition, and then sat

            10  in deposition, prepped.  Warned me of the questions

            11  you're likely to ask.

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Just to put down a marker

            13  here, I'm going to say that's about all the detail I

            14  would like him to go into.  I'm going to object on --

            15                THE WITNESS:  Okay.

            16                MR. PATRICK:  -- privileged grounds beyond

            17  that.

            18                THE WITNESS:  Okay.

            19                MR. PATRICK:  That's all fine.

            20      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  How much time did you spend

            21  since the report until now?  Do you have an idea?

            22      A.   I mean, it would have all been since last

            23  Friday.  I mean, it's not much.  Whatever time between.

            24      Q.   Okay.

            25      A.   I started reading these, the Coates report,



                                                                      33

             1  last Friday.

             2      Q.   Also on page 3 of your report, you say that

             3  your work on -- on this matter is ongoing.

             4                Have you already told me the ongoing work

             5  since the --

             6      A.   Yes.

             7      Q.   -- the date of your report?

             8      A.   Yes, sir.

             9      Q.   And you have read Professor Coates' deposition?

            10      A.   Yes, sir.

            11      Q.   What opinions have you formed about his

            12  deposition?

            13      A.   His deposition was consistent with his expert

            14  report.

            15      Q.   Is that it?

            16      A.   I mean, I've -- I've told you in my expert

            17  report the disagreements that I -- that the conclusions

            18  that I reach that are different from his.

            19      Q.   Yeah, fair enough.

            20                But in reading the report, you didn't come

            21  up with any opinion about -- I'm sorry.  Withdrawn.

            22                In reading his deposition, you didn't

            23  notice anything where you have an opinion that you

            24  haven't described in your report about his views on this

            25  case?



                                                                      34

             1      A.   No.

             2      Q.   Okay.  Are -- do you have any opinions about

             3  Professor Coates' report that are not recorded in your

             4  report?

             5      A.   I mean, no.  There were some specific

             6  statements that he expanded on that I think are

             7  consistent with his first report and therefore, I think

             8  were covered by my critique or opposition to his

             9  conclusions.

            10      Q.   Okay.  So you're talking again about the

            11  deposition now.  So I'll --

            12      A.   Yes.

            13      Q.   -- go back to that then.

            14                So what were the things where you felt he

            15  expanded on what was in his report?

            16      A.   In his report, he continued to use the word

            17  stock as equity ownership interest, and he expanded on

            18  that.  So it's consistent with what he put in his first

            19  expert report.

            20                There was another issue that I thought

            21  that he hammered, but right now I need to go back and

            22  look.  I didn't mark -- mark it as I was reading his

            23  report, but right now I can't remember what it was.  But

            24  it was -- it was not inconsistent with his first report.

            25      Q.   Will you let me know after the deposition what



                                                                      35

             1  that other area is?

             2      A.   Sure.  I'll go --

             3      Q.   Thank you.

             4      A.   -- open the computer when this is over.  And

             5  when we take a break, I'll look it up.

             6      Q.   So then my other question was:  Are there any

             7  opinions you have about Professor Coates' report that

             8  you didn't put in your report?

             9      A.   No.

            10      Q.   Okay.  Have you read the report of another of

            11  the Anadarko experts, a woman named Jane Kidd?

            12      A.   No.

            13      Q.   Okay.  Do you plan to update, revise, refine or

            14  supplement your report?

            15      A.   I have not been asked to do that.

            16      Q.   So you don't plan to do that yourself?

            17      A.   Correct.

            18      Q.   Does Exhibit A to your report list everything

            19  that you reviewed for purposes of giving your opinions?

            20      A.   Yes.

            21      Q.   And how did you decide what to look at?

            22      A.   I'm looking to my counsel to see if any of that

            23  is privileged, but part of that answer --

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Given the Rule 11 agreement

            25  in place in this case, I think I'm going to say that



                                                                      36

             1  process is privileged.

             2                MR. WAWRO:  Okay.

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  What I'm trying to nail down is

             4  the decision about what to look at was not solely your

             5  decision?

             6                MR. PATRICK:  And again, I'm going to

             7  instruct the witness not to answer on the basis of

             8  privilege.

             9                MR. WAWRO:  Okay.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Did you speak with anyone at

            11  NRP in forming your opinions?

            12      A.   No.

            13      Q.   Are there facts about you and your experience

            14  that demonstrate your expertise with respect to the

            15  subject matter of your testimony that are not listed in

            16  your resume that's attached to your report?

            17      A.   Yes.

            18      Q.   Okay.  And some of those we've already gone

            19  over?

            20      A.   More recent ones, yes.

            21      Q.   Okay.  So what would you add to your resume as

            22  illustrating your expertise with respect to the subject

            23  matter that you're opining on in this case?

            24      A.   I mean, you know, I really -- I don't know how

            25  to answer that.



                                                                      37

             1      Q.   Okay.

             2      A.   There's nothing specific, but throughout 40

             3  years, you go through a lot of transactions.

             4      Q.   Have you reviewed the Motions for Summary

             5  Judgment in this case?

             6      A.   Was that on -- I believe that is the only

             7  document that I looked at as far as pleadings.

             8      Q.   I will say this, it's not -- it's not listed --

             9      A.   It's not listed.

            10      Q.   -- anywhere on Exhibit A.

            11      A.   Yeah.  That's for -- that's the reason I was

            12  looking quickly because I don't remember listing that,

            13  but...

            14                No.  So, okay, maybe it was just the

            15  amended petition then is all that I had.

            16                So I think the answer is no, I did not

            17  read the Motion for Summary Judgment.  I don't remember

            18  reading it, no.

            19      Q.   Were you asked to contribute to it?

            20      A.   No.

            21      Q.   In terms of things that have been filed, you

            22  have looked at the amended petition in the case?

            23      A.   Yes.

            24      Q.   You have looked at the protective order or the

            25  Motion for Protective Order?



                                                                      38

             1      A.   No.

             2      Q.   It's listed on Exhibit A.  Do you want to

             3  refresh your recollection?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  We can -- we'll talk about

             5  it at the break, and we can --

             6                THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

             7                MR. PATRICK:  -- go back to the question

             8  if you want.

             9      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But you have also looked at the

            10  defendant's Answer?

            11      A.   Yes.

            12      Q.   Okay.

            13                MR. WAWRO:  Now is a good time to take a

            14  break.

            15                THE WITNESS:  Okay.

            16                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off the record at

            17  10:28 a.m.

            18                (Recess taken from 10:28 a.m. to

            19  10:43 a.m.)

            20                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are on the record at

            21  10:43 a.m.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Mr. Looper, were you able to

            23  get clearance from your client to talk about the other

            24  earnout provision that you mentioned involving Steve

            25  Turner?



                                                                      39

             1      A.   No.  I've called, and I'm going to leave my

             2  phone on.  And -- and they're trying to track down the

             3  CEO of the company is now his daughter.

             4      Q.   Okay.  Until you get that clearance, you can't

             5  tell me anything about it?

             6      A.   Just I would just prefer them saying yes, waive

             7  the privilege and --

             8      Q.   Okay.

             9      A.   -- tell you anything about it.

            10      Q.   Fair enough.

            11                Let me move on, then, and we'll come back

            12  to that if you do get the clearance --

            13      A.   Okay.

            14      Q.   -- to talk about that part of your experience.

            15                You read a number of the depositions in

            16  the case, and they're listed on your report, true?

            17      A.   Yes.  They were all made available to me, yes.

            18      Q.   Okay.  Including Mr. Coates' deposition, which

            19  wasn't listed on your report, but that's because it

            20  hadn't been taken at the time you did your report?

            21      A.   Correct.

            22      Q.   So let me ask you about some of the

            23  circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract.

            24  And can you identify for me what's previously been

            25  marked as Exhibit 48?  But is Exhibit 48 a copy of the



                                                                      40

             1  purchase agreement that you're giving opinions about?

             2      A.   Yes.

             3      Q.   And from your work in the case, can you --

             4  would you agree that this was a contract that was

             5  negotiated at arm's length?

             6      A.   I have no reason to doubt that.

             7      Q.   Did you review depositions about the

             8  negotiation of the contract?

             9      A.   I looked at some parts of the depositions and,

            10  yes, I have no reason to believe that -- both sides were

            11  represented by counsel, and it was an arm's length

            12  transaction.

            13      Q.   And both groups of parties to the case, to the

            14  -- to the transaction were sophisticated parties,

            15  correct?

            16      A.   Correct.

            17                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form to the last

            18  question.

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  They were negotiating a

            20  contract in a commercial mineral extraction context,

            21  correct?

            22      A.   Yes.

            23      Q.   That's what the Trona business is is digging

            24  stuff out of the ground and refining it, true?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                      41

             1      Q.   Now, NRP was represented in the negotiations by

             2  a man named Wyatt Hogan, right?

             3      A.   Yes.  I mean, I don't -- I don't know, I don't

             4  know who was in charge of their negotiations, but I know

             5  he was a man who was deposed, yes.

             6      Q.   From reading his deposition, you know that he

             7  was involved in negotiating the contract, don't you?

             8      A.   Correct.

             9      Q.   Have you ever met Mr. Hogan?

            10      A.   No.

            11      Q.   From reading his deposition, you understand

            12  that he is a trained lawyer, true?

            13      A.   I understand that he was a lawyer.  I don't --

            14  I don't know how much he practiced.  I don't remember.

            15      Q.   But he was trained as a lawyer?

            16      A.   I don't remember that piece of his deposition,

            17  no.

            18      Q.   You understand that he went to law school?

            19      A.   Okay.

            20      Q.   Yes?

            21      A.   I didn't -- no, I didn't -- I didn't pay

            22  attention to that.

            23      Q.   Do you recall from reading his deposition that

            24  he had 15 years of experience in transactional work?

            25      A.   I didn't pay attention to that, no.



                                                                      42

             1      Q.   Did you know from his deposition that he worked

             2  in the corporate departments at both Andrews Kurth --

             3                MR. WAWRO:  We'll take a break.

             4                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off the record at

             5  10:47 a.m.

             6                (Recess taken from 10:47 a.m. to

             7  10:51 a.m.)

             8                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're on the record at

             9  10:51 a.m.

            10                MR. WAWRO:  Thank you.

            11      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Mr. Looper, I take it that was

            12  a call from your client?

            13      A.   It was.

            14      Q.   And have you got clearance to discuss --

            15      A.   I do.

            16      Q.   -- the transaction?

            17      A.   I do.

            18      Q.   All right.  Well, let's go back to that then.

            19                Tell me what that transaction was and who

            20  the parties to it were.

            21      A.   Texas Tubular Solutions was selling to OMK,

            22  which is a Russian pipe company.

            23      Q.   And who did you represent?

            24      A.   Texas Tubular Solutions.

            25      Q.   And what was Texas Tubular selling to OMK?



                                                                      43

             1      A.   Their -- they had two business.  One was heat

             2  treating; one was thread -- threading.  I'm pretty sure

             3  that it was the heat treating.  But it was one of those

             4  two, but I think it was their heat treating operations.

             5      Q.   And what was the earnout provision in that

             6  case?

             7      A.   I've forgotten the exact numbers on the -- the

             8  total transaction.  But the -- the terms of the earnout,

             9  similar to this transaction, most -- most earnouts are

            10  always developed late in the game when the parties

            11  cannot reach agreement.  And the earnout was a mechanism

            12  for bridging the gap between the seller's asking price

            13  and the buyer's expectation of what the value would be.

            14      Q.   And how did the earnout work?

            15      A.   It was a five-year earnout that was based on

            16  the net profits of the company, as I recall, because

            17  there was -- I'm pretty sure it was on a net profit

            18  basis because there was a lot of discussion about

            19  expenses and what was approved expenses and what was

            20  not.

            21                So my recollection -- I could be wrong,

            22  but my recollection was that it was based on net profits

            23  instead of gross revenues, and it paid over five years.

            24      Q.   But how did you determine a payment under that

            25  provision?



                                                                      44

             1      A.   It had a threshold, you know, that certain

             2  amount, revenues over a -- over a certain amount or net

             3  profits above a certain amount would be -- they would

             4  get a percentage.  I don't remember what the percentage

             5  was.  And the -- and it had a cap.  The cap was

             6  15 million in that case.

             7      Q.   Okay.  How did they determine what the cap was?

             8  What were the negotiations over the cap about?

             9      A.   As usual what it usually is.  The difference

            10  between the -- the seller's ask and the buyer's wish,

            11  and so...

            12      Q.   So your experience is it is typical in

            13  transactions like this for the seller to accept a cap at

            14  what it really thinks the property is worth, but is

            15  willing to take less under the earnout?

            16      A.   Well, the seller is setting -- trying to set

            17  the cap at what it thinks the company is worth.  And the

            18  buyer is not willing to pay that much, but would pay

            19  that much if the expectations are achieved.

            20      Q.   All right.

            21      A.   If the seller's expectations are achieved.

            22      Q.   So why is it rational for a seller to accept as

            23  a cap what it actually wants instead of saying, I'm

            24  willing to accept less than what I want; but if it

            25  performs well, I need to get more than what I want?



                                                                      45

             1      A.   That's not what I've said.

             2      Q.   No.  I'm -- I'm asking why isn't that the case?

             3  Why -- why in your experience negotiating these things,

             4  why don't sellers say, if I'm going to take the risk

             5  that I'm going to get less under this earnout than I

             6  think it's worth, I also want --

             7      A.   The buyer or the seller?

             8      Q.   The seller says, I'm taking the risk that I'm

             9  going to get less under this earnout than I think the

            10  property is really worth.  So if you hit a home run, I

            11  want to get more than what I think it's worth.  Why

            12  isn't that what the negotiation looks like?

            13      A.   A, because it doesn't make sense; and B,

            14  because the -- it's -- the buyer is not going to pay the

            15  seller for the added value that they had over and above

            16  the expectation.

            17      Q.   Okay.  So you've never seen an earnout

            18  provision that was capped at an amount that was greater

            19  than what the seller thought the property was worth when

            20  you add in the cap and when you add the cap and the

            21  sales price together?

            22      A.   No, that would not be --

            23      Q.   You've never seen that happen?

            24      A.   That would not be true.  But it's -- it's

            25  because this is not like -- these negotiations are not



                                                                      46

             1  like a list price.  It's not like they've published it

             2  in the paper, I want to sell it for X amount of money.

             3  It's a negotiation.

             4                So who knows what the seller really wants

             5  when they set up a price.

             6      Q.   Okay.  So earnouts come in a variety of

             7  different flavors?

             8      A.   Every one of them is a little different, but

             9  yes.

            10      Q.   Okay.  Were there contingencies in that

            11  earnout?

            12      A.   Yes.

            13      Q.   What were the contingencies?

            14      A.   The only one I remember -- I believe there were

            15  more than one, but the one that I remember is the one

            16  that turned out to be the trigger, which was the

            17  termination of -- in the end, they negotiated on just

            18  one person, as I recall, if Steve Turner were no longer

            19  the CEO of the company.

            20      Q.   And what happened if he was no longer the CEO

            21  of the company?

            22      A.   That he was representing the seller.  So if he

            23  was no longer the CEO, then the seller would not get the

            24  -- they would not continue to get to earn through the

            25  earnout.



                                                                      47

             1      Q.   Okay.  And Mr. Turner was on the seller's side

             2  of the transaction when the transaction is being

             3  negotiated?

             4      A.   Yes.

             5      Q.   And the buyer insisted that the earnout would

             6  only apply so long as he remained the CEO?

             7      A.   Yes.  The buyer would no longer pay the earnout

             8  if he was no longer the CEO.

             9      Q.   Did it matter how Mr. Turner ended up not being

            10  the CEO?

            11      A.   No.

            12      Q.   So the -- the buyer could fire Mr. Turner the

            13  day after they did the transaction if they wanted?

            14      A.   As I recall, there were reasonable -- there

            15  were terms in there about reasonableness that --

            16      Q.   Well, that's what I'm --

            17      A.   He -- he had a contract.  He had a contract in

            18  place.  So he had to be terminated for a cause, yes.

            19      Q.   Okay.  So if he were terminated for cause,

            20  the -- the earnout payments would end?

            21      A.   Yes.

            22      Q.   And if he left of his own volition, the earnout

            23  payments would end?

            24      A.   Yes.

            25      Q.   And what happened?



                                                                      48

             1      A.   He struck one of the Russian executives that

             2  was over there.  And so there was a period of six months

             3  where they were threatening to terminate him for

             4  striking this guy.

             5                And then after, I believe -- I believe

             6  they got the full two years.  It was every six months.

             7                I believe they got their two full years,

             8  but they might have -- it might -- it might have been

             9  less than two full years of the earnout, Mr. Turner just

            10  quit.

            11                They earned -- they earned something under

            12  it but, you know, a few million, but not the entire 15.

            13      Q.   Did Mr. Turner take the position that hitting

            14  the -- the Russian guy was not cause for his

            15  termination?

            16      A.   Yes.

            17      Q.   Did the Russians take the position that it was?

            18      A.   Mr. Turner's position was that the Russian

            19  struck him first.

            20      Q.   And what was the Russian position?

            21      A.   He never communicated to me what his position

            22  was, but he was not fired for that.

            23      Q.   He wasn't fired at all?

            24      A.   Correct.

            25      Q.   But then he left.  Why did he leave?



                                                                      49

             1      A.   He was an interesting man.  He just said that

             2  the money wasn't worth working for those people, so he

             3  left.

             4      Q.   Okay.  Let's go back to where we were

             5  talking -- thank you for that, by the way.

             6      A.   You're welcome.

             7      Q.   Let's go back to where we were talking about

             8  circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract.

             9  We were talking about Mr. Hogan, a person who was

            10  representing NRP in the transaction that is memorialized

            11  in Exhibit 48, the purchase agreement.

            12                From reading Mr. Hogan's deposition, were

            13  you aware that he worked in the corporate departments at

            14  Andrews & Kurth and then Vinson & Elkins for six years?

            15      A.   No, I did not see that part of his deposition.

            16      Q.   Were you aware that he then went to work for

            17  the NRP group of companies as a general counsel and vice

            18  president?

            19      A.   Yes.  I mean, I knew that he was general

            20  coun -- at some point was general counsel and vice

            21  president.

            22      Q.   You also read Mr. Jeremy Smith's deposition,

            23  right?

            24      A.   Yes.

            25      Q.   He was one of the people representing Anadarko



                                                                      50

             1  in this transaction, true?

             2      A.   True.

             3      Q.   From reading his deposition, do you recall he

             4  had an MBA?

             5      A.   I don't remember his education.

             6      Q.   Well, do you remember that like you, he had a

             7  master's of public accounting as well?

             8      A.   I actually didn't look at his, that part of the

             9  deposition.

            10      Q.   From reading his deposition, did you learn that

            11  he had worked in investment banking and corporate

            12  development in the business world?

            13      A.   I mean, I remember him being experienced, but I

            14  didn't pay attention to who he worked for.

            15      Q.   From your work on the case, you understood that

            16  both parties were represented by very experienced

            17  transactional counsel, true?

            18      A.   Yes.

            19      Q.   Anadarko was represented by Akin Gump in the

            20  transaction, true?

            21      A.   I think that's right.  I'm pretty sure that

            22  that's right, yes.

            23      Q.   And NRP was represented by Vinson & Elkins in

            24  the transaction?

            25      A.   Correct.



                                                                      51

             1      Q.   And did you read depositions of both the Akin

             2  Gump lawyers and Vinson Elkins lawyers who worked on the

             3  transaction?

             4      A.   They were -- yes, they were made available to

             5  me, and read parts of them.

             6      Q.   How did you decide what parts to read?

             7      A.   The --

             8                MR. PATRICK:  Caution the witness not to

             9  reveal privileged communications between the attorneys

            10  and yourself.

            11                THE WITNESS:  Okay.

            12      A.   The -- the associate that read through the

            13  depositions focused me on the provisions that dealt with

            14  2.6.  That dealt with the -- the facts surrounding the

            15  development of section 2.6.

            16      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  So you focused your work

            17  in terms of looking at depositions on the negotiation of

            18  that specific clause in Exhibit 48?

            19      A.   That particular clause and the discussion about

            20  the tax reorganization that was being discussed among

            21  the parties.

            22      Q.   Okay.  Did you learn from your work on this

            23  case, the depositions or otherwise, that there were

            24  extensive negotiations over the contract between these

            25  parties?



                                                                      52

             1      A.   Yes.

             2      Q.   Did they begin about a year before Exhibit 48

             3  was executed?

             4      A.   Yes.

             5      Q.   And documents were being exchanged for about

             6  five or six months before Exhibit 48 was executed?

             7      A.   I don't remember the amount of time, but I knew

             8  it was over months.

             9      Q.   Do you remember how many drafts the parties

            10  went through?

            11      A.   No.

            12      Q.   Do you remember how many drafts of section

            13  2.6(e) specifically the parties went through?

            14      A.   No.

            15      Q.   Did you review those drafts?

            16      A.   No.

            17      Q.   Did you review any of them?

            18      A.   Any of the drafts?

            19      Q.   Yes.

            20      A.   No.

            21      Q.   Do you know from your work on the case how the

            22  phrase equity ownership interest got added to the

            23  language that ended up in the contract?

            24      A.   It was my understanding that it started out as

            25  purchased interest, and it was adjusted to be equity



                                                                      53

             1  ownership interest.

             2      Q.   And what is that understanding based on?

             3                MR. PATRICK:  I would caution the witness

             4  not to reveal attorney privileged communications.  So to

             5  the extent you have an independent understanding, you

             6  can testify about it.  But anything that we talked

             7  about...

             8                THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

             9      A.   It was -- it's hard for me to distinguish now

            10  between what's privileged and what I read.  But it was

            11  my understanding from the provisions of the depositions

            12  that I saw that there was a point in time when it was

            13  purchased interest, and it later became equity ownership

            14  interest.

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  So your understanding is that

            16  in a -- in a draft, the phrase purchased interest was

            17  used in section 2.6, what became 2.6(e), and that at

            18  some point, those two words were changed to equity

            19  ownership interest?

            20      A.   Yes.

            21      Q.   There wasn't anything in between those two

            22  words?

            23      A.   I don't remember anything in between.

            24      Q.   Okay.  Who suggested changing purchased

            25  interest to equity ownership interest?



                                                                      54

             1      A.   I do not recall.

             2      Q.   Would that make any difference to you in your

             3  opinions?

             4      A.   Not in what I was asked to do, no.

             5      Q.   Would the party that suggested using the words

             6  equity ownership interest be in the best position to

             7  testify about what they meant?

             8                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

             9      A.   Not necessarily.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Why not?

            11      A.   Because the other party had to also have an

            12  understanding of what the words were that were going

            13  into the contract.  So both parties had to agree on what

            14  the language was.

            15      Q.   What if they thought they meant different

            16  things at the time they signed the agreement?

            17                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            18      A.   It's speculation.  I don't know.

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  You don't know how you would

            20  resolve that?

            21      A.   I mean, I think that's -- two parties have

            22  different -- difference of opinion.  I mean, that --

            23  that's up to the court to decide that.

            24      Q.   How does the court decide that?

            25                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.



                                                                      55

             1      A.   It's up to the court to decide that.

             2      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Can you help us decide that

             3  question?

             4      A.   I can help you -- tell you from my experience

             5  what this language would mean in an ordinary contract

             6  and what normal business guys in negotiations would

             7  expect this language to mean.

             8      Q.   Okay.  So where have you seen the phrase equity

             9  ownership interest used in another contract?

            10      A.   I mean, I -- I don't recall a specific

            11  contract, but it's -- it really is a common phrase.

            12      Q.   But you've never seen it in a contract as far

            13  as you can recall?

            14      A.   I did not -- I said I did not recall a specific

            15  contract; but yes, I know I've seen this language used.

            16      Q.   In a contract?

            17      A.   Equity ownership interest.

            18      Q.   You have seen the phrase equity ownership

            19  interest used in another contract?

            20      A.   I can't tell you a specific contract, but I'm

            21  sure that this phrase is used because it's just such a

            22  common word.

            23      Q.   Well, it's three words.

            24      A.   It's three words.

            25      Q.   It's a phrase.



                                                                      56

             1      A.   Yes.

             2      Q.   But I'm trying -- I'm just trying to be sure I

             3  understand.

             4                You're saying you wouldn't be surprised if

             5  it were in another contract or you know from your

             6  experience that it is in other contracts?

             7      A.   Okay.  I wouldn't be surprised if it were --

             8      Q.   Okay.

             9      A.   -- in other contracts.

            10      Q.   Do you recall anything about what Anadarko's

            11  witnesses said about why those words were added to the

            12  contract language?

            13      A.   As I recall, it related to their concern about

            14  OCI exercising their right of first refusal.

            15      Q.   Who said that?

            16      A.   I thought that was Hogan, but I don't -- I'm --

            17  I'm not -- I'm not sure.  I'm not going to -- I'm not

            18  going to say I recall who said that --

            19      Q.   Okay.

            20      A.   -- in the deposition.

            21      Q.   Now, Mr. Hogan, of course, worked for NRP, not

            22  Anadarko?

            23      A.   Oh, okay.  Then -- then I've -- I've forgotten

            24  the name of the person that was testifying.

            25      Q.   Is it your recollection that NRP's witness, Mr.



                                                                      57

             1  Hogan, said it was in the contract because of the OCI

             2  issue?

             3                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

             4      A.   I don't remember.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Do you recall which party added

             6  the words "including the purchased interest" to the

             7  draft language of section 2.6(e)?

             8      A.   No.

             9      Q.   Do you recall anything about what either

            10  parties' witnesses said about it?

            11      A.   No.

            12      Q.   On your report, which is Exhibit 182, if you

            13  turn to page 12, you have some comments on the expert

            14  report of Professor Coates, correct?

            15      A.   Yes.

            16      Q.   And the first header is a heading for omitted

            17  references.

            18                Do you see that?

            19      A.   Yes.

            20      Q.   There you criticize Professor Coates because

            21  his report -- and I'm quoting here -- "does not address

            22  any of the communications and discussions of the parties

            23  in the negotiations prior to entering the purchase

            24  agreement."

            25                Do you see where I read that from?



                                                                      58

             1      A.   Yes.

             2      Q.   You then say, "Because of that omission, it's

             3  not clear how Professor Coates can" -- and again, I'm

             4  quoting -- "weigh the business purposes and facts

             5  assumed by the parties during drafting in opining on the

             6  meaning of the terms used."

             7                Do you see where I read that?

             8      A.   Yes.

             9      Q.   Okay.  Was your review of those communications

            10  and discussions thorough?

            11      A.   It was thorough on the part that I was focused

            12  on, which was the discussion of the tax -- the tax

            13  reorganization.

            14      Q.   Was your review of those communications and

            15  discussions necessary to your opinions in this case?

            16      A.   No.

            17      Q.   Do your opinions depend on your review of the

            18  communications and discussions of the parties before

            19  entering the purchase agreement?

            20      A.   No.

            21      Q.   Is your review of them irrelevant to your

            22  opinions?

            23      A.   It is -- it is supportive of -- of how I would

            24  interpret those common -- commonly used words.

            25      Q.   Well, did you look for things that supported



                                                                      59

             1  your opinions, or did you look for things and then

             2  decide what your opinions had to be based on what you

             3  saw?

             4      A.   No.  My original review of the contract was on

             5  the language that was used.  And then read the

             6  supporting discussions about the tax reorganization

             7  discussion between and among OCI, Anadarko and NRP.

             8      Q.   I take it you also looked at -- from what

             9  you've just said, you looked at what the parties

            10  actually wrote in their agreement?

            11      A.   I -- I analyzed the agreement.

            12      Q.   Yeah.  You looked at the whole agreement, did

            13  you not?

            14      A.   Yes.  I didn't -- I didn't study all parts of

            15  the agreement, but I did read the entire agreement, yes.

            16      Q.   Okay.  If you could turn in Exhibit 48 to

            17  section 2.6(i), and you'll find that --

            18      A.   Uh-huh.

            19      Q.   -- at page 12.

            20      A.   Okay.

            21      Q.   And look at the subsection Roman numeral VII,

            22  V-I-I, which is over on the top of page 13.

            23      A.   Okay.

            24      Q.   Read what that says there.

            25      A.   "The parties solely intend the express



                                                                      60

             1  provisions of this agreement to govern their contractual

             2  relationship."

             3      Q.   Okay.  What does that mean?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             5      A.   The parties solely intend the express

             6  provisions of this agreement to govern their contractual

             7  relationship.

             8      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Does that mean to you that they

             9  expected the decision about what their contractual

            10  rights and obligations were to depend entirely on what

            11  is written within the four corners of Exhibit 48?

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            13      A.   It is their intention that the provisions of

            14  the contract govern their contractual relationship.

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Turn, if you will, to section

            16  9.10 of the contract.  That's on page 38.

            17      A.   Okay.

            18      Q.   What does it mean to say, as is said in section

            19  9.10, that the agreement is the entire agreement of the

            20  parties and supersedes all prior understandings?

            21                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            22      A.   It means that the agreement supersedes any

            23  prior agreements that the parties had between them.

            24      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And understandings?

            25      A.   Oral and written.



                                                                      61

             1      Q.   So what is an integrated contract?

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             3      A.   I mean, this -- you mean this entireties clause

             4  is that the con --

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Are you familiar with the term?

             6      A.   That the contract constitutes the entire

             7  agreement between the parties.

             8      Q.   You're familiar with the term integrated

             9  contract?

            10      A.   I'm not sure how you're using integrated

            11  contract, no.

            12      Q.   Are you familiar with the term integration

            13  clause?

            14      A.   Yes.

            15      Q.   When you advise clients with respect to

            16  transactions, do you typically advise them to be sure to

            17  include an integration clause?

            18      A.   Not always, no.

            19      Q.   But typically?

            20      A.   It depends on the circumstances of the

            21  contract.

            22      Q.   When was the last contract that you negotiated

            23  where you advised your client not to include an

            24  integration clause?

            25      A.   I don't know.



                                                                      62

             1      Q.   Did you ever do it?

             2      A.   I'm sure that we have.

             3      Q.   But you don't recall a time?

             4      A.   No.

             5      Q.   When you do advise clients to include an

             6  integration clause, why do you do that?

             7      A.   Why don't you first state what you mean by

             8  integration clause.

             9      Q.   Oh.  I meant something -- something along the

            10  lines of section 9.10.

            11      A.   Okay.  I would refer to 9.10 as an entireties

            12  clause.

            13      Q.   Okay.

            14      A.   So I would say the times when you -- you either

            15  don't include the entireties clause if there are

            16  multiple contracts or you accept it by incorporating by

            17  reference other agreements that are being included.

            18                But, you know, yes, as a general rule,

            19  there's an entireties clause in most contracts.  It's

            20  either -- either as written here or modified based on

            21  other multiple agreements or other contracts

            22  incorporated by reference.

            23      Q.   And when you advise clients to include such a

            24  provision in a contract, why do you make that advice?

            25      A.   Because you do not want a prior agreement, a



                                                                      63

             1  verbal agreement, to be binding on the parties.

             2      Q.   So is entireties clause a term of art?

             3      A.   I think different lawyers would have different

             4  -- there's a lot of terms of art.  But different lawyers

             5  use different terms.  But that's the term I've always

             6  used for this.

             7      Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

             8                But you understand what a term of art is?

             9      A.   Yes, absolutely.

            10      Q.   Okay.  Let's turn to your report at pages 10

            11  through 11.  This is, again, I'm sorry, Exhibit 182,

            12  pages 10 and 11.

            13                At the bottom of 10, you've got a section

            14  headed The Commercial Purpose of the Liquidated Damages

            15  Clause.

            16                Do you see that?

            17      A.   Yes.

            18      Q.   Now, I'll come back to this.  But liquidated

            19  damages clause, that's not actually written in the

            20  contract anywhere, is it?

            21      A.   No.

            22      Q.   Is liquidated damages a term of art?

            23      A.   Yes.

            24      Q.   Why did you pick -- why did you choose to use

            25  the term liquidated damages clause in your report when



                                                                      64

             1  it doesn't appear in the contract?

             2      A.   I was trying to develop a phrase that

             3  encapsulated what this clause was having the effect of.

             4      Q.   So that's your opinion about the clause?

             5      A.   It was a defined term.

             6      Q.   Not in the contract it isn't.

             7      A.   Correct.

             8      Q.   You mean you defined it in your report?

             9      A.   Correct.

            10      Q.   Because saying liquidated damages clause was

            11  more convenient to you than saying section 2.6(e)?

            12      A.   Yes, because --

            13      Q.   Isn't the truth of the matter that you were

            14  arguing there your case?

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            16      A.   No.  No.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  You chose those words because

            18  you wanted to make a point, didn't you?

            19      A.   No.

            20                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            21      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Then why did you choose that

            22  longer phrase instead of section 2.6(e) which is in the

            23  contract?

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            25      A.   Because you're referencing the -- actually,



                                                                      65

             1  2.6(e) and (h), I believe it is, both have the same

             2  quantifiable calculation.  And one of them is if NRP

             3  failed to make payment, it would be the payment, and

             4  it's the same calculation.  And the other one is in

             5  2.6(e).  And if NRP ceased to own an equity ownership

             6  interest, then it would effect the same payment.

             7                So to me, it was just a -- it was a way to

             8  reference the clause as opposed to referencing the

             9  specific section.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  So what are liquidated damages?

            11      A.   It's -- it's just an amount of money that the

            12  parties agree to in the event that a certain thing

            13  happens.

            14      Q.   Are you as confident about your opinion on that

            15  as you are about the rest of your opinions in the

            16  report?

            17      A.   I'm as confident about my opinion on why I used

            18  liquidated damages as I am about the rest of the report.

            19      Q.   That's a different -- you're answering a

            20  different question than I asked.  You're aware of that,

            21  aren't you?

            22      A.   I am aware of that.

            23      Q.   Why did you ask -- why did you choose to answer

            24  the question --

            25      A.   Because you're trying to --



                                                                      66

             1      Q.   -- that I didn't ask?

             2      A.   -- ask a question that is something different

             3  than what I was saying.

             4      Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

             5                Now, I'm going to be asking you the

             6  questions.

             7      A.   Okay.

             8      Q.   Whether or not it's what you want to say, I

             9  still get to ask you the questions.

            10                So are you as confident about your opinion

            11  that you just gave about what liquidated damages means

            12  as you are about the other opinions in your report?

            13                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            14      A.   I am confident that the way that I used

            15  liquidated damages is a term of art that's commonly

            16  used, but the form of liquidated damages can be in all

            17  types of forms in a contract.  It's just where the

            18  parties agree on a certain amount in the event something

            19  happens.

            20                I did not intend this to be a damage.  If

            21  you're trying to argue that this is -- I'm claiming this

            22  is a damage award, I'm not.  It's just a -- it's a

            23  calculation of what it is.  It's a formula.

            24      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Well, you choose -- you chose

            25  to use the word damage in the phrase you picked to



                                                                      67

             1  represent section 2.6(e).

             2      A.   It is not relevant to anything that I

             3  understand in -- in the opinion.  So I'm not -- I'm not

             4  sure why that would offend you.

             5      Q.   Well, I'm not offended.  I'm just asking you

             6  questions about it.

             7      A.   Okay.  And I told you, the reason I used it --

             8  I was just -- I was trying to come up with a phrase that

             9  encompasses this formula that is being devised.  And I

            10  could have used ABC, but I -- I chose --

            11      Q.   You could have used --

            12      A.   -- liquidated damages because to me, that was

            13  the effect of the clause.

            14      Q.   You could have used the words section 2.6(e).

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            16      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  It's shorter.

            17                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            18      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  It's in the contract, true?

            19                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            20      A.   I could have used anything.

            21      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Do you -- are you aware

            22  that in Texas, the Texas Supreme Court has said that

            23  liquidated damages clauses fix in advance the

            24  compensation to a party accruing from a failure to

            25  perform specified contractual obligations?



                                                                      68

             1      A.   That would be a good definition, yes.

             2      Q.   But that's not how you're using liquidated

             3  damages in this case?

             4      A.   Actually, in (h), that is what it is.

             5      Q.   I'm asking you about 2.6(e).

             6      A.   In 2.6(h).

             7      Q.   I'm asking you about 2.6(e).

             8      A.   In 2.6(e), no, it's the balance of the purchase

             9  price in the event the contingencies occur.

            10      Q.   Okay.  So you're not using liquidated damages

            11  clause with respect to section 2.6(e) to mean what

            12  liquidated damages means according to the Texas Supreme

            13  Court?

            14      A.   Correct.

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            16      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  And are you aware of any

            17  dispute between the parties about the meaning or

            18  application of section 2.6(h) of the contract?

            19      A.   I'm not aware of any issue over 2.6(h).

            20      Q.   Have you been asked to opine about the meaning

            21  or application of section 2.6(h) of the contract?

            22      A.   No.

            23      Q.   Okay.  So now back to page 10 of your report.

            24  Right down at the bottom when you're talking about the

            25  commercial purpose of section 2.6(e) of the contract,



                                                                      69

             1  you say, "The seller intends the earnout provisions to

             2  secure the integrity of the profits" -- oh, wait, I'm

             3  sorry.  Withdraw that.  I read from the wrong part.

             4                Right before that you say, "The seller

             5  inserts provisions to protect the earnout payments and

             6  prevent manipulation of the metric that drives the

             7  payment calculation.  The seller intends the earnout

             8  provisions to secure the integrity of the profits or

             9  revenues."

            10                Do you see where I read that from?

            11      A.   Yes.

            12      Q.   Then you go on to say, "The parties" -- "The

            13  drafting parties intend earnout clauses to preserve

            14  future contingency payments."

            15                Do you see that?

            16      A.   Where is that?

            17      Q.   That's the next -- beginning of the next

            18  paragraph.

            19      A.   Yes.

            20      Q.   Okay.  Is it your opinion that this was the

            21  purpose of section 2.6(e)?

            22      A.   I mean, it could be.  I think there could be

            23  multiple purposes.

            24      Q.   Okay.  So that could be one purpose?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                      70

             1      Q.   But there could be other purposes as well?

             2      A.   Yes.

             3      Q.   Does your view of the purpose of 2.6(e) inform

             4  your opinion about what the words used in section 2.6(e)

             5  mean?

             6      A.   Yes.

             7      Q.   Okay.  You read Mr. Carroll's deposition as

             8  part of your work in this case, true?

             9      A.   Okay.  Who is Carroll?

            10      Q.   Well, if you look on Exhibit A to your report.

            11      A.   I understand, but who is he?

            12      Q.   He works for or he worked for Anadarko during

            13  the negotiation --

            14      A.   Okay.  All right.

            15      Q.   -- and drafting of the contract.

            16      A.   Yes.

            17      Q.   Mr. Joe Carroll.

            18      A.   Okay.

            19      Q.   You read his deposition?

            20      A.   Yes, generally.

            21      Q.   But you didn't cite to any portion of his

            22  deposition in your report.

            23      A.   That's correct.

            24      Q.   You cited to depositions of other people who

            25  worked on the negotiation of the contract, true?



                                                                      71

             1      A.   True.

             2      Q.   You said that in looking at depositions, you

             3  focused on parts of the deposition that talked about

             4  section 2.6(e) of the contract.  That was one of the

             5  things you focused on, true?

             6      A.   Yes.

             7      Q.   And Mr. Carroll discussed section 2.6(e) in his

             8  deposition, didn't he?

             9      A.   He did.  They all did, but the part that I was

            10  focused on was the discussion of the tax reorganization,

            11  not necessarily the purpose of what each of them

            12  intended.

            13                They clearly had a different understanding

            14  of this language.

            15      Q.   Didn't Mr. Carroll testify in this case that

            16  the purpose of section 2.6(e) was to allow Anadarko to

            17  capture part of the value if the buyer did something to

            18  unlock value in the short term?

            19      A.   Yes.

            20      Q.   He did say that?

            21      A.   Yes.

            22      Q.   So did that testimony inform your opinions in

            23  this case?

            24      A.   That testimony was just exactly consistent with

            25  the language that you just read that formed my opinion.



                                                                      72

             1      Q.   Which language?

             2      A.   Those three sentences, "The" -- "The seller

             3  inserts provisions to protect the earnout payments and

             4  prevent manipulation of the metric that drives the

             5  payment calculation.  The seller intends the earnout

             6  provision to secure the integrity of the profits or

             7  revenues, depending on whether profits or revenues are

             8  the source of calculating the earnout, of the generating

             9  assets."

            10      Q.   So you --

            11      A.   I think that was consistent.

            12      Q.   You did not understand Mr. Carroll to be

            13  talking about some other purpose of 2.6(e) than -- than

            14  those two that you mention there?

            15      A.   Those aren't two.  Those -- I mean, when you're

            16  negotiating a contract, there could be a hundred

            17  different issues locked up in those two sentences.  But

            18  as a general rule, that's the purpose of it.

            19      Q.   Okay.  Let me -- let me back up here.

            20                Back on page 10, you said, "Since the

            21  earnout payments are made over a period of time after

            22  the contract is executed, the seller inserts provisions

            23  to protect the earnout payments."

            24                That's one purpose, right?

            25      A.   Okay.



                                                                      73

             1      Q.   Yes?

             2      A.   Yes.

             3      Q.   Okay.  "And prevent manipulation of the metric

             4  that drives the payment calculation."

             5                That's a second purpose, right?

             6      A.   Yes.

             7      Q.   And both of those purposes are captured by the

             8  next sentence which says, "The seller intends the

             9  earnout provisions to secure the integrity of the

            10  profits or revenues of the generating assets," right?

            11      A.   Yes.  There's different ways of saying the same

            12  thing, but my answer was related to the fact that how

            13  they can come up in a negotiation on those general

            14  purposes could be hundreds of different fact

            15  circumstances that -- that are inserted into a contract

            16  or thought about in a contract.

            17      Q.   But what Mr. Carroll testified to as one of the

            18  purposes of section 2.6(e) was that if something happens

            19  that unlocks value in the short term, I wanted us,

            20  Anadarko, to be able to get something out of that.

            21                That's not captured in what you said about

            22  the purposes, is it?

            23      A.   I think it is.

            24      Q.   Oh, you do?

            25      A.   The way I understand unlocked value, if -- if



                                                                      74

             1  they were to sell to Exxon and make a profit, they

             2  wanted to achieve up to -- up to the full 50 million

             3  based upon that method of unlocking value as he said it.

             4                I've never heard that term before, but

             5  it's not inconsistent with that language.

             6      Q.   Okay.  So you accept that being able to get

             7  additional payment if the buyer, as it turned out NRP,

             8  was able to unlock value, you view that as consistent

             9  with the purposes of section 2.6(e)?

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

            11      A.   Yeah, I think unlock value is so ambiguous in

            12  itself that to me, it's -- it's -- it could be the same.

            13  If you said that and you said these sentences, you would

            14  be saying the same thing.  They're just general

            15  descriptions of why you have a trigger in -- in an

            16  earnout clause.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  If you'd turn to page 15 of

            18  your report, again Exhibit 182, you've got a section

            19  there headed Comparison to Winding Up.

            20                Do you see that?

            21      A.   Yes.

            22      Q.   And towards the bottom of that first paragraph,

            23  you wrote this, "I do not disagree with the Coates

            24  report that a circumstance could occur through the

            25  process of winding up or dissolution by which the



                                                                      75

             1  economic ownership interest in the assets of the target

             2  companies might be distributed in kind to OCI and NRP in

             3  a manner in which NRP commingled those assets with other

             4  assets that had the effect of, or could have the effect

             5  of, diminishing or reducing net revenues, and" -- "and

             6  thus jeopardize the earnout."

             7                Do you see where I read that?

             8      A.   Yes.

             9      Q.   Are you saying that it is your opinion that a

            10  dissolution or winding up of one of these two companies

            11  could be a buyout trigger event?

            12      A.   I'm saying that --

            13                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

            14      A.   I'm saying that the manner of the dissolution

            15  or winding up could affect a transfer of the economic

            16  ownership interest.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  So you are saying that

            18  in your opinion, the dissolution or winding up of just

            19  one of the two companies could be a buyout trigger

            20  event?

            21                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

            22      A.   I am saying that the manner in which they were

            23  dissolved or wound up could have affected a transfer of

            24  the economic ownership interest if that economic

            25  ownership interest ceased to be owned by NRP or any of



                                                                      76

             1  its affiliates.

             2      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  But you said the manner

             3  in which "they" were wound up or dissolved.  And I'm

             4  asking the question whether you agree that winding up or

             5  dissolving just one of the two companies could be a

             6  buyout trigger event?

             7                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

             8      A.   I am saying that the manner of dissolving or

             9  winding up even one of those two could have resulted in

            10  ceasing to own if the NRP or its affiliates had not

            11  continued to own the economic ownership interest of the

            12  assets.

            13      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Why is commingling the

            14  assets with other assets relevant to that question?

            15      A.   Possible in that sentence I speculated and

            16  maybe should not have.  But the -- the point is, there

            17  are ways to dispose of assets that go to third parties

            18  that could result in NRP ceasing to own the economic

            19  interest of that asset.

            20      Q.   Fair enough.

            21                But I'm still just trying to figure out.

            22  You -- I mean, you wrote this, so I'm just trying to

            23  make sure I understand what your opinion is.

            24                Why is commingling the assets with other

            25  assets relevant to the question?



                                                                      77

             1      A.   It's not relevant to --

             2      Q.   Okay.

             3      A.   -- to the opinion.

             4      Q.   Why is having the effect of diminishing net

             5  revenues relevant to the question?

             6      A.   Why is the effect?  Repeat the question.

             7      Q.   Why is having the effect of diminishing net

             8  revenues relevant to that question?

             9                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

            10      A.   There are hundreds of ways that a dissolution

            11  could result in a manner of NRP ceasing to own the

            12  economic interest of those, of the bundle of assets in

            13  the consolidated group.

            14                And I'm just saying I don't disagree with

            15  Professor Coates that there is a way that that could

            16  occur, but I'm saying that it is clear from the language

            17  to me that a mere dissolution of a -- of a company and

            18  the way that it was actually, in fact -- in the way that

            19  OCI Co. was disposed of did not affect the disposition

            20  or ceasing to own the economic ownership interest.

            21      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But I'm still trying to

            22  understand what you wrote, and I don't understand why

            23  you said the effect of diminishing net revenues.  I'm

            24  just wondering why that's relevant to the inquiry in

            25  your opinion.



                                                                      78

             1      A.   Okay.  It's relevant to the purpose of -- of a

             2  earnout clause.

             3      Q.   Okay.  As you understand it?

             4      A.   Now I'm -- now I'm focused on -- well, no, on

             5  your question.  It's relevant to your question.

             6                The -- the -- it could have the effect --

             7  I can understand how it was written and why it would be

             8  written in an earnout clause because you could have a

             9  dissolution that had the effect or that resulted in the

            10  loss of the assets and the diminution or the complete

            11  loss of the net revenues that would calculate the

            12  earnout.

            13                So that was -- that was really the point I

            14  was trying to make.

            15      Q.   Well, so is it important that it diminish the

            16  net revenues?

            17      A.   There's -- if you're focused on 2.6(e), it's

            18  possible.  The 2.6(e) is ceasing to own.  So if the

            19  general purpose of an earnout clause would be to make

            20  sure that the buyer doesn't do something that causes the

            21  effect of losing the net revenues in this case that were

            22  being -- that were the basis of calculating the earnout.

            23      Q.   That wasn't true of the contingency in the

            24  Texas Tubular earnout, was it?

            25      A.   Well, you're focused on the condition that is



                                                                      79

             1  the factual issue before the -- before the parties.

             2  That doesn't mean that that's the only reason you're

             3  writing 2.6(e).

             4                2.6(e) could have occurred.  You could

             5  have triggered 2.6(e) by circumstances materially

             6  different than the tax reorganization.

             7                There could have been a sell-off that they

             8  lost the net revenue stream.  And therefore, that would

             9  have lost the economic ownership interest that was

            10  benefitting and being the basis for calculating the

            11  earnout.  So that is just a different reason.

            12                So you're focused on the particular

            13  trigger comparing Steve Turner's termination to this.

            14  And I'm saying that's not the only reason you write

            15  the -- the clause.

            16                2.6(e) is covering a lot more reasons

            17  than -- than the specific one of the tax reorganization.

            18      Q.   Fair enough.

            19                My question about Mr. Turner's case, the

            20  Texas Tubular --

            21      A.   Uh-huh.

            22      Q.   -- case was the earnout provision there

            23  provided that the right to earnout payments went away if

            24  Mr. Turner were fired for cause?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                      80

             1      Q.   True?

             2      A.   But --

             3      Q.   True?  Right?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

             5      A.   True.

             6      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Now go ahead and say

             7  what else you wanted to say.

             8      A.   Okay.  But that's not the only reason for the

             9  clause.  There were a lot of other factors in that

            10  clause, for instance, the calculation of net profits all

            11  went into that calculation.

            12                So there were a lot of other things that

            13  could have affected the drop of earnings and therefore

            14  triggering the -- the clause.

            15      Q.   Right.  But in the case of Texas Tubular, the

            16  parties agreed that if Mr. --

            17      A.   Turner.

            18      Q.   -- Turner left voluntarily or was fired for

            19  cause, the requirement of the Russian buyers to pay an

            20  earnout, even if it were otherwise, if the net profits

            21  were otherwise, it wouldn't have required those

            22  payments, that obligation went away, right?

            23      A.   Right.

            24      Q.   That contingency didn't have anything to do

            25  with protecting the earnouts, did it?



                                                                      81

             1      A.   Yes, in their mind, it had everything to do

             2  with protecting earnout.

             3      Q.   How?

             4      A.   Because he was the basis for generating the

             5  cash revenue.  He was the man with the relationships.

             6  The negotiations started out broader.  Mark Matts with

             7  Jones Day was on the other side.

             8                They -- it started off broader than that,

             9  but it ended just on him.  But he was the basis of

            10  the -- the revenue stream.

            11      Q.   Okay.  So they were buying his work?

            12      A.   It was a big company, but there were 130

            13  employees.  But -- but he was the rela -- he was the

            14  reputation, yes.

            15      Q.   But even if absent Mr. Turner, the business did

            16  great and justified paying the earnout payments

            17  according to the contractual agreement, the obligation

            18  to make those payments went away if he were fired for

            19  cause or left on his own?

            20                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

            21      A.   Correct.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Even if it turned out he wasn't

            23  necessary at all to the results?

            24      A.   Correct.

            25      Q.   Okay.  In the sentence we were looking at, you



                                                                      82

             1  used the phrase economic ownership interest.

             2      A.   Which sentence?

             3      Q.   I'm sorry.  The one we were looking at on page

             4  12 where you say, "I do not disagree with Coates that a

             5  circumstance could occur through the process of winding

             6  up or dissolution by which the economic ownership

             7  interest" --

             8                Do you see that?  Page 12.  I'm sorry,

             9  page 15.

            10      A.   Okay.  Yeah.

            11      Q.   Page 15 of your report.  I'm sorry.

            12      A.   Yes.

            13      Q.   Economic ownership is in the sentence that you

            14  wrote, correct?

            15      A.   Yes.

            16      Q.   What does that phrase mean as you used it?

            17      A.   The -- the economic ownership interest -- read

            18  your sentence again.  Hang on.

            19                Economic ownership interest is the -- the

            20  assets of the company generating the -- the net

            21  revenues.

            22                And so if you had, it's -- it's difficult

            23  in discussing a complex business, but it's easy to

            24  discuss talking about a simple business.

            25                If you had two people that owned an LLC or



                                                                      83

             1  a corporation that owned a warehouse, they would

             2  commonly reference that they have an equity ownership

             3  interest in the warehouse.  They don't -- that's not

             4  their ownership.  That's not their -- technically they

             5  own in a company, but their equity ownership is in the

             6  warehouse.

             7      Q.   I'm sorry.  I was asking you about the phrase

             8  economic ownership interest, which is the phrase you

             9  used in the sentence we've been looking at.

            10      A.   Ah, okay.

            11      Q.   What is --

            12      A.   You're just asking why is it economic?

            13      Q.   What does the phrase economic ownership

            14  interest mean?

            15      A.   Yeah.  I mean, I -- it's -- I don't know why I

            16  used the word economic.  But the basis, economic, the

            17  basis for calculating the revenues from the ownership.

            18      Q.   That's what it means?

            19      A.   I could have used equity ownership just as

            20  easily.  I should have used equity ownership.

            21      Q.   Well, you used equity ownership interest in the

            22  next sentence.

            23      A.   Okay.  I should have used equity ownership

            24  then.

            25      Q.   And do they mean the same thing?



                                                                      84

             1      A.   Well, the -- the point that I'm making in this

             2  sentence is the same thing.  They don't -- the reason

             3  they don't mean the same thing is equity ownership is

             4  your equit -- equity -- the ownership of the equity, the

             5  interest through the assets of your equity ownership.

             6                The economic ownership is generally the --

             7  the basis for drafting an earnout clause.

             8      Q.   Okay.  So what does equity ownership mean then?

             9  You distinguished it a little bit from economic

            10  ownership.  I'm just trying to make sure I capture --

            11      A.   Okay.

            12      Q.   -- the distinction.

            13      A.   Equity ownership is the -- the shareholders'

            14  interest in the assets of that company, all the business

            15  and assets of the company.

            16      Q.   So that's -- that's equity ownership.  So

            17  what's economic ownership?

            18      A.   As I said, I could have -- I should have used

            19  equity ownership interest in that sentence.  But my --

            20      Q.   Is that because the two things mean the same?

            21      A.   Well, the -- the point that I'm trying to make

            22  in the sentence is there is a way to lose -- if you're

            23  drafting an earnout clause, there's a way to lose the

            24  economics that support your earnout by disposing of the

            25  equity ownership interest in the assets.



                                                                      85

             1      Q.   So I'm -- I'm sorry to keep going back to this,

             2  but we really are in a case that depends on a resolution

             3  of what specific --

             4      A.   Okay.

             5      Q.   -- words mean.

             6                And I'm trying to find out from you, since

             7  you used economic ownership interest in one sentence and

             8  equity ownership interest in the next sentence, what the

             9  difference between those two things is or whether you

            10  view them as entirely synonymous?

            11      A.   I should have used equity ownership in that

            12  sentence.

            13      Q.   You should have because they mean the same

            14  thing, or you should have because they mean different

            15  things?

            16      A.   Economic ownership, you would more often use

            17  those terms when you're talking about a contract,

            18  economic rights.  An equity ownership interest, you

            19  would more often use that term when you're referencing

            20  your ownership through an entity, through your equitable

            21  ownership of that entity.

            22      Q.   And why would you make that difference in

            23  usage?

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

            25      A.   Because your equity ownership is the difference



                                                                      86

             1  between your -- the equity ownership is your interest in

             2  the company.  Your -- the essence of your ownership

             3  through that company.

             4                The economics is what you're generally

             5  focused on.  Not always.  It's not the -- you could have

             6  specific triggers have nothing -- that have no apparent

             7  reason.  Like the termination of Steve Turner may have

             8  no apparent reason why it affects the economics, but for

             9  those parties, it was everything.  That was the reason

            10  why that provision was there.

            11                But the economics is what you're normally

            12  focused on in an earnout clause.  It doesn't affect the

            13  economics.

            14                But I -- I was -- I could put the word

            15  equity ownership interest in that sentence, and it means

            16  the same thing because my point was that I do not

            17  disagree with Professor Coates that you could effect a

            18  dissolution in a manner to lose your equity ownership of

            19  those assets.

            20      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And you think that that is

            21  somehow an important consideration in giving an opinion

            22  about section 2.6(e)?

            23                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

            24      A.   I don't understand your question.

            25      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Well, you're saying I don't



                                                                      87

             1  disagree with Professor Coates that you could dissolve a

             2  company in a way that had the effect of diminishing net

             3  revenues.

             4                Is having the effect of diminishing net

             5  revenues important to whether there's a trigger in

             6  section 2.6(e)?

             7      A.   It -- it may not be.  It may not be.

             8      Q.   You also say that you don't disagree that --

             9  that a company could be dissolved in a way that could

            10  have the effect of diminishing net revenues.

            11      A.   Yes.

            12      Q.   Is that necessarily relevant to whether there's

            13  a trigger event under section 2.6(e)?

            14      A.   It's necessarily --

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            16      A.   It is necessarily relevant to your drafting of

            17  a clause to include the circumstances that you're trying

            18  to include.

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.

            20      A.   Most often you're trying to include events that

            21  would cause the loss of the basis for generating the

            22  metric that is -- that's set in the contract for the

            23  seller.

            24      Q.   But if somebody were trying to draft a clause

            25  that covered that but also covered additional



                                                                      88

             1  compensation to the seller in the event the buyer was

             2  able in the short term to do something that unlocked

             3  value in the company, that would affect how you drafted

             4  the language as well, if that's what the intent was?

             5                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

             6      A.   The unlock value has no specific meaning.  I

             7  mean, for instance, the -- if the buyer goes in and uses

             8  a new technology to substantially improve its

             9  operations, then that doesn't trigger anything under an

            10  earnout clause.  It may affect the net revenues one way

            11  or another, but it doesn't trigger the buyout clause.

            12      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  The earnout clause?

            13      A.   The earnout clause.

            14      Q.   Well, it might if you drafted it in order to

            15  cover and capture that?

            16                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  I mean, you -- you could draft

            18  an earnout clause that said if you institute this new

            19  kind of drilling, then you owe us X amount?

            20      A.   Correct.

            21                MR. PATRICK:  Form.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  You could do that?

            23      A.   Correct.

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

            25      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  So it really depends on



                                                                      89

             1  what the parties were trying to accomplish in what they

             2  end up with?

             3                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

             4      A.   It depends on the language of the contract.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Yeah.

             6      A.   You're right.

             7      Q.   But they might choose different language

             8  depending on what goals they're trying to accomplish.

             9  That's my point.

            10      A.   Yes.

            11      Q.   You'd agree with that?

            12      A.   Yes.

            13      Q.   Ultimately, though, you think you really need

            14  to focus on what language they actually wrote in the

            15  contract in order to determine what the contract

            16  requires?

            17      A.   Yes.

            18      Q.   Okay.

            19                MR. PATRICK:  All right.  We've been going

            20  a little over an hour.  I'm not sure if lunch is set up

            21  already.  But if we want to take a break and assuming

            22  that lunch is here or about to be here, then we'll have

            23  a lunch break.  Does that work?

            24                MR. WAWRO:  Sure.  That -- that works

            25  fine.



                                                                      90

             1                MR. PATRICK:  Okay.

             2                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off the record at

             3  12:00 p.m.

             4                (Recess taken from 12:00 p.m. to

             5  12:09 p.m.)

             6                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're on the record at

             7  12:09 p.m.

             8      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Mr. Looper, going back to the

             9  Texas Tubular case or transaction you worked on, you

            10  said the business had both a heat treating operation and

            11  a threading operation as you recalled?

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

            13      A.   As I recall, the consolidated group of

            14  companies had both heat treating and threading.  And

            15  I've just forgotten whether Texas Tubular was heat

            16  treating or threading.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  So there was a company

            18  that -- that did heat treating and there was a company

            19  that did threading?

            20      A.   Yes.

            21      Q.   Both of those companies were owned by some

            22  other entity?

            23                MR. PATRICK:  Object to the form.

            24      A.   I'm not -- I'm not sure if the entity owned it,

            25  but I know that both of those operations were conducted



                                                                      91

             1  by the same group of companies.  I'm just not sure of

             2  the entity ownership.  I don't remember that.

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Well, who sold -- did the heat

             4  treating business sell itself, or did somebody who owned

             5  the heat treating business sell the heat treating

             6  business to the Russians?

             7      A.   The company that owned the heat treating

             8  business -- I'm -- you know, I'm not 100 percent sure if

             9  it was an asset sale or an entity sale, but I'm pretty

            10  sure it was an entity sale.

            11      Q.   Where a company that owned the heat treating

            12  business sold the heat treating business but kept the

            13  threading business?

            14      A.   That's my recollection.

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            16      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Okay.  So, and let's

            17  look at page 8 of your report, Exhibit 182.

            18                Up at the top of page 8 you write, "Based

            19  on my experience, the commercial context of this earnout

            20  provision and my understanding of the common usage of

            21  business people and business law practitioners, I am of

            22  the opinion that the term successor refers broadly to

            23  any entity that succeeds to or follows another entity in

            24  ownership of a particular asset or interest."

            25                Do you see where I read that?



                                                                      92

             1      A.   Yes.

             2      Q.   Okay.  So we've talked about your experience

             3  somewhat earlier in the dep -- deposition.  What are you

             4  referring to when you say "the commercial context of

             5  this earnout provision"?

             6      A.   The commercial context, as you said earlier,

             7  they were selling mineral that produces soda ash.

             8      Q.   Okay.

             9      A.   And so as a general rule in a transaction,

            10  you've got to understand the commercial context of the

            11  transaction to see what works.  There's a lot of

            12  implications in a contract that both parties are

            13  implying that -- that may not be referenced in a

            14  contract.

            15      Q.   Okay.  So when you say "the commercial context

            16  of this earnout provision," you're referring simply to

            17  the fact that this was a commercial contract between the

            18  parties over the sale of a mineral extraction business?

            19                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, misstates

            20  testimony.

            21      A.   The commercial context of -- I'd say yes and

            22  the commercial context of the tax reorganization that --

            23  that was being discussed by them.

            24      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Oh, so the -- the tax

            25  reorganization is an important part of the context?



                                                                      93

             1      A.   It's the supportive part.  It supports my

             2  understanding of the -- of the way these words would be

             3  used.  That if you're -- if you're permitting a

             4  successor and they -- they've reorganized for tax

             5  purposes to save some taxes, that would be a common --

             6  very common successor to the assets.

             7      Q.   Well, you keep referring to supporting

             8  information or facts or factors.  And you probably know

             9  this, trial lawyers and judges are very familiar with

            10  the difference between evidence that is supportive and

            11  evidence that's the entire evidence.

            12                Typically, in an adversary procedure, the

            13  lawyers for one side look for the evidence that supports

            14  their position and minimize the evidence on the other

            15  side.

            16                Is that how you're using supporting

            17  evidence?

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            19      A.   Boy, that was a long question.

            20                The -- my understanding of this language

            21  is the understanding of the words affiliate, ceases to

            22  own, equity ownership interest, successor, the net

            23  revenues.  On that one, you look up what the definition

            24  is in the contract.  But on the others, you -- they're

            25  -- they're common words.



                                                                      94

             1                And then I'm saying that the successor, I

             2  would conclude, would be successor to that business.  As

             3  long as that business stays in the network, the

             4  consolidated group of NRP, then there hasn't been a

             5  cease to own, or there's been no transfer outside the

             6  ownership -- the equity ownership of that interest.

             7                On the other hand, the discussion of the

             8  tax reorganization, the fact the parties talked about

             9  it, discussed it, means that it was something very

            10  specific that the parties understood, contemplated as

            11  opposed to that they were drafting to cover all the

            12  circumstances that might diminish the net revenues, this

            13  was a specific thing that had been discussed.  And so --

            14      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  How many times was it

            15  discussed?

            16      A.   If it was discussed once, it was discussed.

            17      Q.   So it was discussed once?

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            19      A.   Based on the readings of their depositions,

            20  there was at least a meeting -- there was a discussion

            21  between NRP and Anadarko and then there was another

            22  discussion between OCI and NRP and then there was

            23  another discussion which all three of them attended.

            24      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.

            25      A.   They had that discussion.



                                                                      95

             1      Q.   So Anadarko was involved in two communications

             2  about the tax reorganization?

             3                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             4      A.   Based -- based upon one party's testimony, yes.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Well, what else do you have to

             6  look at?  Is there some other --

             7      A.   No.  No.

             8      Q.   -- point of view?

             9      A.   No.  No.

            10      Q.   So all you know about are --

            11      A.   Yes.

            12      Q.   -- there were two times?

            13      A.   I'm not arguing the facts that it was

            14  discussed.  I'm saying that based on his testimony --

            15      Q.   Okay.

            16      A.   -- that's -- that's what --

            17      Q.   And -- and to what depth was it discussed?

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Any idea?

            20      A.   No.

            21      Q.   Okay.  Not important to you or opinions?

            22      A.   No, it's -- but it -- it's -- it's just -- it's

            23  just supportive that there was a -- there was a

            24  discussion of understanding that this may happen and

            25  that there was no -- no one stood up and screamed and



                                                                      96

             1  said by God, we're going to put that directly in the

             2  contract.

             3                I mean, the point about Steve Turner, I

             4  mean, if you're going to put into a contract that Steve

             5  Turner's termination is going to trigger the cessation

             6  of the earnout, then it's -- it's very specific.

             7                So you've got general language to protect

             8  the general purpose, which would be things that would

             9  diminish the net revenues.  And then you've got specific

            10  things that if you're going to have something that

            11  causes a trigger of a lot of money, loss or gain, then

            12  the contract would generally be very specific about

            13  that.

            14      Q.   Okay.  But your recollection in Mr. Turner's

            15  case was that the -- the heat treating business that got

            16  sold to the Russians was owned by another company that

            17  Mr. Turner was involved in?

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Correct?

            20      A.   That the seller of the -- of the Texas Tubular

            21  was owned by another company that Mr. Turner controlled,

            22  yes.

            23      Q.   So were the Russians successors to that other

            24  company?

            25      A.   The Russians were --



                                                                      97

             1                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             2      A.   -- the successors.  They bought the company.

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Right.  And as you understand

             4  the term successors, they were successors to the company

             5  that sold the com -- the Texas Tubular?

             6      A.   They bought the company from -- Texas Tubular

             7  from them.

             8      Q.   Right.  And they were, therefore, that other

             9  company's successors?

            10      A.   Correct.

            11      Q.   That's your view?

            12      A.   And therefore, Mr. Turner no longer had any

            13  economic interest in the Russian company.

            14      Q.   Mr. Turner never had an interest in the Russian

            15  company, did he?

            16      A.   No.

            17      Q.   But he had an interest in the company that sold

            18  Texas Tubular?

            19                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            20      A.   He had an interest in the company that sold

            21  Texas Tubular.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And whatever that company was

            23  that sold Texas Tubular, your view is that the Russians

            24  were a successor to that other company that sold Texas

            25  Tubular to them?



                                                                      98

             1      A.   The Russians were a successor by purchase, yes.

             2      Q.   A successor by purchase?

             3      A.   Yes.

             4      Q.   So is the by purchase an important part of your

             5  opinion?

             6      A.   I mean, there's a lot of ways to be a successor

             7  to a -- to a company.

             8      Q.   Okay.  Back to the commercial context.

             9                I think you have told me so far that there

            10  are two things you can point to as the context.  One was

            11  a contract over a commercial mineral extraction

            12  operation; and two, the parties in your opinion

            13  discussed a tax reorganization sometime down the road.

            14                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Anything else that's a part of

            16  the commercial context that you're talking about here

            17  as --

            18      A.   No.

            19      Q.   -- the basis of your opinion?

            20                Then you say the -- aside from your

            21  experience in the commercial context, the other basis

            22  for your opinion is your understanding of the common

            23  usage of business people and business law practitioners.

            24                Do you see that?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                      99

             1      Q.   How do you define business people?

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             3      A.   Executives in company, people that own the

             4  companies that are people that I've worked with.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Does being a member of the

             6  group business people require any kind of degree?

             7      A.   No.

             8      Q.   What distinguishes the common usage of business

             9  people from the common usage of the rest of us?

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            11      A.   The rest -- the rest of us?  Just the people

            12  that would be the people that I've worked with who were

            13  executives buying or selling companies.

            14      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  I understand that's what you're

            15  -- I'm trying to figure out, well, what is different

            16  about the way business people use language and the way

            17  everybody else uses language that's relevant to your

            18  opinions.

            19      A.   On this point, I'm not sure that there's a

            20  distinction.

            21      Q.   Okay.  So you're not giving an opinion that any

            22  of the words or phrases used in section 2.6(e) are

            23  usages of trade among business people?

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            25      A.   I am not -- are you saying I'm not arguing that



                                                                     100

             1  -- I think it was a double negative, so repeat your

             2  question.

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Are -- are you saying that any

             4  of the words or phrases used in section 2.6(e) are

             5  usasegs -- usages of trade among the group you're

             6  calling business people?

             7                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             8      A.   I mean, I think business people and meaning

             9  people in companies and lawyers and accountants all use

            10  generally the same language; whereas, you know, maybe

            11  someone working on a oil rig may not reference something

            12  as equity ownership interest.  But I think business

            13  people that understand financial statements and

            14  generally look at companies and look at them in the

            15  context of financial statements would use those -- those

            16  terms commonly, yes.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Are there words or

            18  phrases in section 2.6(e) that you think are so

            19  regularly observed in the vocation of business peopling,

            20  of being a business person, that they have a definite

            21  meaning based on its usage in that vocation or business?

            22                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            23      A.   You know, I really do believe that equity

            24  ownership interest is generally used as a common word

            25  referencing your, you know, shareholders' equity section



                                                                     101

             1  of your balance sheet.  You're a 50 percent owner, so

             2  you're -- I've got a 50 percent equity ownership

             3  interest in that warehouse or soda ash operation.

             4      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Would a business law

             5  practitioner include somebody like Mr. Hogan who was

             6  trained as a lawyer and worked for law firms in their

             7  corporate departments and then worked as general counsel

             8  and vice president of NRP?

             9      A.   Yes.

            10      Q.   Would that also encompass the lawyers at Vinson

            11  Elkins and Akin Gump who worked on the transaction?

            12      A.   Yes.

            13      Q.   What distinguishes the common usage of business

            14  law practitioners from the common usage of the rest of

            15  us?

            16      A.   I'm not sure what you mean by the rest of us.

            17      Q.   People who aren't business law practitioners.

            18      A.   You don't consider yourself a business law

            19  practitioner?

            20      Q.   I'm a trial lawyer.

            21      A.   Okay.  I -- you know, a business law

            22  practitioner, business people generally think in terms

            23  and talk in terms of their -- the financial statements

            24  that reflect their business operations.

            25      Q.   Are you suggesting that there are any words or



                                                                     102

             1  phrases in 2.6(e) that are usages of trade among

             2  business law practitioners?

             3                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             4      A.   I think equity ownership is -- are two words

             5  that are routinely used to reference someone's ownership

             6  in an operation.

             7                It would be obviously more commonly used

             8  by -- when you're referencing small, you wouldn't see a

             9  shareholder of Exxon go, oh, I'm an X percent equity

            10  ownership of that asset.

            11                But you would see business people on a

            12  common -- very common reference that I'm an -- I have an

            13  equity ownership in that warehouse soda ash operation,

            14  tubular goods company.

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  So you know the -- the term or

            16  the phrase term of art?

            17      A.   Yes.

            18      Q.   The term of art refers to a kind of usage of

            19  trade among lawyers.

            20      A.   Okay.

            21      Q.   Fair enough?

            22      A.   Yes.

            23      Q.   It's a term that has a particular meaning.

            24  When lawyers see it, they know what they're talking

            25  about even though maybe the rest of us other people



                                                                     103

             1  don't.

             2      A.   Okay.

             3      Q.   Okay.  Do you agree?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             5      A.   I generally agree.

             6      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  So if a business law

             7  practitioner used a word or a phrase in a contract in a

             8  way that was different from its term of art meaning in a

             9  contract, would you expect the business law practitioner

            10  to point out that different meaning in the contract?

            11      A.   I mean, that's, you know, it's a hypothetical.

            12  But, you know, it really depends on the circumstances of

            13  drafting the contract.  But I get your point generally

            14  about term of art.

            15      Q.   Right.  Well, you said, for example, that the

            16  section 9.10, something that you commonly here referred

            17  to as an entireties clause.

            18      A.   Correct.

            19      Q.   If you decided to use the phrase entireties

            20  clause in a contract, but what you were referring to was

            21  something other than what you normally call an

            22  entireties clause, wouldn't you in some way point out

            23  the fact that you were using it differently from the

            24  normal meaning --

            25                MR. PATRICK:  Objection.



                                                                     104

             1      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  -- in the contract?

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             3      A.   I mean, it really does depend upon the facts.

             4  I mean, it's conceivable that during negotiations, they

             5  referenced it; or it's conceivable that they created a

             6  defined term.

             7                I -- I just can't really answer your

             8  question.

             9                MR. PATRICK:  Just --

            10      A.   Every -- every negotiation is very different.

            11                MR. PATRICK:  Lunch is here when you're at

            12  a stopping point.  If you want to go for --

            13                THE WITNESS:  He's doing so well, I don't

            14  want to stop him.

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Okay.

            16      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  This will -- this will

            17  be short, I think.

            18                Did you know that in 2012, the First Court

            19  of Appeals in Houston said, "The term successor in

            20  contract law is a term of art"?

            21                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            22      A.   No.

            23      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Did you know that the Court

            24  said when it's applied to corporations, it means a

            25  company that becomes invested with the rights and



                                                                     105

             1  obligations of another corporation?

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             3      A.   I mean, are you -- I really would have to see

             4  the facts of the case to understand the context of that

             5  cite.

             6      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Fair enough.

             7                But certainly, your opinion about the

             8  meaning of the word successors in section 2.6(e) is not

             9  that meaning that I just gave?

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            11      A.   I do not agree that the only use of successors

            12  is if there's a party acquiring all of that company.  I

            13  don't agree that that's what that means.

            14      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.

            15      A.   It's just generally not what successor means.

            16  It could be, but...

            17      Q.   But you know what it means to become invested

            18  with the rights and obligations of another corporation?

            19                MR. PATRICK:  Objection.

            20      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Where you assume the rights and

            21  you assume the obligations of the other corporation?

            22                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            23      A.   Yes.

            24      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  When you use -- your opinion

            25  about how a successor is being used in section 2.6(e)



                                                                     106

             1  isn't that meaning, is it?

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             3      A.   Well, it could be.

             4      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But it isn't necessarily that

             5  meaning.  You think successors is much broader than just

             6  that?

             7      A.   Yes.

             8      Q.   Okay.  Did you know that Black's Law Dictionary

             9  says that a successor, when applied to corporations,

            10  means another corporation which through amalgamation,

            11  consolidation or legal succession becomes invested with

            12  the rights and assumes the burdens of another

            13  corporation?

            14                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            15      A.   Okay.

            16      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  It doesn't surprise you, does

            17  it?

            18      A.   No.

            19      Q.   That's not the meaning of the word successor in

            20  section 2.6(e) according to your opinion?

            21      A.   According to my opinion, it could be other

            22  acquisitions of that, the entity.  I -- I see it as

            23  referencing the assets.  It's talking about the equity

            24  ownership interest of the company are its successors.

            25      Q.   But you're saying a successor, as you



                                                                     107

             1  understand it, in your opinion as used in section

             2  2.6(e) --

             3      A.   Uh-huh.

             4      Q.   -- refers to any later owner of an asset?

             5      A.   Yes.  I mean, I think that's a general fair

             6  reference.

             7      Q.   If a careful business law practitioner drafting

             8  a contract for a transaction intended the term successor

             9  in the contract to mean something different from the

            10  meaning it has as a term of art in contract law, in your

            11  experience, wouldn't that careful business law

            12  practitioner point out the different meaning?

            13                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            14      A.   It's applied to the facts.  It's -- I don't see

            15  any difference.  I don't see any difference.  If -- if

            16  those assets went from OCI Wyoming LLC to three

            17  companies afterwards, your -- your reference is still

            18  ceasing down any equity ownership interest in the

            19  companies or their successors.

            20      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Well, it's your opinion, is it

            21  not, that NRP Trona LLC is a successor to OCI Wyoming

            22  Co.?

            23      A.   It's a successor to the economic ownership

            24  interest of NRP.

            25      Q.   Okay.  So that's your -- it's not -- your



                                                                     108

             1  opinion is not that O -- that NL -- NRP Trona LLC is a

             2  successor to OCI Wyoming Co.?  You -- that's not your

             3  opinion?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, misstates

             5  testimony.

             6      A.   It's a successor to the assets of OCI Wyoming

             7  Co., yes.

             8      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But not a successor to OCI

             9  Wyoming Co. itself?

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, misstates

            11  testimony.

            12      A.   It is a successor to the equity ownership that

            13  they had in OCI Co.

            14      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But not a successor to OCI

            15  Wyoming Co. itself?

            16                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  True?

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Misstates testimony.

            19      A.   You are trying to use a definition of successor

            20  that means merger recapitalization.

            21      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  No.

            22      A.   And I'm not --

            23      Q.   I'm asking for your opinion.  You write right

            24  here, "NRP Trona LLC is a successor to OCI Co.," right?

            25      A.   Of those -- of the equity ownership interest of



                                                                     109

             1  NRP.  I see how you're reading that, and I don't --

             2      Q.   You say it's a successor because.  But you are

             3  claiming that it is a -- it's your opinion that it is

             4  a -- that NRP Trona LLC is a successor to OCI Wyoming

             5  Co.?  That's what you wrote, isn't it?

             6      A.   To the equity ownership interest of OCI Wyoming

             7  Co.  To NRP's equity interest that came out of OCI

             8  Wyoming Co., yes.

             9      Q.   But not a successor to OCI Wyoming Co. itself?

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, misstates

            11  testimony.

            12      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  I'm just trying to find out

            13  what your opinion is.

            14      A.   I appreciate that.

            15      Q.   Is -- let me ask the question cleanly.

            16                Is it your opinion that NRP Trona LLC is a

            17  successor to OCI Wyoming Co.?

            18      A.   It is a successor to the equity ownership

            19  interest that it held prior to that transaction.  And so

            20  if your question is, do I think it's the successor of

            21  N -- OCI Co., no, it's not a merged entity --

            22      Q.   Right.

            23      A.   -- which is what the definition you're trying

            24  to use.

            25      Q.   Have you used the term successor to refer



                                                                     110

             1  broadly to any entity that sedes -- succeeds to or

             2  follows another entity in ownership of a particular

             3  asset or interest in the documents memorializing any

             4  deal that you have worked on?

             5                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             6      A.   I'm sure that I have, but -- yes, I'm sure that

             7  I have, but I can't think of any.

             8      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Well, I was just going to ask

             9  you:  Would you tell me which ones?

            10      A.   No.

            11      Q.   Okay.

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Is now a good time for

            13  lunch?

            14                MR. WAWRO:  One -- give me one second

            15  here.  I just want to find it.  I'm almost ready to

            16  break.

            17                THE WITNESS:  You're ready.

            18      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  If you look at section 9.6 of

            19  the contract, which is Exhibit 48.  It's on page 37.

            20  In -- in section 9.6 headed Successors and Assigns, it

            21  says, "The provisions of this agreement shall be binding

            22  upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their

            23  respective successors and permitted assigns."

            24                Do you see that?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                     111

             1      Q.   Does the word successors in 9.6 mean the same

             2  thing as you think it means in section 2.6(e)?

             3                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             4      A.   Yes, it can be.  In this context of that

             5  particular provision, that is referencing corporate

             6  successors.  So if there had been a transfer down of

             7  those assets to another company, it would apply to

             8  that --

             9      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.

            10      A.   -- that company.

            11      Q.   So in section 9.6, successors refer to the

            12  traditional meaning of successors?

            13                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, misstates

            14  testimony.

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  True?

            16      A.   Well, I think it would.  Yeah, I do get your

            17  point, and I think it is referencing what you're --

            18  you're referencing as traditional.  But I think it's

            19  referencing that, but it could come in different forms.

            20  It could come in the form of subsidiaries, or it could

            21  come in the form of a corporate merger or

            22  recapitalization.

            23      Q.   But it doesn't mean any corporation that

            24  follows another corporation in ownership of a particular

            25  asset?



                                                                     112

             1                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             2      A.   It doesn't mean that a -- you're right, it

             3  doesn't mean a party that purchased the asset, correct.

             4      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Last question, then

             5  we'll break for lunch.

             6                On the -- on page 15 of your report in a

             7  section headed The Ultimate Merger by OCI is Irrelevant.

             8      A.   Okay.

             9      Q.   You wrote, "It's quite common for an entity to

            10  have multiple successors."

            11                Do you see that?

            12      A.   Okay.  Yes.

            13      Q.   Would you give me five real world examples of

            14  an entity that has multiple successors?

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            16      A.   Okay.  You could have a 368D reorganization

            17  where you --

            18      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  No, just real world examples.

            19  Tell me the name of the company.

            20      A.   That's real world.  You could have --

            21      Q.   I'm not talking about could have.  I'm talking

            22  about where you say it's quite common, so there must be

            23  a lot of examples out there where there are multiple

            24  successors.  Just give me five examples.

            25                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.



                                                                     113

             1      A.   Well, there's a whole code section devoted to

             2  it, so I would say that that's fairly common that it

             3  occurs, so, yes.

             4      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  I'm not arguing with you

             5  whether it's common or not.  I'm saying because you say

             6  it's common, just tell me the names of five companies

             7  where that's the case.

             8                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, asked and

             9  answered.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Or one.  Start with one, and

            11  we'll go from there.

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            13      A.   Okay.  We just did a transaction last year that

            14  ended up having multiple -- after the company acquired

            15  the assets, then immediately devoted -- distributed the

            16  assets out to different companies.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.

            18      A.   So you ended up with multiple successors to

            19  the --

            20      Q.   So --

            21      A.   -- original company.

            22      Q.   So the name of the company and the name of the

            23  companies that became the successors, the multiple

            24  successors?

            25                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.



                                                                     114

             1      A.   I don't believe I can tell you that.

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Caution the witness not to

             3  reveal privileged information.

             4                THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  So you say it exists,

             6  but you can't tell me because it's privileged?

             7      A.   Well, you don't believe that section 368D is

             8  common, so it's -- it's hard for me to argue with you.

             9  The --

            10      Q.   You're not supposed to argue with me and I'm

            11  not supposed to argue with you and I apologize if I've

            12  been --

            13      A.   Okay.

            14      Q.   -- coming across that way.

            15                All I'm trying to get to is for you to

            16  give me the name so I can go check the reality of it

            17  where you say it is so common for a company -- for an

            18  entity to have multiple successors.  I'm just saying,

            19  tell me.

            20                I started with five.  I backed off to one.

            21  But the one you've given me, you can't actually tell me

            22  about because it's privileged information, so...

            23      A.   Okay.

            24      Q.   So give me another one.  One that --

            25      A.   So --



                                                                     115

             1      Q.   -- that we can check on.

             2      A.   Okay.  But it's not a sufficient answer to tell

             3  you to go read section 368D and figure out how that's a

             4  common occurrence?

             5      Q.   It is not an answer to my question.

             6      A.   Okay.  All right.  Let me think.

             7                One -- I mean, offhand I just can't think

             8  of an example of where there have been multiple

             9  divisions.  But it -- it really is very normal in an

            10  acquisition, post acquisition to divide up and end up

            11  with multiple company.

            12      Q.   Okay.

            13                MR. WAWRO:  We can break for lunch.

            14                MR. PATRICK:  Sure.

            15                MR. WAWRO:  Thanks.

            16                THE WITNESS:  Okay.

            17                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off the record at

            18  12:43 p.m.

            19                (Lunch recess taken from 12:43 p.m. to

            20  1:24 p.m.)

            21                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are on the record at

            22  1:24 p.m.

            23      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Mr. Looper, I want to turn to

            24  the part of your report where you talk about the phrase

            25  equity ownership interest.  So I'm going to ask you to



                                                                     116

             1  turn to page 8 of Exhibit 182 to your report.

             2      A.   Okay.

             3      Q.   And on that page you say that you would expect

             4  and understand the term equity ownership interest to

             5  bear its ordinary accounting standards meaning.

             6                Do you see where I read that from?

             7      A.   Yes.

             8      Q.   Okay.  Is that meaning written down in any

             9  authoritative treatise or guide?

            10      A.   No.  I don't know.  I have no idea.

            11      Q.   Is it written down anywhere other than your

            12  report?

            13      A.   No.  I don't know.  I have no idea.

            14      Q.   Okay.  What you say it means in your opinion in

            15  your report on page 8 is, "The sum of all assets and

            16  business rights and operations of a corporation or

            17  partnership, whether recorded at book value or fair

            18  market value, net of liabilities in a corporation."

            19                Is that your opinion of the meaning of

            20  equity ownership interest?

            21      A.   Yes.

            22      Q.   Isn't that actually the definition of

            23  shareholder equity?

            24      A.   It's -- it is shareholders' equity, but that's

            25  generally what people refer to as their equity



                                                                     117

             1  ownership.

             2      Q.   Right.  But the definition you wrote down is

             3  actually a definition of an accounting standards term

             4  called shareholders' equity, right?

             5                MR. PATRICK:  Object to the form.

             6      A.   Yes.

             7      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And, of course, the contract

             8  we're talking about, Exhibit 48, made specific provision

             9  for the parties to use accounting terms and give them

            10  their standard accounting meaning, didn't they?

            11                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            12      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  If you look on page 8 of

            13  Exhibit 48 in the section headed Construction, section

            14  1.2.

            15                Do you see -- do you see where we are?

            16      A.   Yes.

            17      Q.   It's headed Construction, right?

            18      A.   Okay.

            19      Q.   And you're giving opinions in this case about

            20  how this contract ought to be construed, correct?

            21                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            22      A.   I'm giving opinion on my understanding of how

            23  those phrases are generally used in common usage.

            24      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  So if you see in section

            25  1.2, I think it's subparagraph (k), it says, "All



                                                                     118

             1  accounting terms used in this agreement and not

             2  expressly defined shall have the meanings given to them

             3  under GAAP."

             4                Do you see that?

             5      A.   Correct.

             6      Q.   Okay.  GAAP being generally accepted accounting

             7  principles?

             8      A.   Correct.

             9      Q.   And if we looked for the meaning of shareholder

            10  equity under GAAP, we'd find the meaning that you have

            11  given to the term equity ownership interests, right?

            12      A.   Probably.

            13      Q.   Have you got an opinion about why the parties

            14  didn't use that handy accounting term to name the

            15  concept that you say is that handy accounting term's

            16  concept?

            17      A.   Do I have -- what's --

            18      Q.   Do you have an opinion about why they -- they

            19  chose not to use the standard accounting term,

            20  shareholder equity, if that's what they meant by equity

            21  ownership interests?

            22      A.   It would be -- it would just be very rare for

            23  someone to say that I've got a shareholder's equity in

            24  that building.  It would be very common to say I've got

            25  an equity ownership interest in that building.



                                                                     119

             1      Q.   Nevertheless, the parties did anticipate that

             2  they might use standard accounting terms?

             3      A.   Correct.

             4      Q.   And provided for that in the contract?

             5      A.   Okay.

             6      Q.   Okay.  Now, if equity ownership interest means

             7  the sum of all assets and business rights and operations

             8  of a corporation or partnership, whether recorded at

             9  book value or fair market value, net of liabilities in a

            10  corporation, if that's what it means, then has a

            11  shareholder ceased to own a portion of its equity

            12  ownership interest each time the corporation or

            13  partnership scraps or sells or discards an asset?

            14      A.   No.

            15      Q.   Why not?

            16      A.   Because you're selling -- I mean, because

            17  you're converting it from something to something.

            18      Q.   Well, in one of the examples I gave, they have

            19  scrapped it.  They didn't just --

            20      A.   Scrapped it.  Okay.

            21      Q.   Sent it to the junk.

            22      A.   Then it's depreciated and gone, yes.

            23      Q.   So they have not ceased to own it even though

            24  it's gone?

            25      A.   They've ceased to --



                                                                     120

             1                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             2      A.   They have ceased to own the asset --

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  All right.

             4      A.   -- on the balance sheet.  It's affected by an

             5  offsetting entry.

             6      Q.   So they've ceased to own the asset, but it's

             7  still there in some sense?

             8      A.   No.  There's an offsetting entry, and they've

             9  ceased to own it.

            10      Q.   They've ceased to own it.  They've got

            11  something else, but they have ceased to own a part of

            12  what they did own?

            13      A.   In that asset, yes.

            14      Q.   What if they just --

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form to the

            16  previous question.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  What if they lost it?

            18      A.   You would still have a recording of a loss

            19  entry, but the asset is gone.

            20      Q.   So they've ceased -- in that instance, they've

            21  ceased to own a portion of their equity ownership

            22  interest?

            23      A.   Yes.

            24      Q.   Okay.  If the sum of all assets and business

            25  rates and operations of a corporation is less than the



                                                                     121

             1  liabilities of that corporation, is the shareholder

             2  liable for the deficiency?

             3      A.   In a corporation, no.  In a general

             4  partnership, yes.  In a limited partnership, not the

             5  limited partner.

             6      Q.   Okay.  So in a corporation, they are not

             7  responsible for the liability if it's a negative equity

             8  situation?

             9      A.   Correct.

            10      Q.   So they don't own the liability?

            11      A.   Their equity ownership interest is their

            12  interest in the assets and business of that company.

            13      Q.   Net of the liabilities, you say?

            14      A.   It's the way it's reflected on a balance sheet.

            15      Q.   But you are saying they do not own the equity

            16  ownership interest if it is, in fact, a negative number?

            17  They don't own that?

            18      A.   No, they still own -- or yes, I guess it would

            19  be.  Yes, they still own the equity interest in that

            20  company.

            21      Q.   So how do they own it without being liable for

            22  the debt if it's negative equity?

            23      A.   Because as I pointed out in there, you could

            24  have footnote issues.  You could also have -- you could

            25  have book value versus fair market value.  There could



                                                                     122

             1  be a lot of things that are recorded at a value that's

             2  less than what their actual value is.

             3      Q.   So they own it up to the point of having to pay

             4  it, but then they don't own it?

             5      A.   No.  They own the equity interest in that

             6  business and the assets.  But you're referencing a state

             7  of a balance sheet as opposed to a state of an income

             8  statement.  And a state of a balance sheet is at a

             9  particular point in time.

            10      Q.   I didn't reference either an income statement

            11  or a balance sheet.

            12      A.   Yeah, you actually did.

            13      Q.   I'm just using your -- your terms.

            14                So let me make sure I understand.  You say

            15  a shareholder owns a proportionate share of his or its

            16  proportionate share of the assets of the company net of

            17  its liabilities?

            18      A.   No.

            19      Q.   What are you saying?

            20      A.   I'm saying that a general reference to a -- a

            21  shareholder's equity ownership interest in a company

            22  would be the business and assets generating the

            23  business, operating the business of that company that

            24  existed.

            25      Q.   Okay.  That's different from the definition you



                                                                     123

             1  wrote into your report, isn't it?

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, misstates

             3  testimony.

             4      A.   No.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Well, the -- it sounds

             6  different to me.  So let me read them and make sure

             7  we're on the same page.

             8                You say equity ownership interest means

             9  the sum of all assets and business rights and operations

            10  of a corporation or partnership, whether recorded at

            11  book value or fair market value, net of liabilities in a

            12  corporation.

            13                That's what you said it meant.

            14      A.   That would be the total equity ownership.

            15      Q.   Right.  So it's not just the business

            16  generating assets, it's the assets net of the

            17  liabilities?

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            19      A.   That's correct except you're -- I also

            20  mentioned footnotes.  A -- an asset reflected on a

            21  balance sheet is different than the -- your equity

            22  ownership in it.  You may have a negative interest in

            23  that warehouse because the liability exceeds its

            24  recorded value, but that doesn't mean that the -- you

            25  still don't have an equity interest in that warehouse



                                                                     124

             1  and whatever it produces.

             2      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  If it's producing losses, am I

             3  as the shareholder responsible for those losses?

             4      A.   No.

             5      Q.   Somebody is responsible for those losses?

             6      A.   The company is, yes.

             7      Q.   The company is?

             8      A.   Yes.

             9      Q.   So the company owns the losses, the shareholder

            10  owns the profits.  Is that your opinion?

            11      A.   No.  The shareholder owns the business and the

            12  assets that are creating the -- they're operating from

            13  the business.  That is your equity ownership.

            14      Q.   Okay.  Let me ask you this.  I think it's at --

            15  on page 7 of your report, you refer to the proportionate

            16  share of equity ownership interests that a particular

            17  shareholder has.

            18                See where it says, "Here the equity

            19  ownership interest that each stockholder of OCI Co. held

            20  prior to the internal tax reorganization was its

            21  respective proportional beneficial ownership of OCI

            22  Co.'s sole asset."

            23                Do you see where I read that from?

            24      A.   Okay.

            25      Q.   How do you determine what the proportion is?



                                                                     125

             1      A.   Well, that's -- can be complicated; it can be

             2  simple.  If you had two 50/50 shareholders, they would

             3  be 50 percent equity ownership interest.  And --

             4      Q.   What makes them 50/50 shareholders?

             5      A.   It depends on the form of the entity.

             6      Q.   Well, answer it under any form.  Just I'm

             7  trying to get you --

             8      A.   What could make --

             9      Q.   -- to tell me what makes them 50/50

            10  shareholders?

            11      A.   What could make them 50/50 shareholders?

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            13      A.   What could make them 50/50 shareholders is

            14  having --

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  They are -- in this

            16  hypothetical that you gave me, they are 50/50

            17  shareholders.  What makes them that?

            18      A.   It could be the stock that's issued.  It could

            19  be different forms of stock that is issued.  But if

            20  they're truly 50/50, then typically, they would own

            21  exactly the same form in equal proportions of -- of

            22  whatever stock or ownership certificate or indicia they

            23  have.

            24                In a partnership, it's referenced in how

            25  you define the allocation of profits and losses or



                                                                     126

             1  distributions, depending on whether you've got target

             2  methods.

             3      Q.   Well, in the case of stock in your

             4  hypothetical, whether they have their stock certificate

             5  or they've lost their stock certificate, they still own

             6  the stock, right?

             7      A.   Yes.

             8      Q.   Yeah.  The certificate doesn't define whether

             9  they own the stock?

            10      A.   Correct.

            11      Q.   They own the stock whether they have the

            12  certificate to prove it or not?

            13      A.   Correct.

            14      Q.   Now, the corporation has to recognize that

            15  ownership interest of the shareholder, the stock

            16  ownership interest.  That's one of the corporation's

            17  duties, isn't it?

            18      A.   Correct.

            19      Q.   If, for example, OCI said tomorrow that NRP's

            20  interest in Wyoming LP, in this case the limited

            21  partnership, not a shareholder as in your hypothetical,

            22  but if OCI said tomorrow that NRP's interest in Wyoming

            23  LP was 33 percent, how would you go about showing that

            24  they were wrong?

            25                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.



                                                                     127

             1      A.   You would analyze their -- with a partnership

             2  it's much more difficult than it is with a -- with a

             3  corporation typically, depending on what kind of stock

             4  certificates were issued, because you've got a capital

             5  interest, you've got a profits interest, and you've got

             6  a distribution interest, and you've got a potential loss

             7  interest.

             8                And so typically, when you can arrive at a

             9  percentage, a flat percentage, it's because you can --

            10  you can treat the -- the ownership interest and the

            11  equity -- the ownership interest and the profits

            12  interests, loss interest to be the same percentage if

            13  you're coming up with a common percentage.

            14      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But if OCI said tomorrow to

            15  NRP, you guys only own 33 percent of this NRP -- of

            16  this --

            17      A.   Wyoming LP.

            18      Q.   -- Wyoming LP, NRP, as you understand it, would

            19  have the right to go to court and insist that they

            20  actually own 49 percent, not 33 percent?

            21      A.   Correct.

            22      Q.   Because they have an ownership interest in that

            23  49 percent stake in the limited partnership?

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            25      A.   Correct.



                                                                     128

             1      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  They wouldn't have a right to

             2  go say, we own 49 percent, and you have to give me these

             3  assets that equate to 49 percent of the business, would

             4  they?

             5                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             6      A.   They would not have the right to force a

             7  redemption of their interest, you're right.

             8      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Is it your opinion that equity

             9  ownership interest means the same thing as equitable

            10  ownership interest?

            11      A.   I don't -- I don't -- equitable is -- is -- is

            12  not a word that means equity.  I wouldn't use equitable,

            13  although, I can understand myself or others using that

            14  just out of mistake.  But if I was asked how -- the

            15  question you asked me, I would not see equitable to mean

            16  equity.

            17      Q.   Right.  Because equitable and equity, they're

            18  not synon -- synonyms --

            19      A.   They're not.

            20      Q.   -- are they?

            21      A.   That's correct.

            22                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            23      A.   That's correct.

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Misstates testimony.

            25      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Did I misstate your testimony



                                                                     129

             1  there, or did I state exactly what you were trying to

             2  say?

             3      A.   Exactly what I was trying to say.

             4      Q.   Thank you.

             5                Equity, when it's used in reference to

             6  something that is owned, refers to an interest in

             7  property, right?

             8      A.   Yes.  It refers to an interest in property,

             9  yes.

            10      Q.   Equitable, on the other hand, is a word that

            11  means fairness?

            12      A.   Yes.

            13      Q.   Now, the -- the phrase equity interests is

            14  itself defined in the agreement, right?  It's on the top

            15  of page 3 of Exhibit 48.

            16      A.   Okay.  Okay.

            17      Q.   So you agree that it is defined in the

            18  agreement, equity interests?

            19      A.   Yes.

            20      Q.   Here the parties are using equity to refer to

            21  an interest in property.  And the kind of property

            22  they're talking about is set out here, capital stock,

            23  partnership or membership interest, or units and so on

            24  and so forth, right?  They've defined it?

            25      A.   They have a defined term of equity interest



                                                                     130

             1  that means capital stock, partnership or membership

             2  interest or units and any other participation that

             3  confers upon a person the right to receive a share of

             4  the profits and losses of the issuing entity.

             5      Q.   Okay.  All right.  So the right to share

             6  profits and losses of the issuing entity is a

             7  characteristic one of the rights of owning stock, for

             8  example, right?

             9      A.   Right.

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            11      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But there are other rights

            12  associated with ownership of stock than just the right

            13  to share profits and losses, true?

            14                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            15      A.   Yes.  Yes.

            16      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  For example, there's a right to

            17  vote as a shareholder, right?

            18      A.   Yes.

            19      Q.   There's a right to information, true?

            20      A.   Correct.

            21      Q.   There is a right to attend meetings of

            22  shareholders, right?

            23      A.   Now, if you call that a right, yes.

            24      Q.   Well, isn't there an obligation to hold at

            25  least once a year a meeting of shareholders?



                                                                     131

             1      A.   For a corporation?

             2      Q.   Yes.

             3      A.   Yes.

             4      Q.   And shareholders have the right to attend that

             5  meeting that has to be called every year, right?

             6      A.   Yes.

             7      Q.   One of the rights of ownership is the right to

             8  transfer that ownership, right, of stock?

             9      A.   No, not necessarily.  But, I mean, it -- it

            10  could be a right that you could have or not have, but it

            11  could be a right.

            12      Q.   And then there's the right to be recognized as

            13  a shareholder by the company.  You have that right as a

            14  shareholder, too?

            15      A.   Yes.

            16      Q.   That's part of your ownership rights?

            17      A.   Yes.

            18      Q.   Is equity ownership interest the same thing as

            19  beneficial ownership interest?

            20                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            21      A.   It probably is, yes.  Yes.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Does beneficial ownership

            23  include the right to vote shares?

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            25      A.   Normally.  Not always.  The distinction between



                                                                     132

             1  legal rights and beneficial rights are -- is really a

             2  legal distinction between your rights and property.

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But I'm talking to an expert in

             4  transactional --

             5      A.   Uh-huh.

             6      Q.   -- work.  So I'm asking you:  Does beneficial

             7  ownership carry the right to vote the shares, or does

             8  that belong to the person who has legal title?

             9                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            10      A.   It depends on the contract.

            11      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  As -- with respect to the

            12  company whose shares are held, the company only

            13  recognizes the legal owner, right?

            14      A.   Typically, unless there was a contract that --

            15  most of the instances, you're right.

            16      Q.   Well, the beneficial owner may have the right

            17  to instruct the legal owner how to vote, right?

            18      A.   All -- I'm not trying to argue with you.  I'm

            19  just saying that most separations between legal and

            20  beneficial are represented by a contract, and it depends

            21  on what that contract says.  But as a general rule, if

            22  it was simple legal title and beneficial title, then

            23  you're right, the corporation would look to the legal

            24  title on it.

            25      Q.   Similarly, the -- in selling the shares, it's



                                                                     133

             1  the legal owner of the shares who has to do the

             2  transaction, not the beneficial owner?  The beneficial

             3  owner may be able to direct it by contract, but the

             4  transaction has to be done by the legal owner, correct?

             5      A.   Yes.

             6      Q.   Is equity -- equity ownership interest the same

             7  thing as economic ownership interest?

             8      A.   We've covered that earlier.  I -- I should have

             9  in that sentence used the word equity ownership

            10  interest.  It was -- that sentence was really describing

            11  the general purposes of earnout clauses.  And typically,

            12  they're protecting the economic interest to avoid a

            13  method of circumventing the intent of the -- of the

            14  earnout.  But no, economic and equity are not synonymous

            15  terms.

            16      Q.   And economic ownership doesn't include the

            17  right to vote shares, right?

            18      A.   Generally, yes.

            19      Q.   Or to sell them?

            20      A.   Generally, yes.

            21      Q.   Okay.  I want to turn now to another part of

            22  section 2.6(e) of our purchase agreement.

            23                So in section 2.6(e) of Exhibit 48 on page

            24  11, it includes the phrase, "The equity ownership

            25  interests of either of the companies or their respective



                                                                     134

             1  successors (including the purchased interests)."

             2                Do you see that?

             3      A.   Yes.

             4      Q.   I think you refer to this part of the contract

             5  -- yeah, it's quoted in your report at the top of page 7

             6  as well.

             7      A.   Okay.

             8      Q.   Now, would you agree that the word including as

             9  used there means that purchased interests make up part

            10  of the larger thing or group of things?

            11      A.   The word including?

            12      Q.   Yes.

            13      A.   Yes.

            14      Q.   And in that phrase, what is the larger thing or

            15  group of things that the purchased interests are

            16  included within?

            17      A.   The -- the interest that the successors to the

            18  companies or the companies might have.  The successors

            19  to the company could end up owning the purchased

            20  interests or they could end up owning the assets or they

            21  could end up owning this -- this equity interest that

            22  they had at the time they entered the contract could be

            23  owned by multiple companies.

            24                But one way of ceasing to own the total

            25  equity interest could be to transfer those purchased



                                                                     135

             1  interests down into a different entity and then sell off

             2  that entity.

             3      Q.   Okay.  So you may have misheard my question.

             4                Would you agree that as it's used here in

             5  section 2.6(e), the purchased interests are included

             6  within the larger group of things that are called equity

             7  ownership interests?

             8                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             9      A.   I interpret that -- I mean, I analyzed that

            10  sentence to mean that if they cease to own -- there are

            11  multiple ways that they can cease to own the equity

            12  ownership interest.  One by dissolution, one by winding

            13  up.  Another would be by putting those purchased

            14  interests into successors.  It's coming after the word

            15  successors that putting those ownership interests into

            16  successors, the purchased interest as opposed to the

            17  assets, and then disposing of the -- the successors.

            18      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  So something here includes the

            19  purchased interests, correct?

            20      A.   A -- a method of ceasing to own --

            21      Q.   No, no, you're misunderstanding me.

            22                In -- in the actual language that you

            23  quote at the top of page 7 of your report that comes

            24  from section 2.6(e), there is a parenthetical that says

            25  "including the purchased interests."



                                                                     136

             1      A.   Uh-huh.

             2      Q.   You agreed with me that that meant purchased

             3  interests were part of a larger thing.

             4      A.   Yes.

             5      Q.   What is the larger thing in this sentence that

             6  you understand they are included within?  Isn't it they

             7  are included as part of the equity ownership interests?

             8      A.   No.

             9                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  No.  So they're not part of the

            11  equity ownership interests?

            12      A.   No.  They are -- they are included as a method

            13  of ceasing to own the equity interest.  The

            14  successors --

            15      Q.   The purchased interests are a method?

            16      A.   This -- yes.

            17      Q.   The purchased interests -- wait, wait, wait,

            18  wait.  Stop, stop, stop.

            19                Purchased interest is itself defined?

            20      A.   Yes.

            21      Q.   And it's defined in the contract as a

            22  48.51 percent general partnership interest in Wyoming LP

            23  and a specific number of common shares and a specific

            24  number of preferred shares in OCI Wyoming Co., right?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                     137

             1      Q.   So those aren't methods, those are things,

             2  right?  We agreed that shares of stock are things,

             3  right?

             4      A.   Shares of stock are things, yes.

             5      Q.   And limited or general partnership interests,

             6  those are things, too, right?

             7      A.   Yes.

             8      Q.   What in this phrase where it says those things

             9  are included in something, what are they included in?

            10  What are those things included in?

            11      A.   They're included in the method -- a potential

            12  method of ceasing to own the equity interests through

            13  any successors, whether it's the equity ownership

            14  interest directly or whether it is the purchased

            15  interests themselves.

            16      Q.   Were the purchased interests part of the equity

            17  ownership interest as the term equity ownership interest

            18  is used in Exhibit 48, the purchase agreement?

            19                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            20      A.   The purchased interest is the indicia of

            21  ownership in those entities.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  They are the indicia of

            23  ownership in those entities.  Are they part of the

            24  equity ownership interest?

            25      A.   They reflect the equity ownership interest.



                                                                     138

             1      Q.   They reflect the ownership interest.  But does

             2  that mean they're not part of the equity ownership

             3  interest?

             4      A.   This phrase says that you could cease to own

             5  the equity ownership interest.  So that could be direct

             6  sale or it could be of the company or their successors,

             7  including the purchased interest.

             8                So if this purchased interest were stuck

             9  in a -- another affiliate and you sold off that

            10  successor affiliate, then you -- you have ceased to own

            11  any of the equity interest in the companies.

            12      Q.   What if you only stuck one share of stock in

            13  there and sold it?

            14      A.   You would cease to own a piece, I presume, of

            15  the equity ownership interest.

            16      Q.   A portion?

            17      A.   A portion.

            18      Q.   Okay.  Give me a second.

            19                Let me ask you this:  In section 2.6(e),

            20  the parties agreed that it would be a trigger if buyer

            21  or its affiliate ceases to own all or any portion of the

            22  equity ownership interest either of the companies or

            23  their respective successors.

            24                Do you see that language in 2.6(e)?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                     139

             1      Q.   Does either of the companies mean either one of

             2  or does it mean both of or does it mean something else

             3  in your opinion?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             5      A.   Yeah, I really didn't comment on that largely

             6  because I understand how you could read the word either

             7  or either, either way.  But I -- I didn't see it as

             8  really that relevant because the analysis of the

             9  definition of net revenue was a consolidated interest.

            10  And the -- the operative terms of 2.6(e) was ceasing to

            11  own any portion of the equity ownership interest of the

            12  companies.

            13                And the equity ownership is the equity,

            14  all the assets, what you would -- what compiles the

            15  shareholders' equity section of your balance sheet.  And

            16  therefore, the two of those together, I just didn't see

            17  either or either as being relevant.

            18      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  So does that mean you don't

            19  have an opinion one way or the other what either means?

            20      A.   I don't see it as relevant because the --

            21      Q.   I understand that you said that it's not

            22  relevant.

            23      A.   None of -- because OCI --

            24      Q.   I just want to know, do you have an opinion

            25  about it?



                                                                     140

             1      A.   OCI Co. only owned a limited partnership

             2  interest in Wyoming LLC.  As a -- as a material matter,

             3  it only owned the limited partnership interest.

             4                So there weren't -- there weren't

             5  operating assets that remained in OCI Co. that were

             6  distributed.  So I didn't see it as pertinent to the

             7  meaning of equity ownership interest.

             8      Q.   Okay.  Now my question:  Do you have an opinion

             9  about what either means in the sentence we just read?

            10      A.   I'm expressing no opinion on that.

            11      Q.   Okay.  And you do not intend to express an

            12  opinion on that at trial?

            13      A.   I do not intend to express an opinion on that

            14  at trial.

            15      Q.   And you will apologize to me if you do?  No,

            16  no.

            17      A.   Well, except --

            18      Q.   I take that back.

            19      A.   I'm going to say except I did say that the --

            20  the reference of and the meaning behind net revenue was

            21  a consolidated group.  It was a consolidated --

            22  everything was based on the consolidated financial

            23  statements of two entities.

            24      Q.   Where does that come from?

            25      A.   The definition of net revenue.



                                                                     141

             1      Q.   When the parties looked at the transaction

             2  going in, they looked at it as revenue from two

             3  different entities.

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Didn't they?

             6      A.   No.  I mean, the -- the earnout clause

             7  references net revenues.  And net revenues is defined to

             8  be the consolidated operations, income statement,

             9  balance sheet of those two entities.  So in my opinion,

            10  that was the equity ownership interest that was being

            11  referenced by either of those companies.

            12                If some of the assets had been put into

            13  another one or a successor, those assets still

            14  constitute the equity ownership interest.

            15      Q.   Nevertheless, I am safe in leaving this

            16  deposition relying on you're telling me you are not

            17  going to express an opinion at trial that either means

            18  both?

            19      A.   At trial, I will testify that I believe that

            20  equity ownership is referring to the consolidated

            21  operations of both companies.

            22      Q.   All right.  But in the phrase that says either

            23  of the companies, are you going to say either there

            24  actually means both of the companies?

            25      A.   I, you know, I'm not expressing an opinion on



                                                                     142

             1  either.  I'm -- I'm expressing an opinion on what I

             2  believe is equity ownership interest.  And equity

             3  ownership interest is the makeup of what's referenced

             4  and appears in a consolidated balance sheet of those two

             5  companies.

             6      Q.   Okay.  Okay.  Turning back to your report at

             7  page -- it's Exhibit 182, at page 4, paragraph numbered

             8  3.

             9                Now, there in paragraph No. 3 on page 4,

            10  you identify what you call a two tiered ownership

            11  structure in which Wyoming Co. held a limited partner

            12  interest in Wyoming LP, right?

            13      A.   Yes.

            14      Q.   And you point out in your report that this two

            15  tiered ownership structure created a tax inefficiency,

            16  true?

            17      A.   I used those words because they had concluded

            18  that it was a tax inefficiency for them.  I'm -- I'm not

            19  opining on that I had analyzed to determine that in

            20  their respective, but to them it created a tax

            21  inefficiency, yes.

            22      Q.   And to "them" being who?

            23      A.   NRP.

            24      Q.   NRP.  Well, NRP --

            25      A.   Apparently OCI as well, but -- because they



                                                                     143

             1  also wanted to go forward with it.

             2      Q.   Okay.  The inefficiency you're referring to was

             3  double taxation on a portion of the income generated by

             4  the Trona operations, true?

             5      A.   Yes.

             6      Q.   Meaning money that was paid to Wyoming Co. on

             7  its limited partnership interest would be taxed at the

             8  Wyoming Co. level and then the money Co. distributed on

             9  to its owners would be taxed a second time?

            10      A.   Correct.

            11      Q.   That's the double taxation that we're talking

            12  about?

            13      A.   Correct.

            14      Q.   Did liability for federal tax at the Wyoming

            15  Co. level have any effect on how the annual earnout

            16  payments were calculated?

            17      A.   No.

            18      Q.   But you would agree that paying tax at the

            19  Wyoming Co. level or avoiding tax at the Wyoming Co.

            20  level, that wouldn't affect the amount of the annual

            21  earnout payments?

            22      A.   Correct.

            23      Q.   Okay.  Now, you have represented clients who

            24  were negotiating transactions to buy or sell operating

            25  companies, haven't you?



                                                                     144

             1      A.   Yes.

             2      Q.   Would the double taxation typically depress the

             3  amount of money someone buying the operation or a part

             4  of the operation, would it typically depress the amount

             5  they could earn?

             6      A.   It was a topic we discussed earlier.  It's very

             7  difficult to identify what a seller's value and a

             8  buyer's value are and what -- what elements compose that

             9  and what elements of risk and expectations compose that.

            10                So I don't know the basis upon which how

            11  they calculated value.

            12      Q.   Okay.  But I wasn't asking about value.  I was

            13  really just asking this:  Somebody who owned what

            14  Anadarko and Bitco owned that NRP came to own before

            15  they did the restructuring, the double taxation would

            16  lower the amount that the owner of those interests would

            17  recognize, would -- would get from the investment

            18  because some of it was going to the government as taxes,

            19  right?

            20      A.   It depends on what the valuation is.  If it's

            21  a -- you know, a public company often has very different

            22  valuations because it may be based on reserve value.

            23  And -- and if you're in EBITDA, it's -- again, it's back

            24  to value.

            25      Q.   I'm not talking about valuation.  I'm talking



                                                                     145

             1  about just the money that comes out of the pipe at the

             2  end of the day.

             3      A.   I don't think that's what you asked.

             4      Q.   Yeah.

             5      A.   I think you asked what a -- what a person would

             6  pay.

             7      Q.   No.  I said that -- wouldn't the double

             8  taxation typically depress the amount of money someone

             9  buying the purchased interest would get off of the

            10  investment?

            11      A.   Would get --

            12      Q.   Yeah.

            13      A.   -- off the investment, not would pay.  Okay.

            14                If you're asking would the -- the net tax

            15  be post acquisition depress the amount that they would

            16  get, yes.

            17      Q.   Yeah.  And the reason is, some of that money is

            18  going to the government instead of going to the owner?

            19      A.   Correct.

            20      Q.   Okay.  Now we get to what they'd be willing to

            21  pay.

            22      A.   Okay.

            23      Q.   Wouldn't you expect that that would depress the

            24  amount that somebody would be willing to pay for the

            25  investment if they were stuck with that situation?



                                                                     146

             1                MR. PATRICK:  Objection to form.

             2      A.   You know, I understand that it's logical that

             3  that would be an expense, an expected expense of the

             4  business.  But that doesn't necessarily equate into a

             5  dollar for dollar expectation of understanding of value.

             6      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Understood.  Understood.

             7                But you are familiar with the fact that

             8  buyers and sellers both, but here we're focused on the

             9  buyers, they tend to model the expected return for a

            10  given investment based on what they project the

            11  investment will produce over time?

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            13      A.   A material exception to that would be the

            14  mineral and petroleum industry.

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  In this case?

            16      A.   It's a mineral.

            17      Q.   You're saying they didn't do that here?

            18      A.   No.  I'm saying I don't know how they did their

            19  analysis.  You're assuming by your question that there's

            20  an EBITDA analysis that determines valuation.  And I'm

            21  telling you that that doesn't necessarily play in

            22  particularly in mineral acquisitions.

            23      Q.   Fair -- fair enough.

            24                But you're -- you've added a whole lot to

            25  my questions that I didn't even ask about.



                                                                     147

             1      A.   Yeah.

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form,

             3  argumentative.

             4      A.   Okay.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  As somebody who does this for a

             6  living, advises companies on buying and selling assets,

             7  isn't it true that normally, buyers try to model what

             8  they're likely to get in return on an investment over

             9  time relative to what they paid?

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            11      A.   Yes.

            12      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Yes.  So if part of the money

            13  generated by an enterprise is being paid to the

            14  government in taxes, the return on investment, all other

            15  things being equal, is going to be lower than it would

            16  be if the government were -- were not taking that chunk

            17  of money?

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            19      A.   The exception is the availability and net

            20  operating losses, the -- the comparison of passive

            21  versus active income.  There's a lot of factors that

            22  could go into that analysis.

            23                As a general rule, I understand your

            24  question.  And as a general rule, yes.

            25      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Fair enough.  And thank you for



                                                                     148

             1  that.

             2                I think part of what you're saying is, not

             3  everybody wants to avoid taxes to the maximum extent

             4  they could.  There are times when taxes are actually

             5  beneficial to you?

             6                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, misstates

             7  testimony.

             8      A.   There are times when a party can utilize them

             9  differently than another party --

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Right.

            11      A.   -- could, yes.  I'd just say that they're very

            12  seldom there's a time it's beneficial.  But to some

            13  people, it could be less harmful.

            14      Q.   Whatever the reasons for it were, if the return

            15  on investment that is modeled by the buyer is higher,

            16  the seller might be able to negotiate a higher price

            17  than if the return on investment for that same

            18  investment looks lower to the buyer?

            19                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            20      A.   I mean, again, you're just -- you're assuming

            21  that that's a -- a key factor in determining valuation.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  No.  I'm just assuming it's

            23  sort of common sense that if -- if -- if the way I model

            24  as I'm a perspective buyer shows one return on

            25  investment at a given price, and that given price is



                                                                     149

             1  higher than the buyer has asked for, the buyer -- I

             2  mean, the seller might up the price to capture more of

             3  that value?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             5      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  It's common sense, isn't it?

             6                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             7      A.   It is common sense that taxes are an expense of

             8  operations.

             9      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  You believe that

            10  Anadarko had elected not to solve the double taxation

            11  issue in the past because its tax position would make a

            12  change to the structure disadvantageous, correct?

            13      A.   Yes.

            14      Q.   And that is something that you wrote down in

            15  your report on page 6?

            16      A.   Yes.  It was from one of the depositions

            17  that --

            18      Q.   Okay.

            19      A.   -- said that.

            20      Q.   I mean not page 6, paragraph 6.  Sorry.

            21                Do you have an understanding of what the

            22  tax position was that led to Anadarko's reluctance?

            23      A.   I reached a conclusion based on that comment.

            24      Q.   And what was the conclusion?

            25      A.   That their tax basis was different because the



                                                                     150

             1  transaction itself creates a tax.  And therefore, the

             2  redemption is going to create a tax; or getting rid of

             3  that entity and forming the two of them into the LP only

             4  is going to create a tax.  And therefore, the -- it's

             5  beneficial to you if that tax increases your basis.

             6                And so if -- it depends on the basis of

             7  the party whether that's really going to have any

             8  benefit or not.

             9      Q.   And was it your understanding that Anadarko had

            10  a very low, perhaps even negative, tax basis in the

            11  property?

            12      A.   I'm not assuming what their basis was.  It's

            13  just that their calculation of -- and actually, there's

            14  two factors.  I would say their calculation of what

            15  their tax they would have to pay in the transaction and

            16  possibly, also, the second factor, the period of time

            17  they intended to hold it after that for any tax benefit

            18  did not make sense to them.

            19      Q.   Right.  But you did read in the depositions, I

            20  take it, about the restructuring aspects of this and the

            21  negotiations and discussions about it?

            22      A.   My recollection of the sentence was that they

            23  made a reference to their basis because their basis, it

            24  didn't make any sense.

            25      Q.   Right.  Mr. Smith testified that they have a



                                                                     151

             1  negative basis in Wyoming Co.

             2      A.   (Witness nods head.)

             3      Q.   So any gain from eliminating the double

             4  taxation would be offset by the tax on the gain from

             5  doing so?

             6      A.   Okay.

             7      Q.   Does that accord with your understanding of

             8  what the situation was?

             9      A.   Yeah.  I mean, I wasn't -- I really didn't

            10  analyze exactly why, but I also would have interpreted

            11  that to mean that they were going to have to pay tax and

            12  that whatever benefit that may be realized over time was

            13  outside their time horizon.  I just read into that.

            14                But again, that was my conclusion without

            15  asking anybody about that.

            16      Q.   Now, a buyer of Anadarko and Bitco's interests

            17  wouldn't have that problem because their tax basis would

            18  reflect the price they paid --

            19      A.   Correct.

            20      Q.   -- to acquire, right?

            21      A.   Correct.

            22      Q.   Okay.  According to your review of the evidence

            23  for purposes of your report, you believe that NRP wanted

            24  to eliminate the tax inefficiency if they completed the

            25  proposed transaction with Anadarko, true?



                                                                     152

             1      A.   I concluded that they intended to do it because

             2  they did it so quickly after the transaction.

             3      Q.   Okay.

             4      A.   And because they paid Deloitte to go through

             5  that process.

             6      Q.   Okay.  You also believe that OCI also wanted to

             7  eliminate the tax inefficiency, did you not?

             8      A.   I concluded that they wanted to go forward with

             9  it because they approved it.

            10      Q.   Okay.  In -- in paragraph 6 of your report on

            11  page 5, you refer -- you reference to these points about

            12  what the parties wanted, you refer to deposition

            13  testimony.

            14                Do you see that?

            15      A.   Yes.

            16      Q.   Okay.  So you concluded that NRP wanted to

            17  eliminate the tax inefficiency?  Yes?

            18      A.   I concluded that NRP wanted to eliminate the

            19  tax inefficiency, yes.

            20      Q.   You concluded that OCI also wanted to eliminate

            21  the tax inefficiency?

            22      A.   Yes.

            23      Q.   And you concluded from something that Anadarko

            24  knew that both NRP and OCA -- OCI wanted to eliminate

            25  the tax inefficiency if NRP completed the proposed



                                                                     153

             1  transaction?

             2      A.   Yes.

             3      Q.   And how did you conclude that?

             4      A.   One of these depositions referenced that --

             5  I've forgotten if it was the NRP deposition or the

             6  Anadarko deposition -- that they had mentioned that OCI

             7  would be likely to want to go through with that because

             8  they wanted to do it with us, and it wasn't approved.

             9      Q.   So as you understand the situation during these

            10  negotiations over the sale of these interests, Anadarko

            11  in the position of seller knew that NRP wanted to make a

            12  change to the structure so as to eliminate the tax

            13  inefficiency?

            14      A.   I knew -- I believed that they knew that they

            15  -- it was a possibility, and it was an issue that was

            16  raised in the discussion, yes.

            17      Q.   And you also believe from your review of the

            18  evidence that Anadarko knew that OCI was willing to

            19  engage in discussions about doing exactly that change to

            20  the structure, whatever it was, but a change to the

            21  structure to eliminate the double taxation?

            22      A.   Yes.

            23      Q.   Okay.  You also understood from reviewing the

            24  evidence that NRP, if it became the buyer of the

            25  interests that Anadarko was selling, they couldn't



                                                                     154

             1  control whether or not to restructure.  OCI was in

             2  control of such a decision because it was the majority

             3  owner, right?

             4      A.   Correct.

             5      Q.   Would there be anything, in your opinion,

             6  immoral or unethical or irrational about structuring the

             7  purchase agreement so that NRP would pay extra

             8  compensation to Anadarko if the structure were changed

             9  so as to eliminate the tax inefficiency post

            10  acquisition?

            11                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            12      A.   That was a long question.  No.

            13      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  It wouldn't be immoral, it

            14  wouldn't be unethical, and it wouldn't be irrational for

            15  the parties to agree to that?

            16      A.   Correct.

            17      Q.   Do you know how much money NRP -- NRP has been

            18  able to keep because the restructuring eliminated the

            19  double taxation?

            20      A.   It was my -- it was my understanding that the

            21  cost savings going forward would be about a million a

            22  year.  But I -- that -- the numbers weren't relevant to

            23  me.  Apparently, they -- they concluded that it was a

            24  positive and, therefore, over time, it was going to be

            25  beneficial.



                                                                     155

             1      Q.   Have you by any chance examined the report of

             2  NRP's expert, Courtney Chlebus?

             3      A.   I don't believe that was in the materials that

             4  I received.

             5      Q.   Do you know that Ms. Chlebus says that NRP has

             6  kept in the first four and a half years $8.4 million

             7  that it wouldn't have kept if it hadn't done the

             8  restructure?

             9      A.   Okay.  I was not aware of that.

            10      Q.   Even in a transaction worth $292 million,

            11  that's not chump change, is it?

            12      A.   It depends on how much money they had to pay

            13  for the tax reorganization.

            14      Q.   And you agree that the economic value of the

            15  restructuring to NRP is not reflected in the computation

            16  of the annual earnout payments?

            17      A.   Correct.

            18      Q.   But the amount of the annual earnout payments

            19  actually paid by NRP is subtracted from the contingent

            20  purchase price buyout payment amount?

            21      A.   Correct.

            22      Q.   Do you have a view about why the parties agreed

            23  to cap the contingency buyout payment at 50 million

            24  instead of a bigger amount or a smaller amount?

            25      A.   Only my general practitioner's experience of



                                                                     156

             1  the way that that cap usually develops.

             2      Q.   Other than avoiding taxes at the Wyoming Co.

             3  level, were there other effects of the restructuring?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             5      A.   Other than the tax savings, was there other --

             6  were there other effects?  Is that the question?

             7      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Yeah.

             8      A.   I did not -- I'm not aware of any material

             9  effect.  I'm not aware of any material assets that left

            10  the consolidated group.  That was what I was analyzing.

            11      Q.   Well, wasn't eliminating the preferential

            12  payment right one of the effects of the restructuring?

            13                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            14      A.   Well, the -- yes, but the parties agreed that

            15  the restructuring of the limited partnership interest

            16  for that was the equivalent of the effect.  And the only

            17  way to make that calculation is to understand the

            18  business and to understand what you're expected --

            19  expectation of -- of revenues would be.

            20      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But wasn't eliminating that

            21  preferential right and trans -- transmuting it into

            22  something else, wasn't that one of the purposes of the

            23  restructuring?

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            25      A.   I did not understand it to be a purpose of the



                                                                     157

             1  restructuring.  It was an effect of the restructuring.

             2      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Why did they do it if it wasn't

             3  a purpose?

             4                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             5      A.   I reached a professional conclusion on that,

             6  but I have no --

             7      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Let me hear it.

             8      A.   I have no reason.  My professional conclusion

             9  is that they -- that Deloitte concluded that they needed

            10  to simply split the interest.  And it's not easy to

            11  split a preferential payment because it would continue.

            12  And so it was much easier to split it into a common

            13  interest, which in the way that the offsetting

            14  allocations, the distribution provisions were, which is

            15  under the target method of allegations in the

            16  distribution provisions, the -- there's an offset of the

            17  -- of that preferential payment.

            18                So I gathered that -- my professional

            19  opinion was that they -- Deloitte says we have to report

            20  a value.  It's got to be a fair value.  And therefore,

            21  it's easier to create that into a limited partnership

            22  interest that's merely divided.

            23      Q.   Who was Deloitte representing?

            24      A.   I don't know.  I presume the entity, but I

            25  don't know.



                                                                     158

             1      Q.   Which entity?

             2      A.   OCI Wyoming or -- I don't know.  One of those

             3  two.  I don't know.  I don't know who they represented.

             4      Q.   They weren't representing NRP?

             5      A.   I don't know that.  I don't know who --

             6      Q.   Okay.

             7      A.   -- they represented.

             8      Q.   So other than your -- when you say you made a

             9  professional judgment, that means this is my educated

            10  guess about it?

            11      A.   My educated guess as to why they converted the

            12  preferential payment structure into a single limited

            13  partnership interest was likely because the revenue

            14  stream was going to be enough to achieve the payout, and

            15  therefore, was easy to convert that into a limited

            16  partnership interest.

            17      Q.   But I guess why get rid of it if you don't need

            18  to get rid of it or you don't want to get rid of it?

            19      A.   Because it's much easier to determine a

            20  valuation of -- of what that 1 percent was as a limited

            21  partnership interest --

            22      Q.   So --

            23      A.   -- from a -- from a tax standpoint.

            24      Q.   Could OCI and NRP have solved the double tax

            25  issue without NRP ceasing to own any of the OCI Wyoming



                                                                     159

             1  Co. stock it bought from Anadarko?

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             3      A.   You know, I presume that they could have in

             4  your hypothetical.  It depends on how they did it, but I

             5  presume they could have created the shell, kept one

             6  share, kept something, kept all the shares, and created

             7  a shell, and it had no effective ownership in it.  There

             8  was nothing left in it.  I presume they could have done

             9  that.  It would be a useless step.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  All right.  They could have

            11  just rearranged things so that the 1 percent limited

            12  partnership interest that Wyoming Co. owned in Wyoming

            13  LP no longer was entitled to any share of the revenues

            14  or the profits and losses?

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            16      A.   Yes, they could have done that.  They could

            17  have done that by April of any year.  You're right.

            18  That would be a way they could have done it.  It would

            19  have achieved the same effect, but you're right.

            20      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Could OCI and NRP have

            21  converted Wyoming Co. into a partnership and retained

            22  their respective shares of the equity in the form of

            23  partnership interests?

            24      A.   No.  I mean, it would have still been taxed.

            25  It wouldn't have any -- it wouldn't have had a -- there



                                                                     160

             1  would be no -- again, it would just be a useless debt.

             2  It wouldn't have any effect of -- you'd still have two

             3  entities then with a partnership interest, but it still

             4  would result in a tax the -- the same as --

             5      Q.   It would still have the double taxation?

             6      A.   The same as -- well, it would have still had

             7  the -- it would have still had the redemption tax effect

             8  if I heard -- if I understand you right.  If they had

             9  just recapitalized OCI Co. into a partnership?  Is that

            10  what you're saying?

            11      Q.   Yeah.

            12      A.   Yeah, it would have been -- it still would have

            13  been a taxable amount.

            14      Q.   The restructuring, that kind of restructuring

            15  would be a taxable event; but they would eliminate the

            16  double taxation problem, wouldn't they?

            17      A.   Yes.  And the same -- the same -- they would

            18  have had the same effect, you're right.

            19      Q.   Do you know how much --

            20                MR. PATRICK:  We've been going for a

            21  little over an hour.  Good time for a break?

            22                MR. WAWRO:  Sure.

            23                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off the record at

            24  2:29 p.m.

                                                                     161

             1                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're on the record at

             2  2:44 p.m.

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Mr. Looper, can you tell me how

             4  the preferential payment right works?

             5      A.   How the what works?

             6      Q.   The preferential payment right.  Remember I was

             7  asking before we broke about was that -- was getting rid

             8  of that one of the purposes of the restructuring.  Just

             9  asking you, can you tell me how it worked?

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Object to form.

            11      A.   I mean, I didn't study it, but I think

            12  generally, it was a preferential payment that went up to

            13  OCI Co. of a particular amount.  And then in the way the

            14  share ownership from OCI Co. worked is that a particular

            15  level of those revenues went out to the Anadarko side

            16  and the balance let 80/20.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  So there were like two

            18  sets of preferential rights that got eliminated in the

            19  restructuring?

            20                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            21      A.   Yeah.  Yes.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But getting rid of them was

            23  not, as far as you understand, the purpose at all of

            24  doing the restructuring?

            25                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.



                                                                     162

             1      A.   I believed that it was not, based on my

             2  professional conclusion, that they analyzed the limited

             3  partnership interest that was issued in exchange for

             4  that bottom line number -- the bottom line preferential

             5  distribution right was equal to the 13.6 percent limited

             6  partnership interest or 19.6 percent limited partnership

             7  interest that was issued in exchange for that.

             8      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Certainly, eliminating the

             9  preferential right that it was associated with the

            10  preferred shares could have -- would have an effect on

            11  the timing of payments under certain circumstances?

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            13      A.   Under certain circumstances, it could have an

            14  effect.

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Have you looked at how

            16  the debt restructuring took place?

            17      A.   No.

            18                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Do you have any opinions about

            20  it?

            21      A.   My opinion about 2.6(e) and all of 2.6, that it

            22  was irrelevant to the debt of the company.

            23      Q.   Do you know how much NRP actually ended up

            24  paying Anadarko in the transaction?

            25      A.   No.  I know it was about -- I know it was about



                                                                     163

             1  310 million for the purchase, and then there was about

             2  another 11 million in annual contingent payments.

             3      Q.   Well, I mean, didn't they actually end up

             4  paying -- leaving aside the earnout, didn't they

             5  actually end up paying 292.5 million?

             6      A.   I -- I didn't analyze the amount that got paid.

             7      Q.   Well, if you look at Exhibit 48, Exhibit A, the

             8  settlement statement.

             9      A.   Okay.  Can I just assume that you're right?

            10      Q.   Yeah.  I mean, the agreed price in the contract

            11  was 310, but then there were deductions from that.  So

            12  the money that actually changed hands in cash was 292.5.

            13  I'm just asking you to confirm that.

            14      A.   And I'll -- I'll take your word for it, and I

            15  see I think I found it.  I take your word for it, but it

            16  was based on contractual adjustments.

            17      Q.   Okay.  And did you know that through July 26th

            18  of 2019, roughly four and a half years' worth of

            19  ownership, NRP has received distributions on that

            20  investment of more than $251 million?

            21      A.   No.

            22      Q.   If that's the case, you'd agree NRP got a

            23  pretty good deal, wouldn't you?

            24                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            25      A.   I would agree that that was a good investment.



                                                                     164

             1      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Yeah.  Turning back to your

             2  report, Exhibit 182.  I think it's at pages 11 and 12,

             3  you have a section entitled Tax Cooperation Obligation.

             4  Are you there?

             5      A.   Yes.

             6      Q.   You state that in your opinion, this provision,

             7  section 7.2, requires Anadarko to generally cooperate

             8  and support the procedures and efforts of NRP to effect

             9  tax savings.  And then you give the opinion that

            10  Anadarko has breached its obligations under section 7.2,

            11  right?

            12      A.   I think they -- I don't remember saying

            13  savings, but maybe I did.  I don't remember saying it

            14  the way you just said it, but --

            15      Q.   Okay.  If you look --

            16      A.   -- I'm happy to answer the general question.

            17      Q.   Well, look at the bottom of page 11, the

            18  sentence that begins "in my opinion."

            19      A.   Okay.

            20      Q.   You say, "In my opinion, this provision

            21  obligates Anadarko to generally cooperate and support

            22  the procedures and efforts of NRP to effect tax savings

            23  by effecting the internal tax reorganization in a

            24  circumstance where such reorganization does not increase

            25  Anadarko's taxes."



                                                                     165

             1      A.   Okay.  Yes.

             2      Q.   Okay.  So that part is yes.

             3                And then you go on to say in your opinion,

             4  this is a breach.  That Anadarko has breached its

             5  obligations.

             6      A.   I think this provision obligates the other

             7  party to cooperate in tax matters.  And as a general

             8  rule, it is generally assumed that to mean that as long

             9  as it doesn't affect the other party, they'll cooperate

            10  with them to -- in their tax filings, their -- whatever

            11  it is that they are trying to do to effect the tax

            12  structuring.  As most often, it's related to agreeing on

            13  basis analysis, but it could be any number of tax type

            14  proceedings.

            15      Q.   As long as they're asked to do it, right?

            16      A.   Yes.

            17      Q.   When were they asked to do it?

            18      A.   I would say that they were asked to do it after

            19  Anadarko contacted them and said, you've effected this

            20  tax reorganization, we're triggering our earnout.

            21      Q.   Right.

            22      A.   And so their position would be that we want you

            23  to cooperate with that, you knew about this.  I don't

            24  know, I wasn't there.  But you're right, if -- if there

            25  was any request of them to cooperate with them, that



                                                                     166

             1  would be it.

             2                And so I probably jumped to a conclusion

             3  that in that first discussion, they certainly would have

             4  said that's just the same reorganization that we talked

             5  about.

             6      Q.   Well, they never talked about a specific

             7  reorganization, did they?

             8                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             9      A.   It was my understanding that they did.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  You did tell me that you

            11  had read -- that you focused in the depositions on parts

            12  having to do with section 2.6(e) and also the sections

            13  having to do with the tax reorganization, right?

            14      A.   Yes.

            15      Q.   Okay.  So who asked you to give the opinion

            16  that you have expressed in the report that Anadarko's

            17  position in this litigation is a breach of Anadarko's

            18  obligations under the purchase agreement?

            19      A.   No one.

            20      Q.   It is not a position that your client has

            21  advanced in this litigation, is it?

            22      A.   I'm not aware whether they have or have not.

            23      Q.   Well, you looked at the -- their Answer.

            24      A.   I looked at their Answer.  It was not.

            25      Q.   It doesn't include any counterclaim asserting



                                                                     167

             1  that Anadarko breached the agreement by failing to

             2  cooperate in the manner you suggest, does it?

             3      A.   Correct.

             4      Q.   Now, is the question whether a party has

             5  breached a contractual obligation a proper subject of

             6  expert evidence in your experience?

             7                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             8      A.   It -- it was -- no.

             9      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Let's go back then.  We

            10  were just touching on it a second ago.

            11                On page 9 of your report, you say that the

            12  parties -- and this is the last paragraph on page 9.

            13                You say the parties "did not expressly

            14  include such tax reorganization as a buyout trigger

            15  event."

            16                Do you see where I read that?

            17      A.   The last paragraph?

            18      Q.   Yeah.

            19      A.   Yes.

            20      Q.   You then say that, "Had the parties intended

            21  for a tax restructuring like the internal tax

            22  reorganization be a buyout trigger event, they would

            23  have expressly defined it as such in the contract."

            24                Do you see where you wrote that?

            25      A.   Yes.



                                                                     168

             1      Q.   Now, based on your experience as a

             2  transactional and tax attorney and informed by the facts

             3  and circumstances of the transaction, how would you have

             4  written section 2.6(e) to make clear that the

             5  restructuring was a buyout trigger event?

             6                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             7      A.   The language would be -- it's -- it's so to me

             8  out of the realm of what would normally trigger an

             9  earnout clause like the termination of Steve Turner.

            10  That would not -- that is an event that objectively

            11  someone may not see that as something that directly

            12  affects the earnout.

            13                So I think generally any -- any

            14  manipulation of the economics to effect the earnout is

            15  going to try to get covered by the earnout clause.

            16                Any trigger events that are specific and

            17  that would not be something that affects the economics

            18  would be -- need to be very specific or it turned out to

            19  be a penalty.  Just turns out to be something -- it

            20  would have to be specific or it just wouldn't be read

            21  into the agreement that that was intended, if you're

            22  looking at language that's broad.

            23      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  Let me go back to my

            24  question.

            25                You gave the -- you give the opinion here,



                                                                     169

             1  what you say is your opinion as an experienced

             2  transactional and tax attorney informed by the facts and

             3  circumstances of this traction -- transaction and the

             4  ordinary business meaning of the terms employed in the

             5  contract, your opinion you say is that if the parties

             6  had intended for a tax restructuring like the one that

             7  happened to be a buyout trigger event, they would have

             8  expressly defined it as such in the contract.

             9                That's the opinion you've given, right?

            10      A.   Okay.  Yes.

            11      Q.   How would you have done that if it was your

            12  intention to have a tax restructuring like the internal

            13  tax reorganization be a buyout trigger event?  How would

            14  you have defined it to make sure that everybody

            15  understood it was?

            16                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            17      A.   You could have removed affiliate in the

            18  sentence or possibly they could have had a specific

            19  sentence stating that any transaction intended to

            20  improve the tax position of NRP would trigger the

            21  buyout.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And if the response was this

            23  restructuring, although it had the effect of improving

            24  the tax position, it wasn't intended to do that.  It was

            25  intended to get rid of the preferential payment rights.



                                                                     170

             1  You'd say it wasn't a buyout trigger event because you

             2  couldn't prove what the intent of the restructuring was?

             3                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             4      A.   I -- I do not know the intent.  The effect may

             5  have been to get rid of that buy -- the preferential

             6  payment.  But the distribution method in the agreement,

             7  because the percentages ended up being the same that

             8  they started out being, the parties must have understood

             9  that the economics are going to achieve the preferential

            10  payment and therefore, it didn't affect the overall 49,

            11  51 percent.

            12      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But I'm asking you:  Imagine a

            13  world in which somebody like Mr. Carroll is negotiating

            14  the contract and says, we know a way that they can

            15  unlock value.  They just need to get rid of the double

            16  taxation.  We can't do that effectively because we've

            17  got a zero basis but the first buyer can do that and

            18  that's going to improve their take from this investment

            19  substantially.  So we want some of that as our up side.

            20  That's what we want to do.  So that's -- how would you

            21  do it?

            22      A.   And that's --

            23                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            24      A.   And that's exactly my point that where parties

            25  discuss specifics that are not related to the economic



                                                                     171

             1  detriment of the earnout, then they must be very clear

             2  in the contract that that's intended to trigger the

             3  buyout because otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense.

             4  It doesn't affect the economics of the buyout.

             5                So they have to be very clear when they

             6  have something to attempt it.  And if, as you say, he

             7  expressly wanted it, that's your hypothetical, then they

             8  should have been clear instead of saying it and trying

             9  to be tricky.  You wouldn't read that into a contract.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Well, you might say I don't

            11  want to argue with somebody about what their intent in

            12  taking an action down the road is.  I just want to

            13  define if X happens, they're liable.  So I'm going to

            14  say if you cease to own all or any portion of the equity

            15  ownership interest, including the purchased interest,

            16  you owe us this money.

            17      A.   And that's not what it says.

            18      Q.   But you could write it that way, and it would

            19  be a trigger in that event?

            20                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            21      A.   Possibly instead of using equity ownership

            22  interest, use purchased interest.

            23      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But if you say the purchased

            24  interests are included within equity ownership interest,

            25  doesn't that cover it?



                                                                     172

             1                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             2      A.   Yeah, but the -- the way it's written, it is if

             3  you cease to own the equity ownership interest, the

             4  assets, the bundle of assets, the beneficial ownership

             5  of all those assets in a manner, directly or through any

             6  successors, including successors that might own the

             7  purchased interest, then that would be ceasing to own.

             8      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Yeah.  That's not what it says,

             9  though, is it?

            10      A.   Yes, it is.

            11      Q.   It's not what the words used are?

            12      A.   No, it is.

            13                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form,

            14  argumentative.

            15      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  It doesn't say ceases to own

            16  all.  It says ceases to own all --

            17      A.   Or any portion.

            18      Q.   -- or any portion --

            19      A.   Right.

            20      Q.   -- of the equity ownership interest, right?

            21      A.   Correct.

            22      Q.   And it says the equity ownership interests

            23  include the purchased interests.

            24      A.   No.  It says, if you cease to own all or any

            25  portion of the equity ownership interest, including



                                                                     173

             1  through successors that may be disposing of the equity

             2  ownership interest, the assets or the purchased

             3  interests, if you cease to own, then that would trigger

             4  the buyout.

             5      Q.   If you cease to own what?

             6      A.   The equity ownership interest.

             7      Q.   And are the purchased interests included in the

             8  equity ownership interest?

             9      A.   No.

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, asked and

            11  answered.

            12      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  No?  That's your answer?

            13      A.   Yes.

            14      Q.   Final answer?

            15      A.   Yes.

            16      Q.   Okay.  If somebody were to conclude that in the

            17  phrase -- the phrasing used in section 2.6(e), the

            18  purchased interests are included within the equity

            19  ownership interest, would you agree that a buyout

            20  trigger event has occurred in this case?

            21                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            22      A.   I cannot imagine anyone reaching that

            23  conclusion.

            24      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  But if they did?

            25      A.   Equity ownership interest is a term different



                                                                     174

             1  from purchased interest.

             2      Q.   I understand that, different words.  Presumably

             3  different meaning.

             4                But if somebody were to conclude that the

             5  purchased interests are part of the equity ownership

             6  interests, would you agree that a buyout trigger event

             7  has occurred?

             8                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             9      A.   No.

            10      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Okay.  The other way you said

            11  you could have written this to make it clear that --

            12  that selling -- that engaging in the tax reorganization

            13  or restructuring would be a buyout trigger is if you had

            14  removed the word affiliate.

            15                Do you remember saying that?

            16      A.   Yes.

            17      Q.   So if you took that word out of section 2.6(e),

            18  would you agree that what has occurred is a buyout

            19  trigger event?

            20      A.   No.

            21      Q.   No?

            22      A.   No.  It would be -- you would have to do that

            23  and make it clear that that's intended to be the

            24  disposition of the equity ownership interest.  You can't

            25  use equity ownership interest and get rid of the



                                                                     175

             1  affiliates.

             2                I mean, affiliates is there.  If you got

             3  rid of it, then you would be saying if NRP disposed of

             4  its equity ownership interests.

             5                But you're saying any of the affiliates of

             6  NRP.

             7      Q.   Well, if you assume that at the time the

             8  parties settled on the language that they signed off on,

             9  none of them knew what the restructuring would be, how

            10  would you draft a provision to capture that

            11  restructuring as a buyout event?

            12                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            13      A.   A hypothetical way to do it would be to remove

            14  the definition of affiliates and to state expressly that

            15  it would include any tax -- any reorganization of the

            16  companies that would have the effect of reducing taxes,

            17  I guess.

            18                There's -- there's ways to be specific,

            19  but a general reference to ceasing down the equity

            20  ownership interest wouldn't include that.  No business

            21  person would think that it includes that.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Give me a second.  I think

            23  we're done, but...

            24                Take a look at section 2.6(e).  Just make

            25  sure we're looking at the right thing, it says, "If at



                                                                     176

             1  any time buyer or its affiliate ceases to own."

             2                Why is taking or its affiliate out

             3  important to your opinion about how to phrase a buyout

             4  trigger event?

             5      A.   Because by having affiliate there, it's

             6  referencing that there could be a -- at the time of this

             7  execution, a different affiliate didn't own that

             8  interest.  But by having the affiliate there, it has to

             9  contemplate that in some other manner, an affiliate may

            10  own it, and that's still okay.

            11                It's only if that affiliate then owns it

            12  and then ceases to own it that it would be -- trigger

            13  the event, the 2.6(e).

            14      Q.   Okay.  So who is it that gave up the stock in

            15  Wyoming Co.?

            16                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            17      A.   I've forgotten the name of the company.  NRP --

            18  I've forgotten the name of the NRP entity.

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  NRP Trona LLC?

            20      A.   I've forgotten the name of the entity, but it

            21  was an NRP-owned company.

            22      Q.   Okay.  So you're saying if NRP -- if the buyer

            23  gives it up, it's not a buyout trigger event; but if the

            24  buyer gives it to an affiliate who then gives it up, it

            25  is a buyout trigger?



                                                                     177

             1      A.   No.

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  So I'm still trying to

             4  understand what the word affiliate has to do with --

             5      A.   Okay.

             6      Q.   -- making it clear that it's a buyout trigger

             7  event --

             8      A.   Okay.

             9      Q.   -- if you cease to own some of the purchased

            10  interests.

            11      A.   By having or its affiliate there, you're

            12  already contemplating that there's going to be a

            13  transfer.  There -- there may be a permitted transfer of

            14  the equity ownership interest to an affiliate.

            15      Q.   Now -- now, 2.6(e) doesn't require a transfer,

            16  does it?

            17                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            18      A.   2.6(e) requires ceasing to own --

            19      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Right.

            20      A.   -- the equity interest.

            21      Q.   Which doesn't -- does not require there be a

            22  transfer?

            23                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            24      A.   So I guess the answer to that is just simply

            25  no.



                                                                     178

             1      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Right.  Any disposition.  You

             2  don't have to transfer it to anybody.  You just get rid

             3  of it.

             4      A.   But by having or its affiliate, it contemplates

             5  that there's a -- there's -- there has to be a transfer

             6  or else the word affiliate would have no meaning.

             7      Q.   Well, wouldn't the -- wouldn't it make sense to

             8  put or its affiliate in if you didn't know who was going

             9  to be the buyer?

            10                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            11      A.   It would make sense to put or its affiliate in

            12  to know that it could be any entity related to the buyer

            13  that might end up owning the equity ownership interest.

            14      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  The buyer is defined in the

            15  contract as NRP Trona LLC, correct?

            16      A.   Correct.

            17      Q.   But doesn't 2.6(e) permit NRP Trona LLC to say,

            18  I'm going to put somebody else into this transaction in

            19  my place?  The person who actually buys is going to be

            20  my affiliate.

            21                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            22      A.   No.

            23      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  It doesn't allow that?

            24      A.   No.  The way the contract exists at the date

            25  that the contract is signed.



                                                                     179

             1      Q.   Right.

             2      A.   So at the date the contract is signed, NRP

             3  Trona is the buyer.  So it has or its affiliates.  So

             4  the only way or its affiliates could have any meaning is

             5  that it permits a transfer of the equity ownership

             6  interest to another affiliate.

             7      Q.   Right.  Okay.  So let's assume that has

             8  happened.  If that -- either the buyer in the first

             9  instance or if the buyer has transferred to its

            10  affiliate the equity ownership interest, either one of

            11  them then ceases to own a portion of those equity

            12  ownership interests, there's a buyout trigger event,

            13  right?

            14      A.   Yes.

            15                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            16      A.   Yes.

            17      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  And if the purchased interests

            18  are a portion of the equity ownership interests, you

            19  would agree there has been a buyout trigger event in

            20  this case?

            21                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            22      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  True?

            23      A.   No.

            24      Q.   Why not?

            25      A.   Because equity ownership interest is the asset,



                                                                     180

             1  the beneficial ownership of the assets of the business,

             2  the consolidated group.

             3      Q.   I'm asking you:  If the court determines that

             4  the way this language is set out means that the

             5  purchased interests are a portion of the equity

             6  ownership interest, if that's what the court concludes

             7  the meaning here is, you would agree that there has been

             8  a buyout trigger event?

             9                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

            10      A.   I just cannot imagine how the court could

            11  substitute purchased interest for equity ownership

            12  interest.

            13      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  Of course, the court wouldn't

            14  be substituting, it would simply be saying, I read this

            15  to say the purchased interests are included.  They're

            16  not the same as, they're just part of what we're calling

            17  the equity ownership interest.

            18      A.   If the court believed differently than I do

            19  that -- I believe that including the purchased interest

            20  is a method of ceasing to own, disposing of those could

            21  be a method of ceasing to own the equity ownership

            22  interest.  But the equity ownership interest remains the

            23  beneficial ownership of all the business of the

            24  companies.

            25      Q.   So you're not comfortable with my hypothetical?



                                                                     181

             1  You don't want to answer it?

             2                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form.

             3      Q.   (By Mr. Wawro)  If the court determines that a

             4  part of the equity ownership interests are the purchased

             5  interests, would you agree that a buyout trigger event

             6  has occurred?

             7                MR. PATRICK:  Objection, form, asked and

             8  answered.

             9      A.   I still -- you know, I'm going to say no.  I've

            10  got an analysis of why, but I'm going to say no.

            11                MR. WAWRO:  Okay.  We're done.  Thank you.

            12                THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.

            13                MR. WAWRO:  Pass the witness.

            14                MR. PATRICK:  We'll reserve and read and

            15  sign.

            16                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are off the record

            17  at 3:13 p.m.  That concludes this deposition.

            18                THE REPORTER:  Mr. Patrick, did you want

            19  yours just as soon as I get done with the final?

            20                MR. PATRICK:  Yeah, the final whenever

            21  they're ordering it.

            22                THE REPORTER:  Okay.

            23                MR. PATRICK:  Yeah.

18                    SAMUEL C. WORDEMAN, Ph.D

19  a witness herein, having been first duly sworn, was 

20  examined and testified as follows:

21                         EXAMINATION
                                
22  BY MR. FLYNN: 

23      Q.   Would you state your full name and spell your 

24  last name for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury.  


                                                               5

 1      A.   Sure.  My name is Samuel Clayton Wordeman.  My 

 2  last name is spelled W-O-R-D-E-M-A-N.

 3      Q.   Can you briefly describe your educational 

 4  background, where you went to school, and what degrees you 

 5  obtained?

 6      A.   Sure.  I did my undergraduate work at Washington 

 7  University in St. Louis, where I obtained a bachelor's 

 8  degree in biomedical engineering with a focus on  

 9  biomechanics.  And then I started my graduate work at the 

10  University of Cincinnati in a Ph.D. program for biomedical 

11  engineering and then subsequently transferred to Ohio 

12  State, where I obtained a master's degree and Ph.D. in 

13  biomedical engineering.

14      Q.   What is biomechanics or biomedical engineering?

15      A.   Sure.  So as sort of an umbrella discipline, 

16  biomedical engineering is any field that utilizes the 

17  principles of engineering and physics in the context of 

18  biology and medicine.  So there are biomedical engineers 

19  who design implants and hip or knee prosthesis.  There are 

20  biomedical engineers who design surgical instrumentation.  

21           And my specific area of focus within the field of 

22  biomedical engineering is what's referred to as 

23  biomechanics.  And essentially biomechanics is a field 

24  that takes the principles of mechanical engineering, so 


                                                               6

 1  the principles of forces and, you know, stretches and 

 2  strains and applies them to, in this case, the human body.  

 3  So I spent a lot of time studying the mechanical 

 4  properties of the tissues of the human body and how those 

 5  tissues respond to stretching or straining and application 

 6  of external forces.

 7           And then another field within biomechanics is 

 8  sort of what I would refer to as injury biomechanics which 

 9  is the type of force, the direction of force, and the 

10  nature of force required to cause particular injuries to 

11  the human body.

12      Q.   What types of research have you performed in 

13  biomedical engineering?

14      A.   Sure.  I have done a lot of different types of 

15  research in biomedical engineering.  When I was doing my 

16  graduate work, I worked in a lab where we had a big 3D 

17  motion analysis system, and we would actually measure the 

18  3D motion of the human body.  So the same type of systems 

19  that you see at play when you see a Pixar movie or 

20  something where you see people with markers on their skin, 

21  and then you can track the markers in three dimensions.  

22  We use that same technology for more scientific type of 

23  analysis.  

24           I have also done a lot of research using cadavers 


                                                               7

 1  or human tissue donations, people who have donated their 

 2  bodies to science, where we'll actually take the part of 

 3  the human anatomy and apply forces to it and measure the 

 4  types of forces required to cause a particular injury and 

 5  investigate what I would call injury mechanisms.  

 6           I have also done a lot of research with regard to 

 7  what I would call a computer analysis.  So we'll take the 

 8  same type of analysis that we did with the cadavers or 

 9  with the live subjects and we'll actually create a 

10  computer model or a 3D model in the computer to allow us 

11  to further investigate the effective various forces on the 

12  tissues of the human body.  

13           And then in addition to that type of research, I 

14  have also done crash testing research through the course 

15  of my employment with ARCCA, where I've actually measured 

16  the forces associated with automobile crashes.  And I have 

17  also done component testing of motor vehicle accidents in 

18  the context of a biomechanical analysis.

19      Q.   Where did you go after you obtained your Ph.D.?  

20      A.   Sure.  So shortly after I finished my graduate 

21  work, I stayed on board with Ohio State for approximately 

22  six months doing a postdoctoral research-ship, where I was 

23  essentially doing a lot of the same type of work I was 

24  doing as a graduate student, and I was also helping to get 


                                                               8

 1  some new research projects off the ground, projects that I 

 2  had helped obtain funding from the National Institutes of 

 3  Health for.  And then after about six months, I went to 

 4  work for a company where I am currently employed called 

 5  ARCCA.

 6      Q.   What is ARCCA?

 7      A.   ARCCA is an engineering consulting company.  We 

 8  do a lot of different types of engineering consulting.  We 

 9  have people who do purely sort of accident reconstruction 

10  type of opinions.  We have people who are structural 

11  engineers who do structural engineering.  

12           We started out as a group of naval engineers in 

13  the 1980s.  These are guys who were involved with 

14  designing ejection systems and restraint systems from 

15  naval aircraft, and then they sort of found a natural 

16  niche in the automotive world after they got out of the 

17  military and into the civilian world.  And so we have a 

18  lot of different types of engineers, but we are an 

19  engineering consulting company that does a lot of 

20  different types of work.

21      Q.   With respect to ARCCA, what is your role?

22      A.   So my role is what's referred to -- my job title 

23  is a Senior Biomechanist.  So I'm in our biomechanics 

24  department, and my job is essentially to evaluate the 


                                                               9

 1  safety of restraint systems and to perform what I would 

 2  call biomechanical engineering causation analyses in 

 3  automotive or occupational settings.  And -- so 

 4  essentially I investigate injury mechanisms.  I 

 5  investigate the types of forces associated with various 

 6  incidents.

 7           And then I also do some work with the National 

 8  Hockey League, making recommendations as to the safety of 

 9  their equipment.  So, generally speaking, I'm involved in 

10  identifying the safety of various systems and identifying 

11  the potential for injury due to various circumstances.  

12      Q.   Have you published any of the results of your 

13  research endeavors?

14      A.   Yes, sir.  I have about 22 publications to date, 

15  I believe.  Generally speaking, they all involve some sort 

16  of injury mechanism identification or identification of 

17  risk of injury.

18      Q.   Have you ever presented your research to groups 

19  of other engineering professionals?

20      A.   Yes; I have presented numerous times at the 

21  national level, numerous national conferences as well as 

22  some smaller conferences.  I've also been fortunate enough 

23  to receive recognition in the form of awards from national 

24  organizations for some of the research that I have done.  


                                                               10

 1  So, yeah, I have presented on the national stage multiple 

 2  times.

 3      Q.   Are you a medical doctor?

 4      A.   No, sir, I'm not a medical doctor.  And sort of 

 5  the main difference between what I do and what a medical 

 6  doctor does is a medical doctor is trained in order to 

 7  identify and diagnose injuries and then put forth a 

 8  treatment plan to help a patient recover from those 

 9  injuries.  

10           My training really is in specifically 

11  understanding how those injuries occur in the first place.  

12  So I don't treat or diagnose patients.  I am essentially 

13  interested in the forces required to cause the injuries in 

14  the first place.  

15      Q.   With respect to your work in this case, are you 

16  contesting any of the diagnoses that were made by any of 

17  Ms. Perez's treating physicians?

18      A.   No, sir, certainly not.  As I mentioned, that -- 

19  really the diagnosis falls under the purview of the 

20  medical doctors and that's what they're trained to do.  So 

21  certainly actually accepting those diagnoses as fact is 

22  sort of the first step in my analysis.

23      Q.   Have you previously been qualified to give 

24  testimony in courts regarding the same topics you're here 


                                                               11

 1  to testify about today?

 2      A.   Yes, sir; I have been qualified to testify in 

 3  courts in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and 

 4  Illinois.

 5      Q.   And has your testimony ever been precluded or 

 6  barred in any court?

 7      A.   No, it has not.  

 8           MS. GROSS:  Objection.  Relevancy.

 9  BY MR. FLYNN:

10      Q.   Doctor, I'm going to show you what has been 

11  marked as Exhibit No. 1 with today's date for 

12  identification purposes.  Can you identify that document?

13      A.   Yes, sir.  This is my professional biographical 

14  outline or my CV.

15      Q.   Does that set forth your education, your 

16  training, your employment, your publications, and your 

17  professional accomplishments?

18      A.   Yes, sir.

19      Q.   Is it true and accurate?

20      A.   Yes, sir.

21      Q.   Any additions, deletions, or changes you would 

22  like to make to that document?

23      A.   No, sir.  It's up to date.

24           MR. FLYNN:  At this time we would offer Exhibit 


                                                               12

 1  No. 1, Defendant's Exhibit No. 1 into evidence.   

 2           (Defendant's Exhibit No. 1 was offered into 

 3  evidence.)

 4  BY MR. FLYNN:

 5      Q.   Doctor, what were you asked to do in this case?  

 6      A.   I was asked to perform what's referred to as a 

 7  biomechanical injury causation analysis.  So essentially 

 8  that is an analysis to determine whether or not a 

 9  particular injury or set of injuries could have been 

10  physically caused by the circumstances in this case of the 

11  motor vehicle accident on May 28th of 2015.

12      Q.   Can you explain for the jury how that is 

13  different from a medical doctor's diagnoses?

14      A.   Sure.  So essentially the medical doctors 

15  identify the symptoms and come to a conclusion with regard 

16  to what the injuries are, based on medical imaging or a 

17  history.  

18           What I do is actually analyze the circumstances 

19  of the motor vehicle accident in this case and determine 

20  whether or not the forces present in that motor vehicle 

21  accident and the forces applied to the plaintiff's body 

22  are consistent with the injuries that are being attributed 

23  to that particular incident.  So it's a very different and 

24  in my opinion more robust type of analysis than a 


                                                               13

 1  diagnosis.

 2      Q.   What is involved in a biomedical or biomechanical 

 3  injury causation analysis?

 4      A.   Sure.  So my analysis consists of five steps.  As 

 5  I mentioned previously, the first step in that analysis is 

 6  to identify the injuries that are being attributed to the 

 7  motor vehicle accident.  And as I mentioned, I'm not a 

 8  medical doctor, so I'm not coming up with these diagnoses 

 9  on my own.  That particular step really consists of 

10  reviewing the medical records and identifying what 

11  diagnoses the medical doctors offer.

12           The next step in the analysis is to determine the 

13  severity of the motor vehicle accident, so essentially how 

14  bad of a motor vehicle accident was this.  What were 

15  the -- there are sort of two numbers that I'm primarily 

16  interested in.  Those would be what I would call the 

17  Delta-V and the accelerations in the accident, and I'll 

18  get into more depth on those a little bit later here. 

19           The next step after I've identified or quantified 

20  the severity of the accident is to determine the kinematic 

21  response of the plaintiff.  And when I say "kinematic 

22  response," what I mean is I'm looking at the way that the 

23  plaintiff would have moved relative to the interior of the 

24  vehicle, in this case the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu, and I'm 


                                                               14

 1  analyzing her interactions with the vehicle and the motion 

 2  that she would have experienced as a result of the motor 

 3  vehicle accident.

 4           And then the next step is to determine whether or 

 5  not that movement of her body and the interaction between 

 6  her body and the interior of the vehicle would have 

 7  created what I would refer to as the injury mechanism 

 8  responsible for the injury being claimed.  And when I say 

 9  "injury mechanism," I'm talking about the types of forces, 

10  so the direction of force, as well as the magnitude of 

11  force needed in order to physically damage the anatomical 

12  structures that are being claimed to have been injured in 

13  this particular accident.  

14           And then the final step is to take into account 

15  the plaintiff's specific circumstances and the individual 

16  tolerance of the plaintiff to the types of forces that she 

17  experienced in this particular accident, and to analyze 

18  those forces in the context of the types of forces that 

19  she would have experienced on a daily basis doing fairly 

20  benign tasks that are generally not associated with 

21  injury.  So that's sort of the five-step analysis that I 

22  performed in this particular case.  

23      Q.   What materials were you provided in reference to 

24  this case?


                                                               15

 1      A.   Yes, sir.  I was provided with a number of 

 2  materials, and then I also generated a number of materials 

 3  during the course of my analysis.  But I was provided with 

 4  the police report, the Illinois Traffic Crash Report, as 

 5  well as color and black and white photographs of both of 

 6  the vehicles, the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu and the 2015 

 7  Toyota Rav4.  I also had the repair estimate for the 2004 

 8  Chevrolet Malibu as well as a prior damage report for the 

 9  same vehicle, the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  I had the 

10  medical records for the plaintiff, Ms. Perez, both prior 

11  to and subsequent to the motor vehicle accident.  I had 

12  the interrogatories from the plaintiff, as well as the 

13  deposition transcript of both Ms. Martinez, the defendant, 

14  as well as Ms. Perez, the plaintiff, and then I had 

15  deposition transcripts of three medical doctors, 

16  Dr. Michael Lee, Dr. Matthew Bueche, B-U-E-C-H-E, and 

17  Dr. Asavari Javeri, J-A-V-E-R-I.  And those were the 

18  materials that were provided to me by your office, and 

19  then I also generated some materials during the course of 

20  my analysis, including specification sheets for the 

21  vehicles involved an analyses of the severity of the 

22  accident and numerous scientific references to support the 

23  opinions that I have in this case.

24      Q.   Is that your file to your right?  


                                                               16

 1      A.   Yes, sir.

 2      Q.   After you completed your review of all of those 

 3  materials, you did your analysis, did you prepare a 

 4  report?

 5      A.   Yes, sir, I did.

 6      Q.   I'm going to show you what has been marked as 

 7  Exhibit No. -- Defendant's Exhibit No. 2 for 

 8  identification purposes.  Is it a true and accurate copy 

 9  of your report?

10      A.   Yes, sir, it is.

11      Q.   Would it be helpful for you to review either your 

12  file or your report while testifying here today?

13      A.   Yes, sir, it may.  

14      Q.   Please feel free to do so if it helps you.  

15  Generally speaking, after reviewing the materials we've 

16  discussed, how would you describe the subject incident?

17      A.   Sure.  So after reviewing all of the available 

18  materials, it appears that on May 28th of 2015 Ms. Emilie 

19  Perez was the seat-belted driver of a 2004 Chevrolet 

20  Malibu.  All of the materials indicate that that vehicle 

21  was stopped facing northbound on South Ewing Avenue in 

22  Chicago, Illinois.  

23           Ms. Martinez was the driver of a 2015 Toyota 

24  Rav4, and as the Chevrolet was stopped, at some point 


                                                               17

 1  there was contact between the front of the 2015 Rav4 and 

 2  the rear of the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  And then according 

 3  to the testimony of the plaintiff, there was subsequently 

 4  a contact between the front of her vehicle and an 

 5  unidentified vehicle in front of her at some point.  

 6      Q.   Now, with respect to the contact between the 

 7  front of Ms. Perez's Chevy Malibu and the vehicle in front 

 8  of her, was there any mention of that in the police 

 9  report?

10      A.   No, sir, not that I identified.  

11           MS. GROSS:  Object.  I would like to put on an 

12  objection of beyond 213.

13  BY MR. FLYNN:

14      Q.   Was there any mention of that in the deposition 

15  of Ms. Martinez?

16      A.   No, sir.  

17      Q.   Was there any mention of a frontal collision in 

18  any of the medical records that you reviewed?

19      A.   No, sir.

20      Q.   You said the first step in your five-step 

21  analysis was to identify the injuries.  What did you do to 

22  identify the injuries in this particular case?

23      A.   Sure.  So as I mentioned, that essentially 

24  consists of reviewing the plaintiff's medical records and 


                                                               18

 1  identifying what the medical doctors say the diagnosed 

 2  injuries were.  So I reviewed the plaintiff's medical 

 3  records and identified that she was diagnosed with 

 4  spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1, which essentially means 

 5  that the 5th lumbar vertebra which is sort of the big bone 

 6  in the lumbar spine was diagnosed as having been shifted 

 7  forward relative to her sacrum or essentially her tailbone 

 8  which is the lowest part of the lumbosacral spine.  So she 

 9  was diagnosed with that, and then she had a previous 

10  diagnosis of what I would call a spondylolysis or a pars 

11  defect which is basically damage to the bones located at 

12  the posterior aspect of her lumbar spine.  And those two 

13  diagnoses were essentially related to one another, 

14  according to all of the medical doctors.  

15           MS. GROSS:  Move to strike, pending motions in 

16  limine, beyond 213.

17  BY MR. FLYNN:

18      Q.   Doctor, in terms of medical training, did you 

19  complete medical school?

20      A.   No, sir.  As I mentioned, I don't have a medical 

21  degree.  I do have training.  I took courses in physiology 

22  and human anatomy at the University of Cincinnati Medical 

23  School as sort of part of my initial training as a 

24  graduate student in biomedical engineering.  And so those 


                                                               19

 1  are the same courses taken by the medical doctors at the 

 2  University of Cincinnati or the medical students at the 

 3  University of Cincinnati. 

 4           And then as I mentioned, after those initial base 

 5  work courses, myself and my engineering colleagues went on 

 6  to study the forces required to cause damage to the human 

 7  anatomy and the structures that make up the human body, 

 8  whereas my colleagues in medical school went on to study 

 9  how to identify what those injuries are and how to 

10  diagnose those injuries.  So I certainly do have training 

11  in what I would consider the medical field, but I don't 

12  have a medical degree.

13      Q.   With respect to spondylolysis and 

14  spondylolisthesis, are those diagnoses that were made by 

15  Ms. Perez's physicians?

16      A.   Yes. 

17           MS. GROSS:  Objection.  Beyond 213.

18  BY MR. FLYNN:

19      Q.   And you know that from reviewing the medical 

20  records and the depositions?

21      A.   Correct.  

22      Q.   What is the mechanisms for a traumatic 

23  spondylolisthesis?

24      A.   Sure.  So as I mentioned --


                                                               20

 1           MS. GROSS:  Objection.  Objection.  Objection, 

 2  pending motions in limine.  Beyond 213.  

 3           THE WITNESS:  So the mechanisms required to cause 

 4  spondylolisthesis requires shear force applied to the 

 5  lumbar spine.  As I mentioned, spondylolisthesis refers to 

 6  relative movement of the bones in the lumbar spine.  In 

 7  this case, relative movement forward of the fifth or the 

 8  lowest lumbar vertebra relative to the sacrum.  So the 

 9  mechanism required to cause that in a traumatic type of 

10  setting would require what I would refer to as a shear 

11  force applied to L5, pushing L5 forward relative to the 

12  sacrum.

13           MS. GROSS:  Motion to strike as to the medical 

14  opinion.  

15  BY MR. FLYNN:

16      Q.   Now, the second step you had to determine the 

17  severity of the accident.  What does that mean?

18      A.   Sure.  So essentially that is how bad of a motor 

19  vehicle accident was this.  And as I mentioned previously, 

20  the -- that really consists of identifying sort of two 

21  numbers; the first number is what I would refer to as the 

22  Delta-V, and that's basically the change in velocity or 

23  the change in speed of the vehicle as a result of the 

24  collision.  So to illustrate that point, if you were at a 


                                                               21

 1  stop sign and your vehicle was stopped and then somebody 

 2  were to come up behind you and contact the rear of your 

 3  vehicle, and your vehicle was, say, at the end of the 

 4  accident moving forward approximately 5 miles per hour, 

 5  that will be a 5-mile-per-hour Delta-V.  The same thing if 

 6  your vehicle was going 10 miles per hour and somebody 

 7  struck you in the rear and you were rear-ended, and at the 

 8  end of that accident your vehicle was going 15 miles an 

 9  hour, that would also be a 5-mile-per-hour Delta-V.  So 

10  it's -- the Delta-V is how much your vehicle changes its 

11  speed as a result of the collision. 

12           But if you think about it, you know, you could be 

13  stopped at a stop sign and you could depress the 

14  accelerator in your vehicle and also go from 0 to 5 miles 

15  per hour, but that is a different scenario from the 

16  rear-end collision that I talked about.  The main 

17  difference there is that your vehicle would go from 0 to 5 

18  miles per hour during a rear-end collision over the course 

19  of about one to two-tenths of a second, whereas if you 

20  were applying the accelerator, it would take quite a bit 

21  longer.  And so the quicker that your vehicle experiences 

22  that Delta-V, the higher the acceleration is associated 

23  with that Delta-V.  So that's what I would refer to as the 

24  G forces or the accelerations which are the second number 


                                                               22

 1  that I attempt to identify when I perform a severity 

 2  analysis.

 3      Q.   What are the steps that you look -- that you took 

 4  to determine the severity of the accident?

 5      A.   Sure.  So in any motor vehicle accident the first 

 6  thing that I want to do is identify the vehicles involved 

 7  in the motor vehicle accident.  So I use the vehicle 

 8  identification numbers to identify the year, makes and 

 9  models of those vehicles.  And then I utilize that 

10  information to identify specifications for those vehicles, 

11  so things like dimensions and weights of the vehicle.  

12           Next I generally in a case like this where you 

13  have bumper-to-bumper contact will identify the components 

14  that make up the bumper systems of those two vehicles, and 

15  then I'll utilize the laws of physics and accepted 

16  engineering methodologies or accident reconstruction 

17  methodologies to assess the damages to those two vehicles 

18  and use that information to come up with numbers for the 

19  Delta-V and the accelerations as we talked about 

20  previously.

21      Q.   Can you briefly tell the jury what you found with 

22  regard to the bumper assemblies on each of the vehicles?

23      A.   Sure.  So the bumper assembly on the 2004 

24  Chevrolet Malibu consists of a steel reenforcement bar 


                                                               23

 1  which is mounted to the rear body of the vehicle, and then 

 2  there is a foam energy absorber.  So it's sort of a dense 

 3  foam component that's called the energy absorber, and that 

 4  sits between that steel reenforcement bar and the plastic 

 5  bumper cover or what you actually see on the outside of 

 6  the vehicle.  

 7           And the vehicle, the 2015 Toyota Rav4, utilizes a 

 8  similar type of bumper system.  There is an energy 

 9  absorber and then there is a reenforcement bar that has 

10  mounting brackets attached to it, and those mounting 

11  brackets attach to the frame of the vehicle.  

12      Q.   What was the damage to the plaintiff's vehicle?

13      A.   Sure.  So the plaintiff's vehicle had damage to 

14  the rear bumper assembly, so the components that we talked 

15  about that make up the bumper assembly as well as the rear 

16  body panel and the trunk lid.  And so that was essentially 

17  the damaged components of the plaintiff's vehicle in this 

18  case.

19      Q.   What was your final conclusion with regard to the 

20  severity of the accident?

21      A.   Sure.  So in this case I determined that the 

22  Delta-V in this particular case for the rear-end collision 

23  would have been less than 6.75 miles per hour and the 

24  accelerations associated with that rear-end Delta-V would 


                                                               24

 1  have been less than 1.8g's average.

 2      Q.   Can you explain to the jury how you came to those 

 3  numbers?

 4      A.   Sure.  In this case I performed what's referred 

 5  to as a damage-based speed change analysis.  And 

 6  essentially what that is, is a damage-to-damage comparison 

 7  between the plaintiff's vehicle and a vehicle that was 

 8  subjected to a low-speed rear-end crash test.  So in this 

 9  case I had low-speed rear-end crash test for a 2004 

10  Chevrolet Malibu that demonstrated greater structural 

11  damage to that Chevrolet Malibu than was sustained to the 

12  plaintiff's vehicle.  Specifically the vehicle in the 

13  rear -- low-speed rear-end crash test sustained damage not 

14  only to the rear bumper assembly, but also to the rear 

15  unibody or what I would essentially call the frame of the 

16  vehicle as well as to the frame side member ends.  So 

17  those are really the stiffest sort of structural 

18  components of the rear of the vehicle and damage to the 

19  rear body panel and the rear floor pan.  So there was more 

20  energy imparted to that vehicle that was tested by the 

21  IIHS, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, than 

22  there was damage to the plaintiff's vehicle.  And as a 

23  result, I concluded that the plaintiff's vehicle 

24  experienced a Delta-V that was less than that sustained by 


                                                               25

 1  the tested vehicle.

 2      Q.   So the vehicle in the test was a 2004 Chevy 

 3  Malibu which is the same type of car that was driven by 

 4  Ms. Perez?

 5      A.   Yes, sir.

 6      Q.   And in that particular case they measured an 

 7  actual Delta-V of 6.75?

 8      A.   Yes, sir.

 9      Q.   And the Chevy in that particular test had more 

10  damage than the Chevy involved in this accident?

11      A.   Right, and it's more structural damage.  So, you 

12  know, damage to a tail lamp or something like that doesn't 

13  necessarily indicate a great deal of energy imparted to 

14  the vehicle.  We're talking about structural damage.  So 

15  this is damage to the strong structural steel components 

16  of the vehicle that we are talking about.

17      Q.   Are you saying the Delta-V of the plaintiff's 

18  vehicle in this case was 6.75 miles per hour?

19      A.   No, sir.  It was less than 6.75 miles per hour.

20      Q.   Now, with respect to the vehicle involved in this 

21  particular case, I sent over Exhibits 3 through 12.  And 

22  do those photographs depict the Toyota driven by my 

23  client, Ms. Martinez?

24      A.   Yes, sir.


                                                               26

 1      Q.   And likewise, I'm going to show you real quickly 

 2  what was marked as Defendant's Exhibits 14 through 22.  

 3  And do those photographs depict the vehicle that was being 

 4  driven by Mrs. Perez -- or Ms. Perez?

 5      A.   Yes, sir.

 6      Q.   Now, with respect to the damage to the rear of 

 7  the Chevy Malibu, as part of your analysis, did you work 

 8  on the assumption that all of that damage was from this 

 9  accident?

10      A.   All of the rear-end damage, yes, sir.

11      Q.   Would it be fair to say that your analysis takes 

12  into account a much more severe scenario than the severity 

13  of the actual incident?

14      A.   Yes.

15           MS. GROSS:  Objection to the form.

16           THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I want to give the plaintiff 

17  the benefit of the doubt with regard to how severe this 

18  accident was.  And so essentially I would prefer to 

19  overestimate the severity of the accident as opposed to 

20  underestimate it.  So I think my analysis is very 

21  conservative in that regard.

22      Q.   How did you determine that the accelerations were 

23  less than 1.8g's?

24      A.   Sure.  So acceleration is defined as the change 


                                                               27

 1  in velocity over the change -- or the amount of time 

 2  required for the change in velocity.  So that's something 

 3  you can find in really any physics textbook that you might 

 4  find.  But in this case I utilized results from crash 

 5  tests, previous crash tests, so vehicles with similar 

 6  bumper systems, to determine that in my opinion this 

 7  particular accident would have taken course -- taken place 

 8  over the course of about 175 milliseconds, so just under 

 9  two-tenths of a second.  And when you do the math on that, 

10  it works out to 1.8g's.

11      Q.   Did you perform any further analysis as to the 

12  severity of the collision?

13      A.   Yes, I did.  So I didn't want to just rely on the 

14  damage as described in the repair estimate, so I also 

15  performed what I would refer to as energy-based crush 

16  analyses of the vehicles, so essentially looking at how 

17  much crush damage there is to the back of the vehicles and 

18  identifying an upper boundary based on that.  So based 

19  primarily on specifications for those vehicles and 

20  photographs of the vehicles, and I performed that for both 

21  the rear end and the front of the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu 

22  since, as I mentioned, there was a report of a subsequent 

23  frontal contact, and then I also performed that same type 

24  of analysis to the front of the 2015 Toyota Rav4 and used 


                                                               28

 1  the laws of physics to sort of calculate the subsequent 

 2  change in velocity if that particular vehicle were to have 

 3  sustained greater crush than it did in this particular 

 4  accident.

 5      Q.   When did you perform the additional analysis?

 6      A.   As I mentioned, I didn't want to just rely on one 

 7  piece of information in order to come to my opinions.  So 

 8  I, you know, the damage based speed change analysis, would 

 9  rely somewhat heavily on the repair estimate for the 

10  vehicle.  I also wanted to use the objective information 

11  contained in the photographs of the vehicles as a part of 

12  my analysis, and I also utilized some of the available 

13  testimony with regard to vehicle speeds and motions in 

14  accordance with the laws of physics in order to just sort 

15  of check my work and make sure that everything was 

16  consistent with the Delta-V being less than 6.75 miles per 

17  hour for the rear-end contact.

18      Q.   Did any of those additional analysis contradict 

19  your opinion that this accident resulted in a Delta-V of 

20  less than 6.75 miles per hour or that the accelerations 

21  were less than 1.8g?  

22      A.   No, sir.  They were all consistent with my 

23  previously mentioned opinions.

24      Q.   Now, with respect to this frontal collision, you 


                                                               29

 1  are not offering an opinion as to whether or not that 

 2  collision occurred, are you?  

 3      A.   No.  For the purposes of my analysis, since the 

 4  plaintiff mentioned it in her deposition, I went ahead and 

 5  assumed that her vehicle did actually make contact with 

 6  the vehicle in front of it, and then based on again the 

 7  damage to the vehicle and the damage to the rear of the 

 8  vehicle and the laws of physics, again established an 

 9  upper boundary for the Delta-V and the accelerations due 

10  to potential frontal contact.  And in this case my opinion 

11  is any frontal contact, if it did occur, would actually 

12  have resulted in again a Delta-V less than 6.75 miles per 

13  hour and accelerations less than 1.8g's.

14      Q.   Was there any damage to the front of Ms. Perez's 

15  vehicle, the 2004 Chevy Malibu that she attributed to this 

16  accident?

17      A.   The plaintiff testified that there was no damage 

18  to the front of her vehicle, and the repair estimate did 

19  not list any damage to the front of the Chevrolet Malibu.  

20  The photographs did appear to show maybe some minor 

21  contact damage or scraping damage to the front of the 

22  vehicle, but certainly nothing that would indicate a 

23  significant frontal contact or anything like that.

24      Q.   Now, the third step in your analysis was to 


                                                               30

 1  determine the kinematic response?

 2      A.   Yes, sir.

 3      Q.   What is a kinematic response?

 4      A.   Sure.  So kinematics as a term refers to 

 5  movement.  So in this case I'm interested in the movement 

 6  of Ms. Perez's body within the vehicle.  And so in order 

 7  to do that, basically the laws of physics dictate the 

 8  general direction of her motion.  I wanted to go through 

 9  and calculate various things like her seated height, based 

10  on her height and age and weight and sex and sort of 

11  determine how she would move relative to the interior of 

12  the vehicle.  So I calculated things like her seated 

13  height, and I also identified numerous clearances and sort 

14  of the space around her within the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu, 

15  and then I applied the laws of physics to this motor 

16  vehicle accident and verified the results of that analysis 

17  with motor vehicle or with previous crash testing, using 

18  cadavers or live human subjects.  

19           So basically in a rear-end type of collision the 

20  occupant inside of the struck vehicle would tend to move 

21  rearward, so toward her seat, relative to the interior of 

22  this -- of the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  And I determined 

23  that that would have been her general direction of motion. 

24           I also took into account the fact that the 


                                                               31

 1  plaintiff testified that she was wearing the seat belt in 

 2  the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  So based on the laws -- or 

 3  based on federal law regarding seat belt assemblies, I 

 4  determined that that seat belt assembly would have locked 

 5  when her vehicle's accelerations reached 0.7g's which is 

 6  the acceleration associated essentially with hard braking 

 7  in the vehicle which is why you might notice that your 

 8  seat belt assembly locks when you apply your brakes 

 9  rapidly inside the vehicle.  

10           So I took all of that information into account 

11  and essentially determined how her body would have moved 

12  as a result of both the rear end and the front end 

13  collision in this accident.

14      Q.   So if I understand your testimony, Ms. Perez's 

15  2004 Chevy Malibu was hit in the rear and pushed forward, 

16  but the occupant in the car, Ms. Perez, would have gone 

17  backwards?

18      A.   Yes, backward relative to the inside of the 

19  vehicle.  So essentially what happens in a rear-end 

20  accident is the vehicle gets pushed forward, and the net 

21  effect is that the occupant's seat sort of gets pushed 

22  toward their back.  So at the end of the day what that 

23  results in is motion of the occupant toward the seatback 

24  rearward relative to the interior of the vehicle.


                                                               32

 1      Q.   Is that an opinion or is that physics?

 2      A.   That's physics, sir.  That's well-documented in 

 3  numerous scientific articles, and that's really the laws 

 4  of physics that work in a motor vehicle accident.  

 5      Q.   Is that why when somebody hits the accelerator 

 6  and the car goes forward, if they have something on their 

 7  dashboard, it's going to end up in their lap?

 8      A.   Yes, sir, the same principles at work.

 9      Q.   And that's why when you slam on the brakes, if 

10  you have something on the seat, it's going to go flying 

11  off the seat?  

12           MS. GROSS:  Objection.  Counsel testifying.  

13      A.   Yes.  So it's essentially, you know, if you're 

14  slamming on the brakes in your vehicle, the forces are 

15  acting in the same direction as if you were involved in a 

16  frontal accident.  It's causing your vehicle to slow down 

17  which results in everything inside the vehicle sort of 

18  continuing forward at the same speed that it was prior to 

19  braking or prior to the accident.  So it's all sort of the 

20  same -- same principles of physics at play.

21      Q.   What would happen to Ms. Perez's body if she -- 

22      A.   I'm sorry.  You cut out for a second there.

23      Q.   Strike it.  What would happen to Ms. Perez's body 

24  as she moved backward when the Chevy was pushed forward?


                                                               33

 1      A.   Sure.  So sort of as a general direction of 

 2  motion or a general motion of her body, I determined that 

 3  her pelvis and her torso would have tended to move toward 

 4  her seatback.  Her pelvis and her torso would have been 

 5  well-supported by the seatback in this vehicle, and 

 6  essentially her body would have just loaded into her 

 7  seatback.  And then if there was any forward rebound 

 8  associated with this particular accident, given the low 

 9  severity and the low accelerations of this accident, I 

10  wouldn't expect a significant amount of rebound.  But as I 

11  mentioned previously, the seat belt assembly that she was 

12  wearing would have locked as her body was moving rearward, 

13  and it would have really controlled any forward motion of 

14  her body off of the seatback after she initially moved 

15  rearward.  

16           So it's my opinion that her body and her torso 

17  and her lumbar spine specifically would have been very 

18  well-supported by the seatback in this particular vehicle, 

19  and her lumbar spine would not have experienced any forces 

20  or motions outside of that associated with normal range of 

21  motion or normal physical activities.

22      Q.   Now, you mentioned also that Ms. Perez testified 

23  she subsequently came into contact with the vehicle in 

24  front of her.  What kinematic analysis -- strike that.


                                                               34

 1           You mentioned that Ms. Perez testified she 

 2  subsequently came into contact with the vehicle in front 

 3  of her.  Did your kinematic analysis also come to any 

 4  possible motion of her body due to a frontal contact?

 5      A.   Yes.  So obviously if the occupant is going to 

 6  tend to move backwards in a rear-end contact, her body 

 7  would tend to move forwards due to any frontal contact.  

 8  So as I mentioned, her seat belt assembly would have 

 9  actually locked before she started moving forward.  So it 

10  would have been -- her forward motion would have been 

11  extremely well-controlled by that three-point restraint 

12  that she was wearing.  

13           I did take into account the possibility that she 

14  was sitting all the way forward with her seat completely 

15  vertically and performed calculations to determine how far 

16  forward her chest would have moved, and determined that if 

17  we grant the frontal contact and we sort of took into 

18  account the most severe circumstance for her in a 

19  subsequent frontal contact, if we assume any contact 

20  occurred between her chest and the steering wheel in this 

21  particular vehicle, it would have only occurred at a speed 

22  of about two to three miles per hour.  So it's my opinion 

23  that her forward motion would have been very 

24  well-controlled as a result of her locked three-point seat 


                                                               35

 1  belt that she was wearing.  And again she would not have 

 2  experienced any lumbar spine motion outside of a normal 

 3  range or the normal physiological range of motion.

 4      Q.   We have covered the first three steps of your 

 5  analysis; the injuries claimed, the severity of the 

 6  accident, and the kinematic analysis.  What is the next 

 7  step in the process?

 8      A.   Sure.  So the next step after I perform the 

 9  kinematic analysis, which is basically an analysis of the 

10  general motion of her body, the next step is to look 

11  specifically at the injured body part, in this case the 

12  lumbar spine at L5 and S1, and determine the types of 

13  forces that the lumbar spine was exposed to due to that 

14  kinematic motion or that movement of her body inside of 

15  the vehicle and to account for the mechanism of injury 

16  required to cause the injury being attributed to the 

17  accident and determine if that mechanism of injury was 

18  present.

19      Q.   How do you do that?

20      A.   So that consists of again sort of looking at my 

21  independent analysis and the severity of the accident and 

22  performing some calculations in that regard.  It also 

23  consists of identifying previous crash testing literature 

24  where those forces have actually been measured in 


                                                               36

 1  comparable severity accidents and determining then based 

 2  on the known mechanisms of injury whether or not those -- 

 3  the forces in this particular accident were consistent 

 4  with injurious loading to the lumbar spine.

 5      Q.   Did you come to a conclusion as to how this 

 6  accident would have affected Ms. Perez's lumbar spine?  

 7           MS. GROSS:  Objection, pending motion in limine.  

 8      A.   Yes, sir, I did.  So with regard to the rear-end 

 9  motion of her lumbar spine, as I mentioned, her seatback 

10  is located directly behind her lumbar spine in this 

11  vehicle.  And so any rearward motion of her body would 

12  have resulted in her lumbar spine essentially coming into 

13  contact with the seatback in this vehicle.  That rearward 

14  motion would have been very well-supported and all of the 

15  forces applied to her lumbar spine would have been spread 

16  out essentially over her entire torso.  And so really her 

17  lumbar spine in the rear-end collision here would only 

18  have experienced a limited degree of extension or sort of, 

19  you know, bending backwards very limited amount with 

20  regard to the rear-end collision. 

21           Now in any subsequent frontal collision, as I 

22  mentioned, her seat belt assembly would be locked.  And if 

23  you look at the lumbar motion associated with slight 

24  forward motion, it's again my opinion that her lumbar 


                                                               37

 1  spine would not have experienced any motion outside of the 

 2  normal physiological range.  And again the forces applied 

 3  to her torso would have been disbursed over her entire 

 4  torso due to the shoulder portion of her three-point belt. 

 5           So it's my opinion that, you know, she would have 

 6  essentially experienced greater forward motion bending 

 7  over to tie her shoes than she would have in any 

 8  subsequent frontal contact.  And her rearward motion or 

 9  the extension of her lumbar spine would not have been 

10  significantly greater than essentially just sitting in the 

11  seat prior to the accident.

12      Q.   The shear forces, did you measure those?

13      A.   I didn't specifically measure them.  I did 

14  identify literature where it was measured previously at 

15  comparable severity levels.  In this case it's my opinion 

16  that the shear forces experienced by her lumbar spine 

17  would have been, you know, limited to about 20 pounds of 

18  force which is very minimal in terms of the lumbar shear 

19  forces that the human body can withstand.  

20           The bony parts of her lumbar spine that were 

21  damaged, the pars interarticularis, is not the only part 

22  of her lumbar spine that resists shear force.  You also 

23  have bones in your lumbar spine called facet joints, and 

24  previous research demonstrates that those facet joints can 


                                                               38

 1  experience, you know, more than 650 pounds of shear force 

 2  before there is any damage to the lumbar spine.  So in my 

 3  opinion the shear forces in this particular accident were 

 4  extremely low in the context of those needed to cause 

 5  injury.

 6           MS. GROSS:  Move to strike the medical opinion.  

 7  Motions in limine pending.

 8  BY MR. FLYNN:

 9      Q.   With respect to the spondylolisthesis and 

10  spondylolysis, a certain amount of shear force is required 

11  to create those injuries?

12      A.   Yes, sir.  

13      Q.   Did the amount of force necessary to cause those 

14  injuries based upon your analysis exist in this automobile 

15  accident?  

16           MS. GROSS:  Same objections.

17      A.   No, sir.

18      Q.   With respect to the G forces that Ms. Perez 

19  experienced during this accident, can you put those forces 

20  into some type of context for the jury?

21      A.   Sure.  So we've all heard the term G forces, but 

22  we may not be familiar with exactly what that means.  So 

23  1g is the force due to gravity.  So that's the force that 

24  we're experiencing right now as we sit in our chairs.  


                                                               39

 1  It's something that we all experience every single day.  

 2           The human body experiences forces much higher 

 3  than 1g during activities of daily living.  So there have 

 4  been a lot of biomechanical studies aimed at understanding 

 5  the forces and the accelerations that the human body 

 6  experiences.  And one of the main reasons for that is    

 7  to -- in order to design an implant or something that you 

 8  are going to put into the human body, you have to 

 9  understand the forces and accelerations that that implant 

10  is going to be exposed to on a daily basis.  

11           So the biomechanical community has studied the 

12  accelerations associated with various physical activities.  

13  To give you some context, if you were to, say, sit down 

14  quickly in your chair, your lumbar spine could be exposed 

15  to 3 to 4g's of acceleration.  

16           If you were to jump off of a step or jump up and 

17  land on your feet, your lumbar spine could experience 

18  accelerations on the order of 7 or 8g's even.  

19           If you look at something a little bit more 

20  comparable to sort of like a motor vehicle accident, as I 

21  mentioned previously, if you were to slam on the brakes in 

22  your car, that will be comparable to about 0.7g's of 

23  acceleration.  

24           And if you were, say, in a bumper car and that 


                                                               40

 1  bumper car were hit very hard, you know, as about as hard 

 2  as bumper cars can get hit, the vehicle accelerations of 

 3  that bumper car could be as high as 4 or 5g's.

 4      Q.   Those are far less than the forces involved in 

 5  this accident?

 6      A.   Yes, sir.

 7      Q.   You also -- the fifth part of your analysis, and 

 8  I think we started in that a little bit, but the personal 

 9  tolerance of Ms. Perez, what is meant by her personal 

10  tolerances?

11      A.   Right.  So obviously everyone is different to 

12  some degree.  In this case I had previous medical records 

13  that demonstrated that Ms. Perez had a prior pars 

14  interarticularis defect.  So she had a fracture of the 

15  bony process behind her spine that predated this 

16  particular motor vehicle accident.  And so I wanted to 

17  take into account her personal tolerance, because 

18  obviously, as I mentioned, everybody is a little bit 

19  different.  So essentially that analysis consists of 

20  identifying the types of shear forces that her lumbar 

21  spine was capable of withstanding on a daily basis.  So I 

22  performed some calculations to determine just how much 

23  shear force her spine would experience if she were to, 

24  say, bend over at her waist.  


                                                               41

 1           In this case, it's my opinion that her lumbar 

 2  spine would experience greater shear force just bending 

 3  over to tie her shoes than it experienced in this 

 4  particular motor vehicle accident.

 5      Q.   Did your analysis account for potential 

 6  variations in the plaintiff's posture or the posture 

 7  immediately before the impact?

 8      A.   Yes, it did.  So obviously there are always going 

 9  to be certain things when you are performing this type of 

10  analysis that you can't know with exact certainty.  So I 

11  don't know exactly how her body was positioned inside of 

12  the vehicle.  And in order to account for that, what you 

13  essentially have to do is account for a range of potential 

14  initial positions of her body and then ask yourself 

15  whether or not, you know, changing that posture has a 

16  significant effect on the ultimate opinions with regard to 

17  whether or not the lumbar spine injuries were caused.  And 

18  so in this particular case I accounted for the possibility 

19  that, you know, maybe she was leaning forward a little 

20  bit, maybe she was straight up against her seatback, maybe 

21  she was turned to the side or something like that, and 

22  ultimately came to the conclusion that in this particular 

23  case those were not factors that affected the outcome of 

24  my analysis.


                                                               42

 1      Q.   With respect to the medical records you've 

 2  reviewed, some of those were generated -- were some of 

 3  those generated before the accident?

 4      A.   Yes.  Yes.  There was a considerable history of 

 5  previous lower back pain and previous imaging of her lower 

 6  back that I took into account with my analysis.

 7      Q.   Did you also have the records following the 

 8  accident?

 9      A.   Yes, sir.

10      Q.   Did you take into account her preexisting 

11  conditions?

12      A.   Yes.  

13      Q.   Despite her preexisting conditions, is it still 

14  your opinion that this accident did not cause or 

15  exacerbate any of these injuries?

16      A.   Yes, sir.

17      Q.   What are your final opinions in this case, 

18  Doctor?

19      A.   Sure.  So in this particular case my opinions are 

20  that on May 28th of 2015 Ms. Perez was the seat belted 

21  driver of a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu that was involved in a 

22  rear-end contact and potentially a subsequent front-end 

23  contact.  The rear-end contact was caused by a 2015 Toyota 

24  Rav4.  The severity of the rear-end contact is consistent 


                                                               43

 1  with a Delta-V of less than 6.75 miles per hour with 

 2  average accelerations less than 1.8g's.  

 3           As for the front-end contact or any potential 

 4  front-end contact to her vehicle, that would also be 

 5  consistent with a Delta-V less than 6.75 miles per hour 

 6  and accelerations less than 1.8g's.  The accelerations 

 7  that Ms. Perez experienced during this particular accident 

 8  were within her personal tolerance and human tolerance 

 9  levels and were comparable to or lower than those 

10  accelerations associated with typical daily activities.  

11           Her -- Ms. Perez's body would have tended to move 

12  rearward relative to the interior of the 2004 Chevrolet 

13  Malibu as a result of the rear-end contact to her vehicle, 

14  and that rearward motion would have been well-supported by 

15  the seatback that she was -- by the back of the seat that 

16  she was seated in, and she would not have experienced any 

17  lumbar motion outside of a normal physiological range as a 

18  result of that rearward motion.  

19           As a result of any front-end contact, her body 

20  would have tended to move forward, and that forward motion 

21  would have been well-controlled by the three-point seat 

22  belt that she was wearing, and again her lumbar spine 

23  would not have experienced any motion or loading outside 

24  of a normal physiological range as a result of that 


                                                               44

 1  front-end contact.  

 2           And then finally, it's my opinion that this 

 3  incident did not create the mechanism needed to cause the 

 4  lumbar injury that's being attributed to this particular 

 5  accident.  And therefore, it's my opinion that the lumbar 

 6  spine injury was not caused or exacerbated by this 

 7  particular accident.

 8      Q.   Doctor, did this accident involve the force or 

 9  mechanism necessary to cause any injury to the lumbar 

10  spine?

11      A.   Not in my opinion, sir.

12      Q.   Doctor, were all of your conclusions developed to 

13  a reasonable degree of biomedical and scientific 

14  certainty?

15      A.   Yes, sir.  

16           MR. FLYNN:  Thank you. 

17           MS. GROSS:  Done?  

18           MR. FLYNN:  Done. 

19                            -----

20                         EXAMINATION

21  BY MS. GROSS:

22      Q.   Doctor, good to see you again.  

23      A.   Good morning.

24      Q.   Did I hear you correctly that you took the same 


                                                               45

 1  medical courses as the medical students at the University 

 2  of Cincinnati?

 3      A.   In terms of the anatomy and the physiology 

 4  courses, yes, ma'am.

 5      Q.   Which ones?

 6      A.   Gross human anatomy and human physiology.

 7      Q.   And this is not withstanding any previous 

 8  objections and pending motions in limine, Doctor, I have 

 9  some questions for you regarding your report of       

10  April 12th -- I mean, April 2nd of 2019.  

11           How many vehicles were involved in this accident?

12      A.   Well, there were at least two, and if you look at 

13  the plaintiff's testimony, as many as potentially four.

14      Q.   Doctor, you testified that you are not a medical 

15  doctor; correct?

16      A.   Yes, ma'am.

17      Q.   You don't treat patients, you don't lay your 

18  hands on patients; correct?

19      A.   Correct.

20      Q.   And you are not rendering any medical opinion in 

21  this case; correct?

22      A.   Not with regard to diagnoses, ma'am.  In terms of 

23  medical opinions you would have to be a little more 

24  specific.  Certainly there is a medical aspect, in that my 


                                                               46

 1  opinions, you know, regard the human body.  So if you look 

 2  at it from a very broad perspective, I guess you could say 

 3  that is a medical opinion, but in my opinion it's a 

 4  biomechanical opinion.

 5      Q.   You are aware that in the State of Illinois with 

 6  your qualifications you cannot -- it's against the law to 

 7  offer medical opinion; correct?

 8      A.   That's correct, ma'am.  As I mentioned, ma'am, my 

 9  opinions are biomechanical in nature.

10      Q.   What's the difference between biomechanical, 

11  biomedical?

12      A.   Biomechanical is sort of a subset of biomedical.  

13  Biomedical is really any -- well, biomedical engineering 

14  is any discipline that utilizes principles of engineering.  

15  Biomechanical typically uses more mechanically-oriented 

16  types of opinions.

17      Q.   And you're a biomechanical; correct?

18      A.   Well, my degrees are in bio --

19      Q.   You are a biomechanical?

20      A.   My degree is in biomedical engineering, and I 

21  specialize in biomechanics.

22      Q.   Doctor, what do you understand Ms. Perez's 

23  preexisting injury to be?

24      A.   According to the medical records, she had a 


                                                               47

 1  preexisting pars interarticularis defect.  It was noted to 

 2  be unilateral, and then there was also mention in some of 

 3  her pre-incident medical records that it was potentially a 

 4  bilateral pars interarticularis defect, spondylolysis, in 

 5  other words.

 6      Q.   Spondylolysis; correct?

 7      A.   Yes, ma'am.

 8      Q.   Okay.  Doctor, do you have in front of you 

 9  defendant's updated answer to Rule 213F interrogatories?

10      A.   I have to look, ma'am.

11      Q.   Sure.  Take your time.

12      A.   You said the defendant's?

13      Q.   Correct.

14      A.   I don't believe I do.  No, ma'am.

15      Q.   It's an update -- it's an updated answer to 213F 

16  interrogatories.  

17      A.   Are you referring to my answers to the 

18  interrogatories?  

19      Q.   No, sir.  

20      A.   Ms. Martinez's answers to the interrogatories?  

21      Q.   It's called an updated answer to 213F 

22  interrogatories where the defendant is disclosing the 

23  experts that they hired in this case.  

24      A.   I have answers to plaintiff's expert witness 


                                                               48

 1  interrogatories in response to plaintiff's notice to 

 2  produce to defendant's expert witness.

 3      Q.   That's not it.  

 4      A.   No; ma'am, I don't have them.

 5      Q.   Okay.  So I'll represent to you that we were 

 6  given on April 26th of this year an updated answer to 213 

 7  interrogatories where defendant counsel is disclosing your 

 8  name and the opinions that you are going to have on this 

 9  case.  Is it your testimony that you've never seen that 

10  document before?  

11           MR. FLYNN:  Objection as to form and relevancy.

12      A.   Yes, ma'am, I don't believe I have.  

13      Q.   Thank you.  Doctor, is there any medical opinion 

14  that would change your ultimate opinion on this case?

15      A.   Not with regard to injury causation, ma'am.

16      Q.   Doctor, you testified earlier that you work full 

17  time for what we call ARCCA now, A-R-C-C-A?

18      A.   Yes, ma'am.

19      Q.   And you've been there for three years; correct?

20      A.   A little over four years, ma'am.

21      Q.   I apologize.  You've been there over four years.  

22  And in this case specifically, working with Querrey & 

23  Harrow which is the defendant's firm, law firm, how many 

24  times have you worked with them?


                                                               49

 1      A.   I think approximately 15 times.

 2      Q.   Sixteen with this case; right?

 3      A.   Potentially, yes, ma'am.

 4      Q.   And according to your answers to our expert 

 5  interrogatories, you've been working with Querrey & Harrow 

 6  for about three years; is that correct?

 7      A.   If you go back to the first time I was retained 

 8  by them, yes, ma'am, that's about right.

 9      Q.   Of those -- of these 16 cases that you had with 

10  Querrey & Harrow, I know at least two cases where it's a 

11  motor vehicle accident.  What about the other cases?  Are 

12  they also motor vehicle accidents?  

13           MR. FLYNN:  Objection as to form.  

14      A.   Yes.  Yes, ma'am, I believe they all were.  I 

15  can't recall a case where I was retained by them for 

16  something that was not a motor vehicle accident, if that 

17  is the question.

18      Q.   Thank you.  Mr. Wordeman, is your employment with 

19  ARCCA, any of the expert opinions that you had given while 

20  working for ARCCA, do you also work for plaintiff's side?

21      A.   Yes, ma'am.  I have been retained by plaintiffs 

22  previously.

23      Q.   And what would be the percentage that you're 

24  retained by plaintiff and that you're retained by 


                                                               50

 1  defendants?  

 2      A.   I don't keep track of specific percentages, but I 

 3  would say generally it's more defense than plaintiff work.

 4      Q.   To date on this case how much has ARCCA charged 

 5  for your time?

 6      A.   For my time specifically or for the entire case?  

 7  It's not all necessarily my time on this case.

 8      Q.   Well, let's do this.  How much ARCCA has charged 

 9  Querrey & Harrow for the opinions, revision, of your 

10  opinion on this case?  

11           MR. FLYNN:  Objection as to form and 

12  characterization.

13      A.   Sure.  I believe to date ARCCA has billed 

14  $4,687.50 in this case.  

15      Q.   And that is of April 2, 2019; isn't that correct?

16      A.   April 12th of 2019, ma'am.

17      Q.   Oh, I don't have that one, because the invoice I 

18  have is 4,687.50 of April 2nd of 2019.  This is not 

19  counting your discovery deposition, nor your deposition 

20  today; correct?  

21               MR. FLYNN:  Objection as to form and 

22  characterization.

23      A.   Right.

24      Q.   Doctor, and you are still charging $350 an hour; 


                                                               51

 1  correct?  

 2      A.   I am not charging anything, ma'am.  ARCCA is 

 3  charging $325 an hour for my time under oath here today.

 4      Q.   And again notwithstanding previous objections, 

 5  motions in limine pending, Mr. Wordeman, when you review 

 6  medical records in this case, you are relying on what 

 7  other doctors that treated Ms. Perez came up with, right, 

 8  the diagnosis that they came up with?

 9      A.   For the diagnoses specifically, yes, ma'am.

10      Q.   And you testified earlier on that you reviewed 

11  MRIs prior to this accident; correct?

12      A.   I don't know if I specifically reviewed MRIs 

13  prior to this accident.  I believe there were prior 

14  images.  They may have been MRIs.  They may have been 

15  x-rays.  I can give you more specifics if you wanted.

16      Q.   Sure.

17      A.   There is numerous office visits and office notes.

18      Q.   So my question is, regarding is specifically the 

19  images that you've seen --

20      A.   Yes.  So --

21      Q.   -- prior to this accident.  

22      A.   Well, I would not have reviewed the actual 

23  images.  I would have reviewed the reports associated with 

24  those images.  So I wouldn't be interpreting the images.  


                                                               52

 1  I would be relying on the doctors' interpretation of those 

 2  images.

 3      Q.   Because you are not trained for that; correct?

 4      A.   Right.  That's not what a biomechanical engineer 

 5  does.  A biomechanical engineer performs injury causation 

 6  analyses.

 7      Q.   So my information was correct?

 8      A.   Yes.

 9      Q.   Doctor, throughout your report you have a series 

10  of publications, books, and articles that you cite to 

11  support your opinion; correct?

12      A.   Yes, ma'am.

13      Q.   Of those articles, books, and publications, do 

14  any of them take into consideration the group in which my 

15  client belongs?  And by that I mean age, preexisting 

16  condition.  

17      A.   Well, certainly a number of the articles that I 

18  rely upon consist of individuals that would be either 

19  younger than, older than, or approximately the same age as 

20  your client, you know, taller than, shorter than, lighter 

21  than, heavier than, et cetera.  So they would span sort of 

22  a range that would include your client, but clearly, you 

23  know, it's unlikely that any of them were specifically the 

24  exact age, height, weight, et cetera, as your client.


                                                               53

 1      Q.   Well, more than that, is there any article that 

 2  had height, weight, age, and evidently a preexisting 

 3  condition as Ms. Perez has?

 4      A.   I don't know if any of them specifically had pars 

 5  interarticularis defects, but certainly again there would 

 6  be individuals who would span that range in terms of age, 

 7  height, and weight.

 8      Q.   So let's make it clear.  Is there any articles, 

 9  books, or publications, that you cite on your report that 

10  account for the fact and the characteristics in which 

11  Ms. Perez presents?

12      A.   Well, it's my opinion that there are many that 

13  account for them.  They may not specifically include all 

14  of those individual characteristics in a single article, 

15  though, ma'am.  

16      Q.   Doctor, are you familiar with the lay term 

17  whiplash?

18      A.   Yes, ma'am, I am.

19      Q.   And what is your understanding of that to be?

20      A.   Well, generally speaking, whiplash is a term used 

21  primarily with regard to symptomatology generally 

22  following rear-end motor vehicle accidents, and it 

23  typically refers to pain at the cervical spine or the neck 

24  and potentially what I would refer to cervicogenic 


                                                               54

 1  headaches.  It's not a term that biomechanists typically 

 2  use in order to discuss specific injuries, because there 

 3  is not broad consensus as to what an injury associated 

 4  with whiplash is.

 5      Q.   You lost me.  So your understanding of whiplash 

 6  is related to an injury in the body?

 7      A.   It's a term used to refer to various symptoms.  

 8  There is not broad agreement as to whether or not it 

 9  refers to injury to a specific part of the human body.

10      Q.   Sure, and I wasn't asking for a broad agreement 

11  or what other people understand whiplash to be.  I'm 

12  asking for your understanding of the whiplash.  So it's an 

13  injury to the body?

14      A.   No, ma'am.

15      Q.   Is that what you said?

16      A.   No, ma'am.  I said it's a term used to rely -- or 

17  it's a term used in regard to various symptoms or pain 

18  which is very different from injury.  

19      Q.   So you don't understand whiplash to mean a 

20  movement of the body in the car?

21      A.   It certainly --

22      Q.   I'm sorry.  Let's try again.  Strike that.

23           So you don't understand whiplash to be a type of 

24  movement of a body in a car accident, for example?


                                                               55

 1      A.   Well, there is certainly a type of movement 

 2  that's associated with whiplash, but, as I mentioned, it's 

 3  not a term that specifically refers to injury to a 

 4  specific part of the body.

 5      Q.   Sure.  Doctor, did I understand your testimony 

 6  correctly that in your opinion this rear-end accident did 

 7  not cause Ms. Perez's body to move forward because it was 

 8  restrained by a three-point seat belt?

 9      A.   Well, it's not that it wouldn't have moved 

10  forward at all.  First of all, her initial movement would 

11  have been rearward relative to the interior of the 

12  vehicle, and if she did experience any forward motion, it 

13  would have been extremely well-limited because of the 

14  three-point restraint she was wearing.

15      Q.   Can you calculate how limited that was?

16      A.   Yes, I did, ma'am.

17      Q.   And how was -- how limited was it?

18      A.   Well, in terms of rebound, I did not specifically 

19  perform that analysis, but in order to take into account 

20  the most severe scenario in terms of potential frontal 

21  contact, it's my opinion that her head would not have 

22  moved forward more than 242 millimeters, and her hip would 

23  not have moved forward more than 123 millimeters which 

24  would be -- correspond to forward motion of her torso or 


                                                               56

 1  her chest somewhere in the ballpark of about 182.5 

 2  millimeters, ma'am.

 3      Q.   Mr. Wordeman, did you arrive at a speed in which 

 4  defendant's car hit my client's car?

 5      A.   I identified an upper boundary for the possible 

 6  speed of the defense vehicle based on the upper limit for 

 7  the Delta-V that I calculated.

 8      Q.   And what would that speed be?

 9      A.   So based on the laws of physics and the damage to 

10  the vehicle resulting in a Delta-V less than 6.75 miles 

11  per hour, it's my opinion that the defendant's vehicle 

12  would not have been traveling faster than somewhere 

13  between 9 1/2 and 13 miles per hour.

14      Q.   In that range; right?  

15           MR. FLYNN:  Objection as to characterization.

16      A.   Well, somewhere less than that.  It depends on -- 

17  when you're performing that type of calculation, you have 

18  to come up with what I would refer to as a coefficient of 

19  restitution and accounting for a range of numbers for that 

20  coefficient of restitution.  The number would fall 

21  somewhere between 9 1/2 and 13, but again it would be less 

22  than that.  So it certainly could have been going less 

23  than 9 1/2, but it was most certainly traveling less than 

24  13.


                                                               57

 1      Q.   So -- so we are clear, it was a range between 9 

 2  1/2 and 13 and, like you said, it could be less, but it's 

 3  still within a range because we don't know exactly; 

 4  correct?

 5      A.   Right.

 6      Q.   Mr. Wordeman, you also testified that you relied 

 7  on some pictures in assisting you with your ultimate 

 8  opinion in this case; is that correct?

 9      A.   Yes, ma'am.

10      Q.   And I think we went through this in your 

11  discovery deposition, there are about 116 pictures that 

12  you saw, some of them duplicates; correct?

13      A.   Right.  Correct.

14      Q.   Do you know when those pictures were taken, 

15  either from the defendant's car or the plaintiff's car?  

16      A.   Certainly all of the photographs of the 

17  defendant's car that I have appear to have been taken in 

18  February of 2016.  I do not specifically know when the 

19  photographs of the plaintiff's vehicle were taken, ma'am.

20      Q.   So the defendant's pictures would have been taken 

21  about a year after -- almost a year after the accident?

22      A.   Almost, yes, ma'am.

23      Q.   And you rely on defendant's testimony that there 

24  was no damage and that she didn't take her car to be 


                                                               58

 1  repaired; correct?

 2      A.   I certainly took it into account, yes. 

 3      Q.   But you didn't see any pictures prior to February 

 4  2016?

 5      A.   Right.

 6      Q.   Do you know if defendant on this case, 

 7  Ms. Martinez, was at the scene of the accident when the 

 8  police report was created?

 9      A.   I believe, if I recall correctly, the plaintiff 

10  went and subsequently had the police report generated.  So 

11  I don't know that the police report was actually generated 

12  at the scene.  I believe it was generated subsequent to 

13  the accident.

14      Q.   So there is nothing in the police report to 

15  account to defendant's view of the accident; correct?

16      A.   To account for her view of the accident?

17      Q.   For her -- yes, for her side of the story.  

18      A.   No; I didn't see anything in the police report 

19  that would indicate that, ma'am.

20      Q.   Mr. Wordeman, you did not review the transcript 

21  from Dr. Wahi's deposition, did you?

22           MR. FLYNN:  I'm going to object as to form and 

23  characterization.  It was an evidence deposition.  He is 

24  not allowed to review that.


                                                               59

 1  BY MS. GROSS:

 2      Q.   Well, based on the objections, did you review 

 3  any transcripts of Dr. Wahi's?  

 4           MR. FLYNN:  Same objection.  

 5      A.   No, ma'am, I don't believe I did.

 6      Q.   Did you review any records from Mr. -- or for 

 7  Dr. Wahi?

 8      A.   I would have to go through all of the records 

 9  that I have to be able to tell you for sure, ma'am.  I 

10  don't recall seeing any, but that doesn't mean that I 

11  didn't see any.

12           Could you spell the doctor's names, ma'am?

13      Q.   Sure.  W-A-H-I.

14      A.   I don't recall seeing any medical records from a 

15  Dr. Wahi. 

16           MS. GROSS:  Thank you.  I have no further 

17  questions.

19                        EXAMINATION

20  BY MR. FLYNN:

21      Q.   Doctor, why don't you look through your records 

22  from Midwest Physician Pain Center. 

23      A.   Oh, here they are.   Oh, yes.  So there are some 

24  records from Dr. Wahi here.


                                                               60

 1      Q.   So you did review and consider those in doing 

 2  your analysis in this particular case?

 3      A.   Yes, sir.  

 4      Q.   You were asked a couple of questions about 

 5  whiplash.  Is whiplash sometimes utilized as a generic 

 6  term for acceleration, deceleration?

 7      A.   Yes.  I think that's generally what it is.

 8      Q.   Is it also generic for sometimes flexion and 

 9  extension?

10      A.   Yes.

11      Q.   And with respect to flexion, extension, is that 

12  something that you account for in your kinematic analysis?

13      A.   Yes.  So, I mean, generally speaking, whiplash is 

14  not something that's associated with the lumbar spine at 

15  all.  It's more related to the cervical spine, but 

16  certainly the extension, the level of extension, the level 

17  of flexion of the lumbar spine are something that I 

18  accounted for during my analysis of this accident.  

19      Q.   You were also asked about the potential speed of 

20  my client's vehicle which you gave an estimate of 9.5 to 

21  13 miles per hour?

22      A.   Yes.  The upper limit for the speed of defense 

23  vehicle would be somewhere in that range.

24      Q.   Is that based upon the Delta-V at 6.75 miles per 


                                                               61

 1  hour?  

 2      A.   Right.  It's based on a more conservative Delta-

 3  V than the actual Delta-V of this accident.

 4      Q.   So you would expect it to be less than the range 

 5  that you gave?

 6      A.   Right.

 7      Q.   In other words, that is a very conservative 

 8  estimate?  

 9           MS. GROSS:  Objection.  Mischaracterization.

10      A.   Yes, sir, that's correct.

11      Q.   And you were asked about most of your cases 

12  being on behalf of defendants as opposed to plaintiffs.  

13  Do you limit your work to one side or the other?

14      A.   No, sir, certainly not.  I'll be happy to give a 

15  fair and honest opinion to anyone who seeks my opinions. 

16      Q.   And when we talk about the chest moving forward 

17  182 millimeters, 182 sounds like a lot.  Translate that 

18  to inches for me.

19      A.   It's going to be somewhere about 10 inches.

20      Q.   And there is, what, 10 millimeters to a 

21  centimeter?

22      A.   Right.

23      Q.   There is about 2 1/2 centimeters to an inch?  

24           MS. GROSS:  Objection.


                                                               62

 1      A.   Right.

 2      Q.   So you are talking about 8 inches?

 3      A.   Yes, 8 inches or so.

 4           MR. FLYNN:  Thank you, Doctor. 

 5           THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

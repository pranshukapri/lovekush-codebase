           4   letter from the attorney's office.  Then I

           5   refresh my memory.

           6   Q.     Since that car accident occurred, have

           7   you been involved in any other car accidents?

           8   A.     After 2017, right?

           9   Q.     After September 15, 2017.

          10   A.     Yes, once.

          11   Q.     When did that one occur?

          12   A.     It's maybe seven, eight months ago.  I

          13   don't remember exactly.  Approximately, maybe

          14   within a year.

          15   Q.     Just generally, how did that happen?

          16   A.     It was at the crossroad of the traffic

          17   light, and I was turning.  Then the car for

          18   the opposing lane came over.

          19   Q.     Do you know what caused that accident?

          20   A.     Are you talking about the new accident

          21   or the one happened in 2017?

          22   Q.     The new one.

          23   A.     I was making an attempt of turning at

          24   the traffic light, and I didn't see the

                                                           13



           1   upcoming vehicle.  That's how it happened.

           2   Q.     You were turning left?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     Before the September of 2017 accident,

           5   had you been in any other car accidents in

           6   the five years before that, 2012 to 2017?

           7   A.     Does that include other people that

           8   have contact with me?

           9   Q.     Yes.

          10   A.     If you want to talk about other people

          11   that hit me, then maybe three, four times,

          12   yes.  They was other people's fault.

          13   Q.     Were those all rear-end type

          14   accidents?

          15   A.     Are you talking about those accidents

          16   that people hit me from behind?

          17   Q.     Yes, that's what I'm asking.  You said

          18   three or four accidents.

          19          Were you hit from behind in all of

          20   those?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Can you read any English?

          23   A.     Not too much.

          24   Q.     How do you do with traffic signs?

                                                           14



           1   A.     I do know some of the driving signs.

           2   Q.     Even the ones with words on them?

           3               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  I'm just going

           4   to object to that question as being overly

           5   broad.  I mean, if you want to specify what

           6   types of signs you're referring to, but that

           7   could really mean a whole lot of things.

           8   BY MR. LEVY:

           9   Q.     Do you have any trouble understanding

          10   any traffic signs that have words on them?

          11   A.     No, I won't be able to read it, but I

          12   usually go by my memory of those routes that

          13   I remember and some of the signs that I can

          14   understand.

          15   Q.     I want to switch gears and talk about

          16   the 2017 accident.

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     The date I have is September 15, 2017;

          19   is that correct?

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     What time of day did the accident

          22   occur?

          23   A.     It's around 10:00 in the morning.

          24   Q.     What was the weather like?

                                                           15

           2   Q.     What type of vehicle were you driving?

           3   A.     It's an Audi Q7.

           4   Q.     Is that an SUV?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Was anyone in the car with you at the

           7   time of the accident?

           8   A.     No.

           9   Q.     Who was the registered owner of the

          10   Audi?

          11   A.     My husband.

          12   Q.     Was that the car you would typically

          13   drive?

          14   A.     We share it.  We alternate.  Yes, I'm

          15   on the insurance.

          16   Q.     Was it black?

          17   A.     Correct.

          18   Q.     Did the vehicle have any damage to the

          19   outside before the accident happened?

          20   A.     No.

          21   Q.     It was insured with Progressive?

          22   A.     I don't know the name of the insurance

          23   company.  My husband handles all that.

          24   Q.     Was it registered in Pennsylvania?

                                                           16



           1   A.     Correct.

           2   Q.     What were you doing that morning?

           3   A.     I was driving back home because the

           4   location of where the accident happened

           5   that's my home.

           6               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Let's take a

           7   break for a second.

           8                       - - -

           9               (Whereupon, a break was taken at

          10    this time.)

          11                       - - -

          12               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Ma'am, you were

          13   asked a question earlier about where your

          14   vehicle was registered.  You said it was

          15   registered in Pennsylvania.

          16               Where was the vehicle registered

          17   at the time of the accident?

          18               THE WITNESS:  Yes, I'm sorry, I

          19   forgot to mention earlier because at the time

          20   of the accident the vehicle I have was

          21   registered in the state of New Jersey.

          22   However, in 2018, I got another new vehicle,

          23   and that's registered in Pennsylvania.

           1   BY MR. LEVY:

           2   Q.     Thank you for clarifying.  I think I

           3   noticed right after I asked you that that the

           4   pictures I have show New Jersey license

           5   plates, correct?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     At the time of the accident, I think

           8   you mentioned you were on the way home?

           9   A.     Where the accident happened was right

          10   across the street from my home.

          11   Q.     At the time of the accident, were you

          12   coming back home, or were you leaving your

          13   home?

          14   A.     Yes, I was returning home and just

          15   parking my car.  Then the vehicle struck me

          16   from behind.

          17   Q.     Where were you coming from?

          18   A.     I was coming from US Route 1.

          19   Q.     Where had you been earlier?  Were you

          20   shopping?  Were you at the restaurant?  Were

          21   you somewhere else?

          22   A.     Well, the original plan was going to

          23   shopping, but I cancelled that plan and

          24   returning back home.

                                                           18



           1   Q.     What time did you leave your house

           2   that morning?

           3   A.     Around 9:00.

           4   Q.     After leaving your house, did you get

           5   out of your car at any point?

           6   A.     Are you asking me whether I got out of

           7   my car or go shopping?

           8   Q.     Yeah, did you actually go anywhere?

           9   A.     Yes, because I was planning to do some

          10   shopping, but then I got out of the car but I

          11   didn't go shopping.  I got back in the car

          12   and returned home.

          13   Q.     Where did you plan to shop?

          14   A.     It's on Roosevelt Boulevard.  There is

          15   some shopping centers, so I was planning to

          16   get some groceries.

          17   Q.     Why did you cancel those plans?

          18   A.     Because my husband called me and told

          19   me to come back.

          20   Q.     Did he say why to come back?

          21   A.     Well, he called me to come back to

          22   pick him up; he wants to go together.

          23   Q.     How many cars did you own at the time

          24   of the accident?

           3   have any parking spots?

           4   A.     No, it's off-street parking.

           5   Q.     Generally, how is the parking over

           6   there?

           7   A.     It's pretty much all off-street

           8   parking.  There is no particular parking

           9   spot.

          10   Q.     Is it usually hard to find a parking

          11   spot?  Is there always a spot open?

          12          Are you able to give me what it's like

          13   to find a spot?

          14   A.     Sometimes it's easy, but sometimes

          15   when it gets to the evening it's not so easy

          16   to find a parking spot.

          17   Q.     What day of the week was this

          18   accident?

          19   A.     I really don't recall.

          20   Q.     Do you know if it was a weekday versus

          21   a weekend?

          22   A.     I don't have a clear recollection.

          23   Q.     Other than shopping, did you have any

          24   set plans that day?

                                                           20



           1   A.     No, nothing else.

           2   Q.     Were either you or your husband

           3   working that day?

           4   A.     Yes, I worked that day, but not until

           5   12:00, noon.  I don't have to work until

           6   12:00 or 1:00.

           7   Q.     How far is work from your home?

           8   A.     Well, it's the same location.  The

           9   street level, the first floor, was where I

          10   work, and then we live upstairs.

          11   Q.     Where was your husband when you

          12   initially left to go shopping by yourself?

          13   A.     He was sleeping.

          14   Q.     How far were you from your house when

          15   you got the call from your husband?

          16   A.     15 minutes away from the house.

          17   Q.     When he called you and asked you to

          18   come back, were you in any kind of rush at

          19   that point?

          20   A.     No, I was just driving as I normally

          21   drive returning home.

          22   Q.     Can you tell me what happened from the

          23   time you got the call from your husband?

          24   A.     Nothing else, just driving back home.

                                                           21



           1   Q.     Where did the accident take place?

           2   A.     Well, it was outside my house because

           3   I tried to do parallel parking into the

           4   parking lot, and then when I was parking this

           5   car struck me from the rear.

           6   Q.     It happened on Hunting Park Avenue?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Which direction on Hunting Park?

           9   A.     I'm just going home straight this way.

          10   I'm not sure what you mean by direction.

          11   Q.     How long had you been on Hunting Park

          12   before the accident occurred?

          13   A.     Well, from the shopping center and

          14   returning to my home, it took me about 15 to

          15   20 minutes.

          16   Q.     Is most of that drive back on Hunting

          17   Park Avenue the whole time?

          18               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  I'm just going

          19   to object to most of.

          20               Do you want to put a time on it

          21   or ask the question a different way?

          22   BY MR. LEVY:

          23   Q.     Can you estimate in distance how long

          24   you were on Hunting Park Avenue coming back

                                                           22



           1   from shopping?

           2   A.     I drove on Hunting Park up to my

           3   restaurant home about five-minute drive, very

           4   close.

           5   Q.     You would have been going the same

           6   direction on Hunting Park that whole time

           7   until the accident happened?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     How many lanes is Hunting Park in the

          10   direction you were travelling?

          11   A.     I'm sorry, can you repeat the question

          12   one more time.

          13   Q.     How many lanes of travel are there on

          14   Hunting Park the way you were going?

          15   A.     Two.

          16   Q.     Is it a two-way road with two lanes

          17   going each way?

          18   A.     Yes, two cars can drive in the same

          19   direction.  Two car lanes, yes.

          20               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  He's asking,

          21   though, can cars travel both in your

          22   direction of travel and the opposite

          23   direction of travel on the same road?

          24               THE WITNESS:  Yes, correct.

           2   Q.     Generally, how were the traffic

           3   conditions that morning?

           4   A.     It's not heavy.  It's just normal,

           5   light.

           6   Q.     Do you remember the last time you had

           7   to come to a stop before the accident

           8   happened?

           9   A.     No, I got to my home and want to park

          10   and wait for my husband to come out.

          11   Q.     What was the last intersection you had

          12   traveled through before getting to your house

          13   area?

          14   A.     I'm sorry, can you ask the question

          15   one more time.

          16   Q.     Had you recently crossed through an

          17   intersection before getting to your house?

          18   A.     No.

          19   Q.     What's the speed limit on Hunting

          20   Park?

          21   A.     I think approximately 35, 40,

          22   approximately.  I'm not certain.

          23   Q.     As you were approaching the area where

          24   you live, how fast were you traveling?

                                                           24



           1   A.     I wasn't even 25, very slow.  25, 30,

           2   not even.

           3   Q.     Let's say in that last block of travel

           4   as you're getting towards your house, were

           5   there any other cars in the immediate area

           6   going the same direction as you?

           7   A.     I don't really look and think about

           8   that, no.

           9   Q.     Before getting there, did you have a

          10   plan about how you were going to pick up your

          11   husband?

          12   A.     No, I don't need a specific plan

          13   because he knows that I will be home.  I just

          14   want to get to my house, park my car, and

          15   wait for him to come out.  That's all.

          16   Q.     Before getting there, where did you

          17   want to park your car?

          18   A.     Off the street.

          19   Q.     Was there any thought about which side

          20   you were going to park on?

          21   A.     Well, where my restaurant was, that

          22   side.

          23   Q.     Is that the side where the accident

          24   happened?

                                                           25



           1   A.     Yes, where I wanted to park.

           2   Q.     Did the accident happen on the same

           3   side of the road that the restaurant is on?

           4   A.     No, the restaurant is across the

           5   street.  I was on the opposite side of the

           6   restaurant.

           7   Q.     Why were you on the opposite side of

           8   the restaurant?

           9   A.     Because I was coming home, so that's

          10   where I was planning to wait for him.

          11   Q.     You were always planning to wait on

          12   the opposite side?

          13   A.     Yes, that's correct.  I wanted to park

          14   and wait for him.

          15   Q.     Was your plan to park in an actual

          16   parking spot?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     As you were approaching the area,

          19   which lane were you in?

          20   A.     Well, the inside lane where I can

          21   park.

          22   Q.     The right lane?

          23   A.     Yes, because I'm on the inside lane,

          24   and that's where I wanted to park on the

                                                           26



           1   street.

           2   Q.     How long had you been in that lane

           3   before the accident happened?

           4   A.     Can you say that again?  I'm not sure.

           5   Q.     How long had you been traveling in the

           6   inside lane?

           7   A.     Not long, maybe four or five minutes,

           8   if I recall correctly.

           9   Q.     At some point, did you notice a

          10   parking spot that was empty on the right

          11   side?

          12   A.     Yes, because I saw a spot, so I

          13   decided to reverse back in to park.

          14   Q.     Tell me everything that happened once

          15   you noticed the spot.

          16   A.     Yes, I saw the parking.  I was in the

          17   middle of my parking, and all I can remember

          18   there was a vehicle with a high speed and

          19   struck me from behind, very strong impact,

          20   high speed.

          21   Q.     Was your vehicle moving backwards at

          22   the point of impact?

          23   A.     Yes, I was in a state of reversing

          24   into the parking spot.

                                                           27



           1   Q.     How far backwards had you moved?

           2   A.     Not too long.  I just started to

           3   reverse back in a little bit in there.

           4   Q.     Can you estimate in distance how far

           5   you had moved going backwards?

           6               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Do you mean in

           7   the spot or reversing?  It's not clear if you

           8   mean reversing down the street or into the

           9   spot.

          10               MR. LEVY:  Reversing.

          11   BY MR. LEVY:

          12   Q.     What distance did your vehicle move

          13   while in reverse?

          14               MR. LEVY:  I think the question

          15   is clear.

          16               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  You can answer

          17   if you understand.

          18               MR. LEVY:  If she doesn't

          19   understand, she can let me know.

          20               THE WITNESS:  My vehicle was not

          21   all in the parking spot.  I was planning to

          22   reverse in.  I just started backing in, and

          23   this car viciously slam into my vehicle very

          24   hard.

                                                           28



           1   BY MR. LEVY:

           2   Q.     My question is just in terms of

           3   distance.

           4          Was it a few feet, or if it's easier

           5   in car lengths, how far did your vehicle

           6   moved backwards?

           7   A.     You're asking me how much I reverse in

           8   the parking?

           9   Q.     Exactly.

          10   A.     I don't get into the parking spot yet,

          11   but I was in the process of that.  I was

          12   planning to reverse back in.

          13   Q.     Had you moved more or less than five

          14   feet?

          15   A.     Are you talking about did you move

          16   five feet into the spot?

          17   Q.     From the very first time you put your

          18   car into the reverse gear, how far did you

          19   travel?

          20   A.     Not much because I reverse slowly, and

          21   he just slammed into my car.  I was

          22   reversing, pause, reversing, like stop,

          23   pause, and reversing, that kind of state.

          24   Q.     How many times had you reversed and

                                                           29



           1   paused?

           2   A.     Not long.  I don't remember, because

           3   during the course I tried to park, the other

           4   vehicle just slam into my vehicle.

           5   Q.     When the impact happened, was your

           6   vehicle straight, or had you turned and

           7   actually started moving into the spot at all?

           8   A.     No, I'm in the state of going like

           9   this and that, trying to park.  I don't tilt

          10   it into the spot yet.  My car wasn't tilted.

          11   Q.     It wasn't tilted at all?

          12   A.     But it's moving.  You can tell she

          13   probably didn't pay attention.

          14   Q.     Where was your vehicle compared to the

          15   empty spot when you first noticed the empty

          16   spot?

          17   A.     I was a little before the empty spot

          18   so I can back up.

          19   Q.     When you first noticed it, that's

          20   where you were?

          21   A.     Yes, because I was in the parking

          22   state position.

          23   Q.     When you first slowed down to try to

          24   begin going towards the empty spot, were

                                                           30



           1   there any vehicles directly behind you?

           2   A.     If I remember correctly, I didn't see

           3   any car close behind.  He was pretty far

           4   away, but he was in a high speed and slam

           5   into my car.

           6   Q.     Did you ever put on a turn signal?

           7   A.     Of course, it was on, yes.

           8   Q.     What type of signal did you put on?

           9   A.     My turning signal, parking.

          10   Q.     A right turn signal?  A left turn

          11   signal?  Flashers?

          12   A.     Yes, on the right side.

          13   Q.     A right turn signal, correct?

          14   A.     Yes, correct, yes.

          15   Q.     When did you first put that on?

          16   A.     The time when I started to park I put

          17   that on.

          18   Q.     Did you put that on before you started

          19   slowing down?

          20   A.     When I saw the parking spot, I start

          21   to put my signal on.

          22   Q.     When was the very first time you saw

          23   the car that hit you?

          24   A.     Well, I was there in my position of

                                                           31



           1   parking and I don't know and he just rushed

           2   from behind.

           3   Q.     Did you ever actually see the car with

           4   your eyes before feeling an impact?

           5   A.     I don't see any car immediately

           6   behind.  He's far away.

           7   Q.     My question is just what type of

           8   vehicle hit your vehicle.

           9   A.     I don't remember what kind of car it

          10   was.  Maybe it was a cream color.  I don't

          11   remember.

          12   Q.     Do you know if it was a sedan or a big

          13   SUV or truck, medium-sized car?

          14   A.     I don't recall.  I don't remember.

          15   Q.     Where were you looking when you felt

          16   the impact?

          17   A.     When the impact happened, I was

          18   parking.  Then after it, I felt the impact

          19   and looked in the mirror and, oh, my God, the

          20   guy hit me.

          21   Q.     Which direction were your eyes facing

          22   right before you felt the impact?

          23   A.     Well, I just tried to park.

          24   Q.     Ma'am, that's not my question.  My

                                                           32



           1   question is very specific.

           2          Were where you actually looking right

           3   before the impact happened?

           4   A.     Looking in the front because I wanted

           5   to move back in and look in the front.  I

           6   wanted to park.

           7   Q.     Could you see the vehicle that hit you

           8   right before it hit you?

           9   A.     No, because I was looking in the

          10   front, because where I was sitting in my car

          11   parked, I didn't see his car.  I didn't see

          12   there is a car behind.

          13   Q.     I thought you told me before your car

          14   was moving backwards at the time of the

          15   impact?

          16   A.     Yes, because I was planning to park,

          17   and meantime I'm looking in the front at the

          18   mirror.  I didn't see any vehicle coming up.

          19   Q.     At the actual moment where you felt

          20   the impact, was your vehicle moving backwards

          21   at that time?

          22   A.     No, my car was on, but I was in a

          23   state of trying to park, like move a little

          24   bit and pause, that kind of state.

                                                           33



           1               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  He wants to

           2   know was your car in reverse, in drive, or

           3   were you parked or something else when the

           4   actual impact occurred.

           5               THE WITNESS:  Yes, it was in

           6   reverse, and then I reverse and pause,

           7   reverse and pause.

           8   BY MR. LEVY:

           9   Q.     When the actual impact happened, what

          10   pedal is your foot on?

          11   A.     My foot was on the brake, kind of hold

          12   it a little bit.

          13   Q.     As the impact was just about to

          14   happen, could you see in your rear-view

          15   mirror?

          16               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Are you asking

          17   her if it was possible she was looking, or

          18   was she actually looking?

          19               MR. LEVY:  Was she actually

          20   looking.

          21               THE WITNESS:  Yes, before that,

          22   yes.  I look in the mirror.  I didn't see any

          23   car.  Prior to the incident happen, I look in

          24   the mirror.  I didn't see any car.

           2   Q.     Did you ever see the car that hit you

           3   before the impact?

           4   A.     No, I did not.

           5   Q.     Do you have any idea the speed of that

           6   vehicle?

           7   A.     I can tell you he's in a hard speed,

           8   very, very.  I felt that he didn't even

           9   realize my car was there and just very hard.

          10   Q.     Is that based solely on what the force

          11   of the impact felt like?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     We can agree it was a very hard

          14   impact?

          15   A.     Yes, he slammed into my car.

          16   Q.     What was the point of impact on your

          17   vehicle?

          18   A.     On the side of my rear part.

          19   Q.     Do you have any idea which lane that

          20   vehicle was in leading up to the accident?

          21               THE INTERPRETER:  Do you have any

          22   idea which vehicle?

          23               MR. LEVY:  The striking vehicle.

          24               THE WITNESS:  I think that he's

                                                           35



           1   on the same lane where I was, and after the

           2   impact, his car was kind of just facing the

           5   Q.     How did your car move as a result of

           6   the impact?

           7   A.     Same spot where I was, and he was

           9   Q.     Did your car get pushed forward at

          10   all?

          11   A.     I think that maybe I'd been pushed

          12   forward just a little bit, but I was trying

          13   to park.  His car was pretty hard coming from

          14   behind.

          15   Q.     Did you have any warning that an

          16   impact was about to occur, such as a honking

          17   horn or screeching tires?

          18   A.     No, none of that stuff.

          19   Q.     How did your body move during the

          20   impact?

          21   A.     I shook up like that.

          22   Q.     Did you hit anything inside of the

          23   car?

          24   A.     No, I didn't, no.

           3   Q.     Did you ever go to a hospital to get

           6   Q.     Were there any witnesses to the

           7   accident?

           8   A.     I don't think so.  I don't think any

           9   witness.

          10   Q.     What happened right after?

          11   A.     I think that after the accident he

          12   called the police and the cop came over and

          13   took the report.

          14   Q.     Did your husband come out?

          15   A.     Yes, he came out.

          16   Q.     Did he see the accident?

          17   A.     No, he did not.

          18   Q.     Did he say whether he heard the

          19   accident?

          20   A.     No, he was inside the house.

          21   Q.     How did he learn of the accident?

          22   A.     Well, after the accident happened, he

          23   was ready to come out, so he saw my car

          24   outside.

           1   Q.     Did you have a phone with you in the

           2   car?

           3   A.     Yes, I have phone in my car, but I did

           4   not make a phone call.

           5   Q.     When you called your husband or when

           6   he called you rather, were you driving when

           7   you took that call?

           8   A.     No.  When my husband called me, I was

           9   planning to shop.  Then he called, so I told

          10   him I will be back in about 20 minutes.

          11   Q.     Do you have any type of hands-free or

          12   bluetooth system in the car?

          13   A.     No, I don't have none of that stuff.

          14   Q.     Did you call your husband to tell him

          15   you were getting close?

          16   A.     No, because I know how much time it's

          17   going to take him to get ready.  So I was

          18   going to call him after I parked the car and

          19   let him know that I'm here.

          20   Q.     You hadn't done that yet when the

          21   accident took place?

          22   A.     That's correct, no.

          23   Q.     Who was your phone service provider at

          24   the time of the accident?

                                                           38



           1   A.     I don't know because my husband and

           2   son took care of all that stuff.

           3   Q.     What was your phone number at the time

           4   of the accident?

           5   A.     (215)410-0375.

           6   Q.     Has that changed since the accident?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     Has your phone service provider

           9   changed since the accident?

          10   A.     I don't know.  I'm not sure.  Probably

          11   they did.  My son took care of all that

          12   stuff.

          13   Q.     What's your son's name?

          14   A.     Jason Zheng, Z-H-E-N-G.

          15   Q.     Does he live with you?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     Other than police and your husband,

          18   did anyone else come to the area where the

          19   cars were after?

          20   A.     No, I don't pay attention to that.

          21   Q.     How many people were in the other car?

          22   A.     Two women.

          23   Q.     Did you speak to either of them?

          24   A.     Well, because I don't speak English, I

                                                           39



           1   couldn't communicate, didn't say anything

           2   with them, no.

           3   Q.     What were they doing after the

           4   accident took place?

           5   A.     Can you repeat that?  I felt that

           6   after the accident they were getting out of

           7   the car and cursing.

           8   Q.     My question is, what did you observe

           9   them doing?

          10   A.     I don't understand what they were

          11   saying, but I know they were angry.  They

          12   were cursing and yelling.  As soon as we got

          13   out of the car, they were cursing and got

          14   angry.

          15   Q.     How long did it take for the police to

          16   arrive?

          17   A.     Not long.  Maybe between five to ten

          18   minutes, not long.

          19   Q.     Did the police speak to you at all?

          20   A.     They did.  The cop did speak to me,

          21   but I didn't understand what they say.  So

          22   all I remember is they want my insurance

          23   information, my license and all that.

          24   Q.     At any point, did you say anything to

                                                           40



           1   the police officers about how the accident

           2   happened?

           3   A.     Because my language barrier, I'm not

           4   sure.  I give a description to the police

           5   officer.  I just did the best I can to give

           6   the depiction, but I don't think I say that

           7   much because my language barrier.  I provided

           8   the information that they asked for.

           9   Q.     The police officer wrote down in the

          10   police report, referring to your vehicle,

          11   unit 2, that you stated you were parked with

          12   your hazard lights on the in the right lane?

          13   A.     No, it's not true.  It's a reverse

          14   light.  It was a turning light.

          15   Q.     Just to be clear, you never told that

          16   to them?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Did tow trucks come to the scene?

          19   A.     Towed their vehicle, right?

          20   Q.     I don't know.  I'm asking you.

          21   A.     I didn't see any tow truck because I

          22   saw these two women.  They were outside, and

          23   the cop came and took the report.  I didn't

          24   think it was going to be that serious, so I

                                                           41



           1   didn't think too much about the other stuff.

           2   Q.     Did you take any pictures at the

           3   scene?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     I have some pictures I want to show

           6   you.  I'm going to show your attorney first.

           7   These will be D-1, D-2, D-3.

           8   A.     What do you want me to do with these?

           9   Q.     First, just take a look at each one,

          10   and then I'll ask you some questions.

          11   A.     Yes, that's the damage.  That's

          12   exactly what I told you earlier.  That is

          13   where my car got hit.  That's the damage for

          14   my vehicle in the rear.

          15               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Indicating D-3.

          16   BY MR. LEVY:

          17   Q.     Do all three of these pictures show

          18   the vehicle you were driving at the time of

          19   the accident?

          20   A.     I didn't take any pictures myself.

          21   Maybe my husband took them.

          22   Q.     These may have been taken by my

          23   client.

          24   A.     Okay.

                                                           42



           1   Q.     But I just want to confirm that that

           2   is the car that you were operating at the

           3   time of the accident?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     In all three of those pictures,

           6   correct?

           7   A.     Correct, yes.

           8   Q.     Do these accurately show your vehicle

           9   in the condition it was in right after the

          10   accident occurred?

          11               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  I'm going to

          12   object.

          13               Are you asking her whether the

          14   pictures depict the property damage sustained

          15   to the vehicle after the accident?

          16               MR. LEVY:  I'm just asking if

          17   these pictures show the vehicle right after

          18   the accident.

          19               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  He wants to

          20   know, in all three of these pictures, is this

          21   what your car looked like after the accident

          22   occurred?

          23               THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's where I

          24   tried to park, correct.

           1   BY MR. LEVY:

           2   Q.     Stick with D-1 for right now, this

           3   picture.

           4          Where your Audi is in that picture, is

           5   that where it was when you were hit?

           6   A.     I'm not sure.  I'm not sure whether --

           7   I don't remember whether this was exactly the

           8   position my car was at at the time of the

           9   accident.  I'm not sure if it was moved

          10   forward a little bit or backwards a little

          11   bit, but I was in the state of trying to

          12   park.  That's all I can tell you.

          13   Q.     After the impact occurred, did you

          14   ever move your vehicle?

          15   A.     I don't know.  I don't remember

          16   exactly because my foot was on the brake when

          17   it happened.  I'm not sure if my car was

          18   pushed forward or if I moved my car.  I don't

          19   remember now.

          20   Q.     Do you remember pulling it over before

          21   the police arrived?

          22   A.     I don't think I moved too far.  Maybe

          23   just a little bit.  Anyway, it was right

          24   within the area of where the accident

                                                           44



           1   actually happened.  I didn't think I moved

           2   too much.

           3   Q.     This picture is close to where the

           4   accident happened, correct?

           5               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  I'm going to

           6   object to that question.  My client testified

           7   she does not know who took this photograph or

           8   when it was taken.

           9               MR. LEVY:  Yeah, but she can see

          10   the photograph and compare.  She knows where

          11   the accident happened, and she can see in

          12   this picture where it is.

          13               I'm just asking her to compare

          14   those two.  I didn't ask where the actual

          15   person was when they took it.

          16               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Do you

          17   understand the question?

          18               THE WITNESS:  Yes, I understand

          19   the question.  I think he's trying to ask me

          20   whether my car moved.  Yes, because my foot

          21   was on the brake.

          22   BY MR. LEVY:

          23   Q.     Did you ever have to give a statement

          24   to your insurance company after the accident

                                                           45



           1   that they told you would be recorded?

           2   A.     No, I don't think it was a recorded

           3   statement.  They just asked me how it

           4   happened.  I give them the description.

           5   Q.     Did you have an interpreter for that?

           6   A.     Yes, they have interpreters.  Yes,

           7   that's what the interpreter told the

           8   insurance agent.

           9   Q.     Was your vehicle repaired after the

          10   accident?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Do you know how much that cost?

          13   A.     I don't know the cost because my

          14   husband took care of all that.

          15   Q.     Do you know if there was any damage to

          16   your vehicle that we can't see in these

          17   photographs?

          18   A.     I don't think so, no.  I don't know.

          19   I don't remember all that.

          20   Q.     Does your husband speak English?

          21   A.     No.

          22   Q.     Did any other family members of yours

          23   come out to the accident scene?

          24   A.     Just my husband and me.  That's all.

                                                           46



           1   Q.     Did he speak to either of the people

           2   in the other car?

           3   A.     No, he didn't talk to them.  He just

           4   give the police the identification documents

           5   to let the police handle everything.

           6               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Can we take a

           7   break for a second.

           8                       - - -

           9               (Whereupon, a break was taken at

          10    this time.)

          11                      - - -

          12               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Earlier,

          13   counsel asked you if any other family members

          14   came to the scene of the accident other than

          15   your husband.

          16               Did anyone else come to the

          17   scene?

          18               THE WITNESS:  Yes, I'm sorry, it

          19   was my husband.  He probably called my son to

          20   come to the scene.

          21   BY MR. LEVY:

          22   Q.     Does your son speak English?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     Did you see him speaking to anyone at

                                                           47



           1   the scene?

           2   A.     I don't know.  I wasn't paying too

           3   much attention.  I don't know.  I'm not so

           4   certain because I think my son just looked at

           5   the damage on my car.  Maybe he spoke to the

           6   cop briefly.  I'm not sure.

           7   Q.     Did he speak to the other driver?

           8   A.     I don't know, no.  I didn't pay

           9   attention to that.

          10   Q.     Did you see how the other driver left

          11   the scene of the accident?

          12   A.     Like I said, I didn't pay attention.

          13   I think maybe the cop took the report, and

          14   then they just left.

          15   Q.     Have you seen or spoken to them since

          16   the day of the accident?

          17   A.     No, I don't think so, no.  I don't

          18   remember that.  All I remember is they were

          19   very vicious, and they were cursing, yelling

          20   and very bad attitude.

          21   Q.     Do you remember anything specific they

          22   said?

          23   A.     Well, I didn't understand the words,

          24   but I can tell from expression, the way they

           1   were acting.

           2   Q.     Specifically, the driver of the

           3   vehicle, how was that person moving at the

           4   scene of the accident?

           5   A.     My impression was, even if I don't

           6   understand English, I can tell they got out

           7   of the car and were cursing, yelling.  They

           8   were just very, very bad.  The whole time

           9   nonstop cursing, and they were just standing

          10   there cursing and yelling.  I didn't see any

          11   visible injury.

          12   Q.     It was two people, you said?

          13   A.     Yes, two women.

          14   Q.     They were both behaving as you

          15   described?

          16   A.     Well, the impression I have was

          17   they're looking at me very mean and cursing

          18   and very not friendly at all.  I never seen

          19   any injuries visible that I can observe.

          20               MR. LEVY:  I don't have any

          21   further questions.

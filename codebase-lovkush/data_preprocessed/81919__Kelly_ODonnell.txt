           15    BY MR. WEINBERG:

           16          Q.       Good morning, ma'am.  My name is

           17    Marc Weinberg.  I'm an attorney that's been

           18    retained to represent Ms. Shchogol regarding an

           19    accident that happened back on October 31,

           20    2017.  I'm here to actually take your

           21    deposition with regard to the facts and

           22    circumstances surrounding that accident.  Do

           23    you understand that?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       All right.  To your left is a

                                                               6



            1    court reporter.  She will be taking down

            2    everything that is said here today.  All the

            3    information will be transcribed, placed into a

            4    booklet, and made available to myself and your

            5    counsel prior to the hearing.  Do you

            6    understand that?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       All of your responses have to be

            9    verbal.  Head nods, body movements, things of

           10    that nature cannot be taken down on the record.

           11    Do you understand that?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       If you don't understand a

           14    question, tell me you don't understand it.  I

           15    will be more than happy to rephrase the

           16    question.  Okay?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       Question that may come up that

           19    involve time, distance, things like that.  If I

           20    ask you those questions, I'm going to go and

           21    assume when you're answering those questions

           22    that you're estimating or approximating in

           23    certain response.  If you're going to do that,

           24    please tell me you're estimating or

           25    approximating in terms of time and distance and

                                                               7



            1    things like that.  Okay?

            2          A.       All right.

            3          Q.       Okay.  If at some point in time

            4    you hear your attorney use the term objection,

            5    do not respond to a question and he will tell

            6    you whether you can or cannot answer a

            7    question.  Do you understand that?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       All right.  Is there anything

           10    that would limit or inhibit your ability to

           11    testify here today?

           12          A.       No.

           13          Q.       All right.  Did you review any

           14    documents in anticipation of this deposition?

           15          A.       No.

           16          Q.       Have you seen a police report?

           17          A.       No.

           18          Q.       Have you seen any photos?

           19          A.       Can you clarify.

           20          Q.       Sure.  Photos of any vehicles?

           21          A.       I took photos the day of.

           22          Q.       Have you seen them today or the

           23    last couple weeks or so?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       When and where did you see the

                                                               8



            1    photos?

            2          A.       Today.

            3          Q.       Do you have a copy of those

            4    photos with you now?

            5          A.       Yes.  Well, on my e-mail.

            6          Q.       Can we have those photos pulled

            7    up, ma'am?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       While you're pulling those

           10    photos up, why did you take the photos?

           11          A.       To document what happened.

           12          Q.       Okay.

           13          A.       In case, you know, something

           14    like this were to happen.

           15          Q.       Okay.  Let me see if we can

           16    break that down.  You took photos at the scene

           17    of the accident?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       And you took the photos in case

           20    something like this happened.  Can you be more

           21    specific for me.

           22          A.       Just to have documentation of

           23    the accident period.

           24          Q.       Okay.  When you say if something

           25    like this happens, do you mean a lawsuit?

                                                               9



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       And what did you expect the

            3    photos to show?

            4          A.       Just what happened to the

            5    vehicles.

            6          Q.       Okay.  Why don't you actually

            7    pull them up and make sure you show everything

            8    to counsel first.  Okay?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10                   MR. WEINBERG:  Counsel, have the

           11          been turned over yet?

           12                   MR. SCHLAGNHAUFER:  They have.

           17    BY MR. WEINBERG:

           18          Q.       Ma'am, couple of questions.

           19    Your counsel was kind enough to let me have

           20    some access to his computer.  I'm looking at

           21    photographs of a Toyota Highlander XLE.  Was

           22    that my client's vehicle?

           23          A.       I don't know the make and model

           24    off the top of my head, but it was a Toyota

           25    van.

                                                               10



            1          Q.       And you were driving a Honda

            2    CRV?

            3          A.       HRV.

            4          Q.       Did your vehicle sustain damage

            5    in the accident?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       Was your vehicle repaired?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Where was it repaired?

           10          A.       Gustafson Auto Body in Willow

           11    Grove.

           12          Q.       How long did it actually take to

           13    go and repair the vehicle?

           14          A.       I don't remember.

           15          Q.       Do you know how long you were

           16    without a vehicle for?

           18          Q.       Do you remember what the

           19    approximate cost was of the repair of your

           20    vehicle?

           21          A.       This is an approximate, I

           22    believe it was around $800.

           23          Q.       Okay.

           24          A.       But that's an approximate.  I

           25    don't remember exactly.

            3    conversation?

            4          A.       I asked her if she was okay.

            5    She said yes.  That was really it.  We took

            6    each other's information.  I asked her if she

            7    was hurt.  She said no.

            8          Q.       You asked her first if she was

            9    okay?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       And she said yes?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       And then you asked her after

                                                               13

            2          Q.       Did you see any damage to my

            3    client's car?

            4          A.       I don't remember.

            5          Q.       You don't remember whether there

            6    was or there wasn't?

            7          A.       You mean before the accident

           12          Q.       Did you look at the back end of

           13    her car?

           14          A.       Yes.  When I took the pictures.

           15          Q.       Did you get on the ground and

           16    take pictures?  How did you take the pictures?

           17          A.       I just kneeled and took the

           18    pictures.

           19          Q.       Did you touch the back of the

           20    car at all, the back bumper at all?

           21          A.       No.

           22          Q.       Did you get underneath the

           24    the straight back end of the car?

           25          A.       I just went around it.  I didn't

                                                               14



            1    go underneath the car or anything like that.

            2          Q.       Gotcha.  Okay.  In your own

            3    words, how did the accident happen?

            4          A.       I was pulling off of Woodhaven

            5    Road on Byberry going straight.  I came to a

            6    complete stop at the intersection where her car

            7    was in front of me.  Then I dosed off and my

            8    foot came off the brake and slipped off.

            9          Q.       When you say you dosed off, what

           10    do you mean you dosed off?

           11          A.       I just got done working three 12

           12    hour night shifts.  My foot was on the brake.

           13    I was at a complete stop and my foot slip.

           14          Q.       Where are you a nurse?

           15          A.       CHOP.

           16          Q.       Okay.  And what unit are you in?

           17          A.       At the time it was in the ICU,

           18    but now I'm in outpatient neurology.

           19          Q.       Outpatient neurology?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       Okay.  Can you tell me, what

           22    time did the accident happen?

           23          A.       Approximately, I don't really

           24    remember, but approximately 8:30, maybe.

           25          Q.       Gotcha.  Was my client's vehicle

                                                               15



            1    moving or stopped when the impact occurred?

            2          A.       Stopped.

            3          Q.       How long was she stopped for?

            4          A.       I don't know.

            5          Q.       Okay.  Do you know how long my

            6    client's vehicle was directly in front of you

            7    for?

            8          A.       No.

            9          Q.       Can you tell me the maximum

           10    speed you achieved on Byberry Road before the

           11    accident?

           12          A.       Less than ten miles an hour.

           13          Q.       How would you describe the

           14    traffic, light, medium, or heavy?

           15          A.       Heavy.

           16          Q.       Okay.  When the accident took

           17    place, what caused your vehicle to eventually

           18    come to a stop?  Do you know what I mean by

           19    that question?

           20          A.       No.

           21          Q.       At some point in time your

           22    vehicle came to a stop after the accident; is

           23    that correct?  After the accident happened, you

           24    were eventually able to stop your vehicle,

           25    right?

                                                               16



            1          A.       Well, I was stopped before it

            2    and then during the accident I stopped because

            3    I hit her.

            4          Q.       Right.  That's what I'm saying.

            5    At the time of the accident, your vehicle was

            6    moving forward, fair?

            7          A.       Right.

            8          Q.       How fast were you going when the

            9    accident happened?

           10          A.       Less than five miles an hour.

           11          Q.       Okay.  Eventually after the

           12    accident, your vehicle stopped completely,

           13    right?

           14          A.       Right.

           15          Q.       Was that because you put your

           16    foot on the brake?

           17          A.       No.  My foot was on the brake

           18    and it slipped off.  When I stopped, I stopped

           19    because I hit her.  Is that answering your

           20    question?

           21          Q.       Okay.  So what you're saying --

           22    I think you did.  What you're telling us is, I

           23    want to be clear for the record, the reason

           24    your vehicle came to a stop was the impact with

           25    my client's vehicle stopped your car.  Is that

                                                               17



            1    fair to say?

            2          A.       Well, I stopped beforehand.  It

            3    depends how you're looking at it.  I stopped

            4    beforehand because my foot was on the brake and

            5    then it slipped off.  Then I stopped again when

            6    I hit her.

            7          Q.       Right.  Did you reapply your

            8    foot to the brake harder or was it the impact

            9    with the back end of my client's car that

           10    caused your vehicle to stop?

           11          A.       It was the impact.

           12          Q.       The impact.  Did you see what

           13    happened to my client inside the car?

           14          A.       No.  During it, you mean?

           15          Q.       Sure.

           16          A.       No.

           17          Q.       Do you remember seeing anything

           18    inside the car before the impact?

           19          A.       No.

           20          Q.       How about after the impact, was

           21    she seated in the driver's seat?

           22          A.       Well, when we pulled over she

           23    got out of the car.

           24          Q.       Gotcha.  Police did not arrive

           25    so there is no police report.

                                                               18

            2          Q.       Did you ever give any recorded

            3    statements to your insurance company?

            4          A.       No.

            5          Q.       Recorded statement

            6    over-the-phone or a written statement, anything

            7    like that?

            8          A.       I don't remember.

            9          Q.       Okay.

           10          A.       Sorry.

           11          Q.       Prior to the accident, did your

           12    vehicle have any mechanical problems of any

           23          Q.       How long did you dose off for?

           24          A.       Less than three seconds.

           25          Q.       And was that the first time on

                                                               19



            1    that trip that you had dosed off?

            3          Q.       Okay.  How many times along that

            7          Q.       Yes.

            8          A.       That was the first time.  I

            9    thought you meant...

           10          Q.       Have you done that before in the

           11    past?  Has it happened before because you're

           12    working 12 hour shifts?

           13          A.       Yeah.  It's happened in my

           14    lifetime.

           15          Q.       I got it.  Okay.  Did my client

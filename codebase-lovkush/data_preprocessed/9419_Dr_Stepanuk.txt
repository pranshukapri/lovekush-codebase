           14    BY MR. BAER:

           15          Q.       Good morning, Doctor.

           16          A.       Good morning.

           17          Q.       Could you please introduce

           18    yourself.

           19          A.       I'm Maxwell Stepanuk, Jr.

           20          Q.       And, sir, can you please tell us

           21    what type of medicine you practice.

           22          A.       I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

           23          Q.       What is the field of

           24    orthopedics?

           25          A.       It's the branch of medicine that

                                                               7



            1    deals with injuries and pathology of bones,

            2    joints, and muscles, every data structures such

            3    as nerves and tendons.

            4          Q.       How long, sir, have you been a

            5    surgeon?

            6          A.       Oh, it's about 43 years or so

            7    now.

            8          Q.       Can you please describe what you

            9    had to do to become a surgeon.

           10          A.       I graduated from Temple

           11    University and then did a year of graduate work

           12    at Villanova.  This was followed by four years

           13    of medical school at the Philadelphia College

           14    of Osteopathic Medicine.  I then went to the

           15    Detroit, Michigan area where I did an

           16    internship and a four year residency in

           17    orthopedic surgery at Oakland General Hospital.

           18          Q.       Doctor, through the course of

           19    your career, did you ever have any teaching

           20    appointments?

           21          A.       Yes.  I taught from basically

           22    day one.  I always taught interns and students.

           23    In fact, I was program director for the

           24    Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine

           25    for the Orthopedic Residency Program.  I was

                                                               8



            1    director for about 25 years in charge of the

            2    training of residents learning to become

            3    orthopedic surgeons.

            4          Q.       Doctor, are you currently

            5    board-certified?

            6          A.       I am.

            7          Q.       What does it mean to be

            8    board-certified?

            9          A.       I'm board-certificated in

           10    orthopedic surgery.  It means that you're a

           11    competent orthopedic surgeon.  In my case, I

           12    had to take a written exam followed by an oral

           13    exam.  And then after you're out in practice

           14    for a number of years and accumulate some major

           15    cases, they want to do a survey.  They look at

           16    your x-rays, review your charts, and if you

           17    pass, you're deemed a certified or a competent

           18    orthopedic surgeon.

           19          Q.       Sir, are all doctors or all

           20    physicians board-certified?

           21          A.       No, they aren't.

           22          Q.       Sir, how long have you been

           23    board-certified?

           24          A.       Since 1980.

           25          Q.       Are you licensed to practice

                                                               9



            1    medicine here in the Commonwealth of

            2    Pennsylvania?

            3          A.       Yes, I am.

            4          Q.       And have you ever been qualified

            5    to testify as an expert witness in the courts

            6    of Pennsylvania before?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       Doctor, could you please take a

            9    look at the exhibit that we have marked as

           10    Stepanuk-1.

           11          A.       That's any current and

           12    up-to-date CV or my resume.

           13          Q.       And does that have what your

           14    qualifications or the proofs, if you will,

           15    about what we just talked about?

           16          A.       Yes, it does.

           17          Q.       Feel free to refer to that

           18    document if needed for further questions as to

           19    your qualifications.  Doctor, can you please

           20    tell us what you do currently.  What do you do

           21    on a daily basis?

           22          A.       Well, initially, I did have an

           23    active surgical practice.  I did everything

           24    from carpel tunnel to shoulder surgery, totaled

           25    hips, totaled knees, up until the year 2000.

                                                               10



            1    At that time, I then limited my practice to

            2    office only orthopedics due to arthritis in my

            3    hands and hip.  Presently, I do have an active

            4    practice.  I see patients regularly, write

            5    reports, make recommendations, give injections,

            6    but I no longer do the surgery.

            7          Q.       Sir, do you treat people with

            8    back and neck and shoulder problems?

            9          A.       Yes, I do.

           10          Q.       And have you treated people who

           11    have been injured in motor vehicle crashes?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       Now, how many years have you

           14    been treating people for these types of

           15    problems?

           16          A.       Over 40 years.

           17          Q.       Doctor, as part of your

           18    practice, do you routinely review medical

           19    records, diagnostic studies, and images from

           20    other medical providers in part of providing

           21    medical services and treatment to your

           22    patients?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       Does that include MRI images?

           25          A.       Yes, it does.

                                                               11



            1          Q.       Sir, does your practice also

            2    make -- does your practice involve also making

            3    recommendations to patients based on your

            4    review of those types of materials?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       Does your practice include

            7    diagnosing the patients?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Does your practice include

           10    making prognoses?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       Please tell us, what is a

           13    prognosis?

           14          A.       It means what's going to happen

           15    in the future.

           16          Q.       Doctor, are you familiar with

           17    the usual and customary charges for medical

           18    services in this metropolitan area?

           19          A.       Yes, I am.

           20          Q.       What's your basis for your

           21    understanding and the knowledge of those usual

           22    and customary medical charges?

           23          A.       For being in practice over 40

           24    years.  Also from doing medical legal work.

           25    From looking at medical records, I frequently

                                                               12



            1    review hospital bills, hospital costs, doctors'

            2    costs, and therefore I'm familiar with costs.

            3          Q.       Doctor, are you familiar with

            4    medical procedures such as pain control

            5    injections, arthroscopic surgery, and cervical

            6    arthrodesis?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       And, Doctor, if you could, could

            9    you please tell us currently what percentage of

           10    your practice is dedicated to treating patients

           11    in a clinical setting versus the percentage of

           12    practice that you do in testifying, examining,

           13    this legal medical, medical legal work that

           14    you're doing currently.

           15          A.       Well, I testify about once a

           16    week, maybe 50 times a year.  Other than that,

           17    I'm seeing patients, 30 to 40 patients a week.

           18          Q.       Thank you, Doctor.

           19                   MR. BAER:  Counsel may have some

           20          questions about your qualifications at

           21          this time.

           22                   MR. SMITH:  Just go off for one

           23          second.

           24                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:00 a.m., we

           25          are off the record.

                                                               13



            1                   MR. SMITH:  As I explained to

            2          Mr. Baer prior to the deposition, we do

            3          have a pending motion to preclude the

            4          testimony of Dr. Stepanuk.  Obviously,

            5          we're participating in the deposition.

            6          We're not waiving any of those arguments.

            7          In fact, I believe we're scheduled to

            8          argue those with the court this

            9          afternoon.  Additionally, we have a

           10          motion limine pending to preclude the

           11          emergency room records from St. Luke's.

           12                   So with your consent, Mr. Baer,

           13          what I would suggest is that we just have

           14          a standing objection to those questions

           15          rather than interrupting if you get into

           16          that area since we have a pending motion

           17          on that.

           18                   MR. BAER:  Understood.

           19                   MR. SMITH:  All right.  Okay.

           20          We can go back on.

           21                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:01 a.m., we're

           22          back on record.

           23    BY MR. SMITH:

           24          Q.       Good morning, Dr. Stepanuk.

           25    Just a few questions.  When is the last time

                                                               14



            1    that you actually conducted any type of surgery

            2    at all?

            3          A.       I believe it was June of 2000.

            4          Q.       And are you currently on staff

            5    at any hospital?

            6          A.       I'm on staff at Elkins Park

            7    Hospital, on the courtesy staff.  I really

            8    don't need a hospital, but I'm on staff there.

            9          Q.       You mentioned the word courtesy

           10    and you note that on your CV.  Would courtesy

           11    staff be different than a physician who is on

           12    staff at the hospital?

           13          A.       As courtesy staff, I don't have

           14    to go to meetings.  So it's a good thing for

           15    me, and I don't need the hospital.  I don't

           16    admit people to the hospital.

           17          Q.       That was my next question.  If

           18    somebody needed to be admitted to the hospital,

           19    you couldn't do that, could you?

           20          A.       That's correct.  I would refer

           21    them to someone.

           22          Q.       And if somebody needed surgery,

           23    you wouldn't do that, correct?  You would refer

           24    them to somebody else?

           25          A.       That's correct.

                                                               15



            1          Q.       You referenced your curriculum

            2    vitae and you said it's up-to-date.  I'm at

            3    curriculum vitae.  You mentioned your

            4    publications that you would have had, say, over

            5    the past 40 years; is that correct?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       Would I be correct, Doctor, that

            8    the only -- you only list one publication where

            9    you reference any type of shoulder issues on

           10    your CV?

           11          A.       That's correct.

           12          Q.       You were asked a question

           13    earlier about your percentage of practice

           14    treating patients versus your medical legal

           15    work, and I believe what you testified to is

           16    that you testify at least 50 times a year?

           17          A.       I think the answer you want is

           18    about 70 percent of my practice involves

           19    patients in litigation.

           20          Q.       So would it be fair to say that

           21    70 percent of your practice involves medical

           22    legal work?

           23          A.       Medical legal work, yes.

           24          Q.       And so only about 30 percent of

           25    your practice involves actually treating

                                                               16



            1    patients, fair?

            2          A.       Yeah.  Actually treating regular

            3    patients that do not have legal issues.

            4          Q.       Would that be an accurate

            5    statement?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       And how many times have you

            8    actually physically examined the plaintiff in

            9    this case?

           10          A.       One time.

           11          Q.       And when was that?

           12          A.       On July 1, 2019.

           13          Q.       And as far as that examination,

           14    you wrote one report, correct?

           15          A.       That's correct.

           16          Q.       And it consists of three pages?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18                   MR. SMITH:  No other questions.

           19          Thank you, Doctor.

           20    BY MR. BAER:

           21          Q.       Doctor, with respect to shoulder

           22    surgery, is it possible for you to quantify the

           23    number of times you've performed an

           24    arthroscopic surgery on your patients' shoulder

           25    over the course of your career?

                                                               17



            1          A.       Not really.  Knee arthroscopies

            2    and shoulder arthroscopies are common

            3    procedures, probably the majority of the

            4    procedures that I perform, but I can't give you

            5    a number.

            6          Q.       Would it be more than 1,000?

            7                   MR. SMITH:  Objection.

            8                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:04 a.m., we're

            9          off the record.

           10                   MR. SMITH:  Objection that the

           11          doctor just testified that he cannot give

           12          you a number.  In the beginning he said

           13          he couldn't quantify it.  So it's an

           14          objection to the form of the question, is

           15          leading, and is also asked and answered.

           16                   MR. BAER:  It's not a leading

           17          question, but I can also do a follow-up

           18          question to the doctor and he can answer

           19          it accordingly.

           20                   MR. SMITH:  I'll just have a

           21          standing objection to that so I don't

           22          interrupt again.

            1    BY MR. BAER:

            2          Q.       Do you remember the question,

            3    Doctor?

            4          A.       Yes.  It would be approximately

            5    1,000 over the 25 years I did surgery, yes.

            6          Q.       Okay, Doctor.  All right,

            7    Doctor, we're going to point your attention to

            8    Maritza Rodriguez.  Sir, we're here on behalf

            9    of Maritza Rodriguez related to her treatment

           10    following an accident that occurred on January

           11    31, 2018; is that correct?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       During your testimony, I'm going

           14    to be asking you for some of your opinions.  I

           15    ask that you not give any of those opinions

           16    unless you can do so within a reasonable degree

           17    of medical certainty; is that okay?

           18          A.       Yes, it is.

           19          Q.       Now, you were not a treating

           20    physician for Ms. Rodriguez; is that correct?

           21          A.       That is correct.

           22          Q.       You saw her on one occasion at

           23    my request; is that accurate?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       And, Doctor, could you please

                                                               19



            1    take a look at the documents that we marked and

            2    take a look at Stepanuk-2.

            3          A.       That's the report that I

            4    generated after evaluating Ms. Rodriguez.

            5          Q.       Doctor, I'm going to ask that if

            6    you need to, refer to your report as needed

            7    during the course of your testimony here today;

            8    is that understood?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       Now, Doctor, in a moment I'm

           11    going to ask you to walk us through your

           12    evaluation of Ms. Rodriguez step-by-step.  But

           13    before I do that, I'd like to know the answer

           14    to one very important question.  That is, after

           15    examining Ms. Rodriguez, reviewing her records,

           16    studies that are referenced in your report, did

           17    you find anything wrong with her?

           18          A.       Yes, I did.

           19          Q.       Please tell us what it was.

           20          A.       I found that she had a cervical

           21    strain and sprain, a right upper extremity

           22    radiculopathy, right rotator cuff tear, and

           23    aggravation right AC joint arthritis.

           24          Q.       Can you please explain in

           25    greater detail what those injuries are.

                                                               20



            1          A.       Cervical strain and sprain is

            2    stretching of the ligaments and muscles in the

            3    neck.  It's like a sprained ankle in your neck.

            4    The right upper extremity radiculopathy is

            5    tingling, numbness that radiates down the right

            6    arm.  A rotator cuff tear -- we can go to a

            7    model.  This is the shoulder.  It happens to be

            8    a left shoulder.  This is the collarbone.  This

            9    is the humerus, the arm bone.  The rotator cuff

           10    is in here.  The green is a bursa.  When you

           11    have shoulder problems, you get bursitis.

           12    (Indicating).

           13                   The rotator cuff in this case

           14    was torn in this area, completely torn all the

           15    way through, but it didn't retract, meaning it

           16    didn't separate.  Talk about the AC joint, the

           17    acromion is this part.  The clavicular, the

           18    clavicle is this part (indicating).  So it's an

           19    acromion clavicular AC joint arthritis.  So

           20    there is arthritis in this joint pushing down

           21    where the rotator cuff tear adding the injury.

           22          Q.       Okay.  Doctor, please tell us

           23    what the other injuries are.

           24          A.       We did.

           25          Q.       Okay.  Doctor, would you please

                                                               21



            1    tell us what was the most serious of those

            2    injuries.

            3          A.       The right rotator cuff tear.

            4          Q.       Do you have an opinion within a

            5    reasonable degree of medical certainty as to

            6    the extent or the seriousness of those injuries

            7    which you described for us?

            8          A.       It's my opinion that the

            9    injuries were serious.  They were permanent

           10    injuries and her prognosis was poor.

           11          Q.       Are these conditions painful

           12    conditions, Doctor?

           13          A.       Yes, they are.

           14          Q.       Now, Doctor, did you review any

           15    tests or studies relative to Ms. Rodriguez for

           16    her treatment?

           17          A.       Yes, I did.

           18          Q.       What did you review?

           19          A.       I reviewed prior studies that

           20    showed that she had prior disc problems in her

           21    neck and back with prior radiculopathy in her

           22    right arm.  I also reviewed an MRI.  I tried to

           23    open the MRI itself, but could not.  So I

           24    reviewed the report of an MRI of the right

           25    shoulder dated 6/4/18.

                                                               22



            1          Q.       Now, Doctor, with respect to

            2    reviewing the MRI studies and the MRI reports,

            3    is that something you do in your customary

            4    practice?

            5                   MR. SMITH:  Objection.

            6                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:09 a.m., we

            7          are off the record.

            8                   MR. SMITH:  I believe based upon

            9          the doctor's report, he did not review

           10          the actual MRI studies, only the reports.

           11                   MR. BAER:  In deed.  In fact, he

           12          just said that he --

           13                   MR. SMITH:  But in your question

           14          you said in reviewing the MRI studies and

           15          the reports.  That's the basis of my

           16          objection.  He did not review the MRI --

           17                   MR. BAER:  I'll rephrase the

           18          question.

           19                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:09 a.m., we're

           20          back on the record.

           21    BY MR. BAER:

           22          Q.       Doctor, are the review of MRI

           23    studies and MRI reports something that you do

           24    in your normal practice?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               23



            1          Q.       Why do you do that, Doctor?

            2          A.       Because you do the MRI because a

            3    patient has a problem.  They complain of

            4    shoulder pain, pain doesn't get better, so you

            5    do an MRI to see what's going on.  And in this

            6    case, it showed pathology.

            7          Q.       Now, Doctor, you said you were

            8    unable to open up the disc that contained the

            9    MRI study, the actual MRI study; is that

           10    accurate?

           11          A.       That's correct.

           12          Q.       What did you have to review in

           13    its place?

           14          A.       The report dictated by a reading

           15    radiologist.

           16          Q.       And what were the findings from

           17    that reading radiologist?

           18          A.       That it was hypertrophy of the

           19    AC joint.  That's the joint we talked about

           20    where the arthritis was.  It was a full

           21    thickness cuff tear, full thickness rotator

           22    cuff tear without retraction.  So the cuff was

           23    torn, but it wasn't separated, wasn't

           24    retracted.

           25          Q.       Was there any other findings

                                                               24



            1    with respect to that shoulder?

            2          A.       Of note is that there was no

            3    muscle atrophy.  When a rotator cuff tear is

            4    old, it begins to atrophy.  It does separate.

            5    It does retract and the head of the humerus

            6    rides up.  None of that was present on this

            7    exam.

            8          Q.       Now, Doctor, what other

            9    documents did you have an opportunity to

           10    review?

           11          A.       I reviewed an MRI of the neck,

           12    MRI of the low back, and an EMG of both arms

           13    that were done prior to the motor vehicle

           14    accident.

           15          Q.       And what's the significance or

           16    what were the findings there, sir?

           17          A.       They showed disc pathology with

           18    radiculopathy.  That's my opinion.  These were

           19    aggravated by her 1/31/18 accident.

           20          Q.       And, Doctor, could you please

           21    tell us what other records you reviewed.

           22          A.       I reviewed records from a Dr.

           23    Garabo, Dr. Hassan, and Lehigh Valley Pain

           24    Center.

           25          Q.       And what was the significance in

                                                               25



            1    those records?

            2          A.       She saw Dr. Garabo and he also

            3    treated her for prior injuries.  He treated her

            4    for her present injuries including the shoulder

            5    injury.  She then saw a Dr. Hassan,

            6    H-A-S-S-A-N, on 7/24/18.  He saw her for right

            7    shoulder pain and he noted that there was no

            8    pain in the shoulder prior to the motor vehicle

            9    accident.

           10                   MR. SMITH:  Objection.

           11                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:12 a.m., we're

           12          off the record.

           13                   MR. SMITH:  The objection is to

           14          the doctor's testimony that the doctor

           15          noted that there was no prior shoulder

           16          pain.  I believe what he is referring to

           17          is a statement by the plaintiff.  Just

           18          object to the testimony as misleading and

           19          mischaracterizing the record.

           20                   MR. BAER:  I will just note that

           21          hearsay in the context of a medical

           22          record for the purposes of diagnosis is

           23          an exception to the hearsay objection.

           24                   MR. SMITH:  Sure.  No

           25          disagreement there.  It's just that it

                                                               26



            1          was her complaint, her indication, to the

            2          doctor that she had no prior shoulder

            3          problems, not the doctor's opinion that

            4          she had no prior shoulder problems is the

            5          basis for my objection.

            6                   MR. BAER:  Okay.

            7                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:13 a.m., we

            8          are back on the record.

            9                   THE WITNESS:  Dr. Hassan

           10          examined her and found a rotator cuff

           11          tear.  He said that she failed attempts

           12          in nonoperative treatment including

           13          therapy, injections, medications, and

           14          activity modifications, and therefore he

           15          recommended surgery.

           16    BY MR. BAER:

           17          Q.       Doctor, what was the date of

           18    that report again?

           19          A.       7/24/18.

           20          Q.       So that is 7 months --

           21    approximately seven months after the accident

           22    or six months after the accident of January 31,

           23    2018; is that accurate?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       Now, Doctor, you saw Ms.

                                                               27



            1    Rodriguez on July 1, 2019; is that correct?

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       And you performed a physical

            4    examination of her; is that accurate?

            5          A.       Yes, I did.

            6          Q.       And performing a physical

            7    examination, is that something that you would

            8    do with your clinical patients?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       What's the importance of doing a

           11    physical examination?

           12          A.       To see what is actually wrong

           13    with the patient upon examining, touching the

           14    patient, and evaluating the patient.

           15          Q.       Doctor, when you performed this

           16    examination of Ms. Rodriguez, did you take a

           17    history from her?

           18          A.       Yes, I did.

           19          Q.       And what did she tell you?

           20          A.       Well, she complained of neck

           21    pain, right shoulder pain with occasional

           22    numbness in the right arm, injured in a motor

           23    vehicle accident on 1/31/18.  She was a driver

           24    of a car.  She was injured when she was struck

           25    on the passenger's side by another car that

                                                               28



            1    went through a traffic light.  The impact

            2    caused her vehicle to spin.  She was wearing

            3    her seatbelt.  The airbags deployed.  She

            4    injured her right shoulder as she was swung

            5    about by the impact.  She went to St. Luke's

            6    Hospital in Allentown and was treated and

            7    released.

            8                   She complained to me of a

            9    stabbing, sharp pain in her right shoulder.

           10    She said her shoulder pain was severe.  She had

           11    pain with overhead use of her shoulder with

           12    occasional numbness down the right arm.  She

           13    had mildly, severe pain in her cervical spine.

           14          Q.       Now, Doctor, Ms. Rodriguez saw

           15    you one year and five months almost to the day

           16    from when this crash occurred; is that

           17    accurate?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       And when you saw her that 17

           20    months later, she was still complaining of pain

           21    in her neck?

           22          A.       Still had pain in the neck.

           23          Q.       And still had problems with the

           24    shoulder; is that accurate?

           25          A.       That is correct.

                                                               29



            1          Q.       All right.  Doctor, did you

            2    perform any tests on Ms. Rodriguez as part of

            3    your examination?

            4          A.       Yes.  I examined her neck and

            5    she had pain in the neck muscle upon palpating

            6    or pressing on the muscles.  She had a full

            7    neck range of motion.  The main problem was

            8    pain in the right shoulder.  She had pain about

            9    the entire right shoulder.  There was no

           10    instability.  There was no weakness.  She did

           11    have a significant decrease of motion to the

           12    right elbow.

           13                   She could only abduct and flex

           14    to 45 degrees.  Abduction means bringing it up

           15    from your side, and that was 45 degrees.

           16    Usually, it's up overhead 180 degrees.  Flexion

           17    is bringing the arm forward.  That was only 45

           18    degrees, normal is 180.  External rotation or

           19    bringing the arm rotated outwards was 80

           20    degrees.  That's pretty much normal.  Internal

           21    rotation is rotating the arm downward.  That

           22    was only 30 degrees, normal is about 70 to 80

           23    degrees.  She had positive impingement signs.

           24    These are signs that the rotator cuff is

           25    irritated when you put the arm through certain

                                                               30



            1    motions.  She had no crepitus.  The reflexes

            2    were equal.  She had a decrease in sensation to

            3    the right arm.

            4          Q.       Doctor, is this a normal exam?

            5          A.       No.

            6          Q.       What was abnormal about the

            7    exam?

            8          A.       Significant abnormality was the

            9    loss of shoulder motion with the impingement

           10    signs.

           11          Q.       Doctor, please tell us more.

           12    What else, if anything, did you do as part of

           13    this examination?

           14          A.       That was it as far as the

           15    physical exam.

           16          Q.       Now, Doctor, did she describe to

           17    you the pain that she was experiencing?

           18          A.       She did.

           19          Q.       And what did she say?

           20          A.       She told me stabbing, sharp pain

           21    in her right shoulder, pain is severe.

           22          Q.       Doctor, with respect to all of

           23    this, after you reviewed the record, after you

           24    took the history, and after you performed the

           25    examination, did you come to an opinion within

                                                               31



            1    a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to

            2    her medical conditions?

            3          A.       Yes, I did.

            4          Q.       Please tell us what those

            5    conditions were.

            6          A.       Conditions were cervical strain

            7    and sprain, right upper extremity

            8    radiculopathy, right rotator cuff tear,

            9    aggravation of right AC joint arthritis.

           10          Q.       Doctor, do you have an opinion

           11    as to a reasonable degree of medical certainty

           12    as to the cause of the injuries that we

           13    discussed throughout your testimony?

           14          A.       It's my opinion within a

           15    reasonable degree of medical certainty that she

           16    sustained an aggravation of her neck pain and

           17    an aggravation of her radicular symptoms on

           18    1/31/18.  Her right shoulder pain and right

           19    rotator cuff tear, aggravation of the right AC

           20    joint arthritis was a direct result of her

           21    1/31/18 accident.

           22          Q.       Doctor, with respect to this,

           23    did you also have a reasonable degree of

           24    medical certainty or an opinion within a

           25    reasonable degree of medical certainty as to

                                                               32



            1    the reasonableness and necessity of the

            2    treatment that she underwent following this car

            3    crash?

            4          A.       It's my opinion that the

            5    treatment that she received was reasonable and

            6    medically necessary and was the result of her

            7    car crash.

            8          Q.       Doctor, did you also give a

            9    prognosis to Ms. Rodriguez?

           10          A.       I did.  I said her prognosis is

           11    poor.  She'll continue to have neck pain with

           12    radicular pain and pain in the right shoulder.

           13          Q.       Did you give an opinion as to

           14    the necessity for future treatment?

           15          A.       I did.

           16          Q.       And what is your basis for

           17    giving the opinions for future treatment, sir?

           18          A.       Examining the patient, reviewing

           19    the medical records, particularly the MRI.

           20          Q.       And what future treatment does

           21    Ms. Rodriguez require?

           22          A.       I recommended arthroscopic

           23    surgery on her right shoulder, recommended an

           24    updated MRI of her neck and EMG of the upper

           25    extremity.  Also recommended pain control

                                                               33



            1    injections for her neck.  That's pretty much it

            2    except that if her cervical symptoms and disc

            3    pathology persists and becomes intolerable she

            4    will require surgery on her neck.

            5          Q.       And what type of surgery is

            6    that?

            7          A.       That would be a cervical

            8    arthrodesis or a fusion of her neck with taking

            9    the disc out.

           10          Q.       Doctor, with respect to the

           11    surgery to the shoulder, are you the only

           12    doctor that has recommended that surgery?

           13          A.       No, I'm not.  Dr. Hassan has

           14    also recommended the surgery.

           15          Q.       Now, Doctor, are you familiar

           16    with the costs related to the future treatment

           17    that you recommend?

           18          A.       Yes, I am.

           19          Q.       Could you please itemize for us

           20    what the costs are for the specific areas of

           21    treatment that you recommend for Ms. Rodriguez.

           22          A.       The cost for the arthroscopic

           23    surgery is $40,000 with associated costs of

           24    $7,000 for physical therapy, medication.  The

           25    MRI of the neck and EMG of the right arm is

                                                               34



            1    $4,000.  Pain control injections is $6,000 per

            2    series of injections, and I've recommended two

            3    series of injections costing $12,000.  The cost

            4    for the cervical arthrodesis is $125,000.  The

            5    cost for ongoing treatment for medication and

            6    occasional therapy is $5,000 a year for at

            7    least the next five years.

            8          Q.       Doctor, are all the opinions

            9    that you have just testified to, are they all

           10    made within a reasonable degree of medical

           11    certainty?

           12          A.       Yes, they are.

           13                   MR. BAER:  Thank you, Doctor.

           14          That's all the questions I have for you

           15          at this time.

           16                   MR. SMITH:  Off the record.

            1                    CROSS EXAMINATION

            2                         - - -

            3    BY MR. SMITH:

            4          Q.       Dr. Stepanuk, when we were off

            5    the record, you provided me a copy of what you

            6    indicated was your file that you reviewed in

            7    this case, correct?

            8          A.       Correct.

            9          Q.       Can you just hold that up to the

           10    jury and show them your file.

           11          A.       The file has been thin.  I've

           12    taken some of the therapy notes out.

           13          Q.       Okay.  Well, where are they,

           14    Doctor?

           15          A.       They are gone.  I can't keep a

           16    foot of records on every patient that I get.

           17          Q.       You had a foot of records in

           18    this case?

           19          A.       No.  No.  I'm just saying I

           20    can't keep all the records I get on every

           21    patient.

           22          Q.       What records did you get rid of?

           23          A.       I got rid of the therapy

           24    records, Lehigh Valley.

           25          Q.       How many pages were they?

                                                               36



            1          A.       I don't know.

            2          Q.       What were the dates of them?

            3          A.       I don't know.

            4          Q.       As far as what you kept, Doctor,

            5    is --

            6          A.       No.  I reviewed medical bills

            7    from Lehigh Valley Medical Center.

            8          Q.       I wanted to ask you about that.

            9    Where are they?

           10          A.       They are not there.

           11          Q.       What happened to them?

           12          A.       I don't know.

           13          Q.       As far as the file that you have

           14    left, I want you to just look through there and

           15    just count up the actual pages of medical

           16    records that you have in your file as we sit

           17    here for the deposition.

           18                   MR. BAER:  Off the record.

           19                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:25 a.m., we

           20          are off the record.

           21                   MR. BAER:  First thing, we're

           22          going off the record for the doctor to do

           23          the questions.

           24                   MR. SMITH:  Yup.

           25                   MR. BAER:  And then I'm going to

                                                               37



            1          make an objection, a relevance objection,

            2          as to counting the number of pages.

            3                   MR. SMITH:  Well, I'm going to

            4          ask him specifically what those records

            5          are and so the jury is aware of the

            6          records that he retained as part of his

            7          file.

            8                   MR. BAER:  Again, whether or not

            9          -- again, I'm going to make a relevance

           10          objection to the records that he's

           11          retained.  He testified that he reviewed

           12          more records than what he's kept and so

           13          we'll just leave it at that.

           14                   MR. SMITH:  Okay.  Did you get

           15          to pullout the medical records, Doctor?

           16                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           17                   MR. SMITH:  Okay.  We'll go back

           18          on.

           19                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:26 a.m., we're

           20          back on the record.

           21    BY MR. SMITH:

           22          Q.       All right.  Doctor, can you just

           23    tell us what are the actual medical records

           24    that are left in your file?

           25          A.       Records from Lehigh Valley Pain

                                                               38



            1    Center Chiropractic and Rehab.

            2          Q.       How many pages of those records

            3    do you have?

            4          A.       It looks like two pages.  Dr.

            5    Hassan is two pages, and the MRI is one page.

            6          Q.       So five pages of treatment

            7    records total are what you have left in your

            8    file as of today?

            9          A.       That's correct.

           10          Q.       Now, let's talk about the

           11    records that you indicated that you reviewed or

           12    didn't review in your report.  Can we agree

           13    that you did not review the police report?

           14          A.       Correct.

           15          Q.       Can we agree that you did not

           16    review plaintiff's Complaint?

           17          A.       Correct.

           18          Q.       Can we agree that you did not

           19    review the plaintiff's deposition testimony?

           20          A.       That's correct.

           21          Q.       You're familiar with what a

           22    deposition is, correct, Doctor?

           23          A.       Yes, I am.

           24          Q.       Probably reviewed many of them

            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       And as we're going through this

            3    for all of these questions as to what you

            4    reviewed or didn't review, can we agree that

            5    all of the records that you received to review

            6    in this case were provided by plaintiff's

            7    counsel?

            8          A.       That's correct.

            9          Q.       Did you request any additional

           10    records beyond what they provided to you?

           11          A.       No, I didn't.

           12          Q.       All right.  Now, getting back to

           13    what you reviewed or didn't review, can we

           14    agree that you did not review the plaintiff's

           15    deposition that she gave with respect to a

           16    prior car accident?

           17          A.       Correct.

           18          Q.       Can we agree that you did not

           19    review the records of Gene Levinstein, M.D.?

           20          A.       That's correct.

           21          Q.       Can we agree that you did not

           22    review the records of Samuel Grodofsky, M.D.?

           23          A.       No, I didn't.

           24          Q.       Can we agree that you did not

           25    review the records of Michelle Holding, M.D.?

                                                               40



            1          A.       No.

            2          Q.       So when you say no, Doctor, just

            3    so we're clear, you didn't review them?

            4          A.       No, I did not.

            5          Q.       Did you review the records from

            6    St. Luke's Hospital?

            7          A.       No, I didn't.

            8          Q.       Can we agree that you did not

            9    review the actual MRI films of the shoulder for

           10    the study that was completed after the

           11    accident?

           12          A.       That's correct.

           13          Q.       Can we agree that your report

           14    does not mention anything about a review of any

           15    MRI studies that the plaintiff may have had

           16    before our car accident?

           17          A.       It doesn't specifically state

           18    that.  It does state that she was treated by

           19    Dr. Garabo for the prior neck and back

           20    injuries.

           21          Q.       That was the chiropractor,

           22    correct?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       So there is nothing in your

           25    report talking about any MRIs that she had

                                                               41



            1    before the accident?

            2          A.       No.  But the MRIs were in his

            3    report.

            4          Q.       Did you review those MRI

            5    studies?

            6          A.       No, I did not.

            7          Q.       I do want to talk to you about

            8    one of the records that you do have in your

            9    file.  It's the MRI report after the accident.

           10    Can we see that, Doctor?

           11          A.       Okay.

           12          Q.       If I may, Doctor, if I could

           13    just have that for a second.

           14          A.       (Witness complies.)

           15          Q.       Now, earlier you told the jury

           16    that there was a full thickness tear of the

           17    rotator cuff.  That's what you testified to,

           18    correct?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       Isn't it true that what the

           21    findings of the radiologist that interpreted

           22    that report were actually a focal full

           23    thickness tear involves the distal

           24    supraspinatus muscle tendon approaching five

           25    millimeters, correct?

                                                               42



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       How big is five millimeters?

            3          A.       Half an inch.

            4          Q.       Okay.  Are you sure, Doctor,

            5    five millimeters is half an inch?

            6          A.       2.25 millimeters is an inch.

            7    Maybe less than half an inch.

            8          Q.       That's a small tear, isn't it,

            9    Doctor?

           10          A.       Small tear, yes.

           11          Q.       Would you say it's a tiny tear?

           12          A.       Small tear.

           13          Q.       Would you say it's a tiny tear?

           14                   MR. BAER:  Objection and off the

           15          record.

           16                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:30 a.m., we

           17          are off the record.

           18                   MR. BAER:  Argumentative.

           19                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:30 a.m., we're

           20          back on the record.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  Small tear.

           22    BY MR. SMITH:

           23          Q.       Okay.  Would you also call that

           24    a tiny tear?

           25          A.       Call it what you want, I guess.

                                                               43



            1                   MR. BAER:  We're going to go off

            2          the record again.

            3                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:30 a.m., we're

            4          off the record.

            5                   MR. BAER:  I'm going to object

            6          and move to strike, argumentative.  We

            7          can go back on.

            8                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:30 a.m., we're

            9          back on the record.

           10    BY MR. SMITH:

           11          Q.       Now, Doctor, when you say you

           12    can call it whatever you want.  You call it a

           13    small tear.  When you say you can call it

           14    whatever you want, that can include a tiny

           15    tear, correct?

           16          A.       It could if that's what you want

           17    to call it.

           18          Q.       All right.  Based upon the

           19    records which you reviewed, would it be fair to

           20    say that the last time Ms. Rodriguez received

           21    any medical treatment was over a year ago?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       You mentioned that you reviewed

           24    Dr. Hassan's report, correct?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               44



            1          Q.       Would it be fair to say that you

            2    don't know if Dr. Hassan had any of the prior

            3    medical records, do you?

            4          A.       I don't know what Dr. Hassan

            5    had.

            6          Q.       All right.  Did you ever talk to

            7    Dr. Hassan about his report?

            8          A.       No, I didn't.

            9          Q.       Did you ever try to talk to him?

           10          A.       No.

           11          Q.       Did you ever or were you ever

           12    provided with the report from our medical

           13    expert in this case, Dr. DiBenedetto?

           14          A.       No, I wasn't.

           15          Q.       Did you know we even had Ms.

           16    Rodriguez examined?

           17          A.       No, I don't.

           18          Q.       Let's talk about your actual

           19    report, which is dated July 1, 2019.  When did

           20    you prepare this report?

           21          A.       Right after I saw the patient or

           22    the next day.

           23          Q.       So her complaints in her

           24    examination would have been fresh in your mind

           25    when you prepared it?

                                                               45



            1          A.       That's correct.

            2          Q.       Now, you told us that her chief

            3    complaint was what, Doctor?

            4          A.       Cervical pain, neck pain, pain

            5    in the right shoulder with occasional numbness

            6    in the right arm.

            7          Q.       Now, with respect to the chief

            8    complaint, as you documented in her report,

            9    isn't it true that what you said was, quote,

           10    cervical pain with pain in the right shoulder

           11    with occasional numbness in the right upper

           12    extremity, correct, Doctor?

           13          A.       Correct.

           14          Q.       And when you say occasional

           15    numbness, how often is occasional?

           16          A.       I don't know what's occasional.

           17    Means occasional.  Sometimes it's there,

           18    sometimes it isn't.

           19          Q.       Now, in your report on page two,

           20    you talk about a review of systems.  Do you see

           21    that, Doctor?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       You said 14 systems were

           24    reviewed, correct?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               46



            1          Q.       And you said that she complains

            2    of headaches?

            3          A.       Correct.

            4          Q.       And you said the remaining

            5    review of systems is negative.

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       What were the 14 systems that

            8    you reviewed which were negative?

            9          A.       You want me to go through them

           10    all?

           11          Q.       Yes, please, Doctor.

           12          A.       Cardiovascular,

           13    gastrointestinal, neurologic, vascular, all the

           14    systems.  I don't have them listed by systems.

           15          Q.       Well, even if you don't have

           16    them listed you noted in your report that you

           17    reviewed 14 systems and that they were all

           18    negative.  So can you just tell us what all of

           19    those systems were that were negative.  And if

           20    you don't remember, Doctor, that's okay.  You

           21    can tell us that.

           22          A.       14 systems were reviewed,

           23    complained of headache.  She also complained of

           24    -- well, she complained of headache.  The

           25    negatives, you want me to go through all the

                                                               47



            1    negatives?

            2          Q.       Just to clarify, Doctor, again,

            3    you said 14 systems were reviewed.  She

            4    complained of headaches.  The remaining review

            5    of systems was negative.  I'm just trying to

            6    clarifying with you Doctor what those 14

            7    systems were that you reviewed.

            8          A.       As I said, neurologic system,

            9    cardiovascular, you know, all the systems.

           10          Q.       Beyond neurologic and

           11    cardiovascular, can you tell us the other 12

           12    systems that you reviewed?

           13          A.       No.  Not off the top of my head.

           14    GI, hematologic, I assume, renal system,

           15    endocrine system.  I mean, all the systems in

           16    the body.

           17          Q.       Okay.  Now, you said review of

           18    the neurologic system was negative.

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       What's the neurologic system?

           21          A.       Neurologic is the nerves.

           22          Q.       And you would have done this

           23    review yourself, correct?

           24          A.       No.  The patient checked this

           25    off.  And to cut to the chase, she just checked

                                                               48



            1    off headache.  She did not check off numbness

            2    and tingling.  She did not check off stiffness,

            3    joint pain, weakness.  She didn't check off any

            4    of the muscular or neurologic components that

            5    you would be interested in.  She just checked

            6    off headache.

            7          Q.       And what you are referring to is

            8    a document in your file that Ms. Rodriguez

            9    checked off when you examined her?

           10          A.       That's correct.  She checked it

           11    off.

           12          Q.       And the only item on that system

           13    that she indicated was a problem was headaches?

           14          A.       That's what she checked off.

           15          Q.       That's the whole body, right?

           16          A.       That's it.

           17          Q.       All right.  Let's talk about

           18    your physical exam.  You note that she had no

           19    atrophy of the right shoulder, correct?

           20          A.       Correct.

           21          Q.       Atrophy can occur when you use a

           22    muscle less, correct, Doctor?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       And when you examined her, it

           25    was about a year and a half after this car

                                                               49



            1    accident, right?

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       And as far as what you reported

            4    regarding her ability to move her shoulder, was

            5    that based upon what she told you?

            6          A.       Based upon the motion that I

            7    tried to place her shoulder through is

            8    basically what she told me.

            9          Q.       So if she told you stop, you

           10    stopped?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       Now, just with respect to your

           13    diagnosis, Doctor, the first one you mentioned

           14    was a cervical strain and sprain, correct?

           15          A.       Correct.

           16          Q.       And that's sometimes referred to

           17    as a soft tissue injury, correct?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       And those types of injuries

           20    normally resolve in a matter of weeks or

           21    months, correct?

           22          A.       They can resolve in weeks or

           23    months.  They can persist.

           24          Q.       The general pattern of recovery

           25    for a strain, sprain is usually weeks or

                                                               50



            1    months, correct, Doctor?

            2          A.       Usually weeks or months.

            3          Q.       And with respect to Ms.

            4    Rodriguez's neck, she's never been diagnosed

            5    with a disc herniation by you or anyone else as

            6    a result of this accident, correct?

            7          A.       I don't have it in my report.  I

            8    know from reviewing the medical records that

            9    she had prior disc problems.

           10          Q.       Now, you don't know of any

           11    problem at all with her lower back, correct?

           12          A.       Well, she had prior low back

           13    complaints.

           14          Q.       As far as the accident, you

           15    don't relate any problem with her low back to

           16    our car accident, do you, Doctor?

           17          A.       That is correct.  I do not.

           18          Q.       Your diagnosis also includes an

           19    aggravation of the right AC joint arthritis.

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       So we're clear, Doctor, it's

           22    your testimony that she had arthritis in her

           23    right shoulder before the car accident?

           24          A.       Yes, she did.

           25          Q.       Just a few moments ago you

                                                               51



            1    testified to your opinions regarding whether

            2    Ms. Rodriguez might need certain types of

            3    future medical care.  Do you recall that?

            4          A.       Yes, I do.

            5          Q.       And, again, you saw her -- now

            6    it's about over a year and a half since this

            7    accident, correct?

            8          A.       Correct.

            9          Q.       You note that she may need right

           10    shoulder surgery, correct?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       Has she had any shoulder surgery

           13    to date?

           14          A.       Not to my knowledge.

           15          Q.       You note that she may need

           16    physical therapy.  Has she ever had physical

           17    therapy since this car accident?

           18          A.       Not to my knowledge.

           19          Q.       You note that she may need a

           20    cervical MRI.  Would you tell the jury how many

           21    cervical MRIs the plaintiff has had since this

           22    car accident.

           23          A.       I don't believe she had a

           24    cervical MRI.

           25          Q.       And I believe earlier you talked

                                                               52



            1    about an MRI is a test that you order when

            2    symptoms persists and you want to find out

            3    what's going on.

            4          A.       That's correct.

            5          Q.       Isn't it correct, Doctor, that

            6    Ms. Rodriguez had a cervical MRI after her

            7    prior car accident and before our car accident?

            8          A.       Yes, she did.

            9          Q.       And she never had one after our

           10    accident?

           11          A.       That's correct.

           12          Q.       Now, you also note that Ms.

           13    Rodriguez may need an EMG of the right upper

           14    extremity because of our car accident, correct?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       Would you tell the jury how many

           17    EMGs of the right upper extremity Ms. Rodriguez

           18    has had since this car accident.

           19          A.       She's had none since the car

           20    accident.

           21          Q.       But she did have one after her

           22    last car accident; is that right?

           23          A.       That's correct.

           24          Q.       And you also testified that if

           25    there is ongoing problems, she might need a

                                                               53



            1    neck surgery, correct?

            2          A.       That is correct.

            3          Q.       You've testified that the

            4    treatment which Ms. Rodriguez has received from

            5    the time of the accident has been reasonable

            6    and necessary, right?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       What other doctor that has

            9    examined Ms. Rodriguez since this car accident

           10    has ever even talked about the possibility she

           11    might ever need any type of surgery on her

           12    neck?

           13          A.       No other doctor to my knowledge.

           14          Q.       Your diagnosis with respect to

           15    the neck is a sprain and strain, correct?

           16          A.       Sprain and strain with the

           17    preexisting disc herniations.

           18          Q.       Preexisting means they existed

           19    before the car accident, right?

           20          A.       The discs were there before,

           21    yes.

           22          Q.       In your report, you talk about

           23    that -- or you give the opinion that Ms.

           24    Rodriguez may need to use prescription pain

           25    medicine, right?

                                                               54



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       When is the last time she ever

            3    used prescription pain medication?

            4          A.       I don't know.

            5          Q.       Would it surprise you to find

            6    out that when Ms. Rodriguez gave a deposition

            7    in this case she testified that she currently

            8    was not taking any pain medications?

            9          A.       Wouldn't surprise me.

           10          Q.       And when you examined Ms.

           11    Rodriguez, was she even taking any

           12    over-the-counter pain medications?

           13          A.       No.

           14          Q.       And she had not treated for at

           15    least a year, correct?

           16          A.       That's correct.  Just one

           17    second.  I just checked the forms she filled

           18    out.  She said she was taking Motrin when I saw

           19    her.

           20          Q.       Did she say how often?

           21          A.       No.  She just said

           22    over-the-counter Motrin.

           23          Q.       But that would have been for

           24    headaches according to that document you're

           25    looking at, correct?

            3    BY MR. SMITH:

            4          Q.       What document are you looking

            5    at, Doctor?

            6          A.       I'm looking at the list of

            7    current medications that the patient filled

            8    out.

            9          Q.       Was that part of that review of

           10    systems form you were telling us about earlier?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       And on the review of systems,

           13    the only complaint she checked was headaches,

           14    right?

           15          A.       On the review of systems that's

           16    what she checked.

           17          Q.       All right.  Doctor, how much are

           18    you charging for the time which you've spent to

           19    give this deposition?

           20          A.       It's $2,500 for time taken out

           21    of my practice.

           22          Q.       And you also reviewed records.

           23          A.       Yes.  The charge for the records

           24    and the report was $500.

           25          Q.       So a total of $3,000?

            1          A.       That's correct.

            2                   MR. SMITH:  I have no other

            3          questions, Doctor.

            8          Q.       Doctor, with respect to treating

            9    your clinical patients, are you provided with

           10    deposition transcripts?

           11          A.       No, I'm not.

           12          Q.       How about police reports?

           13          A.       No.

           14          Q.       Do they have any relevance when

           15    you're examining someone for medical issues?

           16          A.       Not for medical issues.  They do

           17    for historical issues.

           18          Q.       Okay.  And, Doctor, just very

           19    quickly, with respect to the checking of the

           20    systems, that's a form that the patient fills

           21    out; is that correct?

           22          A.       That's correct.  I have no idea

           23    why she just checked headaches.  Patients do

           24    what they do.

           25          Q.       But you also took a history from

                                                               57



            1    her and that's when you actually spoke to her

            2    directly; is that correct?

            3          A.       Yes.  I said, what hurts?

            4          Q.       When you asked her what hurts,

            5    she said her neck, right?

            6          A.       Yes.

           20          the record.

           21                   MR. SMITH:  The question was

           22          please remind us so it's been asked and

           23          answered already.  That's the basis of my

           24          objection.

           25                   MR. BAER:  Well, it's in

                                                               58



            1          response to the cross-examination as to

            2          the systems and the argument.  It's well

            3          within the scope of cross.  So we'll just

            4          leave it at that.

            5                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:44 a.m., we're

            6          back on the record.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  Her complaints

            8          when I saw her was cervical pain, neck

            9          pain, pain in the right shoulder with

           10          occasional numbness in the right upper

           11          extremity.

           12    BY MR. BAER:

           13          Q.       Now, Doctor, Dr. Hassan

           14    recommended surgery, correct?

           15          A.       Correct.

           16          Q.       You recommend surgery, correct?

           17          A.       Correct.

           18          Q.       She hasn't gotten surgery,

           19    correct?

           20          A.       Correct.

           21          Q.       With respect to the

           22    recommendations to surgery from Dr. Hassan,

           23    would you agree that Dr. Hassan noted that the

           24    conservative methods were not working, correct?

           25          A.       That's correct.

                                                               59



            1          Q.       And the injections were not

            2    working, correct?

            3          A.       Correct.

            4          Q.       So when you're talking about

            5    having been treated, isn't it really that the

            6    only thing she can do right now is have the

            7    surgery that's been recommended?

            8                   MR. SMITH:  Objection.

            9                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:45 a.m., we're

           10          off the record.

           11                   MR. SMITH:  That is contrary to

           12          all of his treatment recommendations that

           13          he put in his report.  So I object to the

           14          form of the question.  He testified that

           15          she needs all of this treatment and she

           16          hasn't had it.  That was the point of

           17          cross.  So that's the basis of my

           18          objection to the form of your question.

           19                   MR. BAER:  Okay.  We'll suss it

           20          out.  You can answer the question.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  What was the

           22          question again?

           23                   MR. BAER:  To clean up this

           24          record I'm going to withdraw that

           25          question and I'll just ask another

                                                               60



            1          question.

            2                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:45 a.m., back

            3          on the record.

            4    BY MR. BAER:

            5          Q.       Doctor, in the absence of

            6    improvement with the more conservative

            7    treatments that Ms. Rodriguez has undergone so

            8    far, what is the option that is best for her

            9    right now?

           10          A.       She's done pretty much

           11    everything you can do for the shoulder outside

           12    of surgery.  Her next option is surgery with a

           13    cuff repair and a debridement of the rotator

           14    cuff.

           15          Q.       After that procedure has taken

           16    place, after that surgery, would physical

           17    therapy be appropriate?

           18          A.       Yes, it would.

           19          Q.       Would it be required?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       All right, Doctor.  With respect

           22    to all of the other future treatment that you

           23    spoke of, is it not true that you said that if

           24    her symptoms continue that that would be

           25    appropriate?

                                                               61



            1          A.       If they continue --

            2                   MR. SMITH:  Objection.

            3                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:46 a.m., off

            4          the record.

            5                   MR. SMITH:  Again, the objection

            6          is based upon asked and answered, which

            7          is apparent from the form of the

            8          question.  You're asking that isn't it

            9          true that that's what you just testified

           10          to on your direct.

           11                   MR. BAER:  Again, this is -- I

           12          testify as to direct.  You gave

           13          cross-examination and you made certain

           14          points on cross-examination.  I am doing

           15          my level best to address those questions

           16          and staying within the scope of that and

           17          that's something that I'm doing.

           18                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  11:47 a.m., back

           19          on the record.

           20                   THE WITNESS:  In fact, I stated

           21          if her systems become intolerable she'll

           22          require the cervical spine surgery.

           23    BY MR. BAER:

           24          Q.       All right, Doctor.  Again, were

           25    all of the opinions that you've given here

                                                               62



            1    today done so within a reasonable degree of

            2    medical certainty?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4                   MR. BAER:  Thank you, Doctor.

            5          That's all the questions I have.

           10          Q.       Doctor, what has Ms. Rodriguez

           11    been doing for the last year?

           12          A.       I don't know.

           13                   MR. SMITH:  No other questions.

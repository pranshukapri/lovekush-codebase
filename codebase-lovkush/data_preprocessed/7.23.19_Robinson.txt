          18          Q.    Mr. Robinson, good morning.

          19   My name is Rich Scholer, I'm an attorney

          20   with Farmers and I represent

          21   Mr. Edward Holt in a lawsuit that you

          22   filed in reference to a motor vehicle

          23   accident that I have occurred on August

          24   27th, 2017, and we're here for your

           1   deposition today.  Have you ever had your

           2   deposition taken before for any reason?

           3          A.    No.

           4          Q.    Okay.  Then I'm going to go

           5   over some guidelines to make it go as

           6   smoothly as possible.  I'm going to ask

           7   you some questions, you're hopefully

           8   going to provide some answers, at the end

           9   your Counsel may have questions for you.

          10                Seated to my left and your

          11   right is the court reporter.  Her job is

          12   to take everything that's said down

          13   accurately, so we want to try and make

          14   her job as easy as possible.  Because at

          15   the end, she's going to make a little

          16   booklet that will contain all of the

          17   questions and all of the answers, and we

          18   want that booklet to be as accurate as

          19   possible.

          20                So certain guidelines we

          21   like to follow.  I'm going to ask you a

          22   question, you may know exactly what I'm

          23   going to ask, but I'm going to ask you if

          24   you could let me finish the whole

           1   question before you start your answer.

           2   I'll give you the same courtesy, let you

           3   finish an entire answer before I start

           4   another question.  So she can look at me,

           5   take the question, look at you, take your

           6   answer.

           7                It's hard in our normal,

           8   everyday conversation.  We typically

           9   speak over each other.  If it happens,

          10   she will stop us and say, "I can only

          11   take one person at a time."  Not trying

          12   to be mean or nasty, just trying to get

          13   an accurate transcription.

          14                If I ask a question and you

          15   don't hear it, please say so, and I'll

          16   repeat it.  If I ask you a question and

          17   you don't understands it, please say so

          18   and I'll rephrase it.  Otherwise, if you

          19   answer it, I'll assume you heard it, you

          20   understood it, and you're giving me a

          21   truthful answer.  Because the first thing

          22   the court reporter did is give you an

          23   oath to be truthful.  Even though we're

          24   not in a courtroom setting, you still

           1   have that legal obligation to give

           2   truthful answers.

           3                If I ask a question and you

           4   have absolutely no idea, I don't want you

           5   to guess.  Although, if you can give an

           6   estimate or approximation; time,

           7   distance, anything like that, that's

           8   perfectly fine.  But if you are going to

           9   answer my question with, "I have

          10   absolutely no idea, it's going to be a

          11   total guess," I'd rather you say, "I

          12   don't know," or "I don't recall," that's

          13   perfectly fine.  I'm only interested in

          14   finding out what you recall about the

          15   facts.

          16                All the answers have to be

          17   verbal.  If you respond with an uh-uh,

          18   uh-huh, shrug your shoulders, nod your

          19   head, everyone in the room is probably

          20   going to know what you mean, but for the

          21   purposes of the record, those things

          22   don't transcribe, they look the same.  So

          23   if you get prompted to say, "Is that a

          24   yes," or "Is that a no," that's for the

           1   benefit of the transcript.

           2                Hopefully we won't be here

           3   that long, but if you need a break for

           4   any reason, just let us know.  We can

           5   take a break, talk to Counsel, go to the

           6   restroom, get a drink, whatever you want.

           7   But I would ask if you could finish

           8   answering whatever question has been

           9   already been asked so the court reporter

          10   doesn't have to read it back when we come

          11   back from that break.  But otherwise, if

          12   you need a break just let us know.

          13                If you recall an answer to a

          14   question a couple questions down the way

          15   and you want to go back and say, "Hey, I

          16   want to supplement that answer," no

          17   problem, just let us know.  "Remember

          18   when you asked me that question back

          19   then?  I remembered something else."

          20   That's perfectly fine.  Whatever you

          21   remember, whenever you remember, we can

          22   go back and supplement any answers that

          23   you have.

          24                Do you understand all of the

          10          A.    I had to pay for my own

           1          A.    Right.  And you got to get

           2   the cab back or you got to pay for it

           3   anyway.

           4          Q.    So as long as you have the

           5   cab in your possession, you were

           8          Q.    So when you were working

           1   they are.

           2          Q.    Do you know who you would

           3   report to to get jobs or turn the cab in,

           4   or was there someone there that you would

           5   talk to?

           6          A.    I don't know who it is,

           7   whoever is at that window at the front

           8   desk, pass out keys and take the keys and

           9   the money.

          10          Q.    If you had to call out sick

          11   or call out for a day, would you call the

          12   front desk and that person you would

          13   speak with?

          14          A.    Yes.

          15          Q.    Assume majority of the job

          16   when you were driving the cab was

          17   sitting, correct?

          18          A.    Yes.

          19          Q.    Did you have to remove

          20   luggage from the vehicle on occasion when

          21   someone brought luggage into the cab?

          22          A.    Yes.

          23          Q.    After the accident, how were

          24   you informed -- you said the number of

           1   days that you worked went down.  Did they

           2   tell you that, or did you -- because you

           3   had possession of the vehicles.  Did they

           4   tell you to turn in the car for certain

           5   days?  How come you didn't work so much?

           6          A.    Because I had to go to

           7   therapy, and usually when I got to go to

           8   therapy, I just turn the cab back in and

           9   just take off that day.

          10          Q.    And then the next day if you

          11   went to go back, was there a time when

          12   they said they didn't have a cab

          13   available for you so you couldn't work?

          14          A.    No.

          15          Q.    So when you missed time, it

          16   was just to go to the physical therapy,

          17   you'd take off the whole day?

          18          A.    Yes.

          19          Q.    So in that month after the

          20   accident, the time you missed was as a

          21   result of physical therapy from your

          22   injuries from the accident; is that fair

          23   to say?

          24          A.    Yes.

           1          Q.    Okay.  So if you wanted to

           2   work the seven days a week continually,

           3   would you have had access to the car in

           5   they let you go?

           6          A.    Yes.

           7          Q.    What were your typical hours

           8   when you drove the cab?

           9          A.    12:00 to 12:00.

          10          Q.    Is that p.m. to a.m.?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    Did you have a zone or an

          13   area which you stayed in or was it city

          14   wide or state wide; what was your range?

          15          A.    I stayed like in the

          16   northeast.  I could have went anywhere,

          17   but I stayed more in the northeast area.

          18          Q.    Was there radio contact with

          19   base?

          20          A.    Yes.

          21          Q.    And would they communicate

          22   with you over the radio to direct you to

          23   where there was a fare?

          24          A.    Yes.

           1          Q.    Did you ever have to use

           2   your cellphone for that?

           3          A.    Yes.

           4          Q.    What was the difference as

           5   far as when they would contact you via

           6   radio and when they would call you for a

           7   fare, if there was any?

           8          A.    Can you repeat that?

           9          Q.    Sure.  Sometimes they

          10   contact you by radio, and that would be a

          11   handheld mic in the vehicle; is that

          12   correct?

          13          A.    Mhmm.

          14          Q.    Antennae on the back?

          15          A.    Yes.

          16          Q.    And sometimes you said via

          17   cellphone.  If you had your cellphone,

          18   they'd call you on the cell to direct you

          19   to where to go?

          20          A.    Only time that happened was

          21   when the radios was down, they were

          22   switching to a new system or whatever and

          23   we had to use our phones to call and get

          24   the jobs.

           1          Q.    Okay.  So most of the time

           2   if everything was working properly, is it

           3   fair to say that the radio was the main

           4   source of communication?

           5          A.    Yes.

           6          Q.    Did they have any unions

           7   there by any chance in the cab company?

           8          A.    Union, no.

           9          Q.    In the month after the

          10   accident, can you estimate how many days

          11   you did not work because of physical

          12   therapy?

          13          A.    12.

          14          Q.    So based upon your previous

          15   testimony about $100 a day, and you

          16   missed 12 days of work because of

          17   physical therapy, that's about $1,200

          18   would you estimate out of pocket?

          19          A.    Yeah, I would estimate.

          20          Q.    How did they pay you, was it

          21   by check, was it by cash?

          22          A.    How did who pay me?

          23          Q.    The cab company, sorry.

          24          A.    I said I make my own money.

           1   I keep everything after the $150 I get

           2   them, so they never paid me.

           3          Q.    Was it always cash from the

           4   customers?

           5          A.    No.

           6          Q.    Did the cab have the ability

           7   to use credit cards?

           8          A.    Yes.  That's the only way

           9   they would pay me if I take the receipts

          10   in there and get the cash back, or if I

          11   just use it to pay for the cab.

          12          Q.    Okay.  So I'm clear, if you

          13   piked up a fare while you're working for

          14   the cab company and they paid by credit

          15   card and used the machine in the vehicle,

          16   you would take a copy of the receipt and

          17   get reimbursed by the cab company?

          18          A.    Yes.

          19          Q.    But if they paid you in

          20   cash, you kept the cash on your person,

          21   you didn't have to turn that in other

          22   than paying the $150 fee for the car?

          23          A.    Right.

          24          Q.    Did any doctors that you

           1   were seeing after the accident tell you

           2   that you should not drive the cab?

           3          A.    No.

           4          Q.    Did you have to make any

           5   modifications to the cab that you were

           6   driving after the accident, change the

           7   seat position?

           8          A.    Well, I used a small pillow

           9   off the couch when I was driving for that

          10   month after.

          11          Q.    Would you sit on the pillow,

          12   would you put it behind your back,

          13   shoulders?

          14          A.    I put it on my back on the

          15   back of the seat.

          16          Q.    Okay.  Would that then kind

          17   of push your back forward in the seat,

          18   giving that pillow between the back of

          19   the seat and your actual physical back?

          20          A.    No.  Because I had my seat

          21   back, so it just let pressure off the

          22   bottom of my back.

          23          Q.    Did you receive any

          24   unemployment compensation from the cab

           5          A.    No.

           6          Q.    Had you filed tax returns

           7   for the last five years before the motor

           8   vehicle accident?

           9          A.    For what, for the cab

          10   company?

          12          A.    No.

          13          Q.    Did you include the income

          14   that you received from the cab company on

          16          A.    No.

          17          Q.    At the same time you were

          18   operating the cab, you were also working

          19   at Double R Painting?

          22          request a copy.

          23                MR. DOBSON:  Really?  Of

           7   some type of system in the car?

           8          A.    I didn't have to save

           9   anything, it's inside the car.  I never

          10   even seen it until today.

          11          Q.    Okay.

          12          A.    I think they got an SD chip

          13   in them or something.  I never even

          14   bothered with them.

          15          Q.    Prior to the time of the

          16   accident, within six hours before, had

          17   you consumed any alcohol or drugs, legal,

          18   illegal, anything?

          20          Q.    Where were you coming from

          21   when accident happened?

          22          A.    I don't even know.

          23          Q.    Did you have any passengers

          24   with you at the time of the accident?

           7   you cash out?

           8          A.    Pay for the cab and get any

           9   cash I can get.

          10          Q.    Okay.  Did you have to go to

          11   the cab company on a daily basis to give

          12   your $150 fee, or could you do it once a

          13   week or once a month, how did that work?

          14          A.    They wanted you to come in

          15   every 24 hours.  If you stretched it the

          16   48, they wouldn't mind.

          17          Q.    Okay.  Was the business --

          18   someone there always 24 hours a day,

          19   seven days a week?

          13   different.  You know, I could just go in

          14   the house and sleep for a couple hours in

          18          Q.    Can you describe the road

          19   for me, how many lanes of travel in each

          20   direction?

          21          A.    One in each direction.

           1   my client was driving?

           2          A.    A Jeep.

           3          Q.    When is the first time you

           4   recall seeing the Jeep before the

           6          A.    30 seconds before, behind

           7   me.

           8          Q.    Did anything bring that to

           9   your attention, or was it just normal

          10   checking your mirrors?

          11          A.    He brought it to my

          12   attention.

          13          Q.    How did that happen?

          14          A.    He was trying to force me to

          15   go faster.

          16          Q.    How do you believe Mr. Holt

          17   was trying to force you to go faster?

          18          A.    Because he was tailgating.

          19   I assumed he was late for work or

          20   something.  I seen a uniform shirt and he

          21   was trying to speed up, and then he tried

          22   to go around me and that's when he hit

          23   me.

          24          Q.    Can you estimate or do you

           1   know how close was he at any given point

           2   from the 30 seconds you saw him before

           3   the impact occurred?

           5          Q.    Yeah, when you were driving

           7          A.    I could see his eyes, he was

           8   that close.  He was right behind me.

           9          Q.    Do you know what the speed

          10   limit is on Tyson at that area?

          11          A.    I believe 25, it's a regular

          12   street.

          13          Q.    Do you recall how fast you

          14   were going prior to impact?

          15          A.    No, I don't.  I wasn't going

          16   fast enough for him.

          17          Q.    Okay.  When you saw him that

          18   close in your rearview mirror that you

          19   said you could see his eyes, did you get

          20   upset?

          21          A.    No.

          22          Q.    Did you honk your horn or

          23   hit your brakes?

          24          A.    No.  I was used to it when I

           1   was driving the cab.

           2          Q.    So in other words, somebody

           3   driving their vehicle in close proximity

           4   to your bumper happened to you on a

           5   routine basis being a cabdriver?

           6          A.    Yes.

           7          Q.    At the point where Mr. Holt

           8   struck the back of your vehicle, can you

           9   estimate at that time how fast you were

          10   going?

          11          A.    Speed limit.

          12          Q.    Does the cab also in

          13   addition to recording video, did it have

          14   a let's say a black box or something that

          15   recorded data, vehicle speed and

          16   functions of the vehicle?

          17          A.    I'm not sure.

          18          Q.    Were you able to hit your

          19   brakes before impact?

          20          A.    No.  We was just traveling

          21   down the road driving, no reason to hit

          22   the brake because the stop sign is 200

          23   feet away.

          24          Q.    Okay.  Can you describe

           1   traffic at that hour when you were

           2   driving; heavy, medium, light?

           3          A.    None.

           4          Q.    In your own words, tell us

           5   what happened right before the accident,

           6   take us through the accident.

           7          A.    Like I said, I was driving

           8   too slow for him and he was trying to get

           9   me to go faster by getting close to me

          10   thinking I was going to move a little

          11   faster, and that didn't work.  So he

          12   tried to pull out and get around me, you

          13   know, go into oncoming traffic and get

          14   around me, and he didn't do it quick

          15   enough and he hit me.

          16          Q.    Okay.  Did he use his horn

           5   of what I have, that's the ER record that

           6   I have.  And I was looking at the top,

           7   the date, which says 17:02, which I

           8   relate to be about 5:02 p.m.

           9          A.    What you asking?

          10          Q.    You said you went to the

          11   hospital the next day.  Is it possible

          12   you went the same day?

          13          A.    Possible.

          14          Q.    Okay.  When the text that

          15   they wrote said that you had indicated,

          16   it says, "39-year-old patient comes to

          17   the emergency department after being

          18   involved in a motor vehicle accident at

          19   111:00 a.m. today."  Do you remember if

          20   you told them that, or is that something

          21   they wrote down?

          22          A.    That's what I told them, I

          23   was in an auto accident.

          24          Q.    But the 11:00, the accident

           1   happened a little earlier in the morning,

           2   correct, not 11:00?

           3          A.    Right.

           4          Q.    So what I'm saying is do you

           5   remember telling them it was 11:00, or is

           6   that something they wrote down and it's

           7   not accurate to what you told them?

           8          A.    Well, is that the time that

           9   I got there, is that the time that I was

          10   there?

          11          Q.    This is what they wrote, I'm

          12   going by them.  And it indicates that you

          13   told them you were in an accident at

          14   11:00 a.m. today.

          15          A.    Oh, I don't know, maybe

          16   that's wrong.  Because I wasn't in an

          17   accident at 11:00.

          18          Q.    Okay.  Do you remember how

          19   long you were at the hospital on this

          20   day?

          21          A.    A couple hours.

          22          Q.    And then did you seek any

          23   further medical treatment after the

          24   accident?

           1          A.    Yes.

           2          Q.    The Tylenol that they gave

           3   you, did they provide you with it?

           4          A.    I don't know if they gave me

           5   Tylenol, I don't remember.  I'm just

           6   saying that because my back was hurting.

           7   Usually they just give you Tylenol and

           8   kick you out, so that's why I'm saying

           9   that.

          10          Q.    What did you do for the rest

          11   of the day?

          12          A.    I don't know.

          13          Q.    And you said you did get

          14   other treatment.  Where did you go next

          15   for medical treatment as a result of the

          16   accident?

          17          A.    Physical therapy.

          18          Q.    Who was the doctor?

          20          Q.    Do you remember when you

          21   went to Dr. Boden for the first time

           1   Dr. Boden's office was about July 3rd, so

           2   somewhere around six days later.  Does

           3   that sound about right?

           4          A.    Mhmm.

           8   go to see Dr. Boden after the accident?

           9          A.    In the beginning, it was

          10   three, then down to two at some point.

          11          Q.    What did they do for you at

          12   the office for physical therapy, what

          13   actually did they make you do, if

           1   machine, I don't know the name of it.

           2          Q.    Okay.  When you went on any

           3   given day, how long would you be at

           8   times in August, and then there's a gap,

           9   I have no visits for September.  Was

          10   there a period of time in September that

          11   you didn't go?

          12          A.    I don't know.  If that's

          16   times, according to the records, nine

          20          Q.    And I have a total of about

          13   BY MR. SCHOLER:

          14          Q.    I'm going to ask you if you

          15   recognize what's been marked as Robinson

          16   1.  Do you recognize what's depicted in

          17   that picture?

          18          A.    Well, what's that mean?

          19          Q.    What's the picture show; do

          20   you know?

          21          A.    Yeah.  It shows the Jeep.

          22          Q.    Is that my client's car?

          23          A.    Mhmm.

          24          Q.    Do you know if that picture

           1   was taken on the date of the accident?

           2          A.    I assume so.

           3          Q.    Was that a picture that you

           4   took?

           5          A.    I don't know.

           6          Q.    Okay.  Now, do you know

           7   where just from looking at the picture

           8   where the vehicle was in the roadway?

           9          A.    Yeah.

          10          Q.    Okay.  Because I'll submit

          11   that it looks like the right front, which

          12   would be the passenger side tire, is on a

          13   double yellow line.  Is that accurate?

          14          A.    Yup.

          15          Q.    Do you know if that's Tyson

          16   at the point where the accident happened?

          17          A.    It should be.

          18          Q.    And there's a double yellow

          19   line to the driver side, as well.  Where

          20   this car is, is this in the middle

          21   between the two travel lanes?  In other

          22   words, if you know, is there a travel

          23   lane to the passenger side on the roadway

          24   and opposite traffic would be on the

           1   driver side?

           2          A.    Mhmm.

           3          Q.    Is that a yes?

           4          A.    Yes.

           5          Q.    Do you know if this was the

           6   point of impact where my client's car was

           7   when this picture was taken, is that

           8   where he had hit your car?

           9          A.    It looks like it.

          10          Q.    And I'll ask you to take a

          11   look at what's been marked for

          12   identification as Robinson 2.  Can you

          13   tell us what's shown in that picture?

          14          A.    The cab.

          15          Q.    The cab you were driving?

          16          A.    Yeah.

          17          Q.    And do you know if you took

          18   this picture?

          19          A.    I don't know.

          20          Q.    And it appears as if the

          21   license plate, would you agree it looks

          22   like a Pennsylvania license plate?

          23          A.    Yeah.

          24          Q.    Does the damage that's

           1   reflected here on the driver side left

           2   rear and the bumper, does that accurately

           3   reflect the damage that you recall

           4   occurring as a result of this accident?

           5          A.    Yes.

           6          Q.    And it looks like your

           7   vehicle is pulled to the side of the

           8   road; is that accurate?

           9          A.    Yes.

          10          Q.    Is that still in the lane of

          11   travel though, did cars have to kind of

          12   go around you when your car was stopped

          13   here?

          14          A.    No.  They didn't have to go

          15   around me because I'm like almost on the

          16   sidewalk.

          17          Q.    Is that a parking area where

          18   cars could park at?

          19          A.    Yes.

          20          Q.    And just I guess another

          21   picture which was marked as Robinson 3

          22   for identification purposes.  Is that

          23   just another picture of the rear side of

          24   the vehicle you were driving?

           1          A.    Yes.

           2          Q.    Okay.  And when you pulled

           3   the car there, is it fair to say you got

           4   hit and then you were able to drive your

           5   car, steer it over to the side of the

           6   road?

           7          A.    Yes.

           8          Q.    So what's reflected in

           9   Robinson 2 and 3 is not the actual place

          10   where the impact occurred, it occurred

          11   behind the vehicle at some point,

          12   correct?

          13          A.    Yes.

          14          Q.    The pictures don't reflect

          15   it to me, but do you know how far your

          16   car, the back of your car was in Robinson

          17   3 and where my client's Jeep in Robinson

          18   1, the distance between them when these

          19   pictures were taken?

          20          A.    About the distance of this

          21   table.

          22          Q.    So within eight feet maybe?

          23          A.    Yeah.

          24          Q.    Okay.  Were cars able to get

           1   between the driver side driving past the

           2   driver side of your car and the passenger

           3   side of the jeep while you were waiting

           4   there for police to come and for

           5   everything to happen?

           6          A.    Yeah, yes, I believe so.

           7          Q.    Did anyone else stop to

           8   render aide other than when the police

           9   came, did anyone else stop and say, "Can

          10   I help?"

          11          A.    Yeah, I think somebody

          12   walked up, heard the impact in their

          13   house and just walked down to see what

          14   was going on.  They wasn't trying to

          15   help, they just wanted to see.

          16          Q.    Okay.

           1   I have a claim that looks like from

          12          Q.    Okay.  It looks like a head,

          13   neck, and back according to the report

          14   that I have.  Do you remember anything

          15   about that accident at all?

          17          Q.    Do you remember if any of

          21          A.    No, I was all healed up and

          22   fine.

          23          Q.    Okay.  Do you know of any

          24   other accidents that you can recall other

           1   than 2009 and 2011 that you were in, car

           2   accidents?

           3          A.    No.

           4          Q.    It looks like there may have

           5   been one that I have, March 10th, 2016,

           6   which would have been a year before the

           7   car accident that we're here about today.

           8   Do you remember being injured in an

           9   accident on that date?

          10          A.    No.

          11          Q.    So just to sum up, the

          12   injuries that you sustained as a result

          13   of this accident was your lower back?

          14          A.    Yes.

          15          Q.    And as we sit here today,

          16   how does your lower back feel?

          17          A.    Right now it feels fine, but

          18   in the morning is when it hurts.  I don't

          19   take the medication no more, I just move

          20   around until it feels better.

          21          Q.    Did Dr. Boden's office or

          22   any other doctor give any home therapy or

          23   home treatment to do?

          24          A.    No.

           1          Q.    When you say get up and move

           2   around, is there any certain stretches

           3   you do or is it just the matter of when

           4   you get out of bed, standing up and just

           5   waiting --

           6          A.    Oh, yeah, I do stretches.

           7          Q.    What type of stretches?

           8          A.    Back stretches, leg

           9   stretches.  I like to go jogging, so I

          10   stretch before I do that.

          11          Q.    Okay.  Did you jog before

          12   the accident?

          20   week.

          21          Q.    Did that change at all as a

          22   result of the accident, or are you still

          23   able to jog?

          24          A.    Well, it changed because of

           2   know, I'm pretty much back.

           3          Q.    Was there a time after the

           4   accident that you didn't go jogging?

           7          A.    Eight months.

           8          Q.    When you went to the gym

           9   when you belonged to the gym before, did

          10   you use the treadmill there and jog or is

          11   your jogging always kind of outside on

          12   the street?

          13          A.    Always outside.

          16   BY MS. FRASCELLA:

          17   Q.     Good afternoon, Ms. Mendez.

          18   A.     Good afternoon.

          19   Q.     My name is Kim Frascella.  I represent

          20   Mr. Hunter in this litigation.

          21          Have you ever given a deposition

          22   before?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     I'm going to start by giving you some

                                                            6



           1   instructions.

           2   A.     Okay.

           3   Q.     My first instruction is going to be

           4   that all your responses need to be verbal.

           5   If you nod your head or say uh-uh or uh-huh,

           6   that cannot properly be reflected on the

           7   stenographic record.

           8   A.     Okay.

           9   Q.     If you give that type of response,

          10   either I will or your attorney will prompt

          11   you to give a verbal response, okay?

          12   A.     Okay.

          13   Q.     If you don't understand one of my

          14   questions, please let me know, and I'll

          15   rephrase it for you, okay?

          16   A.     Okay.

          17   Q.     If you don't know an answer to one of

          18   my questions or don't recall specific

          19   information, it's perfectly acceptable to

          20   tell me that.

          21   A.     Okay.

          22   Q.     No one here wants you to guess.  If

          23   you can estimate things like time or

          24   distance, that would be appreciated.  But if

                                                            7



           1   you just don't know or can't say, you can

           2   state that for the record, okay?

           3   A.     Okay.

           4   Q.     I ask that you wait until I complete

           5   my question before you begin your answer so

           6   that we're not speaking over one another.

           7   It's difficult for the court reporter to take

           8   down what's being said if we're talking over

           9   one another, okay?

          10   A.     Okay.

          11   Q.     You seem emotional already, and we

          12   haven't even gotten started.  Can I ask you

          13   why?

          14   A.     It's difficult seeing the gentleman.

          15   Q.     Why is it difficult?

          16               MR. DALY:  Are you okay?  Do you

          17   want to step out for a moment with me?  Are

          18   you all right?

          19               THE WITNESS:  It's difficult

          20   seeing the gentleman because since the day of

          21   the accident everything pretty much went bad,

          22   was ruined.

          11   A.     She's 19 now.

          12   Q.     My understanding is she does have some

          13   sort of disability, correct?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     What is the nature of that disability?

          16   A.     Microcephaly, pachygyria, cerebral

           6   Q.     She doesn't have a wheelchair?

           7   A.     She does have a wheelchair.  Because

          19   and the gentlemen came running to the car.

          20   That's the first time I ever seen them and

          21   spoke to them.  I don't know who they were.

          22   Q.     Both of them at the same time?

          23   A.     One came first and one was trying to

          24   turn off the car because the car was smoking.

           1   I was panicked, and my daughter was

           2   screaming.  She was going through a panic

           3   attack.

           4   Q.     I read in your interrogatories that at

           5   the time of the accident she was asleep; is

           6   that correct?

           7   A.     Yeah, she was like -- I don't know --

           8   like dozing off, not sleep sleep.

           9   Q.     Where was she seated in the vehicle?

          10   A.     In the front.

           1   Q.     Do you know whether or not either one

           2   of them were indicated on the police report?

           3   A.     Not that I know of, no.

           4   Q.     Do you know specifically who said what

           5   or who saw what?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     Can you give me a general idea of what

           8   they communicated to you at the scene?

           9   A.     They were trying to help me exit the

          10   car because it was smoking.  It was pretty

          11   bad.  There was things leaking, and they were

          12   scared it was going to catch on fire or

          13   something.  They were trying to help my

          14   daughter out of the vehicle with myself.

          15          I cannot specifically say who went

          16   after the other gentleman.  I was standing

          17   with one of them.  I don't remember.  Maybe

          18   if I see them, I'll be like, okay, you're

          19   this one, and you're the one that was

          20   standing next to me.

          21          One of them went after the gentleman,

          22   and one of them was with me to help take my

          23   daughter out of the car.  That was pretty

          24   much it.  They were like, are you okay?  We

                                                           17



           1   saw everything.  We're going to go stop the

           2   gentleman because he kept on going.

           3   Q.     Where did he go?

           4   A.     He just kept on going.

           5   Q.     Where did he go?

           6   A.     He just kept on going, moving his car

           7   as if he was going to leave.

           8   Q.     My understanding is that Conlyn Street

           9   dead ends into Old York Road, right?

          10   A.     I think so.  I don't recall the

          11   streets.  I just remember I was going down

          12   Broad Street.

          13   Q.     Are you familiar with that area?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     Where do you live in relation to the

          16   area?

          17   A.     I live here in Philadelphia.  I don't

          18   know what you call my mom's area.  It's close

          19   to Allegheny, like 5th and Allegheny.

          20   Q.     You're not familiar with the area

          21   where the accident occurred?

          22   A.     No.  That part up there, I think, is

          23   called Cheltenham, if I'm not mistaken, or is

          24   close to Cheltenham.

           4   leaving to go to the emergency room.

           6   this car was way off to the -- going this way

           7   to the right side.  There is a gas station,

           8   and his car was parked on the other side

          10               MR. DALY:  To the right of you?

           2   Q.     I don't know what that means.

           3   A.     I'm sorry, I guess --

           4   Q.     Closer to the center or closer to the

           5   shoulder?

           6   A.     Closer to the shoulder, not the

           7   center.

           8   Q.     Your testimony is that you were in the

           9   right lane of travel?

          10   A.     Yeah.

          11   Q.     Closer to the Sunoco?

          12   A.     Yeah, closer to where the gas station

          13   would be at, much further, though.  I know

          14   there is a gas station.  It was behind me.

          15   I'm on the right side of the lane.  There's

          16   two lanes; there's one left and one right.  I

          17   was on the right side.

          13   There was some kind of accident.  It just

          14   kind of veered me towards Broad Street.

          15   Q.     You were listening to some sort of GPS

          16   device at the time of the accident?

          17   A.     Yeah, the car has the little bluetooth

          18   to the phone.

          20   phone?

           1   because my daughter needs something to play

           2   with.  If the phone dies, I have the second

           3   phone so my job can call me.

           4   Q.     Are you the only one on that plan?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     How many other children do you have?

          10   Q.     Why don't you tell me in your own

          11   words how the accident occurred?

          12   A.     I was just driving and this gentleman

          13   just crossed in front of me out of nowhere.

          14   Q.     Did you have any indication that the

          15   vehicle was going to turn?

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.     When did you first observe my client's

          18   vehicle?

          19   A.     When his front was already there.  It

          20   just happened so fast.

          21   Q.     When you say his front was already

          22   where?

          23   A.     Like right in front of me.

          24   Q.     Did you get a ticket?

           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     Where did the vehicles come into

           3   contact?

           4   A.     I don't understand.

           5   Q.     Where did the impact occur on the

           6   vehicles?

           7   A.     On my vehicle, it was left and front

           8   left side and front.  I don't recall his

           9   vehicle.  He moved his vehicle, and I was too

          10   concerned as to worry about my daughter being

          11   in the car.

          12   Q.     You don't know where your car impacted

          13   his car?

          14               MR. DALY:  Objection.

          15               You can answer -- no, don't

          16   answer.

          17               MS. FRASCELLA:  Well, I need to

          18   know where her car came into contact with

          19   his.  However you want to phrase it is fine

          20   with me.  I have no preference.

          21   BY MS. FRASCELLA:

          22   Q.     What part of your car touched his car

          10   A.     The middle of his car, front middle.

          11   Q.     Can you tell me how many doors his car

          12   had?

          14   Q.     Do you know what kind of vehicle it

          15   was?

          17   Q.     Can you tell me if it was a car, SUV?

           1   A.     I don't understand.

           2   Q.     Was it raining at the time of the

           3   accident?

           4   A.     It was drizzling and muggy and

           5   darkish.

           6   Q.     Can you tell me the last intersection

           7   you crossed over on Broad Street before the

           8   accident occurred, where the prior

          10   A.     I don't remember.

          11   Q.     Where were you going to turn?

          12          Where did you have to get off Broad

          13   Street, how far down?

          14   A.     I got off 309.  It took me to

          15   Cheltenham.  I know Broad Street goes all the

          16   way down.  I was just going to take Broad

          17   Street all the way down to Temple, past

          18   Temple, Allegheny.

          19   Q.     Can you tell me what position my

           1   A.     I know he was coming -- all I saw was

           2   this thing just cross right in front of me.

           3   Q.     When you say cross right in front of

           4   you, what was he doing?

           5   A.     I'm not going to say jump because he's

           6   in a vehicle --

           7   Q.     Was he turning?

           8   A.     Yeah, like turning.  I know I'm in my

           9   two lanes and Broad Street is a big

          10   intersection, so two lanes on one side, two

          11   lanes on the other side.  It was like swoosh

          12   right in front of me so fast.

          13   Q.     Prior to approaching the area where

          14   the accident occurred, did you see a vehicle

          15   stopped or waiting to turn?

          19   Q.     Did you see any other vehicles?

          20   A.     There were other vehicles.  Everyone

          21   was just going.

          22   Q.     Were there any vehicles on your left

          23   in the left lane?

          24   A.     No.

           1   Q.     How was traffic?

           2   A.     It was light.  It wasn't heavy.

           3   Q.     Were you present when my client spoke

           4   to the police?

           5   A.     I know the police came.  I did not

           6   want to see your client.  My main concern was

           7   with my daughter.

           8   Q.     You didn't hear any conversation

           9   between the police and my client?

          10   A.     No.  The police kept, I think, your

          11   client apart from me, and me and my daughter

          12   were apart on the other side.

          13   Q.     Was there any particular reason for

          14   that?

          15   A.     I was just worried about my daughter.

          16   My daughter was screaming and panicking.  One

          17   of the gentleman -- I don't recall who,

          18   Anthony or the other guy -- they actually

          19   helped me out by getting your client's

          20   information because I was a nervous wreck.  I

          21   was concerned with my daughter.

          22   Q.     Did either one of those gentlemen

          23   speak to my client?

          24   A.     Not that I recall.

                                                           30



           1   Q.     How did they get my client's

           2   information?

           3   A.     Well, they went and when the police

           4   got there, the police asked the gentleman --

           5   they were there.  They were really helpful

           6   keeping me calm and they took the police over

           7   there to where your client was at.  They came

           8   back.  That's how I got a picture of your

           9   client's information and stuff.

          10   Q.     Did you get an incident report with

          11   the police report number on it at the scene?

          12   Did the police give you that?

          13   A.     They gave me a little yellow slip with

          14   some numbers on it.  I had to wait for that.

          15   Q.     Did the police ask you if you were

          16   injured at the scene?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     What did you respond?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Did they call an ambulance?

          21   A.     They said just to go to the emergency

          22   room.

          23   Q.     Did they ask if you needed an

          24   ambulance?

                                                           31



           1   A.     They did.  It just never got there.  I

           2   called 911 and it just never got there and my

           3   daughter panicking everything.

           4   Q.     When you called 911, did you

           5   specifically request an ambulance?

           6   A.     Yes, I said can I get assistance

           7   because I have my daughter, and it even took

           8   long for the police to get there.

           9   Q.     How long?

          10   A.     It took a while, and it just felt like

          11   forever for them to get there.

          12   Q.     We already marked this as Hunter-1.

          13   It's the police report.

          14          Can you just read the handwritten

          15   portion in the narrative, please.

          16   A.     You're talking about this?

          17   Q.     Yes.  You can read it to yourself.

          18   A.     I'm not sure why they said that.

          19   Q.     You read that the police report

          20   indicated that you -- at least it indicates

          21   on the police report that there were no

          22   injuries claimed at the scene of the

          23   accident; is that fair?

          24   A.     Okay.

                                                           32



           1   Q.     Is that what it says?

           2   A.     That's what it says.

           3   Q.     You disagree with that?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     You specifically communicated to the

           6   police officer that you were injured?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     What injuries did you communicate, if

           9   any?

          10   A.     I said I was having headaches, like

          11   dizziness, and my daughter was just screaming

          12   and yelling.  I didn't know what was wrong

          13   with her at the moment.

          14   Q.     Did the police officer express any

          15   concerns with her behavior?

          16   A.     No.  She was just hysterical and

          17   screaming, so much commotion and people

          18   coming around.  It was just rough.

          19   Q.     Does she have outbursts like that on a

          20   frequent basis?

           2   of anxiety disorder in addition to the

           3   medical conditions that she has?

           4   A.     No.  My daughter is not even diagnosed

           5   with ADHD.  Besides her conditions, she

           6   doesn't have any other thing.

           7   Q.     Does she attend school?

          20   of the police report.  It's on page 4.  It's

          21   under the section which indicates EMS agency.

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     It indicates none, correct?

          15   Q.     I presume your daughter went with you

          20   Q.     This accident happened in June.

          22   A.     I don't remember the date.

          23   Q.     Was it in 2018?

          24   A.     It was around the same time, but I

           1   know I just took some time off.

           2   Q.     The accident happened in June.

           3          Did you go back to work in the fall,

           4   the winter?  Can you give me some idea?

           5   A.     Maybe August.

           6   Q.     When you returned to work, did you

           8   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     Was it full-time when you returned?

          17   full-time since the accident?

          18   A.     My hours has fluctuated.  Things have

          19   changed.  I don't remember what date, what

          20   time, what stuff specifically.

          21   Q.     Are you a 1099 employee with Liberty

          24   Q.     What hours do you currently work?

           1   A.     8:00 to 10:00 in the morning and 10:30

           2   to 10:30 at night.

           5   Q.     If you work more than 40 hours, do you

           6   get overtime?

           7   A.     I don't know how that works with the

           8   job.

           9   Q.     Do you work more than 40 hours on a

          10   regular basis?

          11   A.     Yes.

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     Do you know how many hours over 40 you

          15   work on a weekly basis?

          16   A.     Off my head, I don't.

          23   Q.     Does your client drive independently?

          24   A.     No.

                                                           50



           1   Q.     What type of responsibilities do you

           2   have with regard to caring for that client?

           3   A.     Before or after the accident?

           4   Q.     Both.  You can start with before.

           5   A.     Before the accident, I was in charge

           6   of bathing my client, helping her in and out

           7   of the shower.

           8   Q.     Of the shower, not tub?

           9   A.     Well, it's a tub, but she takes a

          10   shower.  You have to lift her leg over.

          11   Q.     But she stands?

          12   A.     Yeah, she stands.  She doesn't lay

          13   down.  I had to help her get in and out of

          14   bed, dress her up.

          15   Q.     What about meal preparation?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     What about medication administration?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     What type of medications do you have

          20   to administer to her?

          21   A.     Well, I don't have to administer, just

          22   give her her medications for her high blood

          23   pressure, for arthritis.

          24   Q.     All oral medication?

                                                           51



           1   A.     Yes, all oral medication.

           2   Q.     How has that changed since the

           3   accident?

           4   A.     It changed a lot because my client

           5   depended on me bathing her and helping her do

           6   her daily things, and since the accident --

           7   she's heavy, so I can't pick her up and lift

           8   her up.

           9   Q.     How heavy is she?

          10   A.     She's like 250 pounds.

          11   Q.     What type of activities did you used

          12   to assist her with before the accident that

          13   you can't assist her with now?

          14   A.     She wanted to lose some weight, so we

          15   used to go work out a little bit.

          16   Q.     Work out where?

          17   A.     We would just walk out in the street

          18   and do some little weights at home.  I would

          19   take her out to at least a fast walk.

          20   Q.     Speed walk?

          21   A.     Yeah.

          22   Q.     You don't do that anymore?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     Has your client had any medical

                                                           52



           1   episodes or injuries since your accident that

           2   prohibits them from doing those things?

           3   A.     Yes.  My client has tried taking

           4   herself a bath and doing things on her own

           5   where she has injured herself.  It's rough

           6   because I used to help her and do it for her.

           7          She doesn't want anyone else looking

           8   at her and taking care of her and that's

           9   understandable.  She tries doing it on her

          10   own, and she's hurt herself a few times.

          11   Q.     You don't help her shower at all

          12   anymore?

          13   A.     It's difficult.

          14   Q.     What's difficult about it?

          15   A.     She's so heavy.  She puts her weight

          16   on me, and my back hurts and my left arm has

          17   been getting numb.  She tries to put a lot of

          18   her weight on my right side.

          19   Q.     When did your right arm start becoming

          20   numb?

          21   A.     My left.

          22   Q.     I'm sorry.  When?

          23   A.     I started having problems right after

          24   the accident.  First, I started feeling a

                                                           53



           1   tingling sensation and pins and needles, and

           2   then sometimes my arm and I can't feel my

           3   fingers.

           4   Q.     Which hand?

           5   A.     My left.

           6   Q.     How frequently does that occur

           7   currently?

           8   A.     It happens about maybe twice, three

           9   times a week.

          10   Q.     How long does it last?

          11   A.     The numbness will last for maybe five

          12   to six minutes.

          13   Q.     What about the tingling?

          14   A.     The tingling sensation comes and goes

          15   all the time.

          16   Q.     When it comes, how long does it last?

          17   A.     About three minutes.

          18   Q.     How frequently in a day does it come

          19   and go?  How many times throughout the day?

          20   A.     Throughout the day, it's like maybe

          21   five times, and I try to have something in my

          22   hand to kind of exercise it, like a squishy

          23   ball or something.

          24   Q.     Are there any other activities that

                                                           54



           1   you are either limited in or can no longer do

           2   with regard to your occupation that we

           3   haven't spoken about?

           4   A.     Can't do her heavy laundry.

           5   Q.     What's her heavy laundry?

           6   A.     Like her big quilts, bedsheets.

           7   Q.     Who does that?

           8   A.     I'm not sure.  I only do the light

           9   stuff.

          10   Q.     Does she have an aide when you're not

          11   there?

          12   A.     She doesn't want anyone.

          13   Q.     So she doesn't have another aide when

          14   you're not there?

          15   A.     She has a granddaughter, but that's

          16   not an aide.

          17   Q.     Does she live there, the

          18   granddaughter?

          19   A.     No, she lives on her own.  My client

          20   lives on her own.

          21   Q.     What about your own personal daily

          22   living activities, how have they been

          23   affected?

          24   A.     My daily actives have been affected

                                                           55



           1   very much, especially with my disabled

           2   daughter.  It's difficult to pick her up and

           3   get her off the bed to change her diapers,

           4   get her dressed, put her in the shower.  It's

           5   difficult to bend down.

           6   Q.     What's difficult about bending down?

           7   A.     Because it hurts my back, and

           8   sometimes I don't have the balance and I lose

           9   the balance and I fall.

          10   Q.     What part of your back hurts when you

          11   bend?

          12   A.     It starts in the lower back and goes

          13   to the middle part of my back.

          14   Q.     When was the last time you saw a

          15   doctor related to your injuries?

          16   A.     It's been months.

          17   Q.     Was the last time you saw a doctor

          18   when you saw Dr. Patel in December 2018?  Is

          19   that the last time?

          20   A.     No, I have not seen a doctor, but I

          21   have been to an urgent care or Ready Care.

          22   Q.     Is that what you already told me

          23   about?

          24   A.     Yes.

                                                           56



           1   Q.     Did they prescribe you any medication?

           2   A.     Sometimes they do, but I already have

           3   Motrin or Tylenol.  I didn't take anything

           4   strong.

           5   Q.     Is there anyone else in your household

           6   who cares for your daughter?

           7   A.     No.  I live with my mother, but my

           8   mother has a condition and she can't help me

           9   with my daughter.

          10   Q.     What's her condition?

          11   A.     Her hipbone is disintegrating, so it's

          12   going away.  My mom has early signs of

          13   dementia, so she can't help me out.  I'm

          14   supposed to be the caregiver for her and my

          15   daughter.

          16   Q.     Who stays with your mother when you're

          17   at work?

          18   A.     My sister lives next door.

          19   Q.     Have you applied for any assistance

          20   for your daughter as far as an aide for your

          21   home situation?

          22   A.     Yes.  Recently, she's been approved,

          23   but just trying to find someone that can take

          24   care of my daughter is not so easy.

                                                           57



           1   Q.     Is she on Medicare Or Medicaid or

           2   both?

           3   A.     I think it's both.  She has Health

           4   Partners.  I'm not sure what that falls into.

           5   Q.     Did she receive Disability benefits,

           6   as well?

           7   A.     Yes, my daughter does.

           8   Q.     Other than when she went to St. Chris

           9   and to her primary doctor, did she have any

          10   other treatment related to the accident?

          11   A.     She takes treatment of her own.  I

          12   would take her to Chester, but I don't know

          13   the name of it, the place I tried.

          14   Q.     Who referred you there?

          15   A.     Her attorney.

          16   Q.     Was it Dr. Bonner's office?

          17   A.     Grossinger, I think.

          18   Q.     What did Dr. Grossinger do for her?

          19   A.     He's giving her different kinds of

          20   therapy.  We don't go as often.

          21   Q.     Has he given her any injections?

          22   A.     Grossinger, I don't recall.  I don't

          23   remember.  We haven't been in months.

          24   Q.     Did she have any MRIs?

                                                           58



           1   A.     I don't remember.  I know we had MRIs

           2   in Children's Hospital.  Whatever

           3   Dr. Grossinger needs, he says to get from

           4   Children's Hospital because they have to put

           5   my daughter to sleep completely.

           6   Q.     Are you talking about St. Chris?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Have you had MRIs?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Where did you have them?

          11   A.     I think it was City Line Avenue.  I

          12   don't recall the place.

          13   Q.     Did you only have one in your neck and

          14   back, or did you have more than that?

          15   A.     I think it was just my neck and back.

          16   Q.     You had an EMG?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Was it with Dr. Holding?

          19   A.     I don't remember what doctor it was.

          20   Q.     Do you know where it was that you

          21   went?

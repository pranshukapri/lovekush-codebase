          16   BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

          17   Q.     Good afternoon.

          18   A.     Good afternoon.

          19   Q.     My name is Daria Koscielniak and I

          20   represent Ms. Lin in connection with the

          21   lawsuit you filed against her.  I'm here

          22   today to take your deposition.

          23          Have you ever given a deposition

          24   before?

                                                            6



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     How many times?

           3   A.     Once.

           4   Q.     When was the last time you gave a

           5   deposition?

           6   A.     I believe it was last year for my

           7   work.

           8   Q.     2018?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Since it's been some time, I'm going

          11   to go over some ground rules before we get

          12   started, okay?

          13   A.     Okay.

          14   Q.     Seated to your left and my right is

          15   the court reporter.  She's taking down

          16   everything that you and I say.  For that

          17   reason, it's important that your answers are

          18   verbal.  She can't take down nods of the

          19   head, hand gestures.  Things like uh-uh or

          20   uh-huh will not be clear on the record that's

          21   created after today.

          22          Do you understand that?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     If I ask you, is that a yes or no,

                                                            7



           1   it's so that the record is clear, okay?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     If you don't understand any of my

           4   questions, please let me know.  I'm happy to

           5   rephrase or repeat them.  If you provide me

           6   with an answer to question, I'm going to

           7   assume that you understood it; is that fair?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Are you under the influence of any

          10   kind of drugs, alcohol, medication, anything

          11   at all that would affect your ability to

          12   understand my questions here today and answer

          13   them truthfully?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     You understand that, even though we

          16   are not in a court of law today, your

          17   testimony holds the same weight as if we

          18   were?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Did you review any documents in

          21   preparation for today?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     What did you review?

          24   A.     Just paperwork, my police report.

                                                            8



           1   Q.     Anything other than the police report?

           2   A.     No.

           3               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Off the record.

          12   A.     I was traveling westbound on Hunting

          13   Park Avenue, and I was on the right lane.

          14   Driving down, and the car came from the left

          15   lane, zoom in front of me.

          16          Before the car passed in front of me,

          17   it was a school bus pulling out of the

          18   parking space on the far-right lane.  A car

          19   on my left came just past in front of me so

          20   close, pulling into the parking space where

          21   the school bus came out.

          22          The person was so close, to prevent

          23   from hitting them, I turned my steering wheel

          24   to the left and I wind up hitting them.

           1   Q.     How long had you been traveling in the

           2   right lane for on Hunting Park?

           3   A.     I traveled the right lane all the time

           4   because I have to make a right turn on

           5   Wissahickon Avenue.

           6   Q.     How long had you been on Hunting Park

           7   for before the accident occurred?  It's fine

           8   if you can do it in minutes or distance.

           9   A.     What do you mean?

          10   Q.     Were you on Hunting Park for three

          11   miles, ten minutes?  How long had you been

          12   traveling that road before the accident

          13   occurred?

          14   A.     I'll say 15, 20 minutes.  I went to

          15   the Walgreens, bought gum, snacks, and drive

          16   back down going to work.

          17   Q.     What time did you have to be at work?

          18   A.     I don't remember what time I had to be

          19   at work, but I do know I had at least 40

          20   minutes before I clocked in.  I always get to

          21   work before I clock in because we get points

          22   if we're late, so I wasn't late that day.

          23   Q.     What was your shift typically like

          24   around the time of the accident?

                                                           51



           1   A.     Can you repeat that?

           2   Q.     What was your shift typically like

           3   around the time of the accident?

           4   A.     At that time, I had a straight shift,

           5   as I remember.

           6   Q.     What does that mean?

           7   A.     It means that, instead of your work

           8   being cut off in two, you do some in the

           9   a.m., and do some in the evening, I have a

          10   midday straight with no break in between the

          11   work.

          12   Q.     What would your hours typically be

          13   around the time of the accident?

          14   A.     I don't remember, but I do know I had

          15   a 10- or 11-hour shift that day straight.

          16   Q.     You were on your way to work when this

          17   accident occurred?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     You hadn't worked at all before that

          20   day?

          21   A.     No, I hadn't worked that day.  I was

          22   just going in for that day work.

          23   Q.     You don't know what time you were

          24   supposed to be there?

                                                           52



           1   A.     It was before 12:00, 12:00 p.m.  I

           2   don't remember.

           3   Q.     Were you rushing on the way to work?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     Before the accident occurred, had you

           6   received points for clocking in late at work?

           8   Q.     You said you were traveling down

           9   Hunting Park in the right lane, and a car

          10   came from the left lane; is that correct?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     What kind of car was it that came from

          13   the left lane?

          14   A.     It was an Audi.

          15   Q.     Color?

          16   A.     Black, I believe.

          17   Q.     When was the first time that you saw

          18   that Audi?

          19   A.     I saw the Audi when it was coming when

          20   I was in the right lane.  I did see that car

          21   driving.  Then I didn't pay too much

          22   attention because it was on my left lane, but

          23   when he got in front of me, that's when I was

          24   like, oh.  Then I turned my steering wheel.

                                                           53



           1   I'm a driver, so I turned my steering wheel

           2   real quick to prevent from hitting her when

           3   she cut in front of me.

           4   Q.     When was the first time that you saw

           5   the Audi before the accident?

           6   A.     When I was at the light because it was

           7   at 20th and Hunting Park light.  It was a car

           8   next to me on the left lane, but it wasn't

           9   that Audi?

          10   Q.     Was the Audi the first car at the

          11   light in the left lane at 20th?

          12   A.     It wasn't the Audi.  It was another

          13   car next to me when we were at the red light.

          14   Q.     Was she behind you?

          15   A.     I don't know.  All I know is she was

          16   on the left lane.  When we were at the light,

          17   Hunting Park and 20th Street red light, there

          18   was a car beside me.  It wasn't that Audi.

          19          When we start going in, the Audi just

          20   cut in front of me to get the parking spot

          21   where the school bus was coming out.

          22   Q.     I'm trying to understand when you were

          23   at the light at 20th and Hunting, were you

          24   the first car in line?

                                                           54



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     In the right lane?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     There was another vehicle in the left

           5   lane directly next to you?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     That was also the first car?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     At some point the light turned green?

          11   Q.     When the light turned green, was that

          12   the first time that you saw the Audi?

          13   A.     When the first car passed, I was

          14   chilling, listening to music.  As I crossed

          15   that intersection, that's when I saw the

          16   Audi, boom.

          17   Q.     In the left lane?

          18   A.     In the left lane, coming from the left

          19   lane and cross in front of me.

          20   Q.     How soon after the light turned green

          21   at the intersection did the Audi cross in

          22   front of you?

          23   A.     It happened very quickly.

          24   Q.     A few seconds?  A few minutes?

                                                           55



           1   A.     Not more than two minutes.  I can't

           2   tell the timeframe.  Everything happened so

           3   quickly.

           4   Q.     Before you went through the

           5   intersection at 20th and Hunting, you didn't

           6   see the Audi at any other time?

           7   A.     No, I didn't pay attention to any car

           8   next to me.

           9   Q.     Let's talk about the school bus.

          10          What kind of school but was it?

          11   A.     It was a short school bus.

          12   Q.     Was it yellow?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     How big was it compared to a standard

          15   SUV?

          16   A.     It's big.

          17   Q.     Bigger than a standard SUV?

          18   A.     Yes.  It's two types of school buses;

          19   the long one and the short one.  It was the

          20   short one.

          21   Q.     When did you first see that short

          22   yellow bus?

          23   A.     When the light turned green,

          24   technically that school bus would be in front

                                                           56



           1   of me.  That school bus had their left turn

           2   signal coming out, pulling out.  So I had to

           3   make sure I don't touch the bus or anything,

           4   so trying to let them go in front of me

           5   because half of the front of the bus was

           6   already out.  When I slowed down to let that

           7   bus go, that Audi cut in front of me to take

           8   that parking spot.

           9   Q.     Did you know that the school bus was

          10   already pulling out of that spot when you

          11   were stopped for the red light at 20th?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     When was the first --

          14   A.     When the light turned green as I start

          15   driving, that's when it was already coming

          16   out of the parking space.

          17               MR. LEVY:  You're anticipating

          18   where some of her questions are going.  Just

          19   make sure you let her get the whole question

          20   out on the record before you answer.

          21               THE WITNESS:  Okay.

          22   BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

          23   Q.     You want to know my exact question

          24   before you begin to answer.

                                                           57



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     You said that you had to slow down in

           3   order to allow the school bus to exit the

           4   parking space?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Did you come to a complete stop?

           7   A.     No, I was driving slowly.  I never

           8   came to a complete stop.  Just wanted to make

           9   sure the bus can go by.

          10   Q.     How fast were you traveling when you

          11   slowed down in order to let the bus exit the

          12   parking space?

          13   A.     Not sure, but it was definitely less

          14   than 10, 12 miles, something like that.  I

          15   wasn't sure exact.

          16   Q.     When the bus exited the parking spot,

          17   where was the Audi at that point?

          18   A.     I don't know where was the Audi at

          19   that time, but before the Audi cleared that

          20   parking spot, that's when that car came boom

          21   in front of me.  She was so close.

          22   Q.     Do you mean before the school bus

          23   cleared?

          24   A.     Before the school bus cleared that

                                                           58



           1   parking spot on the right side, that's when

           2   that car come right in front of me, just come

           3   like this.  I turned my steering wheel to the

           4   left.

           5   Q.     When the Audi began to move in front

           6   of you from the left lane into your right

           7   lane, was the school bus already out of the

           8   spot at that point?

           9   A.     Not completely.

          10   Q.     Was there any collision between the

          11   Audi and the school bus?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     Where did the collision between your

          14   car and the Audi take place?

          15   A.     Past the intersection.

          16   Q.     Did the collision occur in the right

          17   lane, in the left lane, somewhere in between?

          18   A.     It happened right in between the

          19   intersections.  It happened when I turned my

          20   car to the left.  The corner right of my car

          21   made contact with the left side of her car,

          22   backside of her car.

          23   Q.     When that contact occurred, were you

          24   still completely in the right lane, or had

                                                           59



           1   you moved into the left lane?

           2   A.     I was completely in the right lane.

           3   Q.     Even though you turned your wheel to

           4   the left, you were completely in the right

           5   lane?

           6   A.     When I turned my wheel to the left, I

           7   was going to the left lane and let her just

           8   go.  She was too close when she cut in front

           9   of me, so I wind up hitting her.

          10   Q.     The impact occurred entirely in the

          11   right lane; no part of your car was in the

          12   left lane at that time?

          13               MR. LEVY:  Objection to the form

          14   of the question.

          15               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  What about the

          16   form?

          17               MR. LEVY:  One part of the

          18   question was whether the impact took place in

          19   the right lane, but then you also said but no

          20   part of your car was in the left lane.

          21               I think there could be a

          22   difference of where the impact takes place

          23   and where part of her car is.

          24               Does that make sense?

           1               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  I'll re-ask the

           2   question.

           3   BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

           4   Q.     You've told me that the impact

           5   occurred in the right lane; is that correct?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     No part of your car was in the left

           8   lane when the impact occurred?

           9   A.     When I made contact?

          10   Q.     Yes.

          11   A.     When I made the contact, the left side

          12   of my car -- I was already trying to get off

          13   away from her, she cut in front of me so

          14   close, so it happened right in the middle.

          15   Q.     Well, that's what I want to know.

          16          Did any part of your car enter the

          17   left lane when the impact occurred?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     Which part?

          20   A.     The left side of my car.

          21   Q.     How much of the left side?

          22   A.     Completely almost the left.

          23   Q.     If we split your car right down the

          24   middle and you're sitting in the driver's

                                                           61



           1   seat, would that part of the car from your

           2   drivers seat to the middle of the car have

           3   been in the left lane when the impact

           4   occurred?

           5   A.     Yes, it was only the left -- the right

           6   side of my car, the right corner of my car,

           7   that was left that hit her.

           8   Q.     Was the Audi vehicle completely in the

           9   right lane when the impact occurred?

          10   A.     No.

          11   Q.     What was the position of that car?

          12   A.     Like this.  It wasn't straight.

          13   Q.     Can you describe it.

          14   A.     It was not completely straight to the

          15   lane.  It was still in the position of going

          16   in.  It was still in the position of cut in

          17   front of me because some of the car was still

          18   on the left lane.

          19   Q.     Can you describe how much of the Audi

          20   was in the left lane and how much was in the

          21   right lane when the impact between your car

          22   and the Audi occurred?

          23   A.     It was just a little bit of her car

          24   when she came in front of me.  I don't know

                                                           62



           1   how to describe it.

           2   Q.     Let me ask it this way.

           3          Was most of the Audi in the left lane

           4   or the right lane when the impact occurred?

           5   A.     Most of the car was in the left lane

           6   when she cut in front of me.  Her front was

           7   definitely in the right lane, the front of

           8   her car, going directly into the parking

           9   spot.

          10   Q.     Just for the record, it seems like you

          11   were indicating that the Audi was at an angle

          12   when the impact occurred?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     Am I correct in understanding that the

          15   angle would be so that the front passenger

          16   side corner was more in the right lane and

          17   the rear driver's side corner was more in the

          18   lane?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     What did the impact feel like?

          21   A.     What do you mean by how did it feel

          22   like?

          23   Q.     Was it a soft impact, medium impact,

          24   hard impact?

                                                           63



           1   A.     It was a hard impact.

           2   Q.     You said you were traveling about 10

           3   to 12 miles an hour before the impact

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     You said that you turned your wheel to

           9   Q.     Did you hit your brakes at any point?

          10   A.     Yes.  After the car hit her, I put

          11   down my foot on the steering wheel hard

          12   (sic).

          13   Q.     After the impact occurred, that was

          14   when you hit the brakes?

          15   A.     No, I hit the brakes before I hit her,

          16   but she was so close to me.  So it's either I

          17   tried to avoid it, try to avoid it and turn

          18   to the left, but she was so close me, so

          19   close.

          20   Q.     You're traveling 10 to 12 miles an

          21   hour.  You see the Audi come into the lane in

          22   font of you.  You turn your wheel to the left

          23   and you hit the brake, and then the impact

          24   occurs?

                                                           64



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     You weren't able to come to a stop to

           3   prevent the impact, correct?

           4   A.     No, I wasn't able to.

           5   Q.     Do you know how fast the Audi was

           6   traveling?

           7   A.     No, I don't know.

           8   Q.     Do you have any estimate?

           9   A.     No.

          10   Q.     Did you see the Audi come to a stop

          11   before the accident occurred?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     Did you see whether the Audi had any

          14   kind of turn signal on?

          15   A.     No, it did not have.

          16   Q.     Where were you looking when the impact

          17   occurred?

          18   A.     Straight.

          19   Q.     Were you using your cell phone at the

          20   time of the accident?

          21   A.     No.

          22   Q.     Where did your car come to a stop?

          23   A.     After the impact, my car was stopped

          24   basically.  I just drove it to the corner to

                                                           65



           1   prevent it from holding up traffic.

           2   Q.     Was your vehicle drivable after the

           3   accident?

           4   A.     Yes, it was drivable.

           5   Q.     Were you able to drive it away from

           6   the scene?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Where did you go from the scene?

           9   A.     Took it right up to the shop that a

          10   friend of mine knows.

          11   Q.     Where was the shop located?

          12   A.     On Hunting Park Avenue.

          13   Q.     And what?

          14   A.     What do you mean?

          15   Q.     Was it at an intersection?

          16   A.     No, it's right there between

          17   Germantown and Hunting Park or Broad Street

          18   and Hunting Park.  It was a couple blocks

          19   from where the impact happened.

          20   Q.     How long were you at the scene for?

          21   A.     Until the police came.  The police

          22   left.  Then my friend, who I called, drove

          23   the car.

          24   Q.     A friend of yours came to the scene of

                                                           66



           1   the accident?

           3   Q.     What's your friend's name?

           4   A.     Paul Carter.

           5   Q.     Can you spell that for the record?

          20   A.     I'm not sure, but it was right after

          21   when the cops left.  We were probably there

          22   for a little over an hour, two hours.  I'm

          23   not sure.

          24   Q.     Earlier today at my client's

           5               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  I'm not sure

           6   that photographs were ever produced.

           7               MR. LEVY:  I don't know what we

           8   sent to you guys.

           9               MS. KOSCIELNIAK:  Do you have

          10   color versions of these?

          11               MR. LEVY:  Yes, I can e-mail

          12   those to you.

          17   BY MS. KOSCIELNIAK:

          18   Q.     The photographs that were previously

          19   identified as D-1, D-2 and D-3, do they

          20   accurately show the damage to my client's

          21   vehicle after the accident occurred?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Was there damage to any other part of

          24   her vehicle other than what's shown there in

                                                           69



           1   the photographs?

           3   see.

           4   Q.     I do have a couple of color

           5   photographs here.  I'll show you these.  We

           6   can mark them as P-1, P-2, P-3, P-4, P-5.

           7   right.  I was on vacation that same following

           8   week, so I didn't have to work.  I was on

           9   vacation for a little over a week.  Since the

          11   A.     A friend of mine go there for therapy,

          12   who said that their method is good.  So I

          13   tried it there, and it didn't work out really

          14   well.  The schedules were hard, so I changed

          15   it somewhere else.

          16   Q.     The records that I was provided by

          17   your attorney indicate that you first went to

           1   prescribed from the emergency room, waited it

           2   out to see whether I will need anything more

           3   or not.  When I figured out it may be more

           4   than what I thought it is, that's when I

           5   start doing therapy.

           6   Q.     Was there any other reason why you

           7   waited seven weeks for treatment?

           8   A.     No, just that, just waiting it out to

           9   see the medicine that they gave me, the

          10   muscle relaxers, were working out or if I

          11   will feel better.

          12   Q.     How many times did you treat at

          13   Woodland Avenue?

          14   A.     I'm not quite sure of the numbers, but

          16   maybe.

          18   you treated three times in November with

          22   Q.     What happened during the 13 weeks?

           1   to pay.  I have bills to pay.  I cannot

           2   afford to not go to work.  I cannot.

           3          The days that they were available for

           4   me wasn't working for me.  I was going to

           5   work like this in pain.  I find out another

           6   doctor's office who their schedule is

           7   flexible, and they have Saturdays, so I wind

           8   up going there.

           9   Q.     What was the name of that office?

          10   A.     Barun Spinal.

          11   Q.     How did you find out about them?

          12   A.     A friend of mine gave me the place.

          13   Q.     It's your testimony that Woodland

          14   Avenue didn't have any kind of weekend

          15   availability?

          16   A.     They did not have weekend

          17   availability.

          18   Q.     You weren't able to go to Woodland

          19   before work?

          20   A.     No.  At that time, I was starting my

          21   job at 4:00, 5:00 in the morning with

          22   45-minute swings then from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00

          23   p.m.  By that time they closed, so their

          24   hours wasn't working for me.

          22   Q.     I'd like for you to tell me all the

          23   ways this accident in 2017 affected you.

          24   A.     In Africa, before the child is seven

                                                           89



           1   years old, let's say five or six, we carry

           2   them on our back to show them a way of -- we

           3   call it topito.  You carry your child in the

           4   back.  I don't know the name in English.

           5          We call it topito.  I'm not doing that

           6   for my five-year-old.  There is no way

           7   possible I'm able to do that.  He's used to

           8   me carrying him on his back, especially

           9   before he go to bed.  Before he goes to bed,

          10   I would put him on my back and sing to him

          11   and I take him up the steps and put him in

          12   the bed while he was on my back.  He loves

          13   that.

          14          I'm not able to do that, and that's

          15   one thing that mostly affected me a lot.

          16   Other than that, if I'm not able to do my

          17   house chores, like cooking, cleaning, doing

          18   all of that stuff, I have my older son go

          19   into the laundromat with me and carry all the

          20   stuff.  I will always cut my work in half or

          21   three times, if not able to do everything

          22   together.

          23   Q.     You're still able to do things around

          24   the house; it just takes you a little longer

                                                           90

           3   Q.     Did you have any kind of difficulty

           4   with picking up or carrying your children

           5   before the 2017 accident?

           6   A.     Never.

           7   Q.     Even after the 2015 accident, that

           8   wasn't an issue for you?

           9   A.     It was an issue.  It was an issue.

          10   Q.     It was?

          11   A.     It was, yes.

          12   Q.     When I ask you if you've ever had

          13   difficulty with it before, I mean ever.

          14   A.     Oh, no.  Well, I'm assuming, which I

          15   shouldn't.  At that time of the 2015, I had

          16   an issue, but later I was fine, so I'm

          17   assuming.

          18   Q.     Don't assume.

          19   A.     Absolutely.  I apologize for assuming.

          20   Q.     I want to make sure we're on the same

          21   page.

          22          You did have issues with that after

          23   the 2015 accident, but you were then able to

          24   get back to it?

                                                           91



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     Since the 2017 accident, you haven't

           3   been able to do it?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     Anything else that was affected as a

           6   result of the 2017 accident?

           7   A.     That's about it.

           8   Q.     Difficulty with driving and sitting

           9   for long periods of time?

          10   A.     Yeah.  I drive.  SEPTA don't have an

          11   eight-hour workday.  We don't.  Mostly, the

          12   least is ten hours a day at least.  I work

          13   with my neck all the time.  I have to look

          14   all the time.  That's difficult.  Sometimes I

          15   wake up, and I can't even do like this.

          16   Q.     Turning your head fully?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Is there anything you're still doing

          19   for the pain?

          20   A.     No, I don't want to take those

          21   medicine and be addicted to it, so they say.

          22   I kind of really slowed down to what works

          23   for me and not working too much.  As long as

          24   I don't drive too much, I'm fine.

           1          I don't even drive my car to go to

           2   work.  I take public transportation just to

      14   BY MR. BLUM:

      15        Q    Could you state your full name for

      16   the record, please?

      17        A    David P. Bennett, B-E-N-N-E-T-T.

      18        Q    And whom are you employed by, David?

      19        A    Elliott Claims, LLC.

      20        Q    My name is Joseph Blum and I

      21   represent Mercedes-Benz in a case that's been

      22   brought by Millers Capital insurance.

      23             I'm going to ask you a series of

      24   questions today.  If at any time you don't


                                                         6




       1   understand the question, please let me know

       2   and I'll be happy to restate it.  I would ask

       3   that you keep all your responses verbal

       4   because the court reporter cannot take down

       5   our nods or our shrugs.  I would also ask that

       6   you try to let me finish my question before

       7   you start to speak so that she can take one of

       8   us down at a time.

       9             Do you understand all that?

      10        A    I understand.

      11        Q    Is there anything that would prevent

      12   you from testifying accurately today?

      13        A    Not that I'm aware of.

      14        Q    Okay.  Can you tell me how long

      15   you've worked for your current company?

      16        A    Let me think about it.  I want to

      17   say from 2000 is when I hooked up with John

      18   Elliott as a subcontractor with John.

      19        Q    And are you a subcontractor there

      20   now?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    Okay.  And what services does he

      23   contract with you?

      24        A    Basically the handling of property


                                                         7




       1   claims, generally the larger property claims

       2   as opposed to the smaller ones.

       3        Q    All right.  And do you evaluate

       4   claims for other people or independently?

       5        A    I have adjusted some independently

       6   to my own company, which is B&W Claims, LLC.

       7   I also am a subcontractor with Provencher,

       8   P-R-O-V-E-N-C-H-E-R, Claims, LLC.

       9        Q    All right.  And what types of claims

      10   in general are you handling?

      11        A    First-party property claims.

      12        Q    Are they typically commercial,

      13   residential, or both?

      14        A    90% commercial, 10% residential.

      15        Q    And how long have you worked like as

      16   an independent adjuster yourself?

      17        A    Since '99, 1999.  And then when I

      18   first started in the business, which was in

      19   '77 or '78.

      20        Q    Okay.  So in '77 or '78 you started

      21   in the claims business, is that what you're

      22   saying?

      23        A    Correct.

      24        Q    How did you get started?


                                                         8




       1        A    My dad was an independent and I was

       2   looking to change from working for a title

       3   company.

       4        Q    And then from '77, '78 all the way

       5   to '99, have you operated independently or did

       6   you work for other people?

       7        A    No.  From, it's either late '77 to I

       8   believe August of '79 I was with a company in

       9   Nebraska called State Farmers, not State Farm,

      10   that wrote basically farm and residential.

      11             And in '79 I went to work for

      12   American General Fire and Casualty/Maryland

      13   Casualty in Dallas.  Was in the Dallas office

      14   four years as first was an auto adjuster, then

      15   I picked up liability, then I did comp and did

      16   property.

      17             And I want to say in '83 I went to

      18   Midland Odessa with them as a claims manager

      19   of a claims office.  '84 was in San Antonio

      20   for a year as a branch supervisor for workers'

      21   comp and property.  And '85 went to the

      22   regional office as a general adjuster in

      23   Houston.  And in '89 was brought up to

      24   Baltimore, the home office, as a regional


                                                         9




       1   general adjuster for the northeast territory.

       2             And then from there to '99, at some

       3   point I went inside as a home office property

       4   manager, and then the titles changed just to

       5   give me more money.  I'm raised time, so.

       6        Q    You said you worked for a title

       7   company before that?

       8        A    Chicago Title Insurance Company back

       9   in '76, I think it was '76, '75, '76, in

      10   there.

      11        Q    All right.  And can you tell us what

      12   your educational background is?

      13        A    Graduated high school in '73, did a

      14   year at college at Bellevue Junior College,

      15   and then went out into the work force.  With

      16   American General I completed the Insurance

      17   Institute of America three-part course and

      18   then the associate in claims course.  And then

      19   did the five-year with the -- I'm trying to

      20   think of the society -- senior claims loss

      21   associate is the final designation I've got.

      22   And, of course, all the training for business

      23   income, property, storms, whatever.

      24        Q    And are those, when you refer to


                                                        10




       1   that, are those like company training programs

       2   that you're talking about?

       3        A    They're national insurance training

       4   programs.

       5        Q    Okay.  And so they were outside of

       6   the insurance company with like different

       7   associations?

       8        A    Yeah.  The American Educational

       9   Institute is a national -- they provide the

      10   training or classes or educational material

      11   for all divisions of the insurance industry.

      12   And then you have the senior claims loss

      13   associate, which again is the American

      14   Educational Institute, and that's the

      15   five-year program on that aspect.

      16             And then, of course, you've got the

      17   individual training throughout the course that

      18   are put on by different entities like the Loss

      19   Executives Association, has training seminars.

      20   There was Insurance Technical Institute, which

      21   was an estimating program.  Then various

      22   accounting programs of which I had an

      23   accounting background anyway, so.

      24        Q    And at some point were you retained


                                                        11




       1   to work on or adjust a loss that occurred at

       2   the Clemens Cleaning facility here in

       3   Lansdale?

       4        A    Yes.

       5        Q    What were you asked to do?

       6        A    Millers' instructions are generally

       7   the same on all their claims, is basically I

       8   act as the independent adjuster, I evaluate

       9   the damages, review the coverages, and see how

      10   the damages comply or fall within the

      11   different coverages that are available.

      12   Determine whether or not we had possible

      13   subrogation, just on what the cause may be,

      14   and suggest and recommend cause and origin

      15   experts to come in.

      16        Q    All right.  And you said typically

      17   that's what Millers does.  Is that what they

      18   did here?

      19        A    Yes.

      20        Q    Okay.  And had you adjusted claims

      21   for Millers before this?

      22        A    Yes.

      23        Q    Approximately how often?

      24        A    That's a good question.  They

       1   generally account probably, I can answer it

       2   this way, generally about 40% of my income,

       3   yearly income comes from working claims for

       4   Millers.

       5        Q    And when they hire you, do they pay

       6   you per hour, do they pay you per claim?  I

       7   mean, how do they compensate you?

       8        A    I'm on a time and expense basis.

       9   And it depends on the complexity of the claim

      10   as to whether we charge them a regular

      11   adjuster rate or whether we charge them a

      12   general adjuster rate.

      13        Q    Okay.  And did you in fact work on

      14   the Clemens loss?

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    What was the first thing you did on

      17   that loss?

      18        A    Received the loss notice, and I

      19   believe Alex had an appointment set up for

      20   onsite inspection, so I made arrangements to

      21   meet at the site with Alex.  And I believe I

      22   had already enlisted or I had recommended a

      23   cause and origin.  Simply because of the size

      24   of it, it's almost standard practice to find


                                                        13




       1   out what the origin of the fire is.

       2        Q    And did you actually go to the scene

       3   to look at the building?

       4        A    Yes.

       5        Q    And did you meet a representative of

       6   the insured there as well?

       7        A    Yes.

       8        Q    Do you know who that was, do you

       9   remember who that was?

      10        A    Mr. Clemens.

      11        Q    Randy?

      12        A    Without reviewing his emails,

      13   younger guy, met him on several occasions at

      14   the site.

      15        Q    All right.  And when you went in to

      16   the site, had a determination been made as to

      17   whether or not the entire building would be

      18   torn down?

      19        A    At my initial inspection, the fire

      20   marshal was there, and I spoke with him,

      21   referenced what they had done and what they

      22   were wanting.  And I made recommendations to

      23   Alex on site that we needed to bring a

      24   structural engineer in to look at the building


                                                        14




       1   to make an ascertation of what was

       2   rebuildable, what was not rebuildable, and

       3   what was structurally damaged and what wasn't.

       4        Q    And was in fact a structural

       5   engineer retained?

       6        A    I believe so, yes.

       7        Q    All right.  Let me show you a

       8   document that we marked earlier today as Hart

       9   Exhibit No. 2 and ask you if you have ever

      10   seen that before?

      11        A    Yes.

      12        Q    And what is that?

      13        A    That's the evaluation report

      14   provided by Charles Timbie, structural

      15   engineer, on his inspection of the property.

      16        Q    And was the purpose of that

      17   inspection to determine whether or not the

      18   entire structure had to be taken down?

      19        A    It was to look at the entire

      20   structure and determine what was structurally

      21   sound and what wasn't.

      22        Q    And what was your understanding of

      23   what his results were?

      24        A    Standing at the front of the


                                                        15




       1   building, basically about two-thirds of it to

       2   the right had been determined to be

       3   structurally unsound and would need to come

       4   down.  My best recollection, it was the last

       5   bay plus the interior wall and cement slab

       6   over in that area, plus the original cement

       7   slab I believe needed some repairs.

       8             But exterior walls, roof-wise,

       9   probably about two-thirds of the building, all

      10   of the exterior finish, all of the roof

      11   finish, all the insulation, all the interior

      12   drywall.

      13             And without looking at a diagram,

      14   there was one bay -- I believe there was four

      15   bays -- so the one bay where the fire started,

      16   the adjoining wall, part of the next wall.

      17   And I believe that left the exterior and

      18   interior wall of the last bay, again with the

      19   slab and framing.

      20        Q    Was there a determination made at

      21   some point to take the whole building down?

      22        A    That would have been the insured's

      23   decision.  I looked at it and valued it as a

      24   repairable building.

       1        Q    Okay.

       2                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to mark,

       3        if we could, as Bennett Exhibit 1 a

       4        handwritten diagram.

       8                       - - -

       9   BY MR. BLUM:

      10        Q    Mr. Bennett, do you recognize this

      11   handwritten diagram?

      12        A    It's not mine, I can tell you that.

      13        Q    That was the question, actually, so

      14   you got one step ahead of me, that's fine, you

      15   can put it aside.

      16             At some point were you asked to

      17   provide an estimate to repair and/or replace

      18   the building?

      19        A    I proceeded with the repairability

      20   estimate based on what the engineer had

      21   advised me needed was structurally unsound.

      22        Q    I'm going to show you a document

      23   which we marked as Exhibit 3 this morning and

      24   ask you if you can identify this for us?


                                                        17




       1        A    That's my email to Randy, Randy

       2   Clemens.

       3        Q    And what is it that is attached with

       4   your email?

       5        A    That's per my email, my preliminary

       6   estimate on the rebuild with an ACV

       7   replacement cost and actual cash value number.

       8        Q    Okay.  So can you tell me, is that

       9   the cost, is that estimate the cost to repair

      10   the building without the entire thing being

      11   torn down?

      12        A    Yes.

      13        Q    And did you at any time try to make

      14   an estimate of what the actual value of the

      15   building was the day before the fire took

      16   place?

      17        A    I don't believe I did a full

      18   valuation on the building, no.

      19        Q    Did you know, was anyone else asked

      20   to do that?

      21        A    Not that I'm aware of.

      22        Q    So can you tell me -- you mentioned

      23   several numbers, I just want to make sure

      24   we're all on the same wavelength -- there is


                                                        18




       1   various columns on that estimate, one of which

       2   is like, I think it's a cost per unit or unit

       3   cost?

       4        A    Correct.

       5        Q    Tell me what that, your intention of

       6   what that means, what does unit cost mean?

       7        A    That's numbers obtained from the

       8   Marshall Swift valuation program that I

       9   utilize to provide the estimate.  An example

      10   would be architectural fees, which generally

      11   is a percentage of the estimate, and it comes

      12   out to 33,500 for the architectural piece.

      13             Everything else represents, another

      14   example would be replace vinyl siding

      15   insulation, this is after the demolition,

      16   $1.52 a square foot, which includes labor and

      17   material.

      18        Q    So you mentioned a computer program,

      19   the Marshall Swift program, just tell us

      20   generally what that is?

      21        A    Marshall Swift is, basically it's a

      22   nationwide evaluation program that you can do

      23   building valuations on, from residential to

      24   any type of commercial.  You can also go in


                                                        19




       1   and utilize the unit features for individual

       2   building, for framing, for masonry, for

       3   insulation, for mechanical, and so forth.

       4   It's a recognized valuation program that it

       5   can also be used as a rebuild by the insurance

       6   industry and most contractors.

       7        Q    And so is that estimate that's

       8   sitting in front of you like a printout that

       9   came directly from that program?

      10        A    No.  This is my -- I input the

      11   numbers, I use a program called Simsol, which

      12   is an estimating program based off of National

      13   Construction Estimator price, plus additional

      14   pricing.  And as, which you didn't ask me

      15   about, part of what I do is I maintain the

      16   database for Simsol and updating and

      17   developing pricing.  The majority of that

      18   pricing is from National Construction

      19   Estimator, some of it utilizes RSMeans, which

      20   is another construction program.

      21             This type of building I pulled

      22   strictly all the numbers from the Marshall

      23   Swift and input them into my program, because

      24   I'm able to put square footages and room


                                                        20




       1   dimensions and then change the pricing to

       2   whichever program I'm utilizing.

       3        Q    So I just want to make sure I

       4   understand exactly everything you just said.

       5             So you went to the Marshall Swift

       6   program first?

       7        A    Marshall Swift, it's actually a

       8   manual, it's about longer than legal and about

       9   3 inches thick, and they do provide software

      10   that I can go in and pull the pricing out, but

      11   it's not really estimating -- it's for

      12   valuation and estimating purposes, but then

      13   you would have to either write it down or

      14   incorporate it, it's not an estimating

      15   software.

      16        Q    Okay.  So is it accurate then that

      17   you took some of the data from the Marshall

      18   Swift program, and tell me what you did with

      19   that data?

      20        A    All of the data was taken and all

      21   the pricing was taken from the Marshall Swift

      22   valuation program in the individual unit

      23   breakdowns as opposed to a square foot

      24   valuation.  Okay, yes.


                                                        21




       1             A little explanation:  Marshall

       2   Swift breaks it down.  You can do building

       3   valuations on a square foot with additions, or

       4   you can go in and actually do a complete

       5   rebuild estimate starting with your footers,

       6   your foundation, your slabs, whatever type of

       7   wall you're dealing with, masonry, your

       8   interior finish, your interior framing.  It's

       9   providing a detailed estimate.

      10             And all I did was take the numbers,

      11   the most current numbers from there, and

      12   incorporate them into my estimating program so

      13   that I could produce an estimate.

      14        Q    Okay.  So you took the data from the

      15   Marshall Swift, both the books and the

      16   program, and then you put that information

      17   into the estimating software that you used?

      18        A    Right.

      19        Q    Okay.  So the per unit costs that

      20   are listed there, are they from Marshall

      21   Swift?

      22        A    They're from Marshall Swift.

      23        Q    And then after the per unit cost

      24   there is an RCV number?


                                                        22




       1        A    Correct.

       2        Q    What does RCV stand for in this

       3   context?

       4        A    Replacement cost value.

       5        Q    What does that mean, what do you

       6   interpret that to mean?

       7        A    That's basically if something costs

       8   $5 a square foot today and you have 200 square

       9   feet, that would be roughly, what, $1,000 to

      10   replace at today's cost.

      11        Q    So is it taking the unit cost and

      12   applying it to what has to be done in this

      13   project?

      14        A    It's taking the unit cost and

      15   applying it to the square footage involved.

      16        Q    And then after that there is a

      17   column, I think it's labeled DEP.  What is

      18   that column?

      19        A    Depreciation.

      20        Q    What does depreciation have to do

      21   with in this context?

      22        A    Under -- every replacement cost

      23   policy, you can have a policy that is either

      24   on an actual cash value basis or on a


                                                        23




       1   replacement cost basis.  And under the loss

       2   payment clause of all replacement cost

       3   policies, the insured is entitled to the

       4   actual cash value of the loss at the time of

       5   the loss.  He can then make claim for the

       6   replacement cost, as long as he notifies the

       7   carrier within 180 days that he's going to

       8   make claim under the replacement cost.

       9             So the policy was a replacement cost

      10   policy, therefore I determined the replacement

      11   cost value.  I assessed depreciation, which is

      12   a combination of the condition of the building

      13   based on my site inspection as well as

      14   utilizing relative information provided by the

      15   Marshall Swift program as to what depreciation

      16   should be, based on the age.  But that all is,

      17   I want to say it's subjective, because it's

      18   based on the condition of the buildings.  You

      19   apply the depreciation to the replacement

      20   cost, and that gives you your depreciation

      21   amount.  So, in other words, if you have

      22   $100,000 loss and you're applying 20%

      23   depreciation, your depreciation amount would

      24   be $20,000.


                                                        24




       1        Q    Okay.  And so in the depreciation

       2   column, it is the amount of, like the amount

       3   of depreciation you took?

       4        A    Right.

       5        Q    Okay.  And tell me in this context

       6   with this loss, was there a percentage that

       7   you applied across the board of depreciation?

       8        A    I would have to go back and look at

       9   each individual number.  Within the program

      10   itself I'm able to go back and see what was

      11   applied.  Generally I'll look at an overall

      12   average and then I look at the individual

      13   materials.  If the interior finish is in good

      14   condition, it can range anywhere from 20 to 35

      15   or 40 percent.  Generally I don't go over 50%

      16   unless the building is completely dilapidated.

      17             This building was in good condition,

      18   so, again, without going into the internal

      19   program or doing some calculations here, I

      20   don't know if I applied an overall percentage

      21   across the board or whether I did it

      22   individually by trade or material.

      23        Q    And when you say go back and look in

      24   the program, which program are you referring


                                                        25




       1   to?

       2        A    The estimating program, Simsol that

       3   I ultimately put the prices in.

       4        Q    And what did you use or how did you

       5   determine what the original condition of this

       6   building was before the fire?

       7        A    You can look at a building after a

       8   fire and see what the exterior condition is,

       9   look in parts of the building where it's

      10   undamaged.  And generally the fire in that

      11   area just showed a lot of heavy smoke and you

      12   can tell whether the building's been

      13   maintained or not.

      14        Q    And what was your opinion at that

      15   time as to whether or not the building has

      16   been maintained?

      17        A    The building appeared to be in good

      18   condition, better than most.

      19        Q    So if you look at the last page,

      20   which is the summary of your estimate, the

      21   very back.

      22        A    All the way back?

      23        Q    Keep going all the way to the end,

      24   it's double-sided copy.  That page is an


                                                        26




       1   estimate summary for your entire estimate; is

       2   that correct?

       3        A    That's correct.

       4        Q    Okay.  And so the actual cash value

       5   for the repair came out to like 1.9 million;

       6   is that correct?

       7        A    That is correct.

       8        Q    Okay.

       9                  THE WITNESS:  Can I --

      10                  MR. GOGINENI:  If he asks the

      11        question.

      12   BY MR. BLUM:

      13        Q    Go ahead, were you going to explain

      14   something?

      15        A    Yeah.  This is the summary details

      16   where it's broken down by area group within

      17   the estimate, I had about six different

      18   groups.  You also find the totals of the

      19   estimate on Page 5 of the estimate, which is

      20   really the last page of the estimate, it gives

      21   you the summary amount there.

      22             The next two pages detail trade

      23   breakdown, that just breaks out the trade,

      24   does not include overhead, profits, and taxes,


                                                        27




       1   which is why you will have different numbers

       2   on the RCV, depreciation, and ACV.

       3             And then you get to the group

       4   detail, which when you go into the estimate

       5   starting on Page 1, you will find main

       6   building right is a grouping, which will go

       7   along with main building right here.  This

       8   totals each of the individual groups that I

       9   had for the building.

      10        Q    Okay.  And did you have a set of

      11   photographs that you took that went along with

      12   your initial review that led to this

      13   assessment?

      14        A    Oh, I probably had anywhere from 40

      15   to 100 overall photos at different times on

      16   different inspections.

      17        Q    Okay.  And when I gave you that

      18   email, the title, it's entitled that it's the

      19   preliminary estimate.  I personally have not

      20   seen any other estimates.  Do you know, was

      21   there any subsequent estimate to that one?

      22        A    No.  At that point I was in excess

      23   of the policy limits, based on these repair

      24   numbers, and any adjustments that would have


                                                        28




       1   been needed upwards would have still been in

       2   excess of the policy limits.

       3        Q    So I take it from your answer then,

       4   as far as you recall, there was never a need

       5   to go beyond the initial estimate?

       6        A    No.

       7        Q    And what, if anything, did you do in

       8   terms of monitoring whether or not the insured

       9   rebuilt the building and submitted claims for

      10   that rebuilding?

      11        A    Basically the insured advised me

      12   that they were going to just replace the

      13   entire building and rebuild it to suit their

      14   needs, which is his option.

      15             He then had to submit to me all of

      16   the expenses that were being incurred so I

      17   could review them, see what was covered under

      18   the policy, what wasn't covered under the

      19   policy, so I could insure that the full 2.3

      20   was expended in the replacement of the

      21   building.

      22        Q    When you say the full 2.3, what do

      23   you mean by that number?

      24        A    The 2.3 million and change was the


                                                        29




       1   policy limit.  My estimate was in excess of

       2   that.  As long as the insured expended the

       3   full 2.3 in excess of the policy limit, over

       4   the 2.4 -- my estimate, he would be entitled

       5   to recover the depreciation up to the policy

       6   limit.

       7        Q    And did you in fact follow the

       8   procedure and monitor the rebuilding and

       9   submitting those invoices?

      10        A    I didn't monitor, but Randy Clemens

      11   submitted to me all the invoices.  And then I

      12   proceeded and prepared spreadsheets on all the

      13   individual invoices from the main general

      14   contractor, the emergency services that were

      15   provided, as well as some of the

      16   subcontractors.

      17        Q    And what did you do with those

      18   spreadsheets?

      19        A    Provided them to the carrier.

      20        Q    Okay.  And just tell me generally

      21   what they look like, what would one of those

      22   spreadsheets look like?

      23        A    Basically Excel spreadsheets that

      24   start over with the general contractor, his


                                                        30




       1   totals, and then the breakdown.  And I had

       2   found where some subcontractor direct invoices

       3   provided to Randy were submitted to me

       4   previously, so they had to be deducted, you

       5   know, from -- I believe the general contractor

       6   was Fenster, I don't recall exactly.  But the

       7   GC was paying the subs direct, and Randy had

       8   actually submitted me some of the sub bids

       9   directly.  So they were duplicated within my

      10   spreadsheets and I made sure that there was no

      11   duplications, and that certain items that

      12   would not have been covered under the policy

      13   were not included within the totals.

      14        Q    Okay.  Do you have any examples of

      15   what those would be that would not have been

      16   covered?

      17        A    Excavation, land filling, striping

      18   of the parking lot, things like along those

      19   lines that were normally excluded under the

      20   policy.

      21        Q    And what else, if anything, did you

      22   do in the adjustment of this loss?

      23        A    Worked with Randy on his loss of

      24   income claim.


                                                        31




       1        Q    And tell me what was the loss of

       2   income claim?

       3        A    The amount?

       4        Q    No.  What was the basis of the loss

       5   of income?

       6        A    Clemens, the dry cleaning

       7   operations, occupied I want to say probably

       8   60% of the building, and I believe there was

       9   one other tenant-occupied area.  So the lease

      10   for the one tenant was obtained in order to

      11   ascertain the rent that was being charged by

      12   the dry cleaning.  They provided financial

      13   records showing what was being internally paid

      14   for the rent space, as well as the CAM

      15   adjustments, which would have been the charges

      16   for prorated taxes based on the amount of

      17   square footage being occupied by the tenant,

      18   maintenance, things like that that fall within

      19   the CAM.

      20             So you spread that out over the time

      21   period of 12 months along with the CAM

      22   adjustments, which the history was on the full

      23   taxes, and the taxes were actually dropped

      24   after the fire, so we had to wait for the


                                                        32




       1   revised or new tax bill.

       2             And so those amounts were adjusted

       3   and that was determined to be the loss of

       4   income under the terms of the policy for the

       5   12 months, and then there was a 60-day

       6   extension beyond that.

       7        Q    All right.  And what was your

       8   involvement, did you verify all that or how

       9   did you -- what was your personal part in

      10   taking care of that?

      11        A    Oh, I had the lease and verified the

      12   payments and verified the tax bills and then

      13   put together the spreadsheets.

      14        Q    And was that a spreadsheet that,

      15   again, you provided to the insurance company?

      16        A    Yes.

      17        Q    And I just want to make sure I

      18   understand.  So did the insurance company

      19   reimburse the insured for the full payment of

      20   the lease, the full amount of the lease?

      21        A    It would have been per my

      22   spreadsheet calculation.  As I said, the

      23   rental portion pretty much stayed the same for

      24   the 12 months, that's set.


                                                        33




       1        Q    Right.

       2        A    The CAM was adjusted according to

       3   what the new taxes were, which reflected a

       4   drop over the previous year, so obviously the

       5   taxes were dropped by the local borough or

       6   officials once the building was destroyed or

       7   damaged.

       8             So the loss of income included the

       9   lease amounts from the dry cleaners as well as

      10   the one tenant -- and I'm going from memory --

      11   along with the CAM because that was paid in

      12   addition to the base lease amount.  And that

      13   amount was figured for 12 months.  And then

      14   for the additional 60 days, I believe there

      15   was a 35% calculation.  The 60 days under the

      16   policy is provided from when the building is

      17   substantially built or the stock is

      18   replenished so that you can reopen.  It gives

      19   the insured an additional 60 days to get back

      20   up to full.

      21             Clemens Dry Cleaners had basically

      22   occupied about, I want to say 65%, and there

      23   was still 10% undone, I'd have to look at my

      24   reports.  But they occupied a percentage,


                                                        34




       1   there was a percentage still being done.  So

       2   in order to conclude the claim for the

       3   additional 60 days, it was agreed on a 35%

       4   loss for those next two months.  And then that

       5   closed down the claim.

       6        Q    Just so I understand what your

       7   answer is, that 35% you quoted, or if it's 30,

       8   whichever it was, was a number that you

       9   negotiated with Clemens?

      10        A    Basically it's, you take what

      11   they're losing, and if they were losing 10,000

      12   a month in leases and the percentage was 30 or

      13   35, 30% of 10,000 would have been $3,000 for

      14   each of the 60-day period.

      15        Q    I'm just trying to get to, how did

      16   you get to that percentage?

      17        A    I looked at what percentage of the

      18   building they were occupying and using to run

      19   their operations, the percentage, approximate

      20   percentage of the building that was yet to be

      21   completed, so, and what would have been

      22   available for rent had they rebuilt the same

      23   building.

      24        Q    Okay.  And just so I'm clear, in the


                                                        35




       1   way this coverage was written, there was no

       2   attempt by the insurance company to deduct

       3   from the income amount that was reimbursed the

       4   amount of money that was saved by them by not

       5   operating the building?

       6        A    No.  Each of the tenants, the dry

       7   cleaning was separate from the owner, okay?

       8   So the tenants were responsible for the

       9   utilities, as I remember correctly.  So the

      10   only savings to the building would have been

      11   any reduction in property taxes and so forth.

      12   Had the building been vacant, he would have

      13   incurred additional utility expenses.  So in

      14   my estimation there was no reduction in

      15   expenses other than the property taxes had

      16   been reduced.

      17        Q    Okay.

      18        A    And there was no management company

      19   involved, payments were made direct to the

      20   named insured on the building.  So therefore

      21   there was no management fee to reduce the

      22   amount of the rent spot.

      23        Q    Okay.  Was there anything else that

      24   you recall doing in the adjustment of the loss


                                                        36




       1   for this fire?

       2        A    Other than, I met with the

       3   engineers, met with the cause and origin

       4   people, met with the fire marshal, met with

       5   the insured on various occasions, and did

       6   several inspections and followup inspections

       7   on the rebuild, so.

       8        Q    And other than hiring the experts

       9   for the cause and origin investigation, what

      10   other involvement did you have, if any, in

      11   that investigation?

      12        A    As far as trying to make a

      13   determination of the cause?

      14        Q    Yes.

      15        A    None.

      16        Q    Were you present for any of the

      17   inspections that were done by the cause and

      18   origin investigators?

      19        A    The initial inspection, I believe he

      20   was there the very first day.  And then I was

      21   there subsequently when I believe

      22   representatives from Mercedes were there.

      23   There were several people, I had signed in on

      24   the log just to basically look at what they


                                                        37




       1   were doing, but then to do what I needed to do

       2   on the building.

       3        Q    All right.  And when the Mercedes

       4   people were there, did you have any discussion

       5   with them at all?

       6        A    Not that I recall.

       7        Q    And have you ever had any discussion

       8   with any representatives of Mercedes --

       9        A    No.

      10        Q    Let me finish my question.

      11             -- about the fire?

      12        A    Not that I recall.

      13        Q    And have you been present for any

      14   inspections of the Mercedes vehicle that was

      15   involved in the fire?

      16        A    After it was removed?

      17        Q    Correct.

      18        A    No.

      19        Q    Have you participated in any

      20   meetings where there were representatives of

      21   various insurance companies who got together

      22   to discuss this loss?

      23        A    No.

      24        Q    And other than Mr. Timbie, were


                                                        38




       1   there any other engineers that you hired on

       2   behalf or recommended to Millers on their

       3   behalf about this investigation?

       4        A    I don't recall any others being

       5   recommended by me.

       6        Q    And is there anything else you

       7   recall doing in the adjustment of this loss?

       8        A    I don't recall anything else, no.

       9                  MR. BLUM:  Give me one second,

      10        I have a couple documents I'm going to

      19   BY MR. BLUM:

      20        Q    Mr. Bennett, I'm showing you a

      21   document which was produced by Millers, and

      22   ask you if you recognize what this document

      23   is?

      24        A    It's an email from me to Randy


                                                        39




       1   Clemens.

       2        Q    Okay.  And I assume from the look of

       3   it that someone at the insurance copy, Alex

       4   Hart, was also copied; correct?

       5        A    Alex Hart with the insurance

       6   company, and I don't recognize the

       7   Clugstonk@univest.

       8        Q    And what was the purpose of this

       9   email?

      10        A    This was in reference to a

      11   spreadsheet that I put together some time

      12   around October 2017, where I highlighted items

      13   and basically summarized what the spreadsheet

      14   was reflecting regarding review of invoices

      15   that had been submitted by Randy.

      16        Q    And do you know, was this October 3,

      17   2017, at a point where you were basically

      18   attempting to close out the payments that were

      19   being made by the insurance company?

      20        A    This was where we were -- I was

      21   reviewing invoices to verify expenditures that

      22   would have been in excess of the ACV payment

      23   that was made to ascertain how much additional

      24   Randy would be entitled to under the policy up


                                                        40




       1   to the policy limit.

       2        Q    And do you know when those issues

       3   were resolved in terms of like the final

       4   payments that were made?

       5        A    I believe with my final report, I

       6   believe my final report was some time in

       7   January of 2018.  And it may have been

       8   resolved between this October email and that

       9   period of time.

      10        Q    Tell me what that final report would

      11   have looked like, just generally?

      12        A    Pardon?

      13        Q    What would your final report have

      14   looked like?

      15        A    I know it was incorrectly labeled as

      16   the second report, but it was dated January

      17   and it reflected, I believe, the final

      18   additional payment that would be needed under

      19   the building to bring out the full payment on

      20   the building.  And I may have also concluded

      21   the rents at the same time.  I don't recall

      22   without looking at the report.

      23                  MR. BLUM:  I have no further

      24        questions.

       3                       - - -

       4   BY MR. GARBARINO:

       5        Q    Hi, just briefly a few questions.

       6             During your work in this loss did

       7   you ever talk to any representative or

       8   individual from Bergey's Leasing or the

       9   company that leased the vehicle?

      10        A    No.

      11        Q    Did Mr. Clemens ever tell you why

      12   they wanted to tear the building down?

      13        A    I recall discussions regarding it

      14   would be better to, at this time, with this

      15   extended damage, and with the dry cleaning

      16   business needing additional space to move the

      17   dry cleaning operations into the building and

      18   have it renovated to more specifically fit the

      19   dry cleaning business as opposed to leasing

      20   out to individual tenants.

      21        Q    Okay.  And I know you said that

      22   generally sometimes you will see if there's

      23   any subrogation issues when you get hired by

      24   Millers.  Do you remember if you made any


                                                        42




       1   recommendations about subrogation in regards

       2   to this loss?

       3        A    I can give you in general how that

       4   works.  I don't recall specifically on this

       5   particular claim.  When the origin and cause

       6   gives me have an approximate or gives me a

       7   verbal as to the cause, and it appears it may

       8   be something that needs further investigation

       9   for potential subrogation, then I would

      10   recommend passing along that information to

      11   the carrier.

      12             On this particular case I believe

      13   everybody, the cause and origin was reporting

      14   direct to a counsel that had been enlisted, a

      15   subrogation counsel, which is almost standard

      16   practice on any loss of any specific size,

      17   just to get subrogation counsel involved early

      18   on to make sure that all steps that he needs

      19   are covered.

      20                  MR. GARBARINO:  That's all the

      21        questions I have.  Thank you.

      22                  MR. SLATTERY:  No questions.

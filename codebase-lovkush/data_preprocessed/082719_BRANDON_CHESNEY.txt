          16   BY MR. KAPLAN:

          17   Q.     Sir, can you state your name for the

          18   record, please.

          19   A.     Brandon Chesney.

          20   Q.     Mr. Chesney, my name is John Kaplan.

          21   I'm going to be taking your deposition.

          22          Have you ever had your deposition

          23   taken before?

          24   A.     I have not.

                                                            6



           1   Q.     It would be a question-and-answer

           2   session in front of a court reporter where

           3   you were asked questions by an attorney under

           4   oath?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     I kind of summarized what it is.  It's

           7   a question-and-answer session in front of a

           8   court reporter.  You're under oath.  The

           9   court reporter's job is to take down

          10   everything that's said in the room, but she

          11   can only taken down the spoken word.

          12          In response to a question, it's okay

          13   if you make a gesture, nod your head, shrug

          14   your shoulders, but you also have to say

          15   something.

          16   A.     Okay.

          17   Q.     The court reporter can only take down

          18   one person speaking at a time.  I would ask

          19   that you let me finish my entire question

          20   before you respond, and I'll do my best not

          21   the interrupt your response with the next

          22   question, okay?

          23   A.     Okay.

          24   Q.     That's even if you anticipate what I'm

                                                            7



           1   going to ask you.  Let me ask it.

           2   A.     Okay.

           3   Q.     Another reason is, even if you

           4   anticipate or think you know what I'm going

           5   to ask you, you might actually be incorrect,

           6   so let me ask the entire question, okay?

           7   A.     Okay.

           8   Q.     I'm looking for your best recollection

           9   of events, not a guess.  If I ask you a

          10   question and you don't know the answer or you

          11   don't remember, just tell me that you don't

          12   know or you don't remember, okay?

          13   A.     Okay.

          14   Q.     I don't think you're going to be here

          15   all that long, but if for any reason you want

          16   to take a break, just say so.  We'll take a

          17   break.

          18          The only thing I would ask is that, if

          19   there is a question pending when you want to

          20   take a break, that you respond to that

          21   question, okay?

          22   A.     Okay.

          23   Q.     You are represented by counsel here at

          24   this deposition.  During the course of the

                                                            8



           1   deposition, you might hear your lawyer say

           2   objection, object to the form, or something

           3   else.

           4          If your lawyer says something, just

           5   stop, and your lawyer and I will discuss and

           6   hopefully resolve or work out any issue that

           7   might come up.  Then your lawyer will given

           8   you an instruction, okay?

           9   A.     Okay.

          10   Q.     If you don't hear a question that I

          11   ask you, tell me.  I'll repeat it.  If you

          12   don't understand what it is that I'm asking

          13   you, tell me, and I'll rephrase the question.

          14          Do you understand those instructions?

          15   A.     I do.

          16   Q.     If you respond to a question, I'm

          17   going to assume you heard and understand it.

          18   It's very important that you say something if

          19   you do not hear or understand me.

          20   A.     Okay.

          21   Q.     How old are you, sir?

          22   A.     41.

          23   Q.     Are you employed at the present time?

          24   A.     I am.

                                                            9



           1   Q.     What do you do for a living?

           2   A.     I do HR consulting, human resources

           3   consulting.

           4   Q.     Who do you currently work for?

           5   A.     A company called Facility Support

           6   Company.

           7   Q.     You consult for them?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     I forgot to tell you.  Sometimes we

          10   say uh-uh and uh-huh.  We all understand what

          11   you're saying, but it's my understanding it's

          12   spelled the same way.  When we look at the

          13   transcript, we're not going to know what you

          14   were saying.  If you do that, I'm going to

          15   say is that a yes, is that a no.

          16   A.     Okay.

          17   Q.     Are you self-employed?  Are you an

          18   independent contractor?

          19   A.     Not an independent contractor.  I just

          20   consult.  I consult through a third-party

          21   company.  I do human resources consulting for

          22   a third-party company.

          23   Q.     Are you an employee of that

          24   third-party company?

                                                           10



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     What is that third-party company?

           3   A.     It's called Facility Support Company.

           4   Q.     Do you recall being involved in a

           5   motor vehicle accident on April 30th of 2017?

           6   A.     I do.

           7   Q.     Do you recall where that accident

           8   occurred?

           9   A.     It was on Harbison Avenue.  I recall

          10   Harbison Avenue.

          11   Q.     Do you recall approximately what time

          12   of day the accident occurred?

          13   A.     I do not, I'm sorry.  I think it was

          14   around 7:00 p.m., between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m.

          15   Q.     At that time, was it dark out?

          16   A.     I believe so, yes.

          17   Q.     Do you recall what the weather

          18   conditions were like?

          19   A.     I do not.

          20   Q.     You said it was on Harbison Avenue.

          21          Are you able to give me some idea

          22   where on Harbison Avenue?

          23   A.     Harbison and Cheltenham would be, I

          24   believe, the cross street.

                                                           11



           1   Q.     Did the accident actually occur at an

           2   intersection?

           3   A.     Feet before the intersection, I

           4   believe.

           5   Q.     How many?

           6   A.     I don't recall.

           7   Q.     Another instruction I forgot to give

           8   you is there might be questions that call for

           9   some kind of measurement; time, distance,

          10   speed, something of that nature.  If you're

          11   able to give an exact response, please do so.

          12   If you can't but you feel that you're able to

          13   estimate or approximate, you are allowed to

          14   do so.  Just let me know that you're

          15   estimating or approximating.

          16   A.     Okay.

          17   Q.     With that instruction in mind, you are

          18   unable to estimate or approximate how far you

          19   were from the intersection with Cheltenham

          20   Avenue when the accident occurred?

          21   A.     I don't have an exact estimation.  I

          22   could estimate it was maybe one block away,

          23   within the block of my left-hand turn to

          24   Cheltenham Avenue.

                                                           12



           1   Q.     Where were you coming from?

           2   A.     I was coming from center city

           3   Philadelphia.

           4   Q.     If the accident had not occurred,

           5   where were you intending to go?

           6   A.     Home.

           7   Q.     Was it your intention that when you

           8   reached Cheltenham Avenue you were going to

           9   make a left-hand turn?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     Harbison Avenue, as you approach the

          12   intersection with Cheltenham Avenue, is it a

          13   one-way or two-way street?

          14   A.     It's a two way, and then both are

          15   two-way streets.  The left-hand turn is a

          16   two-way street, and Harbison Avenue is a

          17   two-way street.

          18   Q.     I think what I asked you is Harbison

          19   Avenue a two-way street?

          20   A.     Correct, yes.

          21   Q.     How many lanes are there to drive in

          22   on Harbison Avenue as you approach

          23   Cheltenham?

          24   A.     Two.

           1   Q.     A total of four?

           2   A.     Correct.

           3   Q.     Two heading in the direction you're

           4   going and two heading in the opposite

           5   direction?

           6   A.     Correct.

           7   Q.     The vehicle that you were driving,

           8   what was the year, make, and model?

           9   A.     2004 Nissan Maxima.

          10   Q.     Was that your vehicle?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Was it in good working order?  What I

          13   mean by that is, were the brakes, headlights,

          14   steering, horn, all working properly as far

          15   as you know?

          16   A.     As far as I know.  I know I did have a

          17   donut on the vehicle.  There was a donut.  I

          18   had jut gotten a flat prior to that accident.

          19   I had AAA come out and change my tire, and

          20   then I proceeded on my way home.

          21   Q.     You had actually had a flat tire right

          22   before the accident?

          23   A.     Correct, yes.

          24   Q.     I know you said you were going home

                                                           14



           1   when the accident occurred.

           2          Did you have to be at home at any

           3   particular time?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     Was there anybody waiting for you at

           6   home?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     Was there anybody with you in the

           9   vehicle at the time of the accident?

          10   A.     No.

          11   Q.     The intersection of Harbison and

          12   Cheltenham, is that controlled by a traffic

          13   light, sign, any other traffic control

          14   devices?

          15   A.     A light.  It's controlled by a traffic

          16   light.

          17   Q.     Now, you mentioned that you had a

          18   donut on your vehicle.

          19          Do you happen to recall which tire

          20   that would have been?

          21   A.     I believe it was the front left.

          22   Q.     As far as you know, did having a donut

          23   on the front left wheel of your vehicle

          24   contribute in any way to this accident?

                                                           15



           1   A.     I'm not sure if that contributed to

           2   the accident.

           3   Q.     Why don't you pick it up when you're

           4   on Harbison.  Tell me what happened.

           5   A.     I don't remember much because I

           6   believe I was concussed right as the accident

           7   happened.  I don't recall seeing the car in

           8   front of me.  I just don't remember much from

           9   the accident itself.

          10          I do recall just heading home and then

          11   the accident happened and I was just very

          12   disoriented.  I believe I may have hit my

          13   head and was concussed.  That's pretty much

          14   all I remember.

          15   Q.     Were you in the right-hand or

          16   left-hand lane when the accident occurred?

          17   A.     I believe I was in the left-hand lane

          18   because I usually take the left-hand lane to

          19   get onto Cheltenham.  Again, I don't

          20   remember, so I shouldn't guess, I apologize.

          21   Q.     In the accident itself, do you recall

          22   that you struck a vehicle in front of you in

          23   the rear?

          24   A.     Not at the moment, not at the present

                                                           16



           1   moment.  Again, I was disoriented.  After a

           2   few minutes, I realized things weren't -- I

           3   was incoherent.  After that, I pulled over to

           4   see what was what, to see what was going on.

           5   At that moment, I realized something wasn't

           6   right.

           7               MR. MANARA:  I think the question

           8   was do you recall being in an accident.

           9               THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I apologize.

          10   BY MR. KAPLAN:

          11   Q.     Where you struck a vehicle in front of

          12   you in the rear?

          13   A.     Yes.  Not immediately, but, yes,

          14   shortly thereafter.

          15   Q.     Was your vehicle damaged as a result

          16   of the accident?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Where was the damage to your vehicle?

          19   A.     It was in the front left end, I

          20   believe.  I don't remember.  I took

          21   photographs.

          22   Q.     You did?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24               MR. KAPLAN:  Were those supplied?

                                                           17



           1               MR. MANARA:  Should have been.

           2   I'd be happy to send them again.

           3               MR. KAPLAN:  If you could, resend

           4   them.

           5               MR. MANARA:  Of course.

           6   BY MR. KAPLAN:

           7   Q.     You said you believe and then you said

           8   you don't remember and then you said you took

           9   pictures.

          10          As you sit here today, do you recall

          11   where the damage was to your vehicle?

          12   A.     Again, I believe it was the front left

          13   end.

          14   Q.     Let me just stop you there.  Let's

          15   start with the front.

          16          When you say the front, are you

          17   talking about the part of the vehicle where

          18   the head lights are?

          19   A.     Correct, yes.

          20   Q.     Then you used left, so are you

          21   talking --

          22   A.     Driver's side.

          23   Q.     You're talking about the front of the

          24   vehicle, but the left side of the front of

                                                           18



           1   the vehicle?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     The head lights or head light on the

           4   left side of the front of the vehicle, were

           5   they damaged at all?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Were they broken?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Was the front bumper damaged, broken,

          10   bent?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     What other damage, do you recall?

          13   A.     That's it.  That's the only damage I

          14   recall.

          15   Q.     The front headlight was broken; the

          16   front bumper was damaged?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Was there any damage to the front

          19   hood?

          20   A.     I don't think the hood was damaged.

          21   It could have been.  Again, it's been a while

          22   so I don't remember the condition of the car

          23   following the accident.

          24   Q.     Was the vehicle drivable from the

                                                           19



           1   scene?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     Where did you drive it to?

           4   A.     Home.

           5   Q.     Did your airbag deploy?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     Did you report the accident to your

           8   insurance company?

           9   A.     I did not.

          10   Q.     You never did?

          11   A.     No.

          12   Q.     Any reason why not?

          13   A.     Honestly, I really didn't know what

          14   happened, so I was just going to pay for it

          15   myself.  I was going to pay for my damage

          16   myself.  Then I did talk to the insurance

          17   company and we went through the details of

          18   the accident.

          19   Q.     You did report it to your insurance

          20   company?

          21   A.     I did not report.  I believe someone

          22   saw my license plate.  I got out of the car

          23   to exchange information and that type of

          24   stuff, but the person I was trying to speak

                                                           20



           1   to would not speak to me.  At that point, I

           2   didn't know what was going on.

           3          Again, I pulled over to discuss what

           4   happened and that type of thing, and the

           5   person I spoke to just would not speak to me.

           6   Q.     Did the police come to the scene of

           7   the accident?

           8   A.     I do not recall.

           9   Q.     You approached the driver of the other

          10   vehicle that was involved in the accident and

          11   that person did not want to speak to you?

          12   A.     Correct.  Following the accident, I

          13   pulled over to a safe spot, and I got out of

          14   the car to figure out what happened because I

          15   was still disoriented.

          16          I remember trying to communicate to

          17   someone who was actually there.  I tried to

          18   communicate to the person, and the person

          19   just would not say a word.

          20   Q.     The person that you tried to

          21   communicate with, was that the person that

          22   was the driver of the vehicle involved in the

          23   accident?

          24   A.     At that point, I did not know.

                                                           21



           1   Q.     Did you ever come to learn one way or

           2   another who that person was that you

           3   approached?

           4   A.     Through the lawsuit, I guess that was

           5   not the person.

           6   Q.     That was not the person?

           7   A.     Correct.

           8   Q.     Do you have any idea who the person

           9   was that you approached but did not speak to

          10   you?

          11   A.     No, I have no idea.

          12   Q.     What was the last thing that you

          13   remember before the impact occurred?

          14   A.     I remember coming off of 95 and just

          15   heading on my way home.  Then at that point I

          16   don't remember the collision or anything.  I

          17   don't remember any collision or anything like

          18   that.

          19   Q.     You don't remember any impact between

          20   your vehicle and another vehicle occurring on

          21   Harbison Avenue?

          22   A.     Correct.

          23   Q.     On April 30, 2017?

          24   A.     Correct.

                                                           22



           1   Q.     Have you ever consulted with a

           2   physician?

           3   A.     I did not.

           4   Q.     Has your memory of the events of that

           5   evening improved at all since the date of the

           6   accident?

           7   A.     Has my memory improved?

           8   Q.     In other words, have any memories of

           9   that accident started to come back to you

          10   since the date of the accident up until the

          11   time we're sitting here now?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     You said that you didn't report it to

          14   your insurance company, but you had a

          15   conversation with your insurance company?

          16   A.     Right.

          17   Q.     Did somebody else contact your

          18   insurance company?

          19   A.     I believe so.  The insurance company

          20   contacted me.

          21   Q.     You were called by your insurance

          22   company?

          23   A.     Correct.

          24   Q.     Did you speak to a representative from

                                                           23



           1   your insurance company over the phone?

           2   A.     I did.

           3   Q.     Did that representative ever tell you

           4   that he or she was recording the

           5   conversation?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Have you ever seen a transcript of

           8   that recorded conversation?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10               MR. KAPLAN:  Counsel, is there a

          11   copy of that transcript?

          12               MR. MANARA:  I can get you one,

          13   yeah.  It was all passed with the photographs

          14   and everything on the 24th.  I'm happy to

          15   resend.

          16               MR. KAPLAN:  It was sent to us?

          17               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          18               MR. KAPLAN:  How was it sent,

          19   mail or via e-mail?

          20               MR. MANARA:  E-mail.

          21               MR. KAPLAN:  To who?

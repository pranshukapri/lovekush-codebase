            1       Q.  Do you have a middle name?

            2       A.  I have it.  I don't use it.  I only use middle

            3  initial.

            4       Q.  And what is that initial?

            5       A.  H.

            6       Q.  H.

            7                And what does H stand for, sir?

            8       A.  It's my grandfather's name.  The name would be

            9  Hermegenildo.

           10       Q.  Can you spell that for me, please.

           11                THE INTERPRETER:  Yes, sir.  Let me write

           12  it first.  Here it is, sir.  H-E-R-M-E-G-E-N-I-L-D-O.

           13       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  I can see why you go by the

           14  letter H.

           15                MR. BICKHAM:  Me too.

           16       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Are you known by any

           17  other name besides Martin?

           18       A.  Just Martin.

           19       Q.  Okay.  Do you have any nicknames or anything

           20  like that?

           21       A.  No.  Not that I know of.

           22       Q.  Mr. Arredondo, my name is Frank Newton, and I

           23  represent the defendant in this case.  And I'm opposite

           24  you in this matter.

           25                Do you understand that, sir?

            1                MR. BICKHAM:  So sorry.

            2                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

            3                MR. BICKHAM:  Thank you.  Sorry about that.

            4                MR. NEWTON:  No problem at all.

            5                MR. BICKHAM:  Promise I'm not trying to

            6  disrupt you.

            7                MR. NEWTON:  At least you didn't get it on

            8  the keys there.

            9                MR. BICKHAM:  That's why I had to throw

           10  away my old bottles.

           11                MR. NEWTON:  Court reporter freak out.

           12                MR. BICKHAM:  All right.  Sorry about that.

           13                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  No problem at all.

           14       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Sir, you had a chance

           15  to sit in during your brother's deposition, Juan,

           16  correct?

           17       A.  Correct.

           18       Q.  So you had a chance to hear some of the

           19  questions that would be asked him and some of the

           20  answers he gave, right?

           21       A.  That's right.

           22       Q.  And you were sitting next to your attorney,

           23  Mr. Bickham here, during the deposition, correct?

           24       A.  Correct.

           25       Q.  Now before the deposition of your brother that

                                                                       7



            1  you sat in with this morning and early afternoon, had

            2  you attended any other deposition?

            3       A.  No.

            4       Q.  Have you ever given testimony in trial?

            5       A.  No.

            6       Q.  Have you ever given testimony in any kind of

            7  tribunal or hearing?

            8       A.  No.

            9       Q.  Okay.  So since this is your first time to give

           10  sworn testimony, let me cover a few ground rules with

           11  you.  You understand, sir, you've just been placed under

           12  oath by the court reporter?

           13       A.  I understand.

           14       Q.  And do you understand, sir, that it requires

           15  you to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but

           16  the truth?

           17       A.  I understand.

           18       Q.  Do you understand that it carries with it, this

           19  oath that you took, the same pains and penalties for

           20  perjury as if you were testifying in open court?

           21       A.  I understand.

           22       Q.  Also, sir, just like I said to your brother

           23  earlier, when we started this morning, it's important

           24  that you let me finish my question before you begin your

           25  answer.  Okay?  And if you remember also to give an oral

                                                                       8



            1  response, say yes, no, I don't know, or give your

            2  responses in verbal speak as opposed to shrugging your

            3  shoulders or nodding your head or something of that

            4  sort.  Okay?

            5       A.  I understand.

            6       Q.  Okay.  Because if you don't do that, we're not

            7  going to have your intended clear testimony on the

            8  record.  And that's what we're trying to do today.

            9       A.  I understand.

           10       Q.  And we have an interpreter here to your right

           11  who, like with your brother Juan, will be translating

           12  for you and will assist you in this process.  Okay?

           13       A.  I understand.

           14       Q.  Do you speak any English?

           15       A.  Yes.

           16       Q.  Are you able to give this deposition without

           17  the benefit of an interpreter?

           18       A.  No.

           19       Q.  Do you read English?

           20       A.  Some.

           21       Q.  How old are you?

           22       A.  I'll be 60 in November.

           23       Q.  So November, 2019, you'll be 60 years old?

           24       A.  That is correct.

           25       Q.  What's your date of birth, please.

                                                                       9



            1       A.  11/21/59.

            3       A.  In Salamanca, Guanajuato, Mexico.

            4       Q.  And when did you come to the United States?

            5       A.  In 1977.

            6       Q.  Are you a US citizen?

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  When did you become a US citizen?

            9       A.  I don't know the exact date, but it's about --

           10  been around 20 years.

           11       Q.  About 20 years ago?

           12       A.  Give or take a few.

           13       Q.  Okay.  Do you have a Texas driver's license?

           14                THE WITNESS:  (In Spanish) Si.

           15       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  May I see it, please.

           16                MR. NEWTON:  Thank you, sir.

           17                Let the record reflect the witness has

           18  handed me his Texas driver's license.

           19       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Can you give me your current

            1  specific to Kuraray before you started working there?

            2       A.  It was a rule that I had to do it.

            3       Q.  And you did it, and you had to take a test and

            4  pass it, right?

            5       A.  That is correct.

            6       Q.  And you learned in that safety training that if

            7  you saw any unsafe condition anywhere where you were

            8  working, you had the authority to stop the job, right?

            9       A.  That's correct.

           10       Q.  Did you ever stop work, stop a job anywhere at

           11  Kuraray?

           12       A.  No.

           16       Q.  And where was that?

           17       A.  Different companies throughout time.  I don't

           18  recall the names of the companies.  For example, when

           19  they're welding and there's sparks apply flying out and

           20  there is a can of paint, I stop them until I move to a

           21  safer place the can of paint.

           22       Q.  Because you recognize that to be a possible

           23  safety hazard, right?

           24       A.  Correct.  That is what I learn at the training

           25  school where I go to.

                                                                      24



            1       Q.  Okay.  Also, in safety training you learned if

            2  there was an emergency where you were working how you

            3  should go to the muster point, right?

            4       A.  Yeah.  They explain that constantly to us.

            5       Q.  Okay.  And that would be for every specific

            6  place you've worked they would tell you where your

            7  muster point was, right?

            8       A.  Yes.  Because sometimes we move from area for

            9  different areas, and they tell us specifically where to

           10  go to.

           11       Q.  But different plants, too, for every specific

           12  plant you worked at, they would give you a different

           13  muster point, right?

           14       A.  That is correct.

           15       Q.  And they would tell you that if there's an

           16  emergency, you should walk to your muster point,

           17  correct?

           18       A.  Correct.

           19       Q.  And you would do that any time there was an

           20  emergency anywhere you were working, right?

           21       A.  Correct.

           22       Q.  Have you ever been disciplined or punished in

           23  any way or for any kind regarding any kind of safety

           24  violation or safety rule that you didn't follow?

           25       A.  Honestly, yes.  When I'm not wearing any ear

                                                                      25



            1  plugs, they remind me to put them on.

            2       Q.  And where was this where you got in trouble for

            3  not wearing your ear plugs?

            4       A.  I don't remember the name of the company, but

            5  it's an example of what has happened.

            6       Q.  Okay.  Any other examples you can think of

            7  where you've been written up or disciplined for some

            8  kind of safety violation?

           13       Q.  So you don't have a mortgage?

           14       A.  No.  I'm sorry.  I have a home equity on my

           15  house, and I pay a monthly fee for that.

            4       A.  7927 Glencrest.  I'm not sure about the number;

           10       Q.  And why was that?

           11       A.  Cataract.

           12       Q.  Just your left eye?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  Any other surgery on your body besides to your

           24       A.  I had a meniscus damaged.

           25       Q.  How did you hurt your knee?

            2       Q.  Did you fall off a scaffold?

            3       A.  I put a roller table, and it got twisted.

            4       Q.  You twisted your knee working on a scaffolding?

            5       A.  That is correct.

            6       Q.  Other than that, have you ever been hurt on the

            9       Q.  Have you ever been diagnosed with any kind of

           13       Q.  Ever file a Workers' Compensation claim?

           14       A.  I'm not familiar with that, but it's probable

           15  that when I had the event with my knee, I probably had

           16  some of that.

           17       Q.  Other than the possible Workers' Compensation

           18  claim back in 1990 or '91 with your knee, have you ever

           19  filed a Workers' Compensation claim before that you can

           20  recall?

           21       A.  I had an accident.  I had an explosion of an

           22  argon tank.  A gauge blew up.  And if I didn't mention

           23  it privately, I didn't have time to answer that.  The

           24  question didn't -- didn't arise.

           25       Q.  Okay.  A gauge blew up in an explosion?

                                                                      34

            2       Q.  And when was that?

            3       A.  I'm not quite sure, but it's between 2000,

            4  2004.

            5       Q.  And where did that take place?

            6       A.  Valero, in Texas City.

            7       Q.  Valero plant in Texas City?

            8       A.  That is correct.

            9       Q.  And how were you injured?  How were you hurt?

           10       A.  Blew up near my face.  It affected my hearing

           11  because I hear a buzz.

           12       Q.  Have you heard a buzz in your years ever since

           13  then?

           14       A.  Most of the time.  Yes.

           15       Q.  Were you wearing your ear plugs at the time of

           16  the explosion in Texas City?

           17       A.  Yes.  I was wearing everything.  My glasses, my

           18  helmet, and my ear plugs.

           19       Q.  Okay.  Besides hurting your ears, what other

           20  part of your body was hurt when the gauge blew up?

           21       A.  Not -- no other parts.

           22       Q.  Just your hearing?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  Were you cut any place on your face?

           25       A.  It cut me here one piece -- a piece of the

                                                                      35



            1  gauge when it exploded.

            2       Q.  Glass cut you on the left cheek?

            3       A.  The gauges have a plastic part and --

            4       Q.  Which plastic part?

            5       A.  -- that plastic part flew and hit me like that.

            6       Q.  Okay.  Did you have to have stitches?

            7       A.  It wasn't needed.

            8       Q.  Okay.  Besides a cut to your left cheek of your

            9  face and affecting your hearing, any other injuries when

           10  that gauge exploded?

           11       A.  No.

           12       Q.  And you think you may have filed a Workers'

           13  Compensation claim for that?

           14       A.  I didn't.

           15       Q.  No Workers' Compensation claim for that?

           16       A.  Are you talking about money checks to help me

           17  out?

           18       Q.  Right.  A Workers' Compensation claim that you

           19  filed as a result of an on-the-job injury.  Like you

           20  said you thought -- you probably did back in '90 or '91

           21  when you hurt your left knee.

           22       A.  No.  I didn't get any money for anything.

           23       Q.  Did you file a lawsuit as a result of the gauge

           24  blowing up in your face back at Texas City, Valero?

           25       A.  No.

                                                                      36



            1       Q.  Did you get any money because of what happened

            2  to you?

            3       A.  No.

            4       Q.  Okay.  Why didn't you file suit?  It affected

            5  your hearing where you have a buzz that you hear to

            6  today, and you got a cut on your face.  Why didn't you

            7  file a lawsuit?

            8       A.  That's what I ask myself today, but it's too

            9  late now.  I didn't do it.

           10       Q.  Okay.  And you didn't file a Workers'

           11  Compensation claim either; is that right?

           12       A.  No.

           13       Q.  No, you did not file a Workers' Compensation?

           14       A.  No.  I did not.

           15       Q.  Anybody offered you any money or pay you any

           16  money as a result of your injuries from the gauge

           17  blowing up?

           18       A.  Nobody offered me anything.

           19       Q.  And you didn't receive any money either?

           20       A.  Nope.

           21       Q.  Did you lose any time from work as a result of

           22  that accident?

           23       A.  I took off days, weeks.  I even taken months to

           24  just be better.

           25       Q.  After the gauge blew up in your face?

                                                                      37



            1       A.  Yes.  I've rested more when I see -- during my

            2  jobs.

            3       Q.  Okay.  Besides hurting your knee in '90, '91

            4  and the gauge blowing up in 2000 to 2004, have you ever

            5  been hurt on the job before?  Or is that all you can

            6  remember?

            7       A.  Those are the only two.

            8       Q.  Okay.  Ever been in a car accident?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  How many accidents -- car accidents have you

           11  been in?

           12       A.  One.  No more.

           13       Q.  When was that?

           14       A.  I think it was in 1999 or 2000.

           15       Q.  Tell me about the accident.

           16       A.  It was in Mexico.  It was during a vacation

           17  time.  I went there with my wife and my kids.

           18       Q.  Okay.  And what happened?  What kind of

           19  accident was it?

           20       A.  I was doing about 70 miles per hour.  Well,

           21  oncoming traffic was a passenger bus.  And that

           22  passenger bus evaded a pothole, and it evaded my lane.

           23  And that made me lose the highway, and that gave me a

           24  lot of problems.

           25       Q.  Okay.  So a bus came into your lane, and you

                                                                      38



            1  had to leave the highway?

            2       A.  Yeah.  I couldn't collide with him.

            3       Q.  Right.  So what happened after you left the

            4  roadway?

            5       A.  I went downward, downhill about 40 feet between

            6  trees, and my car -- my truck stopped at a tree.

            7       Q.  Did you hit the tree?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  How much damage to your car?

           10       A.  About 50 percent.

           11       Q.  Was it drivable after that, or did you have to

           12  get a new car?

           13       A.  The insurance took it out, took it to the

           14  dealer, fixed it up.  So the days of being there ended,

           15  and I had to come back.

           16       Q.  Okay.  Were you hurt in that accident?

           17       A.  No.

           18       Q.  Anybody else in your car hurt in that accident?

           19       A.  My wife, her right hand a little bit.

           20       Q.  Anybody else in the car with you besides you

           21  and your wife?

           22       A.  Me, brother-in-law, my son, and my daughter

           23  were in the car.

           24       Q.  Were they hurt?

           25       A.  A little bit, but nothing serious.

                                                                      39



            1       Q.  Did they have to go to the hospital?

            2       A.  No.

            3       Q.  Did you go to the hospital?

            4       A.  No.

            5       Q.  Any other car accidents besides that?

            6       A.  That's all.

            7       Q.  Any other accidents, any falls where, like,

            8  you've fallen off a bicycle or down any stairs, anything

           17       A.  It's a tonsillitis.  I had to spend the night

           18  there.  They had to drain it, and I spent the night

           19  there.

           20       Q.  Besides overnight for tonsillitis, anything

           22  filled there?

            5       A.  It could have been when they did surgery on my

            6  eye.

            7       Q.  Okay.  Can you recall any other time?

            8       A.  Maybe three years ago that I took medicine for

            9  that, but I don't recall another time.

           10       Q.  Did you take just one kind of medicine, or was

           11  it more than one for your neck and your low back?

           12       A.  Just one.

           13       Q.  And do you know what it's for?  Was it for pain

           14  or inflammation or what?

           15       A.  He told me -- he told me that he wanted to try

           16  first to see if this medication would bring down the

           17  swelling.

           18       Q.  Swelling where?

           19       A.  Part of my neck and my low back where it hurts.

           20       Q.  And what was the doctor that gave you that

           21  medicine prescription?

           22       A.  Tomaszek.  I can't pronounce it directly.

           23       Q.  How many times have you seen Dr. Tomaszek?

           24       A.  If I'm not missing anyone -- any -- I think

           25  it's four.

                                                                      42



            1       Q.  When's the last time you saw Dr. Tomaszek?

            2       A.  I'm not quite sure, but I believe it's March of

            3  this year.

            4       Q.  Do you have any doctors' appointments now

            5  scheduled?

            6       A.  None.

            7       Q.  Do you have any medical procedures planned or

            8  scheduled?

            9       A.  I told him we talked about the process of what

           10  they did to me and how I felt.

           11                MR. NEWTON:  Object as nonresponsive.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Do you have any medical

           13  procedures planned for the future?

           14       A.  The doctor has not concluded what's going to

           15  occur to me yet.

           16       Q.  So nothing is on the schedule or calendar for

           17  any medical procedures; is that right?

           18       A.  Not yet.

           19       Q.  What kind of medical procedures have you had?

           20       A.  They give me three injections.

           21       Q.  What part of your body did they give you

           22  injections to?

           23       A.  In my neck.

           24       Q.  And who did those?

           25       A.  Dr. Tomaszek.

                                                                      43



            1       Q.  And did you get sent to Dr. Tomaszek by your

            2  lawyers?

            3       A.  The doctor for my therapy sent me there.  I

            4  don't know how it is.

            5       Q.  And what doctor are you talking about that you

            6  saw for therapy?

            7       A.  Zicterman.

            8       Q.  Was that somebody at Texas Rehab?

            9       A.  That is correct.

           10                MR. NEWTON:  Mr. Court Reporter, do you

           11  have that exhibit, the exhibits from the last

           12  deposition?  Can you pull those for us, please?  I just

           13  need the one from Texas Rehab.  Got it.

           14       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Arredondo, let me show you

           15  what's been marked as Exhibit No. 1016 to your brother

           16  Juan's deposition.  You were in here when I showed this

           17  to him, but would you confirm this is the Texas Rehab

           18  facility where you first saw a doctor after Kuraray?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  And you were sent there by your lawyer, right?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  When do you recall first going there?

           23       A.  I don't want to give out dates, but it's

           24  probably the last week of May.

           25       Q.  Okay.  How long after the accident was that,

                                                                      44



            1  the accident at the Kuraray plant?

            2       A.  That I went to therapy?

            3       Q.  Yeah.  When's the first time you went to Texas

            4  Rehab after the accident?

            5       A.  Approximately two weeks after that.

            6       Q.  Okay.  If your records show it was May 29,

            7  2018, does that sound right?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  Did you go there with your brother Juan?

           10       A.  That is correct.

           11       Q.  Each time you went to therapy there at Texas

           12  Rehab, did you go there with Juan?

           13       A.  Not always.

           14       Q.  Most of the time?

           15       A.  No.

           16       Q.  Sometimes?

           17       A.  Some.

           18       Q.  How many times have you been to Texas Rehab?

           19       A.  The same as he, around 10 times -- 10 months.

           20       Q.  When you say "same as he," you mean who?

           21       A.  My brother Juan.

           22       Q.  And what did you have done at Texas Rehab?

           23       A.  Different things.

           24       Q.  Tell me about it.

           25       A.  They would put patches on my knee, pads on my

                                                                      45



            1  knees, on my low back, and on my neck.  And regarding my

            2  shoulder, I would rotate my shoulder using a wheel and

            3  with other parts that they have there.

            4       Q.  Which shoulder?

            5       A.  The right.

            6       Q.  And how long would you stay each time you went

            7  to Texas Rehab?

            8       A.  Sometimes 20 minutes; sometimes 40 minutes.

            9       Q.  Usually how long was it that you would stay?

           10  Was it closer to 20 or closer to 40?

           11       A.  The first times it was closer to 40.  And then

           12  the -- the other times were closer to 20.

           13       Q.  Would you go there before or after work?

           14       A.  Most of the times it was after work.

           15       Q.  Sometimes it would be before work?

           16       A.  If I was not working, then yes.

           17       Q.  Sometimes you would go to Texas Rehab when you

           18  weren't working; is that right?

           19       A.  Because we had a rain out, so we wouldn't work.

           20  So I would take that day, and I would go there.

           21       Q.  Okay.  Like a rain out or something like that?

           22                THE INTERPRETER:  Rain out.  Yes.

           23       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  But you never miss work to go

           24  to Texas Rehab, right?

           25       A.  I would always request an early out in order to

                                                                      46



            1  arrive promptly at the therapy.

            2       Q.  So how much time would you lose from work, if

            3  any, to go to therapy?

            4       A.  I would lose about five or six hours of work

            5  when I had to go twice to therapy per week.

            6       Q.  If you went twice in a week, you'd lose five to

            7  six hours that week.  Is that what you're saying?

            8       A.  Approximately.

            9       Q.  Are there some weeks where you didn't miss any

           10  time from work at all?

           11       A.  Through the ten-month period at the beginning,

           12  I would lose hours for two days in the first months.

           13  But afterwards, I would just lose one hour because I had

           14  to be going constantly to the therapies.

           15       Q.  So for the first month, you lost five to six

           16  hours a week if you had to go twice a week; is that

           17  right?

           18       A.  No.

           19       Q.  All right.  I'm confused.  You said for the

           20  first month you would lose five or six hours a week if

           21  you had to go to therapy two times a week; is that

           22  correct?

           23       A.  I said the first months.

           24       Q.  First month.  That's right?

           25       A.  Not one month.  It was more than one month.

                                                                      47



            1       Q.  Okay.  Well, you said "first month."  You meant

            2  first months?

            3                THE INTERPRETER:  First months.

            4                THE WITNESS:  (In English) Months.

            5       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  For how many months?

            6       A.  (Via Interpreter) I don't have exact figure,

            7  but the first months --

            8       Q.  One or two --

            9       A.  Twice.

           10       Q.  Two or three?

           11       A.  Two, three.

           12       Q.  Okay.  Two to three months you'd lose five to

           13  six hours a week if you had to go two times a week,

           14  right?

           15       A.  That is correct.

           16       Q.  Now some weeks you'd only go once a week,

           17  right?

           18       A.  Once.

           19       Q.  Okay.  And then the following months you said

           20  you'd lose about an hour a week?

           21       A.  No.  It was more.  It was actually -- because I

           22  had to drive from where I worked to the location, so it

           23  was close to two hours.

           24       Q.  Okay.

           25                MR. NEWTON:  Let's take a break.  Going for

                                                                      48



            1  a while.

            7       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Arredondo, we had a chance

            8  to take a break.  Are you ready to proceed?

            9       A.  Yes.  I'm ready.

           10       Q.  You understand, sir, you're under oath still?

           11  You understand that?

           12       A.  I understand.

           13       Q.  Okay.  Let's talk about the day of the

           14  accident.

           15       A.  Okay.

           16       Q.  What time did you get to work that day?

           17       A.  Before 7:00.

           18       Q.  Is that typical for you to get there before

           19  7:00?

           20       A.  Usually between 20 or 15 prior to 7:00.

           21       Q.  Okay.  So you at least -- 6:45 to -- 6:40 to

           22  6:45 is when you'd arrive at work there at Kuraray; is

           23  that right?

           24       A.  Correct.

           25       Q.  And did you have a badge that you had to use to

                                                                      49



            1  get in?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  And what gate did you come through that

            4  morning?

            5       A.  I do not recall the number, but where the guard

            6  was posted checking the badge.

            7       Q.  Where a guard was posted checking the badge?

            8       A.  Every day.

            9       Q.  So it was by a guard shack or something?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Okay.  Now where would you park your truck and

           12  welding rig?

           13       A.  After I crossed the guard shack, there was a

           14  parking lot to the left side.  We'd park it there, and

           15  then I would walk where we would hold a meeting.

           16       Q.  So you parked where you were assigned to park,

           17  right?

           18       A.  That is correct.

           19       Q.  And when you got there that day, what did you

           20  do?  What's the first thing you did?

           21       A.  I walked into -- listened to the safety meeting

           22  we received every morning.

           23       Q.  Was this at the lunch tent?

           24       A.  That is correct.

           25       Q.  And this safety meeting was conducted by Force

                                                                      50



            1  employees, right?

            2       A.  Safety meetings of Force, yes.

            3       Q.  And do you recall what the topic of the safety

            4  meeting was that day, the day of accident?

            5       A.  Not really.

            6       Q.  How long would these safety meetings last each

            7  day?

            8       A.  From 20 to 25 minutes.

            9       Q.  Had them every day that you worked?

           10       A.  Every day in the morning.

           11       Q.  And they would remind you of safety tips,

           12  things to do, things not to do, stuff like that, right?

           13       A.  That is correct.

           14       Q.  Now where did you work that day?

           15       A.  At the fab shop.

           16       Q.  And what unit was the fab shop next to?  Do you

           17  remember?

           18       A.  The fab shop is outside of all the units.

           19                (Exhibits 1018 and 1019 marked.)

           20       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  And how long had you worked

           21  there at the Kuraray plant at the time of the accident?

           22       A.  Since March up to the date of the accident.

           23       Q.  Couple of months then?

           24       A.  Between two or three months.

           25       Q.  Okay.  Just like I did with your brother Juan,

                                                                      51



            1  I'm going to show you a couple of maps.  And these are

            2  Exhibits 1018 and 1019.  And I want you to take a look

            3  at them.  Take your time.  Kind of orient yourself.

            4       A.  (Untranslated response.)

            5       Q.  Okay.  Can you find on the map -- don't mark

            6  anything yet, but can you find on the map where you were

            7  working that day?

            8       A.  I hope I'm not wrong, but the flare was here.

            9  Then it was next to it.  I am guiding myself because of

           10  the location of the flare.

           11       Q.  Okay.  That's fine.  I want you to take a pen

           12  if you have one handy, and I want you to write a W where

           13  you were working the day of the accident.

           14                Little bit bigger than that.  Yeah.

           15                Okay.  Now were you working at that same

           16  location when the accident occurred?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  Okay.  Then I want you to write right next to

           19  the W, I want you to write the letter I.

           20                Okay.  Now what were you doing at the time

           21  of the accident?

           22       A.  I was welding.

           23       Q.  And what were you welding on?

           24       A.  I'm quite sure it was a 6-inch diameter pipe

           25  tube.  I want to be sure, but I'm sure it was a pipe,

                                                                      52



            1  6 diameters -- 6-inch diameter.

            2       Q.  Okay.  And this is in the fab shop, right?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  Now I've never been to the fab shop, so is it

            5  like inside with an opening on each end, or is it

            6  covered like a canopy or a roof or something?

            7       A.  They call it a fab shop, but it's actually a

            8  structure built from scaffolds covered and surrounded by

            9  plastic to prevent the wind from coming in.  And we make

           10  pieces to be taken into the workplaces.

           11       Q.  Okay.  Is it covered like by some kind of

           12  canopy or some kind of building, some kind of roof or

           13  something?

           14       A.  It's hooked up with metal parts, and then the

           15  upper layer of the roof is covered with a plastic that

           16  falls down and surrounds us in order to prevent the air

           17  from coming in.

           18       Q.  Okay.  I mean, does it keep you out of the

           19  weather if it's raining or something?

           20       A.  They do things for different purposes.  We work

           21  with argon.

           22       Q.  With what?

           23       A.  Argon.  Argon.

           24       Q.  Argon?

           25       A.  Argon.  If argon is mixed up with air, what

                                                                      53



            1  we're doing is left to spoil, it's unusable anymore.  So

            2  it protects the air from coming in and mixing with the

            3  argon, and it also protects us against water.

            4       Q.  Okay.  Were you working with anyone at the time

            5  of the accident?

            6       A.  There were about three or four of us at the

            7  time of the accident.  I don't remember how many were

            8  there.

            9       Q.  Do you remember their names?

           10       A.  Of none.  Just one.

           11       Q.  And who is that?

           12       A.  Antonio.

           13       Q.  Remember his last name?  Don't guess, but if

           14  you remember, just tell me.

           15       A.  Arroyo.

           16       Q.  Arroyo?

           17                THE INTERPRETER:  Arroyo.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  And what was Antonio Arroyo

           19  doing while you were working there in the fab shop?

           20       A.  He's also a wel- -- a welder like me.

           21       Q.  Was he welding on the same pipe you were, or

           22  was he welding on his own pipe?

           23       A.  There -- nothing was prepared for him at that

           24  time.

           25       Q.  So what was he doing?

                                                                      54



            1       A.  Waiting for something to be handed to him in

            2  order to start welding.

            3       Q.  Okay.  Where was he in relationship to you?

            4  Was he standing next to you, or was he a couple of feet

            5  away?  Or how would you describe it?

            6       A.  He was about 6 to 8 feet away from me.

            7       Q.  Okay.  Now when's the first time you realized

            8  something was wrong?

            9       A.  I never realized something was wrong until I

           10  heard the explosion.

           11       Q.  Did you actually hear an explosion?

           12       A.  I did.

           13       Q.  Describe how it sounded.

           14       A.  Would you like me describe it through a sound?

           15       Q.  Yes.

           16       A.  It was a sound that he produced from an RV.  An

           17  RV is a release valve, but a very big release valve.  It

           18  sounded like this, and then the flame came out with

           19  black smoke.

           20       Q.  Did you actually see the flame?

           21       A.  From where I was standing, you could see

           22  everything.

           23       Q.  How far away from you was the flame?

           24       A.  How can I say it?

           25       Q.  How many blocks?

                                                                      55



            1       A.  Between two and three.

            2       Q.  Between two and three blocks away?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  Okay.  So you heard a loud noise like a release

            5  of air from a pressure valve, like a release valve,

            6  something like that?

            7       A.  That is when I -- that is what I believe it

            8  was.  That is what I am assuming.  I actually do not

            9  know what it was.

           10       Q.  Okay.  But you heard this noise, right?  And

           11  describe it for us.  Make that noise again, if you can

           12  what did it sound like?

           13       A.  It was very strong.  It was loud.

           14       Q.  How long did it last?

           15       A.  A second.  The sound lasted for seconds and was

           16  followed by the explosion.

           17       Q.  What did the explosion sound like?

           18       A.  Like that.  Very strong.  Very loud.

           19       Q.  And from where you were working, you could look

           20  out and see the fire?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Then what did you do?  What did you do next?

           23       A.  On my side I ran.  I ran because I got scared

           24  because near where that explosion occurred was my

           25  brother, and I was scared that there could be an event

                                                                      56



            1  that would crawl or walk or move towards him.

            2       Q.  Where was your brother working?

            3       A.  He was working nearby where it sounded like

            4  that.

            5       Q.  Where would you say your brother was working on

            6  the plant or at the plant at the time of the event?

            7       A.  From my standpoint to where the event occurred,

            8  it's very hard for me to pinpoint a place.

            9       Q.  How did you know where your brother was working

           10  that day?

           11       A.  Because -- because he'd been working at the

           12  same spot for over a day.

           13       Q.  Now did you guys ride to work together?

           14       A.  No.  He drives his own rig, and I drive mine.

           15       Q.  Okay.  Did you see him that day before the

           16  fire?

           17       A.  That day when it occurred, I ran.  And while I

           18  was running, I saw him.  That is when I fell because I

           19  was running to him instead of running to the other side.

           20                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  Objection;

           21  nonresponsive.

           22       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  When is the first time you saw

           23  your brother that day?

           24       A.  At the safety meeting.

           25       Q.  Okay.  So you went over to the fab shop, and he

                                                                      57



            1  went to wherever he was working, right?

            2       A.  That is correct.

            3       Q.  Okay.  Do you know where in the plant he was

            4  working?

            5       A.  Yes.  I would know where he was working.  He

            6  would -- he could probably move from one place to

            7  another, but he was in the same area.

            8       Q.  Okay.  There on that map that you marked your

            9  location, Exhibit No. 1019, can you identify where you

           10  believe your brother was working at the time of the

           11  accident?  Don't guess.  Just tell me where you believe

           12  him to be working at the time of the accident.  If you

           13  don't know, that's okay, too.

           14       A.  Somewhere here, but I'm not quite sure.

           15       Q.  Now after the fire when you heard the boom,

           16  what did you go -- or where did you go next?

           17       A.  First, when I fell, when I was looking for him,

           18  I was walk -- running towards the people that were

           19  running from the unit.  I started asking about him to

           20  the coworkers.  Some were not able to tell me what had

           21  happened until I asked the person who used the radio.

           22  And they didn't know where they were until I saw him

           23  coming along with the crowd.

           24       Q.  Okay.  But I want to know where you went after

           25  you heard the boom.

                                                                      58



            1       A.  I ran to the part where I thought that my

            2  brother was at.

            3       Q.  Now were -- where was that in relationship to

            4  the muster point, the place you knew to go in the event

            5  of an emergency?

            6       A.  When the emergency occurred, we must know where

            7  to go.  It's based on the direction of the air.  Safety

            8  unit from the plant or the safety unit from the company

            9  directs us.

           10       Q.  Right.  But I'm asking about that day.  Did you

           11  run toward the muster point or away from the muster

           12  point when you were trying to get to your brother?

           13       A.  I was going near the muster point.

           14       Q.  But not directly to it?

           15       A.  No.  Because I was scared and wanted to know my

           16  brother's whereabouts before I went there.

           17       Q.  Where was the muster point that you were

           18  supposed to go to?

           19       A.  (Untranslated response.)

           20       Q.  Okay.  I want you to look on the map and use

           21  the letter M, capital M, and put the muster point where

           22  you were supposed to go to.

           23       A.  Nobody knew where to head.  We didn't know by

           24  then.

           25       Q.  Okay.  You told me earlier, Mr. Arredondo, that

                                                                      59



            1  you knew that there was a muster point you were supposed

            2  to go to at the plant in the event of an emergency,

            3  right?  So where was that muster point that you were

            4  supposed to go to in the event of an emergency at the

            5  Kuraray plant?  You're pointing to it with your finger.

            6  I want you to mark it.  Put a letter -- capital letter

            7  M.

            8       A.  Before I do this, I would like to tell you that

            9  we were -- we were put out in the parking lot here --

           10       Q.  Okay.  I don't want to know that.  I want to

           11  know where the muster point was.  Where were you

           12  supposed to go in the event of an emergency at the

           13  Kuraray plant?  You worked there for two or three

           14  months.  So where was your muster point?

           15       A.  When we came here -- our safety did not know

           16  where the muster point was going to be located until

           17  they sent us here.

           18       Q.  Okay.  Let me get this straight.  For two or

           19  three months, you worked at the Kuraray plant before the

           20  accident occurred?

           21                MR. BICKHAM:  Objection; form.

           22                THE WITNESS:  (In Spanish) Si.

           23       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Did you know where your muster

           24  point was supposed to be?

           25       A.  There's more than one, and there was more than

                                                                      60



            1  one.

            2       Q.  Right.  But when you were working at the fab

            3  shop, how long had you worked at the fab shop before the

            4  day of the accident?

            5       A.  There was some days that I worked at the fab

            6  shop and sometimes -- some days you were sent to the

            7  unit.

            8       Q.  Right.  But how many days had you been working

            9  at the fab shop at the time of the explosion -- or at

           10  the time of the event?

           11       A.  I don't remember the exact number of days, but

           12  I was there for several days -- some days.

           13       Q.  Okay.  When you were working at the fab shop,

           14  where did you believe your muster point to be?

           15       A.  Maybe you're not -- I'm not -- you don't

           16  understand me.  When you work at the fab shop, you

           17  depend on the -- where the air drift is going to.  So

           18  sometimes it's going to be here, or it's going to be

           19  here.  The people that are working here can be sent here

           20  or can be sent there.

           21       Q.  Okay.  And how do you determine which direction

           22  the wind's blowing?

           23       A.  They have some wind socks.  You can look at the

           24  steam, also, the direction of the steam.  And they also

           25  have ways to decide where the direction of the wind is

                                                                      61



            1  going.

            2       Q.  Okay.  I want you to mark for me on that map

            3  with a letter M the places where the muster points would

            4  be when you were working at the fab shop.  Sounds like

            5  there was more than one depending on which direction the

            6  wind was blowing.  Is that right?

            7       A.  That is correct.

            8       Q.  Okay.  So you've marked one place?

            9                MR. BICKHAM:  Hold on.  He wasn't done.

           10                Finish your answer.

           11                THE WITNESS:  I felt strange that we were

           12  being sent there because the direction of the wind was

           13  going that way.

           14                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  Objection;

           15  nonresponsive.

           16       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Tell me where else you

           17  believed the muster point would be depending on which

           18  direction the wind was blowing when you were working at

           19  the fab shop.  You've already marked one muster point,

           20  and you've already pointed on the map to another muster

           21  point.  I just want you to mark it on the map so that

           22  we'll have clear what your recollection is.

           23       A.  I cannot mark it because it could be here or

           24  here or here.  I know if the air direction is coming

           25  this way that it must be one of these places.

                                                                      62



            1       Q.  Okay.  Well, mark another muster point that you

            2  believe to exist if the wind was blowing some other

            3  direction.

            4                Okay.  Have you done that?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  Okay.  Now you said that when you heard the

            7  boom, you didn't run toward the muster point, but you

            8  ran toward where you thought your brother was working.

            9  Is that right?

           10       A.  That is correct.  I would like to add

           11  something.  When I ran, they change -- at the time I did

           12  not know what shelter I was supposed to go to.  At that

           13  time our superiors were supposed to tell us where to

           14  move to.

           15       Q.  Did you ask anybody before you started running?

           16       A.  We asked among ourselves, but everybody ran to

           17  different places.

           18       Q.  Where did the guy you were working with in the

           19  fab shop, where did he run?  Antonio Arroyo.  Where did

           20  he run?

           21       A.  To the opposite side.

           22       Q.  Why did he run there?

           23       A.  I do not know the motive.  Probably because of

           24  fear.

           25       Q.  Did he run to the muster point where he should

                                                                      63



            1  have run to?

            2       A.  I don't know.  We -- I found him later there.

            3       Q.  At a muster point?

            4       A.  That is correct.

            5       Q.  Okay.  And was that the muster point he should

            6  have run to depending on the wind direction?

            7       A.  I do not know what knowledge he had.  It's

            8  possible.

            9       Q.  Did you talk to him and found out -- find out

           10  where he ran and why he ran over to where he did?

           11       A.  We spoke among each other, and most of us ran

           12  out of fear.  And then we spoke later on when everything

           13  was calm down.

           14       Q.  Okay.  What I need to know from you, though,

           15  is, did you talk to Mr. Arroyo, Antonio, and find out

           16  where he went to after the boom was heard.

           17       A.  I do not know where exactly where he ran to.

           18       Q.  All right.  I want you to mark on the map where

           19  you saw Antonio when you found him later.  Draw an A.

           20  A.

           21                Okay.  And that's where you found

           22  Antonio --

           23       A.  That's correct.

           24       Q.  -- sometime after you heard the boom?

           25       A.  Yes.

                                                                      64



            1       Q.  Okay.  Now on the map can you show which

            2  direction you ran after you heard the boom?

            3       A.  What should I put?

            4       Q.  An arrow.  From the fab shop, draw an arrow

            5  where -- what direction you ran.

            6                Okay.  So on that map you've drawn an arrow

            7  showing the direction you ran after you heard the boom,

            8  right?

            9       A.  Correct.

           10       Q.  Let me look at the map, see if I understand

           11  what your markings are.

           12                Okay.  After you heard the boom, when is

           13  the first time you saw your brother?

           14       A.  When I ran towards where I signaled with the

           15  hour -- the arrow.  It's when I saw him coming with the

           16  crowd, and that is the first time that I saw him.

           17       Q.  And what was he doing?

           18       A.  He was running with the rest of the people,

           19  frightened.

           20       Q.  Was he running in your direction?

           21       A.  Not exactly towards me because he didn't see

           22  me.  He was running out of the unit.

           23       Q.  Okay.  How long after you took off running did

           24  you see Juan running with others?

           25       A.  Around two minutes, maybe less.

                                                                      65



            1       Q.  When is the first time you talked to Juan after

            2  you heard the boom?

            3       A.  When he was coming with the rest of the people.

            4  I asked him if he was okay.

            5       Q.  And what did he tell you?

            6       A.  That he had fallen.

            7       Q.  Did he tell you where he'd fallen?

            8       A.  No.  He didn't go into details.

            9       Q.  He just said he had fallen?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Did he say if any part of his body was hurting?

           12       A.  At that time, being we didn't speak of anything

           13  else, because he was sitting somewhere else.

           14       Q.  Okay.  But you said that you ran into him when

           15  he was running with other people.  You asked if he was

           16  okay.  He said he had fallen, but he didn't say he was

           17  hurt in any particular place.  Is that correct?

           18       A.  Correct.

           19       Q.  Okay.  Now did you end up at the same muster

           20  point as he did, or were you some other place?

           21       A.  We were in the same one but separate areas.

           22       Q.  Was it inside or outside a building?

           23       A.  We were sometimes out in the parking lot, and

           24  then they put us to the building in the plant.

           25       Q.  Okay.  Now you said you were running and you

                                                                      66



            1  fell.

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  Was that before or after you saw your brother

            4  Juan?

            5       A.  Before I saw him.

            6       Q.  Did anybody see you fall?

            7       A.  No.

            8       Q.  Tell me how you fell.

            9       A.  There's a small creek where the water goes when

           10  it rains.  I tried to jump over it, but I was not able

           11  to.  And when I landed, I twisted my foot and I fell.

           12  And that's when I hurt my back.

           13       Q.  Did the -- is this like a ditch?  Or was it

           14  like a creek?

           15       A.  A creek.  It's like a creek that has water when

           16  it rains.

           17       Q.  Was there any water in this area that you tried

           18  to jump over?

           19       A.  Just for a little water.  Just humid.

           20       Q.  Okay.  So there was no water you were trying to

           21  jump over, right?

           22       A.  There was a lot of mud.  That's why I jumped.

           23       Q.  Okay.  So you jumped.  And how long -- how wide

           24  was this area where it was muddy?

           25       A.  I'm not very good with measuring.  I would say

                                                                      67



            1  3 feet, more or less.  I don't remember very well.

            2       Q.  Okay.  So you jumped -- tried to jump over

            3  about a 3-foot area, and you say you landed funny.  And

            4  that's when you hurt your back?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  Now tell me about that.  Did you land on both

            7  feet or one foot?  Or what do you remember?

            8       A.  I land on my right foot, but it slipped.  So I

            9  had to put body weight on my left one.  I just kind of

           10  don't remember because it occurred very quickly, very

           11  fastly.

           12       Q.  Okay.  So you landed on your right foot.  Your

           13  right foot slipped.  And then you put weight on your

           14  left foot?

           15       A.  Yes.  When I fell.  Yes.

           16       Q.  Did you fall all the way to the ground?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  What part of your body hit the ground when you

           19  fell?

           20       A.  First my right shoulder, and then I fell

           21  backwards.

           22       Q.  So you say you first fell forward, or did you

           23  fall to the side when you fell?

           24       A.  First I fell on my side, but then I went

           25  backwards.

                                                                      68



            1       Q.  All right.  As I understand it, you jumped over

            2  this muddy area, landed on your right foot.  It slipped.

            3  You landed -- you put your left foot down, and then you

            4  said you fell to your right side, landing on your

            5  shoulder.  Is that right?

            6       A.  No.  I jumped.  Put my right foot -- that's

            7  when I slipped.  And that's when I hit -- and that is

            8  when I hit, and I supported myself with the right

            9  shoulder.  And then I put on the left foot, and that is

           10  when I went backwards.

           11       Q.  Okay.  So what you're saying now is you tried

           12  to jump over this muddy area.  You landed on your right

           13  foot.  It slipped.  You fell on your right shoulder.

           14  Did you fall forward, Mr. Arredondo, or did you fall to

           15  the side?

           16       A.  The first time -- yes.  I -- first I jumped the

           17  muddy area, landed with my right foot.  It slipped, and

           18  I landed with my right shoulder.

           19       Q.  On the ground?

           20       A.  Yes.  The right shoulder hit the part of the

           21  stream.  So I tried to regain balance with my left foot,

           22  and that is when I fell backwards.

           23       Q.  How did that happen if you're laying on your

           24  right shoulder?  I don't -- I don't understand what

           25  you're describing for me.  You said you fell to the

                                                                      69



            1  right side and landed on your right shoulder.  So how

            2  did your left foot get involved?

            3                THE INTERPRETER:  Can I -- can I -- can the

            4  interpreter ask a question on the record just to clarify

            5  the surface area?  Because we are interpreting -- we are

            6  thinking that this is a flat surface, and I think he has

            7  meant the ditch.

            8                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  He talked about jumping

            9  over an Arroyo [sic] or a ditch --

           10                THE INTERPRETER:  Yeah.

           11                MR. NEWTON:  -- or a creek or something

           12  that was a muddy area.  He told us that.

           13                THE INTERPRETER:  He's -- he's describing

           14  with his hands a V shape.

           15                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  But I'm still getting

           16  from him that he landed on his right shoulder.

           17                THE INTERPRETER:  He -- yes.

           18                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.

           19                THE INTERPRETER:  But it -- the only

           20  explanation that would give me that he had to compensate

           21  with his left body parts is that it was a V shape.

           22                MR. NEWTON:  I don't want you to interpret

           23  anything other than what he's saying.

           24                THE INTERPRETER:  I know.  I know.  I know

           25  that.

            1                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.

            2                THE INTERPRETER:  But that's the only

            3  way that we're going to -- I just -- I want to ask

            4  him --

            5                MR. NEWTON:  I don't want you to help him

            6  as far as --

            7                THE INTERPRETER:  Okay.

            8                MR. NEWTON:  -- the direction of his body.

            9                THE INTERPRETER:  I won't.

           10                MR. NEWTON:  Okay?

           11                THE INTERPRETER:  Okay.

           12                MR. NEWTON:  I know you're a doctor, and

           13  that's --

           14                THE INTERPRETER:  No, it's not that.

           15                MR. NEWTON:  I know.  But what I'm saying

           16  is I don't want you to fill in the blanks because --

           17                THE INTERPRETER:  I won't.

           18                MR. NEWTON:  -- you know about mechanism of

           19  injury.  This is the hard part.

           20                THE INTERPRETER:  Yes.

           21                MR. NEWTON:  All I want you to do is to

           22  tell us what he's saying --

           23                THE INTERPRETER:  Okay.

           24                MR. NEWTON:  -- and translate that into --

           25                THE INTERPRETER:  I will.

                                                                      71



            1                MR. NEWTON:  -- English.

            2                THE INTERPRETER:  Okay.

            3                MR. NEWTON:  That's it.  Don't fill in any

            4  blanks.

            5                THE INTERPRETER:  I will not.

            6                MR. NEWTON:  Because I want his testimony.

            7                THE INTERPRETER:  I understand.

            8                MR. NEWTON:  Right?  And that's what we

            9  have to do.  I know it's tricky.

           10                THE INTERPRETER:  No.  It's --

           11                MR. NEWTON:  So -- and if I don't

           12  understand, I don't understand.

           13                THE INTERPRETER:  Okay.

           14                MR. NEWTON:  I'm just trying to get his

           15  best description --

           16                THE INTERPRETER:  Okay.

           17                MR. NEWTON:  -- as to what happened.

           18                THE INTERPRETER:  Perfect.

           19       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Mr. Arredondo, after

           20  you hit your right shoulder, then what part of your body

           21  hit the ground next?

           22       A.  My left foot.  It made me fall back, my left

           23  foot.

           24       Q.  And then what part of your body hit the ground?

           25       A.  My shoulders.  I fell backwards.

                                                                      72



            1       Q.  You fell flat on your back?

            2       A.  Yes.  That's correct.

            3       Q.  And you hit your ground with -- hit the ground,

            4  rather, with both shoulders or with the complete side of

            5  your back -- or the back -- the whole back, in other

            6  words?

            7       A.  Yes.  That is correct.

            8       Q.  Okay.  So when you fell back, you fell

            9  backwards.  And you fell flat on your back.  Is that --

           10  is that what you mean to say?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  When you fell back on your back, flat on your

           13  back, where were your legs?

           14       A.  (Untranslated response.)

           15       Q.  When you fell flat on your back on the ground,

           16  where were your legs?

           17       A.  One leg was extended out --

           18       Q.  Which leg?

           19                MR. BICKHAM:  Wait a minute.  Let him

           20  finish his answer, please, before you ask the next

           21  question.

           22                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  He said one leg.  I'm

           23  trying to get specifically which leg is what I'm asking.

           24                THE WITNESS:  One leg was extended.  The

           25  other one was bent.

                                                                      73



            1       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Which leg was extended?

            2       A.  The right leg.

            3       Q.  Right leg was extended.  Where was it extended?

            4       A.  Towards the front.

            5       Q.  All right.  Straight out in front of you?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  And where was your left leg?

            8       A.  That was the one that was bent when I was lying

            9  down.

           10       Q.  And how was it bent?  Was it bent under you?

           11       A.  Under the other one a little bit.

           12       Q.  Under your body or under your other leg?

           13       A.  Under the other leg.

           14       Q.  Under your right leg?

           15       A.  Correct.

           16       Q.  Okay.  Then you got up, right?

           17                THE WITNESS:  (In Spanish) Si.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  And what did you do next?

           19       A.  (Via Interpreter) It's when I went to look for

           20  my brother that I ran.

           21       Q.  Okay.  So you fell before you saw Juan?

           22       A.  Correct.

           23       Q.  Did anybody help you up off the ground, or were

           24  you able to get up on your own?

           25       A.  I was able to get up by myself.

                                                                      74



            1       Q.  Did anybody tell you they saw you fall?

            2       A.  No.  Nobody saw me.

            3       Q.  Now when you saw your brother Juan and he told

            4  you that he had fallen, did he ask how you were?

            5       A.  There was not a chance for those type of

            6  questions because there are a lot of people there.  So

            7  there was no -- any conversation.

            8       Q.  Well, you said you asked how he was.  Remember

            9  telling me that a minute ago?

           10       A.  Yes.  I did.  But he didn't ask me back.

           11       Q.  Okay.  That's all I'm asking.  You asked how he

           12  was, and he said he'd fallen.

           13       A.  Correct.

           14       Q.  But he didn't ask how you were?

           15       A.  No.

           16       Q.  And you didn't tell him that you had fallen

           17  when you saw him, right?

           18       A.  Afterwards I did tell him that I had fallen.

           19       Q.  I'm talking about when you first saw him.  You

           20  didn't tell him that you fell.

           21       A.  No.

           22       Q.  When's the first time you told Juan you had

           23  fallen?

           24       A.  After I was put into the building.

           25       Q.  So how long after you fell did you tell that to

                                                                      75



            1  Juan?

            2       A.  I can't remember very well.

            3       Q.  Did you have any mud on your clothes?

            4       A.  On my boot -- boot, on my hand, but I washed my

            5  hands, and also here on my elbow.

            6       Q.  Is the only place where you had mud was on your

            7  boot and your hand?

            8       A.  And the shirt.

            9       Q.  And your shirt.

           10                What part of your shirt?

           11       A.  On my shoulder.

           12       Q.  What shoulder?

           13       A.  On the right.  And this part of the shirt.

           14       Q.  What part are you pointing to?

           15       A.  (Untranslated response.)

           16       Q.  Your lower back on the right side?

           17                THE WITNESS:  (In English) On the left

           18  side.

           19       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Left side.

           20                THE INTERPRETER:  Left side.

           21       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  You had mud there, too?

           22       A.  (Via Interpreter) Yes.  On the bottom part of

           23  my shirt.

           24       Q.  Okay.  Did anybody take a picture of you before

           25  you washed your clothes?

                                                                      76



            1       A.  That didn't occur because cell phones are not

            2  allowed there.

            3                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; nonresponsive.

            4       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Did anybody take a picture of

            5  you, Mr. Arredondo, before you took off your clothes and

            6  washed them?

            7       A.  No.

            8       Q.  When you got home that night, did you wash your

            9  clothes?

           10       A.  My wife probably did it the following day.  I

           11  don't remember.

           12       Q.  How many FRCs do you have or did you have back

           13  then?

           14       A.  I do not wear FRCs.  I wear pants, and I have

           15  around 10 pairs.

           16       Q.  Are they fire-retardant?

           17       A.  That is correct.

           18       Q.  Okay.  And then are your shirts fire-retardant

           19  as well, or were they back then?

           20       A.  That is correct.

           21       Q.  And how many shirts did you have back then,

           22  2018, May?

           23       A.  I don't remember, perhaps around 10.

           24       Q.  Okay.  Would you wear clean clothes every day

           25  to work?

                                                                      77



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  Okay.  So what would you do when you get home

            3  each day from work?  Would you take off those clothes

            4  and your wife would wash them, or would you put them in

            5  a dirty clothes hamper or something?

            6       A.  There's a hamper where I put my dirty clothes.

            7       Q.  And then when it was necessary, your wife would

            8  wash -- wash them for you?

            9       A.  Yes.  When I'm running out of clean clothes,

           10  she washes --

           11       Q.  Okay.

           12       A.  -- clothes.

           13       Q.  Now after you got to the building and then the

           14  parking lot, how long did you stay at the plant before

           15  you went home?

           16       A.  That I can remember was between three and four

           17  hours.

           18       Q.  And then they told you to go home?

           19       A.  Correct.

           20       Q.  Were you able to go over to the fab shop and

           21  get your truck and welding rig?

           22       A.  I was not allowed to go back by myself.  I was

           23  escorted to go pick it up.

           24       Q.  Right.  But you were allowed to go back in

           25  there and get your truck and rig and drive home in it,

                                                                      78



            1  right?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  Okay.  What did you do the next day?

            4       A.  It was a Sunday.  I stayed at home.  I was

            5  feeling scared.  I don't remember very much more.  It

            6  was a long time ago.

            7                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  Objection;

            8  nonresponsive.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  The day of the accident was on

           10  what day?  What day of the week?

           11       A.  Was on a Saturday.

           12       Q.  Okay.  Now back in those days, how many hours a

           13  day would you typically work?  These are the days --

           14  weeks leading up to the accident.

           15       A.  We were working Monday through Saturday,

           16  10 hours sometimes 10-and-a-half hours per day.

           16       A.  If I lift, it's something light.

           17       Q.  Okay.  So besides running on the treadmill,

           18  what do you do for cardio?

            8       Q.  What'd they do for you there at Texas Rehab?

            9       A.  They gave me therapy on my shoulder, my left

           10  knee, my low back, and my neck.

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  And was that the same doctor Juan was seeing?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  Some of the times you went to Texas Rehab was

           16  during your layoff period, right?

           17       A.  Correct.

           19  anything you relate to what happened to you at the day

           20  of the accident?

           21       A.  It was last year.  I don't recall the exact

           22  date.  I don't remember.

           23       Q.  And that was -- Dr. Tomaszek gave you that

           24  medicine?

           25       A.  Dr. Tomaszek.

                                                                      91



            1       Q.  Okay.  When's the last time you recall taking

            2  any medicine of any kind?

            3       A.  When I got surgery in my eye.

            4       Q.  When was that?

            5       A.  I'm not quite sure.  I don't remember very

            6  well, but I think it's about three years ago.

            7       Q.  But for your back or for your neck or anything

            8  like that, did you ever take any medicine?

            9       A.  My wife would put -- apply some Ben-Gay there

           10  and would give me some massages.

           12       A.  No.

           13       Q.  Did you ever have an MRI?

           15       Q.  And was -- where was that at?

           16       A.  First time it was when I had knee surgery.

           17       Q.  Okay.  I'm talking about after the accident at

           18  Kuraray.  Did you have an MRI on any part of your body?

           19       A.  I had an MRI at Opus center.

           20       Q.  Okay.

           21       A.  MRI center.  Something like that.

           22       Q.  You're sent there by your lawyer?

           23       A.  My -- the therapists where I was doing therapy

           24  was the one that sent me there, at least that's what

           25  they told me, to go there.

                                                                      92



            1       Q.  Okay.  And what part of your body did you have

            2  an MRI on?

            3       A.  Part of my neck, the shoulder, my knee.

            4       Q.  Which knee?

            5       A.  My left knee.  And my right shoulder, my back.

            6  Here at the back.

            7       Q.  What part of your back?

            8       A.  Lower back.

            9       Q.  And where else?

           10       A.  That's as far as I know.  That's all.

           11       Q.  Okay.  And the left knee was the same knee that

           12  you had surgery on before, right?

           13       A.  Correct.

           14       Q.  Did they ever tell you the results of your MRIs

           15  on any part of your body?

           16       A.  They showed it to me.  Yes.

           17       Q.  What did they tell you?

           18       A.  There's something wrong in my neck and in my

           19  back, and that's why they put the injections on me.

           20       Q.  Who told you you had problems in your neck and

           21  your back?

           22       A.  The therapist doctor where they look at the

           23  MRI.

           24       Q.  Was that at Texas Rehab or somewhere else?

           25       A.  In Texas Rehab.

                                                                      93



            1       Q.  Okay.  Now when you were going to the

            2  chiropractor and having your therapy sessions, did it

            3  make you feel better?

            4       A.  It made me feel better for my -- for my

            5  shoulder and my left knee.  And it helped some in my

            6  neck and lower back, but it resolved completely.

            7       Q.  Did you tell them that you would have pain in

            8  your neck and your back occasionally?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  In effect -- sorry.

           11       A.  I'd like to add something.  Did you say

           12  "occasionally"?

           13       Q.  Yes.

           14       A.  It doesn't hurt -- it doesn't hurt

           15  occasionally.  The pain is there.

           16       Q.  Okay.  Let me ask it again.

           17                Did you -- you recall telling the doctors

           18  at Texas Rehab that you had symptoms in your neck and

           19  your back occasionally?

           20       A.  Yes, I did tell them that.

           21       Q.  Okay.

           22       A.  I probably was not clear on my answer with him,

           23  but I did tell him.

           24       Q.  And did they ask you to rate your pain from 1

           25  to 10 with 10 being the worst?

                                                                      94



            1       A.  Yes.  They told me.  But I cannot recall what

            2  exact number I gave.

            3       Q.  If it says that you told them before you had

            4  therapy it was a 5 and after you had therapy it was a 4,

            5  does that sound right?

            6       A.  It's possible.

            7       Q.  You wouldn't disagree with that?

            8       A.  I wouldn't disagree with that.

            9       Q.  Okay.  And remember being told that after the

           10  MRI of your left knee that they diagnosed you with a

           11  low-grade sprain?  It was a Dr. Porter.  Remember being

           12  told that?

           13       A.  No.  I don't remember.

           14       Q.  If it says that in your medical records, would

           15  you disagree with that?

           16       A.  Yes.  Because I don't recall being told that.

           17       Q.  But you don't dispute being told that?  You

           18  don't say you were not told that or you were told

           19  something different.  You're not say that, are you?

           20       A.  I don't recall him saying that.

           21       Q.  Okay.  But you're not saying he told you

           22  something different.  You just don't remember either

           23  way?

           24       A.  I don't recall.

           25       Q.  If it says in your medical records from Opus

                                                                      95



            1  MRI that Dr. -- Dr. Chad Porter told you that you had a

            2  low-grade sprain of your ACL without evidence of a tear,

            3  would you disagree with that?

            4                MR. BICKHAM:  Objection; form.

            5       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Or you just don't remember

            6  either way?

            7       A.  I just simply don't remember.

            8       Q.  Okay.  Do you recall being told that you had a

            9  moderate-sized cyst in your knee?

           10       A.  Nobody told me anything about that.

           11       Q.  If it says it in your medical records, would

           12  they have been wrong?  Or would you know either way?

           13       A.  I don't remember that.

           14       Q.  So if they found it in your knee, it's not

           15  something you were told about?

           16       A.  Exactly.

           17       Q.  Okay.  Now eventually you had several

           18  injections in your neck, right?

           19       A.  Correct.

           20       Q.  And did they help your neck pain?

           21       A.  The pain subsides for first couple of months,

           22  let's say two months.  And then the pain comes back.  It

           23  returns.

           24       Q.  When it comes back, is it bad as it was before,

           25  or is it a little bit less?

                                                                      96



            1       A.  Okay.  The pain is least of my worries.  I can

            2  tolerate pain.  What worries me the most is the numbness

            3  that I get in both of my hands.

            4       Q.  How long has that been going on?

            5       A.  I don't have exact date -- or exact months, but

            6  this all happened coming from the accident.

            7       Q.  So you're telling us that you've had numbness

            8  in both hands.  It started sometime after May of 2019.

            9  Is that correct?

           10       A.  Was not on that day exactly, but it was after

           11  that day that the prob- -- problem showed up.

           12       Q.  Okay.  How long after the accident on May 19,

           13  2018, at the Kuraray plant do you first recall having

           14  numbness in your hands?

           15       A.  I don't remember very well, but around two

           16  months afterwards.  That's when I started having some

           17  symptoms.

           18       Q.  Did you tell a doctor about it?

           19       A.  The first times I didn't because I didn't see

           20  it as a consequence of this.

           21       Q.  Has any doctor told you that the numbness in

           22  your hands are because of what happened at the Kuraray

           23  plant?

           24       A.  The PA from Dr. Thomas [sic], the physician's

           25  assistant from Dr. Thomas, whose name is Rosa Mar, I

                                                                      97



            1  asked her some questions.  And she did comment that

            2  there was -- this was a consequence because of that.

            3       Q.  This was a physician's assistant?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  Who worked for who?

            6       A.  Tomaszek.

            7       Q.  Okay.  But Dr. Tomaszek never told you that?

            8       A.  I didn't have much time to ask about it.  I

            9  only saw him for a brief time the first time.

           10       Q.  Okay.  At any time did Dr. Tomaszek tell you

           11  that the numbness you were feeling in your hands was due

           12  to the accident at the Kuraray plant?  Did he ever say

           13  that?

           14       A.  No.  I haven't spoken with him.

           15       Q.  How many times have you seen Dr. Tomaszek?  At

           16  least three times, right?

           17       A.  Three times.

           18       Q.  And these were when he would give you your neck

           19  injections, right?

           20       A.  Correct.

           21       Q.  And so what you're telling us is the only

           22  person who told you that the numbness in your hands

           23  might be due to the accident at the Kuraray plant was

           24  someone who worked for Tomaszek; is that correct?

           25       A.  Correct.

                                                                      98



            1       Q.  And this was someone named who?

            2       A.  Rosa Mar.

            3       Q.  Rosa Mar.

            4                THE INTERPRETER:  Uh-huh.

            5       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Is that a "yes"?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  And what does she do for the doctor, if you

            8  know?

            9       A.  I do not know.

           10       Q.  And did she say that it could be due to the

           11  accident or that it was due to the accident?

           12       A.  She told me it was a consequence of what I had,

           13  but we did not mention the accident.

           14       Q.  So what did she relate it to?  She said the

           15  numbness in your hands was due to what?

           16       A.  She told me that it's a consequence of what

           17  they were able to see at -- in the MRI.

           18       Q.  In your neck?

           19       A.  In my neck and also in my waist.

           20       Q.  So Rosa Mar said that the problems with

           21  numbness in your hands were due to what they found on

           22  the MRI in your neck and your lower back?

           23       A.  That's how I understood it.  I'm sorry.  No.

           24  We didn't speak about the lower back.

           25       Q.  Okay.  Well, you just mentioned it.  That's why

                                                                      99



            1  I -- I asked -- so what do you remember Rosa Mar telling

            2  you, as far as the numbness in your hands, she said to

            3  do what?

            4       A.  I don't remember the conversations right now

            5  very well.

            6       Q.  So no doctor has told you what the cause of

            7  numbness in your hands is; is that correct?

            8       A.  Correct.

            9       Q.  How long have you had numbness in your hands?

           10  Or how often I should say.  Is it every day? every other

           11  day? once a week?

           12       A.  Every day.  Some days stronger than others,

           13  mainly during the night when I'm lying down.

           14       Q.  How long has it been that way?

           15       A.  I don't have an exact date.  It's -- it's

           16  around two months after the accident.  It could be more.

           17  It could be less.

           18       Q.  Do you recall telling any doctor about that?

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  Do you recall getting steroids from

           21  Dr. Tomaszek?

           22       A.  I do not know the chemical composition of what

           23  is applied to me.

           24       Q.  Do you recall him giving you what's called a

           25  Medrol Dosepak in August of 2018?

                                                                     100



            1       A.  He gave me something, but I can't affirm it was

            2  that.  I just don't remember.

            3       Q.  Do you remember a little foil pack he gave you

            4  where it had so many tablets you take a day, and then it

            5  was a little less the next day and a little less the day

            6  after that?

            7       A.  I do remember a package that had a lot of pills

            8  next to each other, but I don't remember the details.

            9       Q.  Right.  Did you take those?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Did they help you?

           12       A.  I'd say no.

           13       Q.  Okay.  Did you ever tell the doctor that the

           14  steroids that you took or the medicine that he gave

           15  you -- "he" being Dr. Tomaszek -- gave you temporary

           16  relief?

           17       A.  Correct.

           18       Q.  Has any doctor recommended surgery on your

           19  knee?

           20       A.  None.

           21       Q.  Has any doctor recommended surgery on your

           22  neck?

           23       A.  The assistant called me, told me that I had to

           24  get three injections per year.

           25       Q.  Who -- what assistant was this?  What doctor

                                                                     101



            1  was he or she the assistant to?

            2       A.  From Dr. Tomaszek's.

            3       Q.  Okay.  This is someone who worked for

            4  Dr. Tomaszek?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  Rosa Mar or someone else?

            7       A.  Rosa Mar is there because she speaks Spanish

            8  and is able to communicate to us.

            9       Q.  So is she the one who told you that you needed

           10  to get three injections a year on your neck?

           11       A.  She didn't told me that I needed it.  She told

           12  me it was the maximum I could get.

           13       Q.  Okay.  So that was the most you could get was

           14  three injections a year.  Okay.

           15       A.  And that's what she told me; that if it didn't

           16  go away that I would need surgery.

           17       Q.  Right.  But did any doctor tell you that you

           18  need surgery on your neck?  Has any doctor ever told you

           19  that?

           20       A.  No.  Nobody.

           21       Q.  When's the last time you had injection on your

           22  neck or to your neck?

           23       A.  I'm not quite sure, but I believe it was March.

           24       Q.  Of this year?

           25       A.  Of this year.  Yes.

                                                                     102



            1       Q.  The pain in your neck hasn't kept you from

            2  working, right?

            3       A.  That is correct.  But I have to use different

            4  methods in order to do my job now.

            5                MR. NEWTON:  Objection; nonresponsive.

            6       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  The pain in your neck has not

            7  prevented you from working, correct, Mr. Arredondo?

            8       A.  Correct.

            9       Q.  Any numbness you have in your hands has not

           10  prevented you from working, correct?

           11       A.  Correct.

           12       Q.  Are you working currently?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  Where are you working?

           15       A.  I work at the shop of Force at La Porte.

           16       Q.  You do welding there?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  And how long have you been working there this

           19  time?

           20       A.  Where I am right now, I've been working there

           21  for three months.  I do not know the exact date.

           22       Q.  Six days a week?

           23       A.  Five.

           24       Q.  If you had -- were asked to work six, would you

           25  do so?

                                                                     103



            1       A.  No.

            2       Q.  Why not?

            3       A.  Because I get tired too much.

            4       Q.  Okay.  So you work five days a week, 10 hours a

            5  day?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  Has any doctor told you that you can't work six

            8  days a week?

            9       A.  No.

           10       Q.  Has any doctor ever told you that you can't

           11  work seven days a week?

           12       A.  No.

           13       Q.  Has any doctor taken you off work for any

           14  period of time?

           15       A.  No.

           16       Q.  Has any doctor put you on restrictions for

           17  work?

           18       A.  No.

           19       Q.  Has anybody told you that you -- strike that.

           20                Any doctor told you that you need surgery

           21  on your back?

           22       A.  No.

           23       Q.  Remember telling Dr. Tomaszek or someone in his

           24  office in March of 2019 that the numbness in your hands

           25  comes and goes?

                                                                     104



            1       A.  Probably did.

            2       Q.  So if it says in your medical records of

            3  March 28, 2019, that you followed up with Dr. Tomaszek's

            4  office by phone, does that sound correct to you?

            5       A.  I'm sure it is, but I just don't remember very

            6  well.

            7       Q.  Okay.  So if your medical records say that on

            8  March 28th, 2019, you told someone in Dr. Tomaszek's

            9  office that the numbness in your hands comes and goes

           10  and it happens a couple of times every few days, would

           11  that be correct?

           12       A.  I don't remember if I did it.

           13       Q.  You're not saying that it's incorrect.  You're

           14  just saying you don't remember saying that?

           15       A.  That is correct.

           16       Q.  When you talked to Dr. Tomaszek's office,

           17  you're talking to a medical translator or someone who

           18  speaks Spanish, right?

           19       A.  Correct.

           20       Q.  Do you remember telling Dr. Tomaszek in June of

           21  2019 or someone in his office that when you have

           22  injections, you have gotten significant relief of pain?

           23       A.  I don't remember.

           24       Q.  Now your medical records say the last time you

           25  got an injection in your neck was in June, June 13 of

                                                                     105



            1  2019.  That would be a couple of months ago.  Does that

            2  sound right to you?

            3       A.  No.  It doesn't -- that doesn't sound right.

            4       Q.  Well, if your medical records say that, do you

            5  think that's wrong?

            6       A.  Yes.  There's a mistake there.

            7       Q.  So you have any explanation for why it says in

            8  Dr. Tomaszek's records for you of June 13, 2019, that

            9  you underwent an injection in your neck that day?

           10                MR. BICKHAM:  Object to the form.

           11                THE WITNESS:  No.  I was -- nothing was put

           12  on me.

           13       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  So my question, though,

           14  is, do you have any explanation for why it says on

           15  June 13, 2019, Dr. Tomaszek gave you an injection in

           16  your neck on that day?  Do you think that is incorrect?

           17                MR. BICKHAM:  Object to the form.

           18                THE WITNESS:  That is not correct because

           19  that was not the date.

           20       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  When do you recall having your

           21  last neck injection?

           22       A.  If I'm not mistaken, it was March.  Some day of

           23  March.

           24       Q.  Remember the last time you saw Dr. Tomaszek

           25  being told that you have no progressive neurologic

                                                                     106



            1  deficits and no issues which would mandate surgery?

            2       A.  I don't remember that.

            3       Q.  When you have these neck injections by

            4  Dr. Tomaszek, where would you have them done?

            5       A.  VIP Surgery [sic] Center.

            6       Q.  And where is that located?

            7       A.  In Conroe.

            8       Q.  In Conroe, Texas?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  Is that the same place where Dr. Tomaszek has

           11  his office, or is that a different place?

           12       A.  It's a different place.

           13                THE INTERPRETER:  Can I request a

           14  two-minute break?

           15                MR. NEWTON:  You bet.  Almost done.

           16                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record at

           17  5:31 p.m.

           18                (Break taken from 5:31 p.m. to 5:38 p.m.)

           19                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

           20  5:38 p.m.

           21       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Mr. Arredondo, we've

           22  had a chance to take a break.  Are you ready to proceed?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  Okay.  During the break I showed the records

           25  from Dr. Tomaszek to your attorney, and it does show

                                                                     107



            1  that on June 13, 2019, you did undergo your most recent

            2  injection to your neck.  So I didn't want you to think I

            3  just made that up.  Okay?

            4       A.  Okay.  I didn't have an injection on that date.

            5       Q.  Okay.

            6                MR. BICKHAM:  Just wait for the next

            7  question.

            8                MR. NEWTON:  That's right.  Let's just go

            9  to the next -- next exhibit.  Clear it up.

           10                (Exhibit 1020 marked.)

           11       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Let me show you what's been

           12  marked as Exhibit No. 1020 to your deposition.  And

           13  these are records from Tomaszek Neurosurgical

           14  Associates.  Flip through there if you will.  Just kind

           15  of flip through and let me know when you're ready.  I'll

           16  ask you a question.

           17                Ready to go forward?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  Okay.  I'm going to turn to, in your records

           20  from Dr. Tomaszek, page 15 and page 16.  And I want you

           21  to look at page 15.  And this is an operative report

           22  where it talks about you undergoing an injection in your

           23  neck on June 13, 2019.  Will you confirm for me that

           24  that's what it says there on that page?

           25                Do you see where it has your name there,

                                                                     108



            1  Martin Arredondo?

            2       A.  Yes.  Here it is.

            3       Q.  And you see it says June 13, 2019?

            4       A.  I'm looking at it.

            5       Q.  Okay.  And it says:  "Procedure bilateral

            6  foraminal root block C6" -- I don't expect you to

            7  understand what that means.  I'll submit to you, sir,

            8  that that is an injection in your neck.  And it shows

            9  that it was given to you on June 13, 2019, at the VIP

           10  Surgical Center.

           11                Now that you have a chance to look at that,

           12  does that refresh your recollection about having your

           13  most recent injection to your neck in June of this year?

           14       A.  I don't remember.

           15       Q.  Okay.  Do you still maintain that that's

           16  incorrect that the last injection you had to your neck

           17  was March of 2019 and you did not have an injection to

           18  your neck in June of 2019?  Is that still your

           19  testimony?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  So you think this is a mistake in your records?

           22       A.  I believe so.

           23       Q.  Okay.  That's fine.  Okay.  You can just leave

           24  that on the table.  Now if we flip the page to page 17,

           25  we see your name again at the top, and it shows that you

                                                                     109



            1  underwent an injection to your neck on March 28, 2019.

            2  Do you see that sir?

            3       A.  Yes.  I can see it.

            4       Q.  Okay.  Is that the one you remember being the

            5  last time you had an injection to your neck?

            6       A.  Yes.  This is possible.  Yes.

            7       Q.  So you think that -- you still maintain that

            8  the last injection you had to your neck was on March 28,

            9  2019; is that right?

           10                MR. BICKHAM:  Object to the form.

           11                THE WITNESS:  Correct.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Have you talked to anybody at

           13  OSHA or the Chemical Safety Board or the EPA about the

           14  accident at Kuraray?

           15       A.  No.

           16       Q.  If your records at the Texas Rehab Institute

           17  dated May 29th, 2018, say that -- I'm reading now from

           18  page 4 of 5, that date.  "Patient's symptoms appear to

           19  have come on as a result of a motor vehicle accident

           20  consistent with the one described in this report."

           21                Do you recall telling anybody at Texas

           22  Rehab Institute that you had been in a car accident?

           23       A.  No.

           24       Q.  So you think that would be another mistake in

           25  your medical records?

                                                                     110



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  Do you know the total amount of your medical

            3  expenses, sir?

            4       A.  I have no idea.

            5       Q.  Have you paid any medical expenses out of your

            6  own pocket?

            7       A.  No.

            8       Q.  Do you know who has paid your medical expenses?

            9       A.  No.

           10       Q.  Do you know if your attorney has guaranteed

           11  payment of your medical expenses out of any recovery

           12  from your lawsuit?

           13       A.  No.  I do not know.

           14       Q.  Have you received any money from your attorneys

           15  in this case?

           16       A.  No.

           17       Q.  I'm looking at your records from Force

           18  Corporation, sir, and it says that you underwent

           19  training, the Basic Plus course and also the Kuraray

           20  EVAL course, on March 9, 2018.

           21       A.  Correct.

           22       Q.  Does that sound right to you?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  But you've received other safety training

           25  before that, correct?

                                                                     111



            1       A.  Correct.

            2                (Exhibit 1021 marked.)

            3       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Let me show you what's been

            4  marked as Exhibit No. 1021 to your deposition.  And I'll

            5  submit to you that these are your answers to defendant's

            6  first master set of interrogatories.  Flip through this

            7  document, please, sir, if you will, and tell me if

            8  you've ever seen that document before?

            9       A.  I don't remember.  It's possible.

           10       Q.  Okay.  Look at the last page of that document,

           11  please.  Do you recognize your signature on that page?

           12       A.  Yes.  I remember now.

           13       Q.  Okay.  And so now do you remember signing this

           14  particular page for this document which are answers to

           15  questions in your lawsuit?

           16       A.  Yes.

           17       Q.  You remember working with your attorneys or

           18  someone that works for your attorneys to come up with

           19  answers to these questions?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  And do you recall signing this document on

           22  June 10, 2019, as it says on page 6 of this exhibit?

           23       A.  That's correct.

           24       Q.  And did you do that in this office where we are

           25  today?

                                                                     112



            1       A.  Correct.

            2       Q.  Mr. Arredondo, have you ever seen a

            3  psychiatrist or a psychologist for any reason?

            4       A.  No.

            5       Q.  Have you ever been treated for any mental or

            6  emotional condition?

            7       A.  No.

            8       Q.  Have you ever seen a doctor for depression or

            9  anxiety of any kind?

           10       A.  No.

           11       Q.  Have you ever been given medicines for

           12  depression or anxiety?

           13       A.  No.

           14       Q.  Ever been diagnosed with PTSD?

           15       A.  No.

           16       Q.  Have you ever seen a therapist or a counselor

           17  for any mental or emotional condition?

           18       A.  No.

           19       Q.  Now look down at interrogatory number 15 at the

           20  bottom of page 6, please, sir.  And interrogatory

           21  number 15.  That's just a fancy lawyer word for

           22  question.  Now I'm going to read -- read along with me,

           23  if you will.

           24                Number 15 says:  "For each instance in

           25  which you worked at the Kuraray EVAL plant prior to the

                                                                     113



            1  May 19 incident, state the date you worked at the

            2  Kuraray EVAL plant and what your job was."

            3                And read along what your answer is right

            4  here that you swore to as being true and correct.  It

            5  says:  "I started as a welder at the Kuraray EVAL plant

            6  on May 19, 2019."

            7                You see those words there on the page as an

            8  answer to interrogatory number 15?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  But that's not correct, is it?  Or is it

           11  correct?

           12       A.  It is incorrect.

           13       Q.  So do you have any idea how they happen to put

           14  that down there?  Someone did?

           15                MR. BICKHAM:  Objection; form.

           16                THE WITNESS:  I have no idea.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Did you look at these

           18  interrogatories before you signed the last page to them?

           19       A.  I don't remember.  And, besides, I can't -- I

           20  have difficulty reading in English.

           21       Q.  Well, did someone in Mr. Bickham's office here

           22  at Bickham Law, they speak Spanish, right?  Mr. Bickham

           23  does.  Do other people speak Spanish here, as far as you

           24  know?

           25       A.  It's possibly a mistake.  I just don't

                                                                     114



            1  remember.

            2       Q.  Okay.  Do you recall meeting with Mr. Bickham

            3  when you signed these interrogatories on June 10, 2019,

            4  or was it someone else?

            5                MR. BICKHAM:  Don't answer those questions.

            6  Who he met with and who -- who he met with about the

            7  interrogatories --

            8                MR. NEWTON:  That's not -- that's not

            9  privileged.

           10                MR. BICKHAM:  -- is not -- well, I think it

           11  is.

           12                MR. NEWTON:  Who he met with?

           13                MR. BICKHAM:  What you're trying to do is

           14  you're trying to embarrass me.

           15                MR. NEWTON:  No, I'm not.

           16                MR. BICKHAM:  Because someone in my office

           17  made a mistake.

           18                MR. NEWTON:  No, I'm not.

           19                MR. BICKHAM:  You've already covered when

           20  he started working at the Kuraray plant, so, yes, we

           21  obviously made a mistake.  Please move on.

           22                MR. NEWTON:  Just let him -- let him -- let

           23  him -- if that's correct, let him say that.  But he

           24  swore to these being correct.  So I'm just doing my

           25  thing.

                                                                     115



            1                MR. BICKHAM:  Oh, come on.

            2       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Arredondo, did you read

            3  these answers to interrogatories before you signed the

            4  page saying that they were true and correct?

            5                MR. BICKHAM:  Objection to the form.

            6                THE WITNESS:  I must have.

            7       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Do you recall when you signed

            8  this page where your signature appears on page 6 of this

            9  exhibit, do you recall sitting down with someone in

           10  Mr. Bickham's office and having them explain these to

           11  you?  Not just a lawyer but someone who worked for him?

           12  And I don't want to get in to what they told you.  All I

           13  want to know is do you recall someone explaining to you

           14  or reading these answers to you so that you could say

           15  they were true and correct?

           16       A.  Yes.

           17       Q.  Okay.  Now at interrogatory number 16, if

           18  you'll look at the bottom of page 6, it says:  "For each

           19  instance in which you were at the Kuraray EVAL plant or

           20  any reason after the May 19th incident, state the

           21  purpose and the date of each instance."

           22                And turn the page, if you will, and at the

           23  top of page 7 is the answer to number 16.  And it says:

           24  "I never went back to the plant."

           25                Do you see that?

                                                                     116



            1       A.  I could have -- I could not have answered that.

            2       Q.  Okay.  So you think it's incorrect then?

            3       A.  That's incorrect.

            4       Q.  Okay.  All right.  I just wanted to get that

            5  from you.  Okay.

            6                Do you know Fernando Javier Aguilar?

            7       A.  I saw him once or twice.  I don't remember very

            8  well.

            9       Q.  Do you know where he works?

           10       A.  No.

           11       Q.  Did you ever work with him at Force?

           12       A.  When I saw him, he did not work for Force when

           13  I saw him.

           14       Q.  Okay.  Did you ever know him to work at the

           15  Kuraray plant?

           16       A.  Now?

           17       Q.  At any time.

           18       A.  No.  I don't know anything about him.

           19       Q.  Okay.  So you don't know if he worked at the

           20  Kuraray plant on May 19, 2018, or not?

           21       A.  That's where I saw him, but I do not know with

           22  which company he was working with.  He was not working

           23  with Force.

           24       Q.  Okay.  But did you see him at the Kuraray

           25  plant?

                                                                     117



            1       A.  Once or twice perhaps.  I don't remember.

            2       Q.  Did you see him at the Kuraray plant on the day

            3  of the accident, or do you remember?

            4       A.  I don't remember.

            5       Q.  Do you know who Straughn Scott Frier is?

            6       A.  No.

            7       Q.  Almost done.

            8                MR. NEWTON:  Fire drill?

            9                MR. BICKHAM:  Yeah.  We have a fire drill

           10  at 6:00 o'clock.  I didn't think we'd still be here; so

           11  I didn't say anything about it.

           12                MR. NEWTON:  That's all right.  We're

           13  almost done.  Look through my notes here.  Lucky it's a

           14  fire drill and not a real fire.

           15                MR. BICKHAM:  No.  It's a drill.

           16                MR. NEWTON:  We try to plan around our fire

           17  drills.

           18                (Discussion off the written record.)

           19                MR. NEWTON:  Look through my notes, and

           20  we're just about done, sir.

           21       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Do you know what a wind block

           22  is, sir, that you would use as a welder?

           23       A.  Sometimes.

           24       Q.  What is a wind block that you're supposed to

           25  use as a welder?

                                                                     118



            1       A.  We use it in different processes.  For example,

            2  if we're sitting in a place like this one, I would put

            3  like a shield in order to prevent me from seeing the

            4  light.

            5       Q.  It's also to prevent the wind from taking

            6  sparks from the welding and taking it out into the

            7  plant?

            8       A.  Correct.

            9       Q.  Do you recall working for a company called

           10  Performance Contractors?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  When's the last time you worked for them?

           13       A.  I don't remember probably -- it could have been

           14  2013, but I don't remember.

           15       Q.  That's the last time you remember working for

           16  them?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  You remember receiving a verbal warning for

           19  violation of the company policy regarding use of a wind

           20  block?

           21       A.  I don't remember.

           22       Q.  If it says that in your employment records,

           23  would you have any reason to dispute it?

           24       A.  I don't know.

           25       Q.  Can you recall any other time when you were

                                                                     119



            1  reprimanded for received any kind of warning, verbal or

            2  written, for any safety procedure or safety violation?

            3       A.  I don't remember.

            4       Q.  When you would undergo safety training -- did

            5  we talk about this earlier, that you knew that you were

            6  authorized to stop work if you saw an unsafe condition?

            7  Did you tell me that earlier?

            8       A.  Correct.

            9       Q.  Okay.  And so you knew you had the authority to

           10  do that, and you know that as part of your safety

           11  training, right?

           12       A.  Correct.

           13       Q.  When's the first time you recall being told

           14  that, that you had the authority to stop work if you see

           15  an unsafe condition anywhere?  When's the first time you

           16  recall being told that?

           17       A.  I don't remember.

           18       Q.  Do you recall being given a stop-work card as

           19  part of your safety training?

           20       A.  No.  I don't remember.

           21       Q.  Is it possible you got one from Houston Area

           22  Safety Council and just don't remember?

           23       A.  No.  I never received any cards.  Not that I

           24  can recall.

           25       Q.  Did you ever have occasion to stop work at any

                                                                     120



            1  facility where you worked?

            2       A.  Yes.  I stopped somebody from grinding during

            3  the welding process because there was a bucket of paint

            4  nearby.  And I stopped in order to move -- remove the

            5  bucket of paint -- the can of paint.

            6       Q.  Okay.  And I see it in my notes.  You did

            7  receive authorization or information about the

            8  authorization to stop work if you saw something unsafe.

            9  And I recall -- I'm seeing in the notes here that you

           10  did that when you saw a can of paint near someone who

           11  was doing some welding, but actually you think it was

           12  someone grinding; is that right?

           13       A.  Was grinding.

           14       Q.  Was grinding.  Okay.  Wasn't welding.  It was

           15  grinding?

           16                THE INTERPRETER:  It was grinding.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  That was not at Kuraray, was

           18  it?

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  Okay.  No, it was not, right?

           21       A.  No.

           22                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  Thank you, sir.

           23                I pass the witness.

           24                MR. BICKHAM:  Reserve our questions till

           25  the time of trial.

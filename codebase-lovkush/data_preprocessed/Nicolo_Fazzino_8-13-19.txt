          2                 (Fazzino Deposition

          3                 Exhibit 1 so marked.)

          4             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the

          5    deposition of Nicolo Fazzino recorded on

          6    8/13/19 in New Haven, Connecticut.  This

          7    deposition is being taken in the case of

          8    Fazzino versus A.O. Smith Corp., et al., and

          9    was noticed by Christopher Meisenkothen for the

         10    plaintiff.

         11             The videotape operator is Ross Allen

         12    of Geomatrix Productions, 270 Amity Road,

         13    Woodbridge, Connecticut.  Counsel's appearances

         14    will be noted on the stenographic record.  At

         15    this time, could we have stipulations and

         16    swearing, please.

         17             MR. SQUITIERO:  Usual stipulations?

         18             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Yes.

         19             MR. SQUITIERO:  Do you want him to

         20    read and sign or no?

         21             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Yeah, might as

         22    well.

         23             MR. SQUITIERO:  Just for the record,

         24    this is Geoffrey Squitiero for the defense



                                                            10

          1    liaison counsel and for a couple of the

          2    defendants.  It's our position that this is a

          3    newly filed case.  We're not sure that all the

          4    defendants have even been served yet, and so

          5    the defense would like to put on the record

          6    that we are going to contend that an appearance

          7    today or attendance at this deposition, since

          8    it is being done on such short notice, is not a

          9    waiver of any defenses or jurisdictional issues

         10    that may exist.

         11             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  I reserve my right

         12    to argue otherwise, if I have to.

         13             MR. SQUITIERO:  Anybody else have

         14    anything else they want to say?  Okay.

         15         NICOLO FAZZINO, Deponent, having first

         16    been duly sworn by the Notary Public, deposes

         17    and states as follows:

         18                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED

         19    BY MR. SQUITIERO:

         20        Q.   Mr. Fazzino, my name is Geoff

         21    Squitiero, as I said, and I'm going to probably

         22    ask you most of the questions today.

         23        A.   Okay.

         24        Q.   Have you ever gone through this before



                                                            11

          1    where you had to answer questions like this?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   There's a couple of things I want you

          4    to keep in mind so we can make this run as

          5    smoothly as we can.  Okay?

          6        A.   Yeah.

          7        Q.   I'm going to ask you questions.  I'll

          8    ask you to answer them as best you can.  And

          9    one of the most important things is only one of

         10    us should be talking, because the court

         11    reporter here, Linda, she's trying to take down

         12    every word everybody says.

         13        A.   Okay.

         14        Q.   So if you and I are both speaking at

         15    the same time, it's almost impossible for her.

         16        A.   Okay.

         17        Q.   So please try to let me finish asking

         18    the question --

         19        A.   Yeah.

         20        Q.   -- and I'll let you finish the

         21    answers.

         22        A.   Okay.

         23        Q.   If you don't know what I'm talking

         24    about, you don't know a word I'm using, or you



                                                            12

          1    don't understand the question or you didn't

          2    hear the question, anything like that, please

          3    tell me that, and we can have it repeated for

          4    you, or I can say it a different way.  Okay?

          5        A.   Okay.

          6        Q.   But on the other hand, if you answer

          7    the question, we're going to have to figure

          8    that you knew what I was asking you and that's

          9    the answer you meant to give me.  Do you

         10    understand that?

         11        A.   Yeah.

         12        Q.   We'll be asking you about things that

         13    we know happened many, many years ago.  Nobody

         14    remembers everything that happened in their

         15    whole life.

         16             If an answer to a question is "I don't

         17    know," that's a perfectly good answer.  We're

         18    not asking you to guess about things or

         19    speculate about things.  Okay?  Do you

         20    understand that?

         21        A.   Uh-huh.

         22        Q.   If it is a situation where the only

         23    way you can answer is to guess about it, just

         24    tell me, and then we'll move on.  Okay?



                                                            13

          1        A.   Okay.

          2        Q.   As I said, she is taking everything

          3    we're saying down, so I know what you're doing

          4    if you nod your head or you shake your head,

          5    but if I say to you, Is that a yes or is that a

          6    no, it's because we have to have an actual word

          7    so she can type it.  Okay?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   If you need to take a break for any

         10    reason at any time, please let me know.

         11        A.   Okay.

         12        Q.   What's your current address?

         13        A.   It's 105 Lisa Lane.

         14        Q.   Lisa Lane?

         15        A.   Middletown, Connecticut.

         16        Q.   How long have you lived there?

         17        A.   2003.

         18        Q.   Who else lives with you at that

         19    address right now?

         20        A.   Pardon me?

         21        Q.   Who lives with you at that address?

         22        A.   My wife.

         23        Q.   Anyone else?

         18    mechanics were working with?

         19        A.   No, I don't know.  They buy a boiler

         20    and...

         21        Q.   That's probably a good question to ask

         22    you too.

         23        A.   I never look for the boiler.  I was a

         24    helper, you know.

         16    this, and it was -- sometimes, you know, I get

         17    a price on it all the time.  If it was less, I

         18    used to buy.

         19        Q.   Because customers cared about the

         20    price?

         10        Q.   So that would be -- the same would

         11    apply to where you would have bought any

         12    particular boiler?  You're not sure where you

         13    bought it from?

         14        A.   No.  When I get the people, they give

         15    me a list.

         16        Q.   Other than boilers, what other kinds

         17    of plumbing equipment do you remember working

         24    houses?



                                                            99

         18        A.   If it was a boiler, the circulator,

         19    the burner, you know.

         20        Q.   Right.  So a circulator is a pump; is

         21    that right?  A circulator pump?

         22        A.   What do you mean?

         23        Q.   Is that what you're talking about when

          1        A.   A circulator, yeah.

          2        Q.   That's kind of a pump, right?

          8    buy those.

          9        Q.   It's something you used a lot when you

         10    were working on people's boilers?

         11        A.   Yeah.

         12        Q.   You also mentioned burners.  Do you

         13    know who made any of the burners you used to

         14    work with?

         15        A.   What do you mean?

         16        Q.   Didn't you say you worked with burners

         17    sometimes too?  You might have to repair

         18    burners?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   Who made the burners you worked with?

          4    were there to do repairs?

         12    one I buy.  I remember the list.

         13        Q.   So if you worked with boilers at a

         14    business, it would have been one of those names

         15    you listed?

         16        A.   The names I just said.

         19    you couldn't tell me whose boiler was there?

         20        A.   No, I forgot it.  I know there was a

         21    lot.

         22        Q.   It's a long time ago.  It's hard for

          9             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  I think he said

         10    Palmer before.

         11        Q.   Oh, Frank Palmer.  Okay.  Did Frank

         12    Palmer -- was he still working with you at the

         18             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  You might have to

         19    ask it again.

         20        Q.   Do you know what an account is at a

         21    business, you can go charge things?  Did you

          2        Q.   You just remember the three towns you

         11             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  On the record at

         13        Q.   Are you ready to continue?

         14        A.   Okay.

         15        Q.   I want to ask you a couple more

         16    specific questions about boilers.

         17        A.   Boilers.

         18        Q.   So you already told us that there were

         19    times that you would have installed boilers,

         20    right?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   And there were times that you were

         23    involved in removing boilers?

         24        A.   Yes.



                                                           111

          1        Q.   Did you also do maintenance on

          2    boilers, like cleaning boilers?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   How often would you do that?

          5        A.   We do most -- we do one a year, I used

          6    to do.  And then I told the oilmen to do.

          7    Sometimes the customer told me, We want you to

          8    come in here.  I'll go.  I have to go.

          9        Q.   And for the yearly maintenance, was it

         10    something that they called your company to do,

         11    or was it because you were working with an oil

         12    company?

         13        A.   I no work with the oil company.

         14        Q.   It was all directly with you that they

         15    would say they want the maintenance done?

         16        A.   (Nodding.)

         17        Q.   And if we asked you the names of the

         18    companies of the boilers -- the name brands of

         19    the boilers that you removed, you don't know

         20    that list, do you?

         21        A.   No.

         22        Q.   How about anything else that you can

         23    remember -- I'm not going to say it that way.

         24             Let me ask you directly:  You gave us



                                                           112

          1    a list of boiler company names you remember?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   Can you think of any other company

          4    names that you worked with over the years, no

          5    matter what the product was?

          6        A.   What do you mean?

          7        Q.   Other company names that you -- the

          8    products you worked with.  Can you think of any

          9    other company names by the actual name?  Can

         10    you give me a list of boiler companies?

         11        A.   Yeah, I gave you the list.

         12        Q.   Right.  I have that.  Do you know any

         13    other companies that made other products that

         14    you would have worked with when you were

         15    working as a plumber?

         16        A.   No.

         17        Q.   Doesn't come -- nothing comes to mind

         18    right now?

         19        A.   No, I just do my list.

         20        Q.   When you say your list, that's the

         21    names of the list of the boilers we talked

         22    about?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   And that's a list that you made



                                                           113

          1    yourself from your own memory?

          2        A.   I used to do this one all the time, so

          3    I remember.

          4        Q.   The paperwork your attorney filed in

          5    this case says that you're suffering from a

          6    disease, mesothelioma.  Have you heard that

          7    before, that name?

          8        A.   Yeah, I know.  I got that.

          9        Q.   When did you first -- when was the

         10    first time a doctor told you that you were

         11    suffering from that disease?

         12        A.   When was it?  Last year.

         13        Q.   We have some --

         14        A.   I think it was this year.  This year.

         15    Couple of months ago.

         16        Q.   Sometime in 2019?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Do you remember who the doctor was

         19    that told you that?

         20        A.   I don't know.  I don't know the doctor

         21    was.  The name, it was one -- I know -- what is

         22    the name?  I don't know.  I forgot.

         23        Q.   Was it a doctor in Connecticut or up

         24    in Boston?



                                                           114

          1        A.   Connecticut.  I think it's Nicolo.  I

          2    forgot the last name.

          3        Q.   And you have a surgery scheduled?

          4        A.   Yes.

          5        Q.   That's going to be in Boston?

          6        A.   Boston.

          7        Q.   When was the -- where were you told

          8    that you would have to have that surgery?  Do

          9    you remember when they said, We're going to set

         10    that up for you?

         11        A.   It's a month.

         12             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  He's not asking for

         13    the date of the surgery.  He's asking when the

         14    doctors first told you that you might have

         15    surgery.

         16             So when did you first start talking

         17    about surgery with the doctors?  Was it a month

         18    ago?  Was it two months ago?

         19             THE WITNESS:  A month ago.

         20        Q.   And is it Dr. Bueno you're seeing

         21    there?

         22        A.   Yeah.

         23        Q.   How many times have you met with

         24    Dr. Bueno?



                                                           115

          1        A.   A lot of times.  I've been a long time

          2    I'm going.

          3        Q.   More than five times, do you think?

          4        A.   Months.  Months ago.  All the time.

          5        Q.   What did he tell you the surgery is

          6    going to be?  What are they doing for the

          7    surgery?  Did they explain to you what it was?

          8        A.   Yeah, I got to -- I don't know.  I

          9    forgot.

         10        Q.   It's on one of your lungs?

         11        A.   One of my lungs.

         12        Q.   Do you remember which lung it is?

         13        A.   The right, I think.

         14        Q.   What have they told you about what you

         15    can expect after the surgery?  Have they said

         16    how long you have to stay in the hospital?

         17        A.   I don't know.  Maybe a month.

         18        Q.   Are you going to keep seeing that

         19    doctor after the surgery, or are you going to

         20    switch back to a Connecticut doctor?  Do you

         21    know that yet, or after the surgery is done?

         22        A.   I think I got to stay there.  That's

         23    all what I think.

         24        Q.   Did they ask you to do anything



                                                           116

          1    specific to get ready to have the surgery?

          2        A.   Yeah.  I'm all ready.  I got the date.

          3        Q.   What is the date -- do you remember

          4    what the date is?  Is it next week?

          5        A.   Next week, I think, yeah.

          6        Q.   Did you ever have any trouble with

          7    your lungs before the doctor said you had this

          8    disease?

          9        A.   I got a little -- a couple of years.

         10        Q.   What did they say?  What was the

         11    problem before this?

         12        A.   The problem, I get tired.

         13        Q.   Tired like you felt shortness of

         14    breath?

         15        A.   No.  No.  Just tired.

         16        Q.   When did you first notice that you

         17    were feeling tired?

         18        A.   Couple of years, two, three years.  I

         19    don't know.

         20        Q.   Do you remember any of the doctors

         21    that you spoke to about being tired?

         22        A.   My family doctor.

         23        Q.   Who was that?

         24        A.   I don't know the name now.  Dr.

          4        Q.   How long has he been your family

          7    few months.  For a couple of years, he check me

          1        Q.   I'm sure your attorney will give us

          2    the records, and his address will be on there.

          3             Other than Dr. Hirsch and Dr. Bueno,

         23    2003, it says Fazzino Plumbing & Heating, Inc.,

         24    and then it lists a number of addresses, mostly



                                                           130

          1    in the Middletown area; is that correct?

          2        A.   Yeah.

          3        Q.   Have you seen this document before?

          4        A.   No.  I know this.  I ask Chris to do

          5    that.

          6        Q.   Did you ever write down all the names

          7    of these addresses before?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   You did?

         10        A.   I used to do it.

         11        Q.   I understand that what you're saying

         12    is you did work at each of these places.

         13        A.   Yeah, I worked at these places, yeah.

         14        Q.   What I want to know is:  Did you ever

         15    write down these addresses and give it to

         16    Mr. Meisenkothen?

         17        A.   I give it -- I know he write for me.

         18        Q.   Okay.  So you told him, and he wrote

         19    it down?

         20        A.   Yeah.

         21        Q.   How did you come to remember those

         22    addresses?  For instance, there's one here that

         23    says 11 Bellevue Terrace, Cromwell.

         24        A.   Yeah.



                                                           131

          1        Q.   How did you recall that you worked --

          2        A.   Because I used to know that address.

          3    You know, I used to know, and then I went all

          4    the way through to write all this list.

          5        Q.   Did you just use your memory, or did

          6    you look at anything else?

          7        A.   I just remember.

          8        Q.   If I asked you to, like, 11 Bellevue

          9    Terrace in Cromwell, I'm going to ask you, do

         10    you know if that was a house or an apartment or

         11    a three-family house?

         12        A.   House.

         13        Q.   It was a house?

         14        A.   Yeah.

         15        Q.   Do you know any of the people that

         16    live on any of the addresses on this list?

         17        A.   I got the list here.

         18        Q.   Can I see that list?

         19             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  That's a different

         20    list.  You can look at that one.  He can look

         21    at that one too.  That's the products.  And

         22    those are the addresses.

         23             THE WITNESS:  This is addresses?

         24             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Yes.



                                                           132

          1             THE WITNESS:  Okay.  What is the --

          2        Q.   I wanted to see if any of those

          3    addresses that you have, do you know any of the

          4    people that own those properties or live at

          5    those properties?

          6             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Did you understand

          7    his question, Nick?  He wants to know if you

          8    know who owned any of those or who lived at any

          9    of those.

         10             THE WITNESS:  I don't think so.  I

         11    forget the name.  I forgot the name.

         12        Q.   It's a pretty --

         13        A.   I know I used to work there.

         14        Q.   It's a pretty comprehensive list.

         15    What is --

         16        A.   Yeah, because I got 20 years and now I

         17    retire.

         18        Q.   So you're going back through your

         19    memory and trying to figure out what you

         20    remember -- where you remember working, right?

         21        A.   Yeah.

         22        Q.   Is that the complete list of what you

         23    can remember in terms of the locations?

         24        A.   Yeah.



                                                           133

          1        Q.   I assume -- let me ask you this:  Are

          2    there other locations that you can't remember

          3    that you worked at, meaning addresses that you

          4    worked at that you didn't write down because

          5    you couldn't remember where they were?

          6        A.   What do you mean?

          7        Q.   Well, is that every place that you

          8    ever worked?

          9        A.   Yeah.

         10        Q.   Every address that you ever worked at?

         11        A.   I have more.  That's what I remember.

         12        Q.   So those are the ones you remember,

         13    but there were more?

         14        A.   More than this, yeah.

         15        Q.   Can I see that?

         16        A.   Before I had a lot of people.  That is

         17    what I remember.

         18        Q.   And would you be able to identify what

         19    you did at any of these jobsites that are

         20    listed on Exhibit 2?

         21        A.   Let me see.  What you want?

         22        Q.   Well, any of them.  Are you able to

         23    say, the Kidcity one, I did some plumbing work

         24    and I did some boiler work?  Are you able to

         20    the work you did at High Street?  What is it

          8             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Nick, you just --

          9    don't mess with the microphone.  It's affecting

         10    the -- you're not used to being on TV, I know.

         11    Don't touch the mic.

         12        Q.   So after your diagnosis of

         13    mesothelioma, did you go around, drive around,

         14    to locate the places that you had worked in the

         15    past?  For instance, you knew that you worked

         16    at 20 Liberty Street in Middletown.  Did you go

         17    drive around the neighborhood to look for

         18    places that you had worked?

         19        A.   Yeah, when they told me I wasn't --  I

         20    wasn't...

         21        Q.   After you got diagnosed with cancer?

         22        A.   Yes, that's when I go around.

         23        Q.   You drove around, and that's how you

         24    came up with the number -- the names?



                                                           138

          1        A.   That's right.

          2        Q.   And after you did the work there, have

          3    you recently been in any of the buildings that

          4    you listed here?

          5        A.   Yeah.

          8        Q.   Well, you list all these buildings.

          9    What I want to know is:  Since your diagnosis

         10    of cancer, have you gone back to any of those

         11    buildings to look in the basement or anywhere

         12    else?

         13        A.   No.

         14        Q.   You listed a number of boiler

         15    manufacturers earlier, and I think that you

         16    have something in your hand; is that right?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Can I see what you have in your hand?

          7    in front of you all day today while you're

          8    giving testimony?

          9        A.   No.  I ask Chris -- I ask him to write

         10    this.

         11             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  He just wanted to

         12    know if you had that in front of you this

         13    morning.

         14        A.   No.  No.

         15        Q.   When did you -- we broke for lunch,

         16    and then we came back around 1:30.  Did you

         17    have that piece of paper with you starting at

         18    around 1:30?

         19        A.   1:30.

         20             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  I told Geoff when

         21    we sat down.

         22        Q.   So your lawyer provided it to you?

         23        A.   Yeah.  But I know I used to know that

         24    one here.  To write it this way, I got to



                                                           140

          1    remember.

          2        Q.   So it helped you recall --

          3        A.   Yeah.

          4        Q.   -- the names of the products that you

          5    worked with; is that right?

          6        A.   Yeah.

          7        Q.   You gave me -- identified a number of

          8    addresses that are on this list here, Exhibit 3

          9    -- I'm sorry -- Exhibit 2.  Okay?  You told me

         10    about all the names where boilers were?

         11        A.   Right.

         12        Q.   Are you able to tell me the

         13    manufacturer of a boiler at a specific

         14    location?

         15        A.   This boiler here, I know the boilers.

         16        Q.   You know them generally?

         17        A.   But I don't know -- I don't know the

         18    name of the boiler.

         19        Q.   Let me see if I can summarize, I

         20    think, what you're saying.

         21             Is it true that you know the names of

         22    boilers that you encountered, but you don't

         23    know where specifically the address of where

         24    they are; is that right?



                                                           141

          1        A.   That's right.  I know.  The names of

          2    the boilers, I don't know.

          3        Q.   Well, in terms of -- you gave me --

          4    you gave us earlier a list of boilers?

          5        A.   Yes.

          6        Q.   Is there anything that differentiates

          7    one boiler from another, a manufacturer?  Say,

          8    for instance, like a can of Coke or a can of

          9    Pepsi, they have a different color scheme.

         10    They have different symbols on them, logos.  Is

         11    there anything that you can recall --

         12        A.   The color --

         13        Q.   Just let me finish the question.

         14             Is there anything specific that you

         15    recall about any of the boilers you identified

         16    to separate them from one another?

         17        A.   I don't know, but I know the name.  I

         18    don't know the color.  I forget what the color

         19    of it was.

         20        Q.   Do you recall anything specific about

         21    any of the names of the boilers in terms of,

         22    like, say, the lettering of the names or

         23    anything that's specific to one boiler as

         24    opposed to another boiler?



                                                           142

          1        A.   What do you mean?  I don't understand.

          2        Q.   Sometimes, like, Coca-Cola is written

          3    with a certain type of script.

          4        A.   Yeah.

          5        Q.   Is there anything about the names of

          6    the boilers that you worked with that was

          7    different that stood out to you?

          8        A.   I never paid attention to that.  It's

          9    a boiler.  I forgot the color, what it was.  I

         10    used to be, but now, I don't know.

         11        Q.   It was too long ago?

         12        A.   Yeah.

         13        Q.   So when is the last time you worked on

         14    a boiler?  Was it -- strike that.

         15             At one point I thought you had said

         16    that you retired -- I'm sorry.  Your Social

         17    Security printout, I think, shows that your

         18    last earnings for Fazzino Plumbing & Heating

         19    was in 2001.  Is that right, or is it 2003?

         20        A.   What do you mean?

         21        Q.   Well --

         22             MR. LYONS:  Chris, can you just

         23    confirm that?

         24             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Well, the Social



                                                           143

          1    Security records, just for the record, for

          2    Fazzino Plumbing & Heating, Inc., there's

          3    earnings.  The last year is 2001, but then

          4    there's an entry for Nick Fazzino for 2001 and

          5    2002.

          6        Q.   Well, is it true that the last time

          7    that you would have worked on a boiler was

          8    sometime in the early 2000s?

          9        A.   I work the boilers until 2003.

         10        Q.   Until you retired?

         11        A.   Until I retired, yeah.

         12        Q.   And was there -- I assume that part of

         13    your work would be to install new boilers?

         14        A.   New boiler and the plumbing.

         15        Q.   But would you install new boilers in

         16    residential settings?

         17        A.   Lots.

         18        Q.   A lot.  Okay.  Did you have like a

         19    go-to boiler, one that you preferred working

         20    with?

         21        A.   The list, I got all the good, nice

         22    boiler, nice names, you know.

         23        Q.   Was there one that you --

         24        A.   All good boilers.  I wasn't looking



                                                           144

          1    just for a better price.

          2        Q.   But you'd want a quality product too,

          3    correct?

          4        A.   That's part of it, yeah.

          5        Q.   So was it always the price, or were

          6    you looking for a combination of quality and --

          7        A.   For the price and for the -- because

          8    all of them, they're good.

          9        Q.   So was there one boiler manufacturer

         10    that was or a few boiler manufacturers that

         11    were cheaper than others?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   Like, for instance --

         14        A.   Sometimes they give you -- they give

         15    you a little credit.

         16        Q.   Like a rebate?

         17        A.   You pay less.  And then I take it.  I

         18    check all the price for all of this, so who

         19    come in less, I bought.

         20        Q.   Would you pay for it directly and then

         21    charge the homeowner, like, a markup?

         22        A.   What do you mean?

         23        Q.   Well, you'd go to a supply house to

         24    get the boiler, right?



                                                           145

          1        A.   I got to pay.

          2        Q.   You pay?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   Then you charge the person that

          5    your --

          6        A.   I charge the person.

          7        Q.   Was there anything about installing a

          8    new boiler that would have exposed you to

          9    asbestos?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   What?

         12        A.   Because -- because -- can you repeat?

         13        Q.   So in terms of Fazzino Plumbing &

         14    Heating, that job started in -- you started

         15    that company in 1975?

         16        A.   Yeah.

         17        Q.   And in 1975, would you be installing

         18    new boilers at that time?

         19        A.   Yeah.

         20        Q.   And so -- and you did from 1975 to

         21    2003; is that right?

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   And so what I want to know is:  When

         24    you would install a new boiler, just the



                                                           146

          1    installation, would that expose you to

          2    asbestos?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4             DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Objection.

          5        Q.   And how so?

          6        A.   Because when you install the boiler,

          7    you have to put a circulator.  You have to put

          8    a -- you got to put the burner.

          9        Q.   Okay.

         10        A.   That's it.

         11        Q.   What about putting in a circulator

         12    would expose you to asbestos?

         13        A.   Because the gasket.

         14        Q.   Would you manipulate or move the

         15    gasket in some way?

         16        A.   You install it, so you touch.

         17        Q.   Would that come with the circulator,

         18    or would you have to buy it separately?

         19        A.   No, come with the circulator.

         20        Q.   Then you said put in the burner.  How

         21    would that expose you to asbestos?

         22        A.   You have to set up inside the boiler.

         23        Q.   Was there anything about the burner

         24    itself that exposed you to asbestos?



                                                           147

          1        A.   I think so.

          2        Q.   How so?

          3        A.   Because it's all asbestos.  It's --

          4    sometimes a little bit outside.  You feel it.

          5        Q.   On the burner itself?

          6        A.   You feel it.  Yes.

          7        Q.   So the burner that you worked with

          8    would have asbestos on it?

          9        A.   I'm sure it was asbestos.

         10        Q.   Did you ever have to insulate a

         11    boiler?

         12             MS. PATCH:  Objection.

         13        A.   What do you mean?

         14        Q.   Did you ever put asbestos insulation

         15    around a boiler?

         16             MS. PATCH:  Objection.  Overly broad.

         17             MR. LYONS:  My question is overly

         18    broad.  Okay.

         19             MS. PATCH:  You're asking about all

         20    boilers.

         21             MR. LYONS:  Okay.

         22        Q.   Did you ever put asbestos insulation

         23    around a boiler?

         24        A.   Insulation inside the boiler?



                                                           148

          1        Q.   Not inside.  Around the outside of a

          2    boiler?

          3        A.   Sure.  You put it outside the boiler.

          4    You put the jacket.  You put the -- before you

          5    do, there's things you put -- you put a rope.

          6    You install the rope, install, at the time you

          7    put the rope.

          8        Q.   Where would you install the rope?

          9        A.   Inside the -- oh, boy.  Inside -- no.

         10    The sections.  The sections, one another.  All

         11    right.  You put the asbestos, the rope, all the

         12    way around from one side to the other side.

         13    And then you put together.

         14        Q.   Do you know who manufactured the rope?

         15        A.   I think -- let's see.  I forgot that.

         16        Q.   Okay.  Now, in terms of -- other than

         17    the circulator, the burner, and the rope, when

         18    you would install a new boiler, was there

         19    anything else that would expose you to asbestos

         20    other than those three things?

         21        A.   Oh, a lot of stuff, you know.

         22        Q.   Like what?

         23        A.   You take the old one out.  All right?

         24        Q.   What's that?



                                                           149

          1        A.   You have to take the old --

          2             MR. HOOVER:  I just got an e-mail

          3    saying the conference telephone line is cut

          4    out.

          9             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record

         10    at 2:03.

         11        Q.   You talked about the circulator, the

         12    burner, and the rope.  Was there anything about

         13    -- on new installation.

         14        A.   New installation.

         15        Q.   Anything other than those three things

         16    that you believe exposed you to asbestos?

         17        A.   The old one, it's worse.

         18        Q.   But that's a removal, right?

         19        A.   Removal.

         20        Q.   So I'm just talking about the

         21    installation --

         22        A.   Yeah.

         23        Q.   -- of a new boiler?

         24        A.   Well, if you started the new one, when



                                                           150

          1    you do the section, put it together.  You put

          2    in all the rope.  After the boiler is tied up,

          3    everything is completed, you put the shirt.

          4    You put insulation from the top of the boiler.

          5    All right?

          6        Q.   You put insulation on the top of the

          7    boiler?

          8        A.   The boiler.

          9        Q.   Was that a --

         10        A.   Insulation.  It's a...

         11        Q.   Was it like a mix that you would use,

         12    like a powder mix, or was it like a blanket?

         13        A.   Like a blanket, but it's asbestos

         14    blanket.

         15        Q.   And does the name Pittsburgh Corning

         16    sound familiar to you?

         17        A.   I don't know.  I forgot.

         18        Q.   How about Owens-Corning?

         19        A.   Owens-Corning.

         20        Q.   Do you know any of the names of the

         21    manufacturers of the asbestos that you put on

         22    top of the --

         23        A.   I don't know.

         24        Q.   Let me just finish.  On top of the



                                                           151

          1    boilers, do you remember the names of the

          2    insulation companies that manufactured that?

          3        A.   The company, I don't know.

          4        Q.   You don't know?

          5        A.   No.  I buy the supply house with the

          6    boiler.  They come inside.  That's it.

          7        Q.   You bought it at the supply house?

          8        A.   You buy the supply house, the boiler,

          9    and then they send you the asbestos and

         10    everything.

         11        Q.   The supply house would provide you

         12    with that?

         13        A.   The cord, yes.

         14        Q.   Would you actually physically pick up

         15    the boiler from the supply house, or would you

         16    have it delivered to the address that you --

         17        A.   Delivered to the place.

         18        Q.   So when you went -- would you call the

         19    supply house and say, I need this type of

         20    boiler, what kind of price do you have; please

         21    deliver it to this address?  Or would you go to

         22    the supply house and pick it up?

         23        A.   No.  I call to send them to the job.

         24        Q.   And did they bring it down into the



                                                           152

          1    basement, or did you have to do that?

          2        A.   I have to do that.

          3        Q.   When it came to you, was it in a

          4    cardboard box, or was it in a crate?  How did

          5    it come?

          6        A.   Depended.  Some come in a section, and

          7    some was completed.

          8        Q.   Now, your career was, at least

          9    according to this, about 28 years at Fazzino

         10    Plumbing & Heating?

         11        A.   Yeah.

         12        Q.   During that time, did there come a

         13    period of time where you became aware of the

         14    dangers of asbestos?

         15        A.   We never know.  Nobody talking about

         16    that, paying attention.  We know -- in 1990,

         17    then we started -- they started to know.  We

         18    started to know, and we stopped.

         19        Q.   Let me see if I can clarify this.

         20             Sometime in the 1990s, you became

         21    aware of the dangers of asbestos and --

         22        A.   We stopped at the time.

         23        Q.   When you say "we stopped," does that

         24    mean that --



                                                           153

          1        A.   Everybody stopped.

          2        Q.   Everybody in the industry?

          3        A.   Everybody know.  Before that, we don't

          4    know.  I think it was the stuff to put in the

          5    boiler.

          6        Q.   The first time that you knew about the

          7    dangers of asbestos was sometime in the 1990s?

          8        A.   '90s.  Yeah.

          9        Q.   Did you ever wear a mask, a paper

         10    mask, a respirator, or anything from 1975 until

         11    the time you began --

         12        A.   No.  We don't know.

         13        Q.   I know you're trying to be helpful

         14    with the answers, but it makes it very hard for

         15    Linda to take down two people talking.

         16        A.   Okay.

         17        Q.   If you can just let me finish.  I know

         18    you know where I'm going.

         19             Did you ever wear a mask or a

         20    respirator or any sort of breathing equipment

         21    while working for Fazzino Plumbing & Heating?

         22        A.   Can you repeat?

         23        Q.   Yes.  Did you ever wear any sort of

         24    respiratory mask or any sort of equipment on



                                                           154

          1    your mouth to prevent you from breathing dust

          2    while working for Fazzino Plumbing & Heating?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   How about prior to --

          5        A.   We don't know.  I don't know.

          6        Q.   How about when working at Bacon

          7    Brothers or Matteo Plumbing, did you ever wear

          8    a mask there?

          9        A.   No.

         10        Q.   Did you ever see anybody else wearing

         11    a mask?

         12        A.   No.  Nobody else.  We don't know at

         13    that time.

         14        Q.   We talked about installation of

         15    boilers.  Any of the jobs that are listed here,

         16    were they new construction, or were they

         17    renovations?

         18        A.   New stuff.

         19        Q.   All of it was new stuff?

         20        A.   New stuff.  Taking out the old one to

         21    put in the new one.

         22        Q.   Was there any new construction,

         23    meaning, someone had just built a house and

         24    they called you and they needed -- or in the



                                                           155

          1    process of building a house and they needed to

          2    install a boiler?

          3        A.   Yeah.

          4        Q.   Did you ever have that happen to you,

          5    or was it all just take out the old boiler, put

          6    in the new one?

          7        A.   Which one?  Can you repeat?

          8        Q.   Yeah.  Did you ever have a situation

          9    where you installed a new boiler at a new home?

         10        A.   What do you mean?

         11             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Did you put in a

         12    completely new boiler into a completely new

         13    building?

         14             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

         15             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  That's what he's

         16    asking you.

         17        Q.   You did that at times?

         18        A.   Yeah.

         19        Q.   And were there times where you would

         20    remove a boiler and put in a new one?

         21        A.   And sometimes remove it and install.

         22        Q.   And do you know any of the names of

         23    the manufacturers of the boilers that you

         24    removed from a location?



                                                           156

          1        A.   I never paid attention just to look at

          2    it.

          3        Q.   When you removed them, you never paid

          4    attention to the names of them?

          5        A.   The names.

          6        Q.   And the reason why you know the names

          7    of the ones you installed was because you

          8    ordered them on the phone?

          9        A.   No, because I ordered them.  We go --

         10    -- the time, we put a boiler, a big boiler.

         11    Then when I check, I make it exactly the BTU I

         12    need for the house.

         13        Q.   On most of the work that you did, I

         14    see a lot of addresses here that look like they

         15    may be residential units.

         16             Was most of the work that you did for

         17    Fazzino Plumbing & Heating residential boilers?

         18        A.   Residential, yeah.

         19        Q.   They were mostly residential?

         20        A.   Mostly residential.

         21        Q.   One of the ones you mentioned was a

         22    middle school.  Do you know what year you did

         23    work at the middle school?

         24        A.   I don't know.  I forgot now the date.



                                                           157

          1        Q.   Would you know if it was the 1970s,

          2    '80s, or '90s?

          3        A.   End of the '70s and the '80s, I think.

          4    I don't know.

          5        Q.   So just focus --

          6        A.   I forgot it now.

          7        Q.   So you don't know --

          8        A.   Exactly when I did, you know.

          9        Q.   Let's just start again, because I

         10    think we're talking over one another.

         11             The middle school that you referenced

         12    earlier, do you know what decade you did the

         13    work there?  Was it the 1970s, '80s, '90s?

         14        A.   I don't know the date exactly.  It was

         15    in the '70s.

         16        Q.   In the '70s.  Okay.  And Kidcity, you

         17    said -- it says here covent on Broad Street.

         18    Was that a convent?

         19        A.   What?

         20             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Typo.  It was a

         21    convent that was converted into Kidcity Museum.

         22    It's there now.

         23        Q.   Do you know when you did the work on

         24    the convent in Middletown, whether it was the



                                                           158

          1    '70s, '80s, '90s?

          2        A.   I don't know the date.

          3        Q.   There is another one, the Florence

          4    Stillman School.  Do you remember that on

          5    Loveland Street?

          6        A.   Loveland Street, yeah.

          7        Q.   Do you know when you did the work

          8    there?

          9        A.   I don't know the date, you know.  We

         10    do every day, every day.  I don't remember the

         11    date when you put it there.

         12        Q.   I want to talk to you a little bit

         13    about your work in general.  How much of your

         14    work for Fazzino Plumbing & Heating was

         15    bookkeeping, recordkeeping, administrative type

         16    of things, or did you have someone that did

         17    that for you?

         18        A.   What do you mean?

         19        Q.   So you had to make sure that you sent

         20    the bill to the person that you're -- did your

         21    wife help you with the bills?

         22        A.   Yes, she send the bill to the

         23    customer.

         24        Q.   Okay.  And would there be times where



                                                           159

          1    you would do plumbing work as well when you

          2    were working for Fazzino Plumbing & Heating?

          3        A.   Yeah.

          4        Q.   There would be?

          5        A.   What do you mean?

          6        Q.   Well, you were a plumber?

          7        A.   Yeah.

          8        Q.   And some of that work, I assume, would

          9    involve things like fixing toilets, installing

         10    toilets?

         11        A.   Yeah.

         12        Q.   Installing showers?

         13        A.   Yeah.

         14        Q.   Those types of things, right?

         15        A.   Yeah.

         16        Q.   Can you say what percentage of the

         17    work that you did for Fazzino Plumbing &

         18    Heating was installing and removing boilers?

         19        A.   We never do a percentage.

         20        Q.   Could you estimate it, though?

         21        A.   We used to estimate every job.

         22        Q.   What I'm trying to get is:  How much

         23    time would you spend doing the boiler work

         24    compared to the other type of work you do as a



                                                           160

          1    plumber?

          2        A.   The plumber used to -- new houses take

          3    longer.

          4        Q.   A new house takes longer?

          5        A.   To install.  The boiler, one day, we

          6    finish.

          7        Q.   So removing a boiler and installing

          8    it, you can do it in a day in a residential

          9    setting?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   Would it take you a full day?

         12        A.   Two guys.

         13        Q.   Two guys, a full day?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   In terms of the removing of a boiler,

         16    do you believe you were exposed to asbestos as

         17    a result of removing a boiler?

         18        A.   Oh, yes.

         19        Q.   How so?

         20        A.   Because you have to take the boiler

         21    off, you know, and make a lot of dust from the

         22    asbestos.

         23        Q.   Would you take -- would you remove it

         24    from the lines?  There's pipes hooked into the



                                                           161

          1    boiler, right?

          2        A.   Yeah.

          3        Q.   Would you disconnect the boiler?

          4        A.   You want to -- how did we do it?

          5        Q.   Yeah.

          6        A.   The job?

          7        Q.   Yeah.

          8        A.   Okay.  So we put the boiler, sections

          9    and bring it down the stairs.  And then we shut

         10    off the water, the power off, and we started

         11    water.  We started taking -- first we take the

         12    circulator off, the burner off.  And then it

         13    was a gasket.  The gasket, we got to scrape.

         14    And that's a lot of dust.

         15        Q.   That's a gasket when you're removing

         16    the boiler?

         17        A.   Removing, yeah.  A lot of stuff that

         18    comes out, you know.  And the burners and

         19    things.  And then when you take the section

         20    out, the rope becoming like a dust.  That's all

         21    the stuff.

         22        Q.   Were you able to take the boiler out

         23    in one piece, or did you have to take it apart?

         24        A.   We take it apart because we have to



                                                           162

          1    take the sections out.

          2        Q.   Was it mostly sectional boilers you

          3    were working with?

          4        A.   It depends.  It depends on the house,

          5    how big they are.

          6        Q.   When you installed new boilers in a

          7    house, was there a range of BTUs?  In terms of

          8    what was the lowest BTU and what was the

          9    highest?

         10        A.   Before they used to put a lot of BTU

         11    in the boiler.  There no need.  Then they

         12    figure out how much BTU you got to be.  Then we

         13    order the right BTU for the job.

         14        Q.   For the job?

         15        A.   For the job.

         16        Q.   What would do you with the old boiler

         17    when you took it apart?

         18        A.   We take it apart, and we deliver to

         19    the junk place.

         20        Q.   Was there a certain junkyard you would

         21    go to?

         22        A.   Junkyard, yeah.

         23        Q.   Was there one that would go to

         24    frequently?



                                                           163

          1        A.   We take it off.  We take it back.

          2             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  He's wondering

          3    which junkyard you went to.

          4             THE WITNESS:  Oh, I don't know at that

          5    time.

          6        Q.   Was there one in the Middletown area

          7    that you'd go to?

          8        A.   Middletown area, yeah.  There was one

          9    in Portland and one in Middletown.  Depended

         10    where was the job.

         11        Q.   Did you advertise at all, or was it

         12    all word of mouth?

         13        A.   I had a lot customers.

         14        Q.   You had a lot of customers?

         15        A.   A lot of customers.  Over time, yeah,

         16    you know the times.

         17        Q.   In terms of places you lived, do you

         18    believe you were exposed to asbestos at any of

         19    the places you lived from any product?

         20        A.   I don't understand.

         21        Q.   So some people have asbestos

         22    insulation in their attic.  They need to remove

         23    it, or they had it in their attic.  What I want

         24    to know -- some people have asbestos shingles



                                                           164

          1    on their home.  I want to know if you believe

          2    you've been exposed to asbestos in any of the

          3    places where you've lived?

          4        A.   No, when I was living, I was living

          5    most of the time, new house.

          6        Q.   How about, have you ever done any work

          7    on cars?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Other than your occupation, being a

         10    plumber, is there any other ways that you think

         11    that you were exposed to asbestos?

         12        A.   Well, what do you mean?  What do you

         13    mean?  Can you explain to me?

         14        Q.   Yeah.  So one of your claims is you

         15    were exposed to asbestos from your work.

         16        A.   Yeah.

         17        Q.   Where you were getting paid to do

         18    certain work.  What I want to know is:  Do you

         19    think you were exposed to asbestos outside of

         20    your work in any way?

         21        A.   No.  See, if you outside working, I

         22    mean, I don't get asbestos.  I get asbestos

         23    when I'm inside, when you change something or

         24    when you installing something, you know.



                                                           165

          1        Q.   There was a reference that you had

          2    prostate cancer at one point; is that true?

          3        A.   Cancer now, I got.

          4        Q.   No.  I know you do now.  Maybe I

          5    missed the record, but was there -- were you

          6    ever diagnosed with prostate cancer or any

          7    issues with your prostate?

          8        A.   When?

          9        Q.   Any time.

         10             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Do you remember any

         11    issues with your prostate at all?

         12             THE WITNESS:  The prostate, yeah.

         13             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  That's what he's

         14    asking you.

         15        Q.   Did you ever have cancer on the

         16    prostate?

         17        A.   I don't think so.

         18        Q.   Have you ever been diagnosed with

         19    cancer other than your mesothelioma?

         20        A.   No.

         21        Q.   What is the surgery that you're

         22    undergoing?  What is it that they're going to

         23    do?

         24        A.   What do you mean?



                                                           166

          1             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Geoff went through

          2    that stuff this morning, and he answered the

          3    questions as best as he could.

          4             MR. LYONS:  To the extent he knows.

          5        Q.   Do you know what they're going to --

          6    what type of surgery you're going to undergo?

          7        A.   It's got to be a tough job.

          8        Q.   It's going to involve your lungs?

          9        A.   The lungs.

         10        Q.   Earlier you gave information about the

         11    different manufacturers of boilers?

         12        A.   Yeah.

         13        Q.   Are you able to determine or state

         14    which ones you encountered more so than others,

         15    or were they all -- is there one or more that

         16    you used more frequently than others?

         17        A.   What do you mean?

         18        Q.   Well, you gave a couple of names of

         19    boiler manufacturers.  What I want to know is:

         20    Is there one that you would encounter that you

         21    would deal with more often than others?

         22        A.   I don't know what...

         23             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  The names of the

         24    boilers --

          1             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

          2             MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  The names of the

          3    boilers you mentioned this morning, were there

          4    any of those that you used more often than

          5    other ones?

          6             THE WITNESS:  No.

          7             MR. LYONS:  All right.  Thank you for

          8    your time, Mr. Fazzino.  I don't have any

          9    further questions at this point.

          15   BY MR. ARNER:

          16   Q.     Good morning, sir.

          17   A.     Good morning.

          18   Q.     Can I have you state your full name

          19   for the record.

          20   A.     My name is Khaaliq Branch.

          21   Q.     Have you ever given a deposition

          22   before?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     I'm going to go through and give you

                                                            6



           1   some instructions on how this process is

           2   going to work, okay?

           3   A.     All right.

           4   Q.     We're here for a question-and-answer

           5   session.  I'm going to be asking you

           6   questions.  You're going to be responding to

           7   them.  There is a court reporter seated to

           8   your left.  She's taking down all those

           9   questions, your answers, and anything your

          10   attorney might want to add to this

          11   proceeding, okay?

          12   A.     Okay.

          13   Q.     I'm going to ask that you verbalize

          14   your responses and you keep your voice up so

          15   that everybody in the room can hear you,

          16   okay?

          17   A.     Okay.

          18   Q.     If I ask you a question that you don't

          19   understand, please don't answer it.  Just let

          20   me know; say I don't understand what you're

          21   asking me.  I'll try to rephrase it so that

          22   you do understand it and can provide me an

          23   answer, okay?

          24   A.     Yes.

           1   Q.     I'm not here to trick you today.  I'm

           2   trying to gather information about this

           3   accident.  If you don't know the answer to my

           4   question, it's okay to tell me I don't know

           5   as long as that's the truthful response.

           6   It's also okay to tell me you don't recall

           7   because this may have happened some time ago

           8   and you don't remember what happened or you

           9   don't remember the answer to a particular

          10   question I have.

          11          If I ask you for something like speed,

          12   distance, or time and you don't exactly know

          13   but you can provide us with a reasonable

          14   estimation or approximation, I ask that you

          15   do that, but let us know.  Let us know that

          16   you are approximating or estimating.  I'm

          17   sure your lawyer doesn't want you guessing at

          18   things today.  I don't want you guessing at

          19   things today.  I want as accurate information

          20   as you can, all right?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     If you need to take a break here at

          23   any point, please just ask me, and I will

          24   accommodate you.  I just ask, if I have a

                                                            8



           1   question pending, you answer it and then

           2   we'll take a break, okay?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     I don't expect to be here too long

           5   with you today, but there are some areas I

           6   have to cover.

           7          Do you understand those instructions?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Also, just for her sake, if I ask you

          10   a question and I haven't finished my

          11   question, allow me to get the whole question

          12   out and I'll give you time to answer.  That

          13   way you and I aren't speaking over one

          14   another, okay?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     Let me have your date of birth.

          17   A.     8/2/92.

          18   Q.     I'm going to show you what's been

          19   marked as Branch-1.  These are your answers

          20   to interrogatories.  I'm going to show you

          21   the last page there.

          22          My question is, is that your

          23   signature?

          24   A.     Yes.

           2   kids' mother, too.  So they just said they're

           3   laying me off anyway.  So that's why I

          15   A.     It was early.  It wasn't raining or

          16   anything.  I believe it started raining

          17   afterwards, though.

          18   Q.     Do you know if the roadways were slick

          19   at the time of the accident?

          20   A.     No, it wasn't.

          21   Q.     Why don't you tell me what happened.

          22   A.     When I turned to come down the ramp to

          23   merge onto the southbound to go towards south

          24   Philadelphia, there was a car in front of me.

           1   I had to slow down.  When I slowed down, I

           2   probably was doing about 15 miles.  It's not

           3   that long until you get to where you're at.

           4          When I slowed down, there was a car in

           5   front of me waiting to get on.  When I slowed

           6   down, three seconds later an impact came

           7   behind me.

           8   Q.     Were you moving or stopped?

           9   A.     No, I was stopped.  I was at a

          10   complete stop.

          11   Q.     How long were you stopped for before

          12   the impact occurred?

          13   A.     About two to three seconds, tops.

          14   Q.     How would you classify the impact

          15   itself?  Was it light, medium, hard,

          16   somethings else?

          17   A.     It was hard.  It was a nice impact.

          18   Q.     What was the first thing that you did

          19   after the impact?

          20   A.     I was stuck for a little, like a split

          21   second or two.  I was stuck, and when I

          22   looked back, I seen the guy that hit me.  He

          23   was in the Acura.  When I got out of the car,

          24   I was startled a little bit.  I was like,

                                                           25



           1   what's going on?  You're coming fast down the

           2   ramp.  He said I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

           3   I said, I understand that.  At first, I

           4   forgot that I just put the car seats in

           5   there.  So I'm thinking I'm just happy that

           6   my kids wasn't in there because it was a nice

           7   impact.  It was that.

           8          We called the cops.  They said, being

           9   as though there wasn't nobody hurt for real,

          10   no deaths or anything, no major injuries,

          11   just go to the side of the road or pull off

          12   and pull the cars by wherever Main Street at.

          13   That's what happened.

          14   Q.     Now, whose car were you driving on the

          15   date of the accident?

          16   A.     I was driving my kids' mother's car.

          17   Her name is Andrea Sheard.

          18   Q.     Is Andrea the owner of the vehicle, or

          19   is that your kids' mom?

          20   A.     She's the owner of the vehicle.

          21   Q.     Who's Genevede Sheard?

          22   A.     That's her mother.

          23   Q.     Is she the owner of the car, do you

          24   know?

                                                           26



           1   A.     I thought that Andrea was the owner of

           2   the car.  I just thought that Genevede

           3   co-signed for her.

           4   Q.     Andrea is your kids' mother?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     What kind of car was it?

           7   A.     It was a Chevy Malibu.

           8   Q.     At any point after the accident, did

           9   you have an opportunity to look at the damage

          10   to the Malibu?

          11   A.     Yes, I had walked around the car, took

          12   pictures of his car.

          13   Q.     What did you see, if anything, to the

          14   back of Ms. Sheard's car?

          15   A.     It was dented in a little, and I think

          16   the trunk was up a little bit.

          17   Q.     Did you see any other damage?

          18   A.     No, I just seen the back damage.

          19   Q.     I got two photographs here of what I

          20   believe to be the back of the car.  They're

          21   marked as Branch-2 and Branch-3.  Take a look

          22   at them real quick.

          23          Is that the car, first of all?

          24   A.     This is the car.

                                                           27



           1   Q.     Looking at both photographs, does it

           2   show the damage that you can see?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     In particular, you pointed to

           5   Branch-3, and I think you pointed out how the

           6   fender is kind of pulled apart or pulled out?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Did you see any other damage to the

           9   vehicle as you were walking around?

          10   A.     That's about it, just those damages.

          11   Q.     Other than what you already told me,

          12   did you have any further conversation with

          13   the guy who struck you?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     Was that car equipped with airbags?

          16   A.     Andrea's car?

          17   Q.     Yes.

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     Did they go off?

          20   A.     They didn't go off.

          21   Q.     Did you or any part of your body

          22   strike anything inside the vehicle?

          23   A.     I don't believe.  I know I was back

          24   and forward.  It was a long time, but I don't

                                                           28



           1   believe so.

           2   Q.     Now, did the police eventually come?

           3   A.     Yes, they're the ones that helped us

           4   on the side on the shoulder.

           5   Q.     Did you speak to the police officer?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Tell me about the conversation you had

           8   with the officer.

           9   A.     I just told him what happened, and he

          10   asked the guy, how was you saying that you

          11   were going 15 miles per hour.  He was getting

          12   on him about how you're coming dawn the ramp

          13   that fast because his car was totaled, and he

          14   wrote down the incident report.

          15   Q.     Did he ask you if you were injured?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     Did you respond to that?

          18   A.     I told him that I was hurting, my back

          19   and my neck, but it was more so my neck.

          20   Q.     Did he call an ambulance for you?

          21   A.     No, he told me I should just go to the

          22   hospital.

          23   Q.     Did you go to the hospital?

          24   A.     Yes, I did.

                                                           29



           1   Q.     When did you go to the hospital?

           2   A.     I believe I went to the hospital

           3   either that day or the next day.  I can't

           4   recall.  I believe it was the next day.

           5   Q.     How long were you at the accident

           6   scene for in total?

          10   scene?

          11   A.     I had to get the car to the next exit.

          12   I can't tell you what the next exit is.  It's

          13   by Main Street, though.  It was a gas

          14   station.  I had to get the car towed.

          15   Q.     The car was towed to the gas station?

          16   A.     No.  I was able to still drive the

          17   car, just the back was messed up.  I was

          18   still able to operate the car and drove to

          19   the gas station, but I got it towed because

          20   she called about the accident.

          21   Q.     Who?  Ms. Sheard?

          22   A.     Yes.

                                                           30



           1   A.     I believe it was her that called.

           2   Q.     When you say her, is that Andrea?

           3   A.     Andrea.  I believe it was Andrea

           4   Sheard.  I never really got a chance to talk

           5   to her about it because she was pissed off.

           6   Q.     Where did you go when you left the gas

           7   station?

           8   A.     After that, I called my brother.  He

           9   had a car.  He had a vehicle.  He came and

          10   got me.

          11   Q.     Where did he take you?

          12   A.     He took me to my mom's house.  I was

          13   exhausted being as though I was getting up

          14   early.

          17   Q.     The next day you ended up going to the

          18   hospital?

          19   A.     I believe so.

          20   Q.     That's what I think I saw.

          21          Where did you go?

          22   A.     I went to Methodist.

          23   Q.     Same hospital that you went before?

          24   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     When did you first feel the back pain?

          15   A.     It came probably a few days

          16   afterwards.  It was like my back go in and

          17   out.  It's really my neck.  My neck is the

          18   one that gave me the problem the most.

          19   Q.     When you ended up going to the

          20   hospital at Methodist, when you got there, on

          21   a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being no pain, 10 being

          24   went to the hospital the next day?

           5   Q.     Now, at some point, you ended up

           6   treating with Dr. Bowden again?

           8   Q.     Do you know when you started with him?

           9   A.     I can't recall that.  I don't know.

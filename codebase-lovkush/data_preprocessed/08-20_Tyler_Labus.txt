          11   BY MR. GORODETZER:

          12   Q.     Good morning, Mr. Labus.

          13   A.     Good morning.

          14   Q.     My name is Aaron Gorodetzer.  I'm an attorney and I

          15   represent Sherrilyn Hensley.  You understand that?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     And just for the record, your father, Gregory

          18   Labus, is sitting in the room with us today?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     And per representation of your counsel, he is not

          21   going to be called as a witness in this matter?

          22                  MS. BARBETTA:  That's correct.

          23                  MR. GORODETZER:  Okay.

          24   BY MR. GORODETZER:

          25   Q.     Mr. Labus, have you ever given a deposition before?
                                                                      5



           1   A.     No, I have not.

           2   Q.     All right.  I'm gonna give you some basic

           3   instructions.  A deposition is a question-and-answer

           4   session.  Do you understand that?

           5   A.     Yes, I do.

           6   Q.     And we have a court reporter here who's taking down

           7   our -- the questions and answers, so one of the things I'd

           8   ask you to do to keep the record clean is that you wait

           9   'til I finish asking my question before you give your

          10   answers, so that way we keep the record clean.  Do you

          11   understand that?

          12   A.     Yes, I do.

          13   Q.     One of the things you've done well so far is you've

          14   given verbal responses.  So while I might understand a

          15   "uh-huh" or a head nod or a -- I'd ask that if the answer

          16   requires a verbal response, that you give a verbal

          17   response.  Do you understand that?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     And I'm sure if you don't, somebody will say, "Yes

          20   or no?" and get you to -- trigger you to do it.

          21                  Also, I'd ask you not to anticipate where

          22   I'm going with the question.  You might think I'm going

          23   one way with the question, and I might totally change my

          24   line of thinking and ask a completely different question,

          25   which, if you anticipate, you might give the right answer
                                                                      6



           1   to the wrong question.  You understand that?

           2   A.     Yes, I understand.

           3   Q.     If at any point -- if I ask a question, I'm gonna

           4   presume you understood it if you give an answer.  If you

           5   don't understand a -- a question or you need it repeated,

           6   please feel free to do that.  Do you --

           7   A.     I understand.

           8   Q.     -- understand that?

           9   A.     I'm sorry.  Yes, I understand that.

          10   Q.     You also understand that your testimony today is --

          11   while we're in this informal setting, is under oath as if

          12   we were sitting inside a courtroom, correct?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     And we're not here to ask you to guess about

          15   anything today, but if you can estimate something, just

          16   let me know that you're estimating.  Do you understand

          17   that?

          18   A.     Yes, I -- I do understand that.

          19   Q.     Are you under -- have you taken any drugs, alcohol,

          20   or any meditations that would prevent you from providing

          21   testimony today?

          22   A.     No, I have not.

          23   Q.     And you understand that we're here today regarding

          24   a March 3rd, 2017 automobile accident?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                      7



           1   Q.     And it's my understanding that that accident

           2   happened at the intersection of Route 202 and Oakland Road

           3   in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     And it would be a fair statement on -- on that

           6   date, you were operating a 2005 Chevy Malibu?

           7   A.     Yes, that's correct.

           8   Q.     And the color of that vehicle was white?

           9   A.     Silver.

          10   Q.     Silver.  And the owner of that vehicle would be

          11   your father, Gregory Labus?

          12   A.     That is correct.

          13   Q.     And you were driving it permissively?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     And on that date, the car was in good working

          16   order?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     No mechanical issues that you were aware of?

          19   A.     Not to my knowledge.

          20   Q.     And it's my understanding that the accident

          21   happened approximately 6:00 p.m. that night?

          22   A.     Yes, I believe so.

          23   Q.     And you were traveling on your way to work at

          24   Carrabba's?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                      8



           1   Q.     At that time, what was your job duties at

           2   Carrabba's?

           3   A.     I was a host.

           4   Q.     And how long had you been a host at Carrabba's

           5   prior to the accident?

           6   A.     Between one and one and a half years approximately.

           7   I'm estimating.

           8   Q.     And what were your hours at Carrabba's?

           9   A.     My hours were usually from 2:00 or 3:00 in the

          10   afternoon to about 10:00 or 11:00 in the evening.  I'd

          11   like to also note that that was not always the case.

          12   Sometimes, you might come in around 5:00 or 6:00.

          13   Q.     On March 3rd, do you know what time you were

          14   supposed to be at Carrabba's?

          15   A.     I don't recall exactly.

          16   Q.     Do you still work at Carrabba's?

          17   A.     I do not.

          18   Q.     When did you stop working at Carrabba's?

          19   A.     Last summer.

          20   Q.     So the summer of 2018?

          21   A.     Correct.

          22   Q.     And why did you stop working at Carrabba's?

          23   A.     I started working a different job.

          24   Q.     And what's your -- what was your new job?

          25   A.     Math tutoring.
                                                                      9



           1   Q.     Who was your supervisor at the Carrabba's?

           2                  MS. BARBETTA:  At the time of the accident?

           3                  MR. GORODETZER:  At the time of the

           4   accident.

           5                  THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure how to answer

           6   this question.  There could be two answers.

           7   BY MR. GORODETZER:

           8   Q.     Well, okay.  Let me try and flesh that out.  Who

           9   would have been in charge of your work schedule at

          10   Carrabba's at the time of the accident?

          11   A.     Primarily, the assistant manager, and then, of

          12   course, the manager and owner also.

          13   Q.     Do you -- are -- do you know if the manager slash

          14   owner is still the same today as it was back on the date

          15   of accident?

          16   A.     I don't know for sure.

          17   Q.     Well, what was the name of the person?

          18   A.     I -- I don't recall her last name.  I do recall her

          19   first name.

          20   Q.     What was her first name?

          21   A.     Eleanor.

          22   Q.     And this would have been the Carrabba's in the

          23   shopping center right on 202, before you get to Route 1?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     So if I call it the Route 1, 202 Carrabba's, you'd
                                                                     10



           1   know what I was talking about?

           2   A.     I would.

           3   Q.     Do you recall if you were late for work on

           4   March 3rd, 2017?

           5   A.     I don't recall exactly.

           6   Q.     And on March 3rd, 2017, you were on your way to the

           7   Route 1, 202 Carabba's, traveling from your home -- your

           8   address at the time of 143 Lydia Lane in West Chester?

           9   A.     Yes, that's correct.

          10   Q.     And do you recall being involved in a motor vehicle

          11   accident on March 3rd, 2017?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     And could you tell me -- describe to me, in your

          14   words, what happened.

          15   A.     I was coming from home, on my way to work.  And as

          16   I was approaching the light, I was trying to get through a

          17   yellow so that I could get to work.

          18   Q.     How fast were you traveling?

          19   A.     I don't recall exactly.  I'd be estimating that it

          20   was somewhere around 60 miles per hour.

          21   Q.     And the posted speed limit on Route 202 Southbound

          22   in that direction would be 45 miles an hour?

          23   A.     I don't know for sure, but I believe so.  I believe

          24   that's correct.

          25   Q.     Do you recall:  Were you accelerating to try and

           1   get through the yellow light, or were you slowing down or

           2   keeping a steady speed?

           3   A.     I don't remember exactly.

           4   Q.     So as you were trying to get through the yellow

           5   light, what happens next?

           6   A.     As I'm getting under the light, the other car was

           7   also going under the light, and we T-boned.

           8   Q.     And when you say "T-boned," what part of your car

           9   struck the other vehicle?

          10   A.     My front end of my car struck the -- the passenger

          11   side of their car, the broad side.

          12   Q.     And did your airbags go off?

          13   A.     My airbag did go off.

          14   Q.     And prior to impact, do you recall striking your

          15   brakes?

          16   A.     I do believe I recall stepping on the brakes prior

          17   to impact.  There was a very short amount of time to do

          18   so, but I do remember trying to step on the brakes.

          19   Q.     How much time elapsed from the time you first saw

          20   the other vehicle 'til the time of impact?

          21   A.     I don't know.

          22   Q.     Would you say it was less than five seconds?

          23   A.     I can't say.  I don't remember.  I'm not sure.

          24   Q.     So after the impact, tell me what happened.

          25   A.     After the impact, well, the -- the cars sort of
                                                                     12



           1   spun to what would have been my right.  And didn't feel

           2   very well.  Felt -- you know, it wasn't fun.

           3                  And then, I tried to get out of my car, and

           4   the car door needed some force getting open.  Some

           5   Samaritans came out of their cars and helped myself and, I

           6   believe, her out of her car.  Well, at least I know a

           7   Samaritan helped me get out of my car.  I guess I don't

           8   know about...

           9   Q.     At the time of the accident, did you have a cell

          10   phone?

          11   A.     I did.

          12   Q.     And were you using your cell phone at any time

          13   prior to impact?

          14   A.     No, I was not.

          15   Q.     Do you recall what -- do you still have the same

          16   cell phone number?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     And what is that?

          19   A.     (484)631-6164.

          20   Q.     And do you know who the carrier for that cell phone

          21   was at the time of the accident?

          22   A.     I don't.

          23   Q.     Who's your current carrier?

          24   A.     I don't know.

          25   Q.     You don't know who your cell phone carrier is?
                                                                     13



           1   A.     I -- I don't know, actually.

           2   Q.     Who pays for your cell phone?

           3   A.     My father.

           4   Q.     Would your father know who your cell phone provider

           5   was at the time of the accident?

           6   A.     I believe so.

           7   Q.     All right.

           8                  MR. GORODETZER:  You see that?  You said he

           9   wasn't gonna be a witness.

          10                  MS. BARBETTA:  We can provide the cell

          11   phone provider.

          12                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yeah.  I appreciate it.

          13   Yeah.  I would ask that just -- I will -- certainly, once

          14   I get the transcript, I -- I always hate when somebody

          15   tries to make me remember what I want after a deposition,

          16   so I will shoot you a follow-up letter.

          17                  MS. BARBETTA:  Just send me an email, and

          18   I'll send you a --

          19                  MR. GORODETZER:  Perfect.

          20                  MS. BARBETTA:  -- information on it.

          21                  MR. GORODETZER:  It may have been part of

          22   my document request anyway, so whatever -- the cell phone

          23   records, texts, data, voice.

          24                  MS. BARBETTA:  Well, usually, you would

          25   have to subpoena those.  If we don't have them, we don't
                                                                     14



           1   provide them.

           2                  MR. GORODETZER:  Okay.  Sometimes, it's --

           3   they can just go back into their logs and print that

           4   stuff.

           5                  MS. BARBETTA:  Yeah.

           6                  MR. GORODETZER:  If you want me to subpoena

           7   it, I'll subpoena it.  That's fine, but --

           8                  MS. BARBETTA:  Okay.

           9   BY MR. GORODETZER:

          10   Q.     And at the scene, tell me -- you got out of your

          11   car.  What happens next?

          12   A.     I was -- walked over to a sidewalk, and I sat down.

          13   Some of the Samaritans asked me how I was doing, if I was

          14   okay.  And then shortly, there were police and an

          15   ambulance on scene.

          16   Q.     Do you have the names of any of these Samaritans?

          17   A.     I do not.

          18   Q.     Did any of them leave you their contact

          19   information?

          20   A.     No.

          21   Q.     Did you say -- what did you tell the Samaritans?

          22   A.     I answered their questions about how I was feeling

          23   and if I was okay.  I said, "I'm okay, I think."

          24   Q.     Were you injured at all in this accident?

          25   A.     Not severely.  I had a slight concussion and some
                                                                     15



           1   cuts from the broken glass, and I think that that was the

           2   extent of any injury.

           3   Q.     Did you file a medical claim through any insurance

           4   company -- or any auto insurance?

           5   A.     I don't know.

           6                  MS. BARBETTA:  I'm not aware of any claim.

           7                  MR. GORODETZER:  Okay.

           8   BY MR. GORODETZER:

           9   Q.     So you're sitting on the sidewalk.  What happens

          10   next?

          11   A.     Eventually, a police officer comes up to me and

          12   wants to know if he can talk to me and ask me some

          13   questions.

          14   Q.     Then what happens?

          15   A.     I answered the police officer's questions.

          16   Q.     And what did you tell the police officer?

          17   A.     I don't remember exactly.

          18   Q.     All right.  After you get done talking to the

          19   police officer, what happens next?

          20   A.     I waited on the curb for a couple more minutes.

          21   And then, eventually, an ambulance was there, and some of

          22   the EMT people spoke to me.  And then, I was transported

          23   to a hospital.

          24   Q.     Did either of your parents arrive on the scene?

          25   A.     No.
                                                                     16

           3   Q.     Which hospital did you go to?

           4   A.     I don't remember.

           5   Q.     At any point after the accident, prior to going to

           6   the hospital, did you contact your parents?

           7   A.     Can you repeat the -- can you repeat the question,

           8   please.

           9   Q.     Yes, sir.  At any time prior to leaving the scene

          10   to go to the hospital, did you contact your parents?

          11   A.     I don't believe I did.

          12   Q.     So other than the Samaritans and the police

          13   officer, did you speak to anybody else at the scene?

          14   A.     The EMT people.

          15   Q.     EMT people.  Besides them, anybody else?

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.     You didn't speak to my client at all at the scene?

          18   A.     That is correct.

          19   Q.     Have you ever spoken to my client?

          20   A.     I have not.

          21   Q.     Do you know if she was injured in this accident?

          22   A.     I don't know for sure.  From what I've been told,

          23   she --

          24                  MS. BARBETTA:  Objection.

          25                  I don't want you to answer anything that
                                                                     17



           1   you've been told by Counsel --

           2                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yes.  Correct.  So --

           3                  MS. BARBETTA:  -- as a result of the

           4   accident.

           6                  MS. BARBETTA:  So just based on if you know

           7   at --

           8                  MR. GORODETZER:  Based on your personal

           9   knowledge.

          10                  MS. BARBETTA:  -- at the scene of the

          11   accident.

          12                  THE WITNESS:  Based on my personal

          13   knowledge, I do not know if she's injured -- or was

          14   injured.

          15   BY MR. GORODETZER:

          16   Q.     All right.  It would be a fair statement that you

          17   never called to see how Ms. Hensley was doing at any

          18   point?

          19   A.     No, because I haven't spoken to her.

               2        reporter is Amy Larson and will now swear in

               5                        SHARON M. ZURN,

               6             a witness in the above-entitled action,

               7             after having been first duly sworn, was

               8             deposed and says as follows:

               9

              10                          EXAMINATION

              11    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              12    Q.  Ms. Zurn, you understand that the oath that

              13        you have given is the same oath that you

              14        would be given in a court of law and comes

              15        with the same penalties of perjury?

              16    A.  Yes.

              17    Q.  Now, the court reporter is taking down every

              18        spoken word, so nods or head shakes cannot be

              19        transcribed by the court reporter.

              20                 Also, the court reporter can only

              21        take down what is being said by one person at

              22        a time.  I, therefore, ask that you wait

              23        until I finish my questions before you

              24        answer, and I will provide you with the same

              25        courtesy or try to.


                                                                     8


               1                 Understood?

               2    A.  Okay.  Yes.

               3    Q.  If you don't understand a question, please

               4        let me know.  If you do answer my question, I

               5        will assume that understand and answer -- you

               6        understood and answered the question that I

               7        asked.

               8                 Do you understand?

               9    A.  Yes.

              10    Q.  Please do not guess in response to my

              11        questions.  However, I am entitled to your

              12        best estimate.  Do you understand the

              13        difference between a guess and an estimate?

              14    A.  Yes.

              15    Q.  Is there any reason you cannot go forward

              16        with providing your best testimony today?

              17    A.  No.

              18    Q.  Is there any reason you cannot testify fully

              19        and truthfully?

              20    A.  No.

              21    Q.  Are you under the influence of any drugs,

              22        alcohol or medications that may affect your

              23        ability to respond to my questions fully and

              24        truthfully?

              25    A.  No.


                                                                     9


               1    Q.  If you need a break, just feel free to ask,

               2        okay?

               3    A.  Okay.

               4    Q.  Do you have any questions regarding the

               5        deposition process before we start?

               6    A.  Not at this time.

               7    Q.  Have you ever been deposed before?

               8    A.  Yes.

               9    Q.  Okay.  So then you know that your counsel may

              10        make objections during the deposition.  And

              11        the purpose of the objection is for the judge

              12        to review that objection later.  So an

              13        objection is not an instruction to not

              14        answer.  So unless you're instructed not to

              15        answer the question by your counsel, please

              18    A.  Yes.

              19    Q.  Okay.  How many times have you been deposed

              20        before?

              21    A.  Once.

              22    Q.  Can you describe the proceeding in which you

              23        were deposed?

              24    A.  Are you asking the specific subject for which

              25        I was deposed?


                                                                    10


               1    Q.  Yes.

               2    A.  I was asked to provide subject matter

               3        expertise relating to a claim on warranty for

               4        our implantable cardiac rhythm devices.

               5    Q.  Okay.  Have you ever testified at trial?

               6    A.  No.

               7    Q.  Okay.  Are you appearing at this deposition

               8        as the corporate representative of

               9        Boston Scientific Corporation?

              10    A.  Yes.

              11    Q.  Okay.  What is your position -- or --

              12                    MR. ROBINSON:  Just to clarify

              13        that, Counsel, it's for two topics that she's

              14        here as the corporate representative, topic 4

              15        and topic 7.

              16                    MR. ELLERBE:  Correct.  Okay.

              17        Thank you.

              18    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              19    Q.  Are you currently employed by

              20        Boston Scientific Corporation?

              21    A.  I am.

              22    Q.  What is your current position?

              23    A.  I am director of global post market quality

              24        assurance.

              25    Q.  And how long have you been at


                                                                    11


               1        Boston Scientific?

               2    A.  I started in 1999 and worked until 2012, and

               3        then I left the company to go to a different

               4        company that Boston later acquired in 2015,

               5        so I've been back since 2015.

               6    Q.  And in 1999 were you working at Guidant or

               7        Boston Scientific?

               8    A.  Guidant.

               9    Q.  And then Guidant was acquired by

              10        Boston Scientific in 2006; is that right?

              11    A.  Yes.

              12    Q.  So for that whole period you were

              13        working first at Guidant and then

              14        Boston Scientific, but was it all the cardiac

              15        rhythm management group?

              16    A.  Correct.

              17    Q.  And what was your position at

              18        Boston Scientific/Guidant in 2007 through

              19        2009?

              20    A.  So it varied, but I believe in 2007 I was the

              21        manager of device tracking.  And then

              22        sometime in 2008 I became the director of

              23        post market within the cardiac rhythm

              24        management division, and that covered 2008

              25        and 2009.


                                                                    12


               1    Q.  Okay.  And was that a position in the quality

               2        group?

               3    A.  Yes.

               4    Q.  So was your -- was the person you reported to

               5        Bill Young?

               6    A.  In -- when I became the director, that is

               7        correct, in 2008.

               8    Q.  And before that who did you report to?

               9    A.  I'm trying to remember in -- when I was

              10        managing device tracking.  I can't remember

              11        if Bill Young was still there or if I

              12        reported to, I think it was, Noel Colon, who

              13        would have been a director.

              14    Q.  Okay.  And can you describe your official

              15        duties as the manager of device tracking?

              16    A.  I was responsible for ensuring that all the

              17        cardiac rhythm management devices were

              18        tracked in accordance with the FDA device

              19        tracking regulations 821, so I oversaw the

              20        operations that involved collecting device

              21        tracking registrations and the process that

              22        made sure that we continued to follow those

              23        patients, including the physician they

              24        were -- that saw the patient, where the

              25        patient resided, from the point that the


                                                                    13


               1        patient received the device until the device

               2        came out of service.

               3    Q.  And would you also track whether the patient

               4        died or not?

               5    A.  We would do our best to capture if there was

               6        a death, correct.

               7    Q.  Can you describe your official duties as

               8        director of post market -- I'm sorry, can you

               9        describe what that --

              10    A.  Post market quality assurance.

              11    Q.  Can you describe what those -- what your

              12        position entailed there?

              13    A.  To clarify, you're talking about when I was

              14        in the role in 2008 and 2009?

              15    Q.  That's correct.

              16    A.  Okay.  In that role I was responsible for the

              17        post market operations for the cardiac rhythm

              18        management division, which included device

              19        tracking, it included post market, which was

              20        our complaint handling, as well as our

              21        failure analysis lab, which received returned

              22        explanted products and did analysis testing.

              23    Q.  What percentage of devices were returned to

              24        the failure analysis lab for testing?

              25                    MR. ROBINSON:  I'm going to object


                                                                    14


               1        to the form of the question as being outside

               2        the scope of the topics for which Ms. Zurn

               3        has been designated as a corporate rep.  She

               4        can answer the question, but only in her

               5        individual capacity.  The answer is not going

               6        to be binding on the corporation.

               7                 You can answer the question.

               8                    MR. ELLERBE:  Your objection is

               9        noted for the record.  I think that's a

              10        matter that would have to be decided by the

              11        judge, and I'll just note that for the

              12        record.

              13                    MR. ROBINSON:  I just think I need

              14        to put you on notice about that when you go

              15        out of scope.

              16                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.  Understood.

              17                    THE WITNESS:  Can you please

              18        restate the question again now?

              19                    MR. ELLERBE:  Sure.

              20    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              21    Q.  What percentage of devices were returned to

              22        the failure analysis lab for testing?

              23    A.  And I'm interpreting the question to be

              24        returned relative to those that had a

              25        complaint?


                                                                    15


               1    Q.  Sure.

               2    A.  To the best of my recollection, approximately

               3        20 to 25 percent.

               4    Q.  Okay.  So was MDR reporting one of the

               5        subjects over which you had managerial

               6        authority?

               7    A.  Yes.

               8    Q.  Can you explain what an IDE is?

               9    A.  I will tell you to the best of my knowledge.

              10    Q.  Okay.

              11    A.  It stands for investigational device

              12        exemption.  My understanding is it's a

              13        process through the FDA by which a device

              14        that's not yet fully market approved is

              15        allowed to be implanted through some sort of

              16        a clinical study.

              17    Q.  Okay.  Do you know whether there was an IDE

              18        that applied to Cognis and Teligen?

              19    A.  I believe there was.

              20                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to scope.

              21                 You can answer the question.

              22                    THE WITNESS:  I believe the answer

              23        is yes, there were -- there was.

              24    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              25    Q.  And do you know when that IDE went into


                                                                    16


               1        effect?

               2    A.  I -- I -- into effect as when it started?

               3    Q.  Correct.

               4    A.  I don't know the date.

               5    Q.  Okay.  Would it have been before 2007?

               6    A.  I honestly don't know.

               7    Q.  Okay.  Did a company like Boston Scientific

               8        have any obligation to report on events that

               9        occurred during an IDE?

              10                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              11                 You can answer.

              12                    THE WITNESS:  Answer?

              13                 Did the company have an obligation

              14        to report -- can you please restate?

              15                    MR. ELLERBE:  Sure.

              16    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              17    Q.  Did Boston Scientific have any obligation to

              18        report on any adverse events that happened

              19        during an IDE?

              20    A.  Yes.

              21    Q.  Okay.  Can you describe what that obligation

              22        was?

              23    A.  The obligation would be governed under the

              24        IDE process.  So for any clinical study there

              25        is typically a protocol that describes the --


                                                                    17


               1        how an adverse event would be defined for

               2        that particular study, and that would also

               3        govern what types of adverse events would be

               4        reported.

               5    Q.  Okay.  Now, did Boston Scientific submit a

               6        supplemental PMA for the Cognis and Teligen

               7        devices to the FDA in December of 2007?

               8                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to scope.

               9                 You can answer if you know.

              10                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know for

              11        sure.  I can't say for certain.

              12    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              13    Q.  Do you know whether Boston Scientific

              14        submitted a supplemental PMA for Cognis and

              15        Teligen?

              16    A.  My best, not guess, but estimation, is I

              17        believe they would have.

              18    Q.  And does the December 2007 time period sound

              19        right to you?

              20    A.  I don't know.

              21    Q.  Okay.  Now, once a supplemental PMA -- strike

              22        that.

              23                 Would there be an IDE for a device

              24        before a supplemental PMA was submitted?

              25                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to scope.

               1                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

               2    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               3    Q.  You don't know -- can you describe the

               4        sequence in the development of a device and

               5        how -- strike that.

               6                 Can you describe how the IDE and the

               7        supplemental PMA interact in terms of the

               8        sequence of the development of a device?

               9                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to scope.

              10                 You can answer if you can, but...

              11                    THE WITNESS:  The best of my

              12        knowledge is an IDE study is undertaken to --

              13        from a clinical study perspective that is

              14        part of then a submission to the FDA, it's

              15        part of the data that goes into the FDA in

              16        terms of seeking approval for that device to

              17        market it.

              18                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              19    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              20    Q.  Now, once a supplemental PMA is submitted for

              21        a device, do the rules change as to what kind

              22        of events need be to reported to the FDA?

              23                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to scope.

              24                 You can answer if you can.

              25                    THE WITNESS:  I'd like you to


                                                                    19


               1        clarify the question, because I want to make

               2        sure I understand what you're asking.

               3                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

               4    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               5    Q.  So let's say that there was an IDE for a

               6        device first.  Do you understand?

               7    A.  Yup.

               8    Q.  Okay.  And then a supplemental PMA is

               9        submitted.

              10    A.  Uh-huh.

              11    Q.  Now, you had testified earlier that the IDE

              12        would describe what kind of events needed to

              13        be reported to the FDA, right?

              14    A.  Correct.

              15    Q.  Now, once that supplemental PMA is submitted,

              16        does anything change in terms of reporting on

              17        adverse events or is it the same rules apply?

              18    A.  I think it depends on whether -- are you

              19        asking before -- we submit it in there's a

              20        time period, have we gotten approval from the

              21        FDA to market that product?

              22    Q.  Sorry?

              23    A.  Because once it's marketed, then, yes, the

              24        rules change in terms of it becomes a post

              25        market -- becomes governed under the 803


                                                                    20


               1        regulation.

               2    Q.  I'm talking about the time period between

               3        when the supplemental PMA is submitted and

               4        when it is approved by the FDA.

               5    A.  So I will tell you the answer to that is the

               6        803 regulations would not kick in until

               7        approval, so that gap period would not

               8        require MDR reporting.

               9    Q.  Okay.  And I'm -- okay.  Understood.  Thank

              10        you.

              11                 And are there any other rules and

              12        regulations that apply during that dependency

              13        of the supplemental PMA?

              14                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to scope.

              15                    THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure what

              16        specifically you're asking.  It's a -- it's a

              17        little bit of a vague question for me.

              18                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              19                    THE WITNESS:  Can you help

              20        clarify?

              21                    MR. ELLERBE:  Sure.

              22    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              23    Q.  I'll take it -- maybe if we go with a

              24        different line of questions --

              25    A.  Okay.


                                                                    21


               1    Q.  -- maybe it'll help explain.

               2                 Do you know whether

               3        Boston Scientific began implanting Cognis and

               4        Teligen devices -- strike that.

               5                 Do you know whether doctors began

               6        implanting the Cognis and Teligen devices in

               7        patients outside of the United States before

               8        the FDA approved the supplemental PMA for the

               9        Cognis and Teligen devices?

              10    A.  I believe the answer is yes, as part of the

              11        clinical study.

              12    Q.  Okay.  And do you know whether those implants

              13        took place before or after the supplemental

              14        PMA was submitted?

              15    A.  I don't know for certain.  My estimate --

              16        best estimation would be they probably would

              17        have.

              18    Q.  Probably would have what?

              19    A.  The implants would have -- outside the U.S.,

              20        would have been occurring prior to our

              21        submission to the FDA.

              22    Q.  Okay.  I'm going to represent to you that the

              23        implants took place after the supplemental

              24        PMA was submitted.

              25    A.  Okay.


                                                                    22


               1    Q.  So my question is:  What were the

               2        requirements in terms of reporting on those

               3        events that occurred in those implants

               4        outside of the United States while the

               5        supplemental PMA was pending, but before it

               6        was approved by the FDA?

               7    A.  Is your question relative to clinical

               8        reporting obligations or post market

               9        reporting obligations?

              10    Q.  Well, let's take both.

              11    A.  Okay.  So the question again is post

              12        supplement to the FDA, but -- I want -- I'm

              13        sorry, you've asked a lot of pre and post.

              14    Q.  Sure.

              15    A.  Could you please restate?

              16    Q.  Sure.  And maybe I'll just make further

              17        representations as to the timeline --

              18    A.  Okay.

              19    Q.  -- and to aid you in answering the questions.

              20                 So the supplemental PMA for the

              21        Cognis and Teligen devices were -- I'll

              22        represent that that was submitted to the FDA

              23        in December of 2007.

              24    A.  Okay.

              25    Q.  And I'll further represent that doctors began


                                                                    23


               1        implanting the Cognis and Teligen devices in

               2        patients outside the United States in

               3        February of 2008.

               4    A.  Okay.

               5    Q.  And then I will finally represent that the

               6        FDA approved the supplemental PMA for the

               7        Cognis and Teligen devices in -- on -- on or

               8        about May 8th, 2008.

               9    A.  Okay.

              10    Q.  So my question is what were the requirements

              11        for reporting on adverse events that occurred

              12        in those outside the United States implants

              13        before the FDA approved the supplemental PMA?

              14    A.  Okay.  I'll answer from an MDR first --

              15    Q.  Okay.

              16    A.  -- because it's probably easier for me.  The

              17        MDR 803 rules do not apply until a device is

              18        marketed or approved.

              19    Q.  Okay.

              20    A.  So if you're telling me the approval was in

              21        May of 2008, it would have been upon approval

              22        that at that time we would have began

              23        reporting for an MDR.

              24    Q.  Okay.

              25    A.  Relative to IDE, my answer is that they would


                                                                    24


               1        follow the clinical study protocol that was

               2        in place.

               3    Q.  Okay.

               4    A.  So whatever the protocol stipulated relative

               5        to adverse event reporting is what would have

               6        been reported.

               7    Q.  Okay.  Is the outside the United States

               8        territory sometimes referred to as OUS?

               9    A.  Yes.

              10    Q.  Okay.  Can you explain what MDRs are?

              11    A.  Yes.  MDR stands for medical device report.

              12        It is a requirement from the FDA as part of

              13        the 803 regulation on informing the FDA of

              14        certain types of events that happen once a

              15        device is approved for market release.

              16    Q.  Okay.  So let's look at an exhibit.  And it

              17        is Bates-stamped TEMP-BSC00113311.

              18                    (Exhibit 1 marked.)

              19    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              20    Q.  Okay.  Do you recognize this document?

              21    A.  I do.

              22    Q.  Okay.  Can you explain what it is?

              23    A.  It is a memo documenting minutes from a QSAT

              24        meeting from November of 2008.

              25    Q.  Okay.  And what is a QSAT meeting?


                                                                    25


               1    A.  I believe the acronym stood for Quality

               2        System Assurance Team.

               3    Q.  And were you on the QSAT?

               4    A.  I was not, I don't believe, a formal member,

               5        but I periodically attended them depending on

               6        the topic.

               7    Q.  Okay.  Did you attend this meeting?

               8    A.  Apparently I did.  I see my name as an

               9        attendee here.

              10    Q.  Okay.  And do you see there are action items

              11        in the bottom half of the page?

              12    A.  I do.

              13    Q.  Okay.  And do you see that two of the action

              14        items are assigned to you; is that right?

              15    A.  I do.

              16    Q.  Okay.  Can you describe what those action

              17        items are?

              18    A.  Give me a minute to read it, please.

              19    Q.  Sure.

              20    A.  (Reviews document.)  So the first one is an

              21        action to ensure that we looked at the

              22        definition of similar product in the FDA

              23        regulations and made sure that we were

              24        appropriately applying it.

              25                 And I believe the second one is an


                                                                    26


               1        action to -- after we went back and looked at

               2        those, anything else that we deem not

               3        reportable just to verify that that was the

               4        accurate assessment.  That's the best of my

               5        recollection.

               6    Q.  Okay.  Can you explain the first part of that

               7        first action item -- excuse me -- that says,

               8        "Ensure procedures clearly state ambiguous

               9        events require reporting to the FDA"?  Can

              10        you explain what that means?

              11    A.  So I -- I don't remember exactly, but I will

              12        tell you what I would interpret it today as

              13        being.

              14    Q.  Okay.

              15    A.  Is the regulations are not black and white,

              16        and our analysts are forced every day to make

              17        judgment and exercise based on their

              18        interpretation of the regulation.  We have

              19        procedures that do the best we can to make

              20        that as easy for them so there isn't

              21        ambiguity.  And my interpretation here would

              22        be there was something that we identified

              23        that wasn't as clearly documented as we could

              24        have made it, so the action was to go back

              25        and try and remove that ambiguity to make it


                                                                    27


               1        clearer, our interpretation of the

               2        regulations, so that our analysts could

               3        appropriately report.

               4    Q.  So you're saying that this does not mean that

               5        in case an event is ambiguous as to what may

               6        have happened, it should be reported to the

               7        FDA, that's not what this means?

               8    A.  I'm reading it saying ensure that -- the

               9        action is to ensure our procedures clearly

              10        state that there was some -- as I said

              11        earlier, we want to make our procedures as

              12        clear as possible.  I'm reading this to say

              13        we wanted to look at our procedures to look

              14        at how best to remove ambiguity related to

              15        what was reportable to the FDA under the MDR

              16        regulation.

              17    Q.  But here the word ambiguous, it's describing

              18        events; is that right?

              19    A.  Yes.

              20    Q.  Okay.  So is this talking about events that

              21        were ambiguous or policies that were

              22        ambiguous?

              23    A.  The procedures are in place to interpret

              24        events.  Events do not come in black and

              25        white.  They often come in with varying --


                                                                    28


               1        varying degrees of information.  And so the

               2        ambiguous events oftentimes require

               3        additional information that we have to seek

               4        to clarify.  And, again, I'm -- you asked

               5        what I'm interpretation of this action item

               6        was.  It was to go ahead and make sure that

               7        our procedures are updated to make it easier

               8        for our analysts to review ambiguous events

               9        to make sure that they come up with a

              10        consistent and correct MDR reporting

              11        decision.

              12    Q.  So this phrase does not mean that ambiguous

              13        events do require reporting to the FDA, that

              14        ambiguous -- strike that.  I'm sorry, I have

              15        more questions, more documents.

              16                 Now we're going to look at Zurn 2,

              17        and it is Bates-stamped BSC_Higgins-00338611.

              18                    (Exhibit 2 marked.)

              19    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              20    Q.  Take as much time as you need to to review

              21        that.

              22    A.  (Reviews document.)

              23    Q.  I should have said, you know, the way that

              24        these e-mail chains work is you have to start

              25        at the back --


                                                                    29


               1    A.  Which is what I did exactly.

               2    Q.  Okay.

               3    A.  -- so I can reacquaint myself.

               4        (Reviews document.)

               5    Q.  I'll just let you know, you take as much time

               6        as you need, but my questions are going to

               7        deal with your e-mail on the second page --

               8    A.  Okay.

               9    Q.  -- that ends in 12.

              10    A.  Okay.  (Reviews document.)

              11                 Okay.  I'm sure I'll want to read it

              12        again when you ask, but at least I've

              13        acquainted myself with it.

              14    Q.  Sure.  So can you just describe generally

              15        what this document is?

              16    A.  It's an e-mail chain among a number of people

              17        within the quality and clinical space

              18        discussing feedback received through FDA on

              19        MDR reporting and reporting under clinical

              20        studies.

              21    Q.  Okay.  So do you see the e-mail that you

              22        wrote on June 15th and sent at 5:13 p.m. that

              23        appears on the page that ends in 12?

              24    A.  I do.

              25    Q.  Okay.  And who were the people you were


                                                                    30


               1        sending this to?

               2    A.  Chris Harrold at the time would have been our

               3        vice-president of regulatory for the CRM

               4        division.  Bill Young would have been our

               5        vice-president of quality for the CRM

               6        division.  Steve McQuillan was in clinicals.

               7        I don't remember his title.

               8        Greg Voss was in clinicals, and Erika Huffman

               9        was a manager in the post market team.

              10    Q.  Okay.  So did she work under you at this

              11        point in time?

              12    A.  Yes.

              13    Q.  Okay.  Now do you see the fifth bullet point

              14        down in your list of bullet points that

              15        begins with, "Based on our QSAT deep dive"?

              16    A.  I do.

              17    Q.  And does that refer to the meeting whose

              18        minutes we just looked at?

              19    A.  It refers to a QSAT.  I can't tell you if

              20        it's the exact QSAT meeting, because they

              21        were held periodically.

              22    Q.  Okay.

              23    A.  But it does refer to that same forum.

              24    Q.  Okay.  Can you explain what you're saying in

              25        this bullet point?


                                                                    31


               1    A.  Let me read it one more time --

               2    Q.  Sure.

               3    A.  -- and then I will answer.

               4        (Reviews document.)

               5                 Okay.  So at one point in time

               6        the -- our interpretation of the FDA

               7        regulations related to similar was not as

               8        broad as we ultimately made it, meaning it

               9        had to be more specific.

              10                 The regulations don't tell you the

              11        definition of similar, so our interpretation

              12        at the time was more limited such that when

              13        that COGENT 4 study was taking place, it did

              14        not meet the definition of similar at that

              15        time, so we were not filing MDRs.

              16                 What this is saying is based on

              17        learning from that deep dive, which I believe

              18        came through some feedback that we got from

              19        FDA on another site within the Boston

              20        Scientific family, but not within the CRM or

              21        the management division, we took and listened

              22        to that feedback and figured out we -- we

              23        should be looking at how do we apply it

              24        within CRM.

              25                 It's important to note we were under


                                                                    32


               1        different quality systems at the time, so

               2        what's referred to here as legacy BSC would

               3        have been different from cardiac rhythm

               4        management.  So what it's saying here is we

               5        took the feedback that we received, that we

               6        just talked about at a QSAT meeting, and we

               7        ultimately updated our procedures to define

               8        the definition of similar device.

               9    Q.  Okay.  And is this meaning that if a -- if

              10        Boston Scientific has a defibrillator device

              11        and it's -- it might still be under an IDE,

              12        but there's an adverse event that happens,

              13        does this mean that an MDR should be filed

              14        for that event?

              15                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              16                 You can answer.

              17                    THE WITNESS:  It doesn't

              18        necessarily mean an MDR would be filed.  It

              19        would be evaluated --

              20                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              21                    THE WITNESS:  -- against the

              22        criteria.

              23                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              24    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              25    Q.  So -- and if the criteria were met for MDR


                                                                    33


               1        filing, then an MDR would be filed in that

               2        case?

               3    A.  I would go back -- yes, but let me go back

               4        one step earlier.  It -- the definition of --

               5        it's not as broad as saying a defibrillator.

               6        It had to be of the same product code.

               7        There's an FDA pro code that's assigned by

               8        the FDA, and that is how we like -- put like

               9        categories together and that's how we met the

              10        definition of similar.

              11                 So if you -- if your question is if

              12        it met the definition of similar, meaning it

              13        had the same pro code, and we walked an MDR

              14        decision tree and we got to a decision that

              15        yes, it should be reported, yes, it would be

              16        reported as an MDR.

              17    Q.  Okay.  And when we talk about similar, we're

              18        comparing a device that's under the IDE to a

              19        device that's already being marketed; is that

              20        right?

              21    A.  Yeah, it's comparing -- yes, a device that is

              22        marketed to one that may not be marketed,

              23        correct.

              24    Q.  Okay.  And if they have the same pro code

              25        then you would evaluate whether that --


                                                                    34


               1        excuse me.  Strike that.

               2                 The event happens with the device

               3        that was not being marketed, right, but then

               4        you evaluate whether that device is similar

               5        to one that is being marketed; is that right?

               6    A.  Correct.

               7    Q.  And then if they have the same pro code, then

               8        you evaluate whether or not that event needs

               9        to be reported under the normal MDR reporting

              10        criteria; is that right?

              11    A.  Correct.

              12    Q.  Do you know whether Cognis and Teligen had

              13        the same pro codes as their predecessor

              14        devices?

              15                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              16                    THE WITNESS:  I would -- so if I'm

              17        not supposed to guess, then I'm going to say

              18        I don't know for certain.

              19                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              20    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              21    Q.  Do you know where the information regarding

              22        what the pro code for a device would be

              23        resides?

              24    A.  So a pro code -- once it's approved, a pro

              25        code is assigned by the FDA and there is a


                                                                    35


               1        database within the FDA that, I believe when

               2        you submit your registration, the pro code is

               3        part of that process, so we then as a

               4        manufacturer know what pro code to use when

               5        we do submit MDRs.

               6    Q.  And if you submit a supplemental PMA for a

               7        new device as opposed to an original PMA,

               8        would the new device have the same pro code

               9        as the old device which it was supplementing?

              10    A.  I don't know.

              11    Q.  Okay.  Now, can you explain what your

              12        parenthetical note in this bullet point

              13        means?

              14    A.  Where it says italic starting with, "Note"?

              15    Q.  Correct.

              16    A.  Okay.  Let me read it.  (Reviews document.)

              17        Okay.  So it's saying that we did this deep

              18        dive, again, as I mentioned learning from

              19        feedback -- from FDA from different parts of

              20        Boston Scientific, we looked internally

              21        within our CRM process and we identified we

              22        were not filing MDRs on Cognis/Teligen that

              23        were part of COGENT 4.

              24                 And as I stated earlier, at the time

              25        we did not have the definition of similar in


                                                                    36


               1        place, so it was therefore not applied.  And

               2        the rationale I'm stating here is we viewed

               3        Cognis/Teligen as a different platform and,

               4        therefore, not similar, meaning we weren't

               5        using pro code as our basis for similar.  The

               6        quality system assurance team agreed with

               7        that.

               8                 We aligned to make the

               9        interpretation change on a go-forward basis,

              10        so we decided not to go back and file MDRs,

              11        but we update our procedures on a go-forward

              12        to align with that pro code classification.

              13                 And that's very consistent with any

              14        change in interpretation that we have with

              15        regulations, we will make them, very

              16        typically, on a go-forward basis.

              17    Q.  Can you explain why?

              18    A.  Well, as I stated earlier, regulations are

              19        not black and white, so interpretation of

              20        those regulations is always evolving as we

              21        learn more.  So unless we viewed it as a -- a

              22        nonconformance where we clearly identified

              23        we -- we did not follow the regulation, but

              24        rather we evolved our understanding of the

              25        regulation, that's on a go-forward basis.


                                                                    37


               1                 There's -- it's very difficult to --

               2        there's -- there's not a line in the sand

               3        black and white.  There is a continual

               4        evolution of interpretation.  And so when we

               5        make those changes, we make them going

               6        forward.

               7    Q.  Okay.  So here's a different hypothetical.

               8        If there were an adverse event that happened

               9        with a device and Boston Scientific didn't

              10        learn about that adverse event until a year

              11        later --

              12    A.  Okay.

              13    Q.  -- would it still do -- evaluate whether or

              14        not MDR reporting was appropriate for that

              15        event even though it had happened 12 months

              16        beforehand?

              17    A.  We will take a complaint, no matter when we

              18        receive it, and we use the procedures that

              19        are in place at the time we get that

              20        complaint, and whatever procedure is in place

              21        is what we follow.

              22                 So in your scenario, we learn of a

              23        complaint that may have happened sometime in

              24        the past, if we learn about it today, we will

              25        evaluate it today based on those procedures.


                                                                    38


               1    Q.  And does the FDA use MDR reporting to make

               2        decisions about whether any sort of action on

               3        its part is needed?

               4                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to scope.

               5                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know what

               6        FDA -- I can't speak for what FDA does with

               7        the information we submit.

               8    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               9    Q.  You don't know why the FDA requires reporting

              10        of MDRs?

              11    A.  That's a different question than what you

              12        asked the first time.

              13    Q.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, then, can you tell me, do

              14        you know why FDA requires reporting of

              15        adverse events?

              16                    MR. ROBINSON:  I'm going to object

              17        to scope.

              18                 You may answer.

              19                    THE WITNESS:  As part of device

              20        regulations, there is an obligation on

              21        manufacturers to monitor performance of

              22        products to ensure that they remain safe and

              23        effective, and the MDR regulation is one of

              24        the ways that they collect information for

              25        that purpose.


                                                                    39


               1    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               2    Q.  So in this case, wouldn't the FDA want to

               3        know about these events that had happened in

               4        the COGENT 4 study just as much as they would

               5        want to know about events that happened after

               6        they approved the devices?

               7                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

               8        and scope.

               9                 You may answer.

              10                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, I'm

              11        trying to understand your question.  Can you

              12        either restate it or state it slightly

              13        differently for me?

              14                    MR. ELLERBE:  Sure.

              15    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              16    Q.  So because Boston Scientific had not

              17        submitted MDRs for these events that happened

              18        in the COGENT 4 study, the FDA did not have

              19        MDR reports for those events, right?

              20                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

              21        and scope.

              22                    THE WITNESS:  They would not have

              23        received reports from the -- via the MDR

              24        system prior to the market approval.

              25                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.


                                                                    40


               1    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               2    Q.  So after the decision was made to change

               3        interpretation of the similar --

               4    A.  Uh-huh.

               5    Q.  -- is there any reason to think that the FDA

               6        wouldn't also be interested in those events?

               7                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

               8        and scope.

               9                    THE WITNESS:  I can't speculate

              10        for what FDA's interest would or would not

              11        be.  All I can tell you is that we interpret

              12        the regulations and we follow our procedures

              13        which are the result of that interpretation,

              14        and when we made the change, we followed the

              15        regulation -- the interpretation and the

              16        procedures going forward.

              17    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              18    Q.  But the information is still relevant to

              19        these devices that are being marketed at this

              20        time, right?

              21                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

              22        and scope.

              23                    THE WITNESS:  What is your

              24        question again, the -- say it again.

              25    BY MR. ELLERBE:


                                                                    41


               1    Q.  The information about those events that

               2        happened in the COGENT 4 study is still

               3        relevant to the safety and effectiveness of

               4        these devices that were being marketed at the

               5        time this decision was made, right?

               6    A.  Yes.

               7    Q.  Okay.

               8                    MR. ROBINSON:  I want to make a --

               9        on the last answer, I'm objecting to the

              10        scope on that one as well.

              11    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              12    Q.  Okay.  I'm going to show you another

              13        document.  This will be Zurn 3, and it's

              14        Bates-stamped BSC_Higgins-00275074.

              15                    (Exhibit 3 marked.)

              16                    THE WITNESS:  (Reviews document.)

              17        Okay.

              18    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              19    Q.  Okay.  What is this document?

              20    A.  This is a Complaint Summary Report from our

              21        Lighthouse complaint management system.

              22    Q.  Okay.  And is it sometimes referred to --

              23        this kind of document sometimes referred to

              24        as a CSR?

              25    A.  Yes.


                                                                    42


               1    Q.  Okay.  And do you see there's a number at the

               2        top of the first page that says, "Internal PI

               3        number"?

               4    A.  Yes.

               5    Q.  Can you describe what that internal PI number

               6        means?

               7    A.  It's the -- I believe it's the unique

               8        complaint number within Lighthouse.

               9    Q.  Okay.  And can you just generally describe

              10        what information the CSRs contain?

              11    A.  They contain a summary of what was reported

              12        to us relative to a complaint.  They may

              13        contain any attempts that we make to collect

              14        additional or missing information if we need

              15        it.

              16                 It would reflect whether we got the

              17        product back, if there was any analysis

              18        testing.  It would reflect if we had any --

              19        it would reflect our assessment of whether or

              20        not it was reportable either to the FDA via

              21        an MDR or outside the United States through

              22        various vigilance reporting requirements.

              23    Q.  And what is vigilance reporting requirements?

              24    A.  Vigilance reporting is the generic term we

              25        use for a regulatory report outside the U.S.


                                                                    43


               1        So analogous to an MDR is to the U.S. what a

               2        vigilance report would be to various

               3        countries throughout the world.

               4    Q.  Okay.  And how -- or strike that.

               5                 Would Complaint Summary Reports be

               6        used in the process of deciding whether or

               7        not to report an event to regulators?

               8    A.  This document itself, no.  The individual

               9        analyst doesn't use or print this document.

              10        This is a result of their work.

              11    Q.  Okay.

              12    A.  So they would not use this document, per se,

              13        to make a reporting decision.

              14    Q.  Okay.  Does a Complaint Summary Report

              15        reflect all the information that the analyst

              16        uses?

              17    A.  It reflects a summary of their investigation

              18        of the work that they've performed, yes.

              19    Q.  Okay.  Okay.  And then can you turn to the

              20        second page?

              21    A.  Uh-huh.

              22    Q.  Does this page tell you where the event

              23        happened?

              24    A.  I'm looking here.  (Reviews document.)

              25        "Account country," if we have it, would be


                                                                    44


               1        populated.  In this case it's blank, so it's

               2        possible we did not -- were not able to

               3        obtain all the information.

               4    Q.  What about, "Source Country"?

               5    A.  I'm sorry, I'm looking for that.  Hold on.

               6    Q.  It's at the top on the right.

               7    A.  There you go.

               8    Q.  Okay.

               9    A.  Actually, I'm going to reclarify my previous

              10        question.  The account country would be

              11        specific to the contact information.

              12    Q.  Okay.

              13    A.  But thank you for pointing out the source

              14        country is on the top, and it's Germany in

              15        this case.

              16    Q.  So that means this event happened in Germany?

              17    A.  Yes.

              18    Q.  And does the event date right under that mean

              19        that this event happened on March 18th, 2008?

              20    A.  Yes.

              21    Q.  Okay.  And then at the bottom, do you see

              22        where it says, "Device Info," that section?

              23    A.  Device Info, yes.

              24    Q.  And does this mean that this was a Teligen

              25        device model F102 serial number 000128?


                                                                    45


               1    A.  Yes.

               2    Q.  Okay.

               3                    MR. ELLERBE:  Should we maybe go

               4        off the record now.

               5                    THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are going

               6        off the record at 9:50 a.m.

               7                    (Recess.)

               8                    THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on

               9        the record at 10:33 a.m.

              10    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              11    Q.  Ms. Zurn, do you understand that you're still

              12        under oath?

              13    A.  Yes.

              14    Q.  And before we took a break, we were talking

              15        about a CSR for an event that was labeled

              16        with an internal PI number 1261088-1; is that

              17        right?

              18    A.  Correct.

              19    Q.  Can you explain to me what the dash 1 means

              20        in that number?

              21    A.  I don't know.

              22    Q.  Okay.  Okay.  Can you turn to the third page

              23        in this document that ends in 076.

              24    A.  (Complies.)

              25    Q.  And can you read the description into the


                                                                    46


               1        record, please?

               2    A.  "Event description, Boston Scientific CRM

               3        received information that this implanted

               4        right ventricular defibrillation lead

               5        presented with shocking impedances above

               6        125 ohms one day after implant."

               7    Q.  Okay.  And then can you please read the

               8        manufacturer narrative as well?

               9    A.  "During the revision procedure, it was

              10        discovered that the lead's terminal pin was

              11        not fully inserted into the header of the

              12        implanted implantable cardioverter

              13        defibrillator," parenthesis, "ICD.  The lead

              14        was reconnected and now the shock impedance

              15        measurements are within normal parameters.

              16        No adverse patient effects were reported.  No

              17        additional information is available."

              18    Q.  So based off of that description, is it

              19        correct to say that this patient had a

              20        Teligen device implanted and then the next

              21        day it was discovered that one of the leads

              22        had a shocking impedance measurement above

              23        125 ohms?

              25                    THE WITNESS:  I think that's how I

               1        would summarize it.

               2    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               3    Q.  And then when it -- the manufacturer

               4        narrative refers to the revision procedure.

               5        Can you describe what a revision procedure

               6        is?

               7                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

               8        and scope.

               9                    THE WITNESS:  Revision procedure

              10        would be one where after the device is

              11        implanted, something requires the patient to

              12        go back into surgery for various reasons to

              13        have the implanted device revised.

              14    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              15    Q.  And so that means the pocket is reopened; is

              16        that right?

              17                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

              18        and scope.

              19                    THE WITNESS:  It could be.  I

              20        don't know that it's always that case.

              21    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              22    Q.  Reading this narrative, do you believe that

              23        the pocket was reopened?

              24                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

              25        and scope.


                                                                    48


               1                    THE WITNESS:  I would say yes,

               2        based on the sentence where it says the lead

               3        was reconnected.  To me that would imply yes.

               4    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               5    Q.  Do you see on the next page, at the top it

               6        says, "Regulatory decision information"?

               7    A.  Yes.

               8    Q.  Okay.  And is this what you were referring to

               9        earlier when you said that CSRs would record

              10        what the regulatory decision-making

              11        reporting -- strike that.

              12                 Does this show what the regulatory

              13        reporting decision was for this event?

              14    A.  Yes.

              15    Q.  Okay.  And does this show that no reporting

              16        was done for the United States?

              17    A.  Yes.

              18                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              19    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              20    Q.  Does this show that there was reporting done

              21        to an international regulator?

              22    A.  Yes.

              23    Q.  Do you know which regulator that would be?

              24    A.  From this box, I can't tell for certain.

              25    Q.  Based off of the fact that this implant


                                                                    49


               1        occurred in Germany, does that give you

               2        information?

               3    A.  More than likely, then, it would have been

               4        the German competent authority.

               5    Q.  Do you know why this event was not reported

               6        to the FDA?

               7                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

               8                    THE WITNESS:  Well, the rationale

               9        on this, I can't tell exactly from -- because

              10        it's -- there's the blank field here.  But

              11        based on the date and based on the fact that

              12        I believe this device was not approved in the

              13        U.S. yet and we had not yet implemented the

              14        definition of similar, we would have

              15        considered it not eligible for MDR reporting.

              16    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              17    Q.  Now, putting that policy aside, do you have

              18        any sense as to whether or not this event

              19        would have been -- strike that.

              20                 If that policy were not in place,

              21        would the MDA -- MDR criteria have been

              22        applied to the this event to decide whether

              23        or not it needed to be reported to the FDA?

              24                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              25                    THE WITNESS:  If -- if you're --


                                                                    50


               1        if you're asking me if we had had -- if this

               2        had happened after the implementation of the

               3        similar clause, then we would have assessed

               4        it for reportability.

               5                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

               6    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               7    Q.  And based off of your knowledge of MDR

               8        reporting, do you believe this event would

               9        have been -- should have been reported under

              10        that criteria?

              11                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              12                    THE WITNESS:  So to answer that I

              13        would have to look at the procedure that was

              14        in place at the time this event came in.  As

              15        I stated earlier, our procedures are revised

              16        periodically, so I would -- I would want to

              17        assess it and make that decision based on the

              18        procedure in place at the time the event

              19        occurred.

              20                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              21    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              22    Q.  Even though there was this change in BSC's

              23        internal policies regarding similar products,

              24        would it have been possible for BSC to have

              25        reported on this kind of event to the FDA?


                                                                    51


               1                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

               2                    THE WITNESS:  Would it have been

               3        possible?  I suppose.  But if the analyst was

               4        following the procedure, the answer would be

               5        no, they wouldn't have reported it.

               6    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               7    Q.  If someone at Boston Scientific thought this

               8        is an important kind of event, we need to

               9        report on this to FDA even if our internal

              10        policy says that we don't have to, would it

              11        have been possible to submit that kind of

              12        report?

              13                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              14                    THE WITNESS:  Technically, it may

              15        have been.  However, I will say our analysts

              16        are trained, for very good reason, to follow

              17        procedure.  So following procedure, they

              18        should not have reported.

              19    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              20    Q.  Okay.  Turning to the next page -- excuse me,

              21        two more pages.  It's the one that ends in

              22        079 at the bottom.  Do you see at the bottom

              23        of that field there's a trend number?

              24    A.  Yes.

              25    Q.  Okay.  Is that trend number trend TR8018?


                                                                    52


               1    A.  Yes.

               2    Q.  Do you know what that trend is?

               3    A.  I am vaguely familiar with it.  I -- I'm not

               4        an expert in the trending process, but I am

               5        vaguely familiar with it.

               6    Q.  So what's the significance of listing the

               7        trends in the CSR?

               8    A.  A trend is one of the post market processes

               9        to monitor complaints of a similar type, and

              10        it helps us monitor to -- to see if there is

              11        potentially some -- some action we may need

              12        to take.  So putting it on the complaint file

              13        is part of the complete part of complaint

              14        handling regulations and internal

              15        requirements.

              16    Q.  So to use Boston Scientific's parlance, would

              17        this be a trended event?

              18                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to scope.

              19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

              20    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              21    Q.  So outside of the MDR reporting process,

              22        were there any other methods by which

              23        Boston Scientific reported on incidents and

              24        adverse events that occurred in implants of

              25        the Cognis and Teligen devices before


                                                                    53


               1        May 8th, 2008?

               2                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

               3                    THE WITNESS:  So you're using the

               4        word "report."  Can you clarify what you mean

               5        by "report," when you say reported to FDA?

               6                    MR. ELLERBE:  Made FDA aware of.

               7                    THE WITNESS:  So the -- the only

               8        thing I can think of would be that FDA can

               9        come in and inspect Boston Scientific at any

              10        point in time, and that's very routine.  So

              11        it's possible that they could have become

              12        aware or become made aware through coming in

              13        and inspecting us.  And when we have

              14        inspections, complaint files are routinely

              15        looked at.

              16                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              17                    THE WITNESS:  So that would be a

              18        mechanism for FDA becoming aware of certain

              19        events.

              20                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              22    Q.  Are you familiar with the COGENT field

              23        following report?

              24    A.  I -- I don't know that I am.

              25    Q.  Okay.


                                                                    54


               1    A.  It -- I might need to see --

               2    Q.  Sure.

               3    A.  -- if there's an exhibit or something you can

               4        show me.

               5    Q.  Sure.

               6    A.  It's a little bit of a vague question.

               7    Q.  Okay.  Okay.  So I'm going to first show you

               8        an exhibit that will be marked Zurn 4.  It

               9        has a Bates number of TEMP-BSC00039698.

              12    Q.  Have you ever seen this document before?

              13    A.  I do not know if this is something I saw

              14        prior to this deposition or not.  Maybe, but

              15        it's -- it's not familiar to me.

              16    Q.  Okay.  Does this letter indicate that

              17        Ron Thompson was sending an amendment to the

              18        PMA supplement for Cognis and Teligen to

              19        Doris Terry on April 3rd, 2008?

              20    A.  I would agree.  That's what it looks like to

              21        me.

              22    Q.  Okay.  And would this just be a cover letter?

              23    A.  That's what it looks like to me.

              24    Q.  Okay.  So now I'm going to show you another

              25        exhibit.  This will be Zurn 5.  And it is


                                                                    55

               4    Q.  Have you ever seen this document before?

               5    A.  I don't believe so.

               6    Q.  Okay.

               7    A.  No.

               8    Q.  I will represent to you that this is a copy

               9        of the amendment that Ron Thompson sent to

              10        Doris Terry on April 3rd, 2008.

              11    A.  Okay.

              12    Q.  Do you see on the last page that there is a

              13        list of exhibits?

              14    A.  Yes.

              15    Q.  Can you tell me what Exhibit 4 is?

              16    A.  It reads, "OUS COGENT field following

              17        clinical report."

              18    Q.  Okay.  So now we'll look at one more exhibit.

              19        This will be marked Zurn 6.

              20                    (Exhibit 6 marked.)

              22    Q.  Have you ever seen this document before?

              23    A.  This one I have.

              24    Q.  Okay.  And is this the COGENT Field Following

              25        that was attached as an exhibit to that


                                                                    56


               1        submission to the FDA?

               2    A.  It's titled the COGENT 4 Field Following, if

               3        that's your question.

               4    Q.  Okay.  I'll represent to you that it is --

               5    A.  Okay.

               6    Q.  -- the exhibit.

               7    A.  Okay.

               8    Q.  Now, can you tell me the criteria by which

               9        events -- strike that.

              10                 Does this report describe

              11        observations and adverse events that happened

              12        in connection with the implantation of Cognis

              13        and Teligen devices in places outside the

              14        United States?

              15    A.  I believe that is correct.

              16    Q.  Okay.  Can you tell me what was the criteria

              17        for deciding whether or not to include those

              18        observations and/or adverse events in this

              19        report?

              20    A.  Am I allowed to read this to try and answer

              21        that?

              22    Q.  Sure.

              23    A.  Okay.  (Reviews document.)

              24                 So can you please restate your

              25        question one more time for me now?


                                                                    57


               1    Q.  Can you tell me what was the criteria for

               2        deciding whether or not to include those

               3        observations and/or adverse events in this

               4        report?

               5    A.  So my answer would be it would be based on

               6        the protocol for the clinical study and how

               7        we defined in that protocol adverse events

               8        and observations, which I think is defined in

               9        here.

              10    Q.  Okay.

              11    A.  I saw it on here somewhere.

              12    Q.  Is it on page 9?

              13    A.  You're one ahead -- yeah.  So there's a

              14        definition on page 9 of an adverse event, and

              15        then on page 10 you had asked about

              16        observations and complications, and that's

              17        defined here.

              18    Q.  Okay.  If we can go back to page 9, do you

              19        see the section that discusses unanticipated

              20        device effects?

              21    A.  I do.

              22    Q.  Okay.  Can you read that section into the

              23        record, please.

              24    A.  "An unanticipated adverse device effect is

              25        defined in the IDE regulations," parenthesis,


                                                                    58


               1        "21 CFR 812.3 S as any serious adverse effect

               2        on health or safety or any life-threatening

               3        problem or death caused by or associated with

               4        a device if that effect problem or death was

               5        not previously identified in nature, severity

               6        or degree of incidence in the investigation

               7        plan or application, including a

               8        supplementary plan or application, or any

               9        other unanticipated serious problem

              10        associated with a device that relates to the

              11        rights, safety or welfare of patients.  There

              12        have been no unanticipated adverse device

              13        effects reported in this field following to

              14        date."

              15    Q.  So using this definition of unanticipated

              16        device effects, is it possible that if a

              17        certain kind of adverse effect happened more

              18        frequently than was anticipated, that that

              19        would be an unanticipated device effect?

              20                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              21                    THE WITNESS:  I don't read that in

              22        here.  I read severity.  But what you asked

              23        to me sounded like occurrence rate.  So I'm

              24        reading here if it's something that we did

              25        not anticipate, not previously identified or


                                                                    59


               1        the severity.

               2    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               3    Q.  Do you see where it says, "Degree of

               4        incidence"?

               5    A.  I do see that.

               6    Q.  Could that mean rate?

               7                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

               8                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

               9    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              10    Q.  Do you think a person reading this might

              11        think that it refers to rate?

              12                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

              13        and scope.

              14                    THE WITNESS:  When I read it the

              15        first time, and how I'm reading it now,

              16        severity or degree describes the type more

              17        than it does how often, and your question to

              18        me was more on the how often.

              19    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              20    Q.  So is it your testimony that if an adverse

              21        effect -- excuse me, strike me -- strike

              22        that.

              23                 If an adverse effect happened more

              24        frequently than was anticipated, that that

              25        would not be an unanticipated device effect?


                                                                    60


               1                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

               2                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

               3        You're asking me something that's a little

               4        outside of my subject area expertise, and I'm

               5        trying to answer it the best I can based on

               6        reading this.  But I -- I'm not steeped in

               7        the clinical space as much as I am in the

               8        post market space, so I'm answering the best

               9        I can.

              10                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.  Okay.

              11    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              12    Q.  Turning to the page that ends in 712, do you

              13        see the section heading, "IS-1 incomplete

              14        port insertion"?

              15    A.  Yes.

              16    Q.  Hold on a second.  Can you read that first

              17        paragraph out loud, please.

              18    A.  Sure.  "The reported event associated with

              19        this is impedance of greater than 200 ohms

              20        due to the IS-1 terminal pin not being fully

              21        inserted into the header.  During the COGENT

              22        field following, the field engineers received

              23        training that reinforced the

              24        instructions-for-use in the system guide.

              25        The current system guide gives instruction on


                                                                    61


               1        how to insert the IS-1 terminal pin,

               2        therefore, no changes will be made to address

               3        this issue."

               4    Q.  Thank you.

               5                 And do you see under that paragraph

               6        that there's a list of seven devices?

               7    A.  In the parenthesis with the letters?

               8    Q.  Yes.

               9    A.  Yes.

              10    Q.  And those would be the devices where this

              11        observation was made?

              12                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to the

              13        form.

              14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it says this

              15        issue was reported in seven devices,

              16        parenthesis, and it lists them, so I would

              17        understand this to mean that those were the

              18        seven devices that was referred to.

              19                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              20    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              21    Q.  And then based off of that earlier CSR that

              22        we looked at, would you think that that would

              23        be one of these events that was listed here?

              24                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              25                    THE WITNESS:  May I look at the --


                                                                    62


               1                    MR. ELLERBE:  Sure.

               2                    THE WITNESS:  This was number 3.

               3        (Reviews document.)

               4                 Well, I would not, because this

               5        clearly says the event is associated with

               6        impedances of greater than 2000 ohms due to

               7        the IS terminal 1 not being fully inserted.

               8        In the description in the narrative, I don't

               9        see anywhere in here that it describes

              10        anything related to impedances greater than

              11        2000 ohms.

              12    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              13    Q.  And are you looking at Zurn 3?

              14    A.  I am looking at Zurn 3, and I'm on -- on the

              15        bottom ending at 076.

              16    Q.  Okay.  And does it say that the measurement

              17        was above 125 ohms?

              18    A.  In the description it says, "The

              19        defibrillation lead presented with shocking

              20        impedances above 125 ohms," yes.

              21    Q.  So can you rule out that this event didn't

              22        meet that definition of greater than

              23        2000 ohms?

              24                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              25                    THE WITNESS:  I will answer again.


                                                                    63


               1        I don't see anything in here that says

               2        greater than 2000 ohms.  And what this says

               3        in here is that those events associated in

               4        this category had impedances greater than

               5        2000 ohms.

               6                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

               7    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               8    Q.  But is there anything that could rule this

               9        even out from being included in there --

              10                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection --

              11    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              12    Q.  -- or do you just not see enough criteria to

              13        include it in that greater than 2000 ohms?

              14                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              15                    THE WITNESS:  Based on the

              16        available information, I don't see it

              17        matching this criteria.

              18    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              19    Q.  Does this event also describe an event --

              20        does this CSR also describe an event where

              21        there was an incomplete port insertion?

              22    A.  It does say the lead's terminal pin was not

              23        fully inserted into the header of the ICD.

              24    Q.  So is that yes, this is an event where there

              25        was an incomplete port insertion?


                                                                    64


               1                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

               2                    THE WITNESS:  It does meet part of

               3        the criteria in terms of the terminal pin not

               4        being fully inserted.

               5                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.  Okay.

               6    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               7    Q.  So now I'm going to show you a document

               8        that's marked BSC_Higgins-00284283, and I

               9        believe this will be Zurn 7.

              10                    (Exhibit 7 marked.)

              11                    MR. ELLERBE:  Counsel, I

              12        apologize, I -- I wrote Zurn 7 at the bottom

              13        of this, your copy.

              14                    MR. ROBINSON:  Oh.

              15                    MR. ELLERBE:  I'm just going to

              16        give that to you.

              17                    MR. ROBINSON:  I'll forgive you.

              18        I would have written it anyway.

              19                    MR. ELLERBE:  I'm sure your

              20        handwriting is neater than mine, so I

              21        apologize for sullying it.

              22                    THE WITNESS:  (Reviews document.)

              23        Okay.

              24                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              25    BY MR. ELLERBE:


                                                                    65


               1    Q.  Can you describe what this document is?

               2    A.  This is a Complaint Summary Report.

               3    Q.  Okay.  And can you describe what kind of

               4        device was involved here?

               5    A.  Well, I'm looking under the device

               6        information, and it lists ALTRUA as the

               7        product family.

               8    Q.  Okay.  And where did this implant take place?

               9    A.  This doesn't list the implant.  Are you

              10        asking -- are you asking where the event took

              11        place?

              12    Q.  Yes.

              13    A.  Source country says United States.

              14    Q.  Okay.  And do you see the date as well?

              15    A.  The event date is listed as September 26th,

              16        2008.

              17    Q.  Okay.  And what is an ALTRUA device?

              18    A.  Boy, I believe it's a pacemaker, but it's

              19        been many years since I worked in the

              20        division.  So I'm pretty sure -- it's a

              21        pacemaker or defibrillator.  I'm pretty sure

              22        it's a pacemaker.

              23    Q.  Okay.  And do you see on the page ending in

              24        289?

              25    A.  289, okay.


                                                                    66


               1    Q.  Is there a trend associated with this CSR?

               2    A.  There is.

               3    Q.  Can you tell me what that trend is?

               4    A.  TR08018.

               5    Q.  Okay.  Now can you tell me why this -- strike

               6        that.

               7                 If we go to the page ending in 286.

               8    A.  Okay.

               9    Q.  Does this page indicate that no MDR was

              10        submitted to the FDA?

              11    A.  That is correct.

              12    Q.  Can you explain why?

              13    A.  Well, the rationale that's listed here refers

              14        to a decision tree within the procedure at

              15        that time.

              16    Q.  Okay.

              17    A.  And I would be happy to explain it if I could

              18        at least walk the decision tree and provide

              19        that same rationale.

              20    Q.  Okay.  Okay.  But you would need to see that

              21        policy document?

              22    A.  Right.  Because as I said earlier, we follow

              23        procedure, procedures change, so I'd want to

              24        follow the one that was in place at the time.

              25    Q.  Sure.  Okay.  We can put that one aside.


                                                                    67


               1    A.  Okay.

               2    Q.  Now I'm going to show you Zurn 8, which is

               3        Bates-stamped BSC_Higgins-00280556.

               4                    (Exhibit 8 marked.)

               5                    THE WITNESS:  (Reviews document.)

               6        Okay.

               7                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

               8    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               9    Q.  So can you tell me what this document is?

              10    A.  Complaint Summary Report.

              11    Q.  Okay.  And what kind of device was involved

              12        in this complaint?

              13    A.  Under the device info it lists a Teligen.

              14    Q.  Okay.  And was this also implanted in the

              15        United States in January of 2009?

              16    A.  The event occurred in the United States.  It

              17        doesn't have implant date on here.

              18    Q.  Okay.  And it was in the United States?

              19    A.  The event occurred in the United States,

              20        correct.

              21    Q.  Okay.  Now, can you read -- did you read the

              22        description of this event?

              23    A.  I did.

              24    Q.  Okay.  Okay.  Do you see where it says, "The

              25        physician then held the lead and the device


                                                                    68


               1        together as the nurse tightened the

               2        setscrew"?

               3    A.  I do see that.

               4    Q.  Do you know whether that was an off-label

               5        implant technique?

               6                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

               7        and scope.

               8                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

               9                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              10    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              11    Q.  If it were on off-label implantation

              12        technique, is that something the FDA should

              13        have been notified about?

              14                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

              15        and scope.

              16                    THE WITNESS:  Notified how?  Can

              17        you clarify your question?

              18    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              19    Q.  Was this -- was this event submitted as an

              20        MDR?

              21    A.  On the next page it does say yes, we

              22        submitted an MDR.

              23    Q.  Okay.  And can you tell me, what does

              24        malfunction mean there?

              25    A.  There are three types of MDR reports.  This


                                                                    69


               1        to me says that the type of MDR that was

               2        filed was a type malfunction.

               3    Q.  And what does that mean?

               4    A.  Well, as opposed to a death or a serious

               5        injury type, there's -- I'd have to get the

               6        regulations out to cite it exactly.  It's the

               7        least concerning or least significant type of

               8        mal -- or of MDR report.

               9    Q.  Okay.  So in the MDR report, should the FDA

              10        have been made aware of the fact that this

              11        implantation technique was off-label, if

              12        indeed it was off-label?

              13                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

              14        and scope.

              15                    THE WITNESS:  So I don't believe

              16        that our MDR reporting requires -- again, I'd

              17        have to look at the procedure.  I don't know

              18        that this was off-label, first of all.

              19                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              20                    THE WITNESS:  So if -- if -- are

              21        you asking me if it was off-label -- what is

              22        your question exactly?

              23    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              24    Q.  Should the FDA have been told this happened

              25        and the doctor used an off-label technique to


                                                                    70


               1        implant this device?

               2                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form

               3        and scope.

               4                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know about

               5        should.  But when we write event descriptions

               6        in our MDR reports, we describe the facts as

               7        we collect them.  And I believe this event

               8        description would have largely been what

               9        would have been on the MDR.

              10                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

              11    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              12    Q.  And this event description does not say

              13        whether or not this was an off-label

              14        technique or not, does it?

              15    A.  It does not.

              16    Q.  Okay.  So -- okay.  Actually, let's look at

              17        the next exhibit.  This will be Zurn 9.

              18                    (Exhibit 9 marked.)

              19    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              20    Q.  I'll make some representations to you as I

              21        give this to you, which is that this is a

              22        printout of a spreadsheet that was produced

              23        to us in this case by counsel for

              24        Boston Scientific, and it includes the

              25        information form from the Form 3500As for


                                                                    71


               1        certain events --

               2    A.  Okay.

               3    Q.  -- corresponding to certain PI numbers.

               4    A.  Okay.

               5    Q.  And I believe if you look at the top two

               6        rows, you'll see PI numbers for this event

               7        that we just were discussing.

               8    A.  Sorry, what -- do you want me to look at the

               9        first two rows, you said?

              10    Q.  It's really -- I believe it's the second row.

              11        I'll represent to you that I think that's the

              12        form 3500A for this PI.

              13    A.  I'll look at the second row, okay.

              14    Q.  And I'll further, just for the record, state

              15        that I believe that the first row is the

              16        supplemental MDR that was submitted for the

              17        same PI number.

              18    A.  Okay.  Okay.

              19    Q.  Okay.  So does this row appear to you to

              20        contain all the information that would be

              21        submitted in a Form 3500A?

              22    A.  Boy, I --

              23                    MR. ROBINSON:  I'm going to object

              24        to the form and the scope of that question.

              25                    THE WITNESS:  But I answer?


                                                                    72


               1                    MR. ROBINSON:  Yeah, go ahead.

               2                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I don't know,

               3        because I'm used to seeing the 3500A looking

               4        like a form and not like a spreadsheet.

               5                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

               6                    THE WITNESS:  So if you showed me

               7        a 3500A, I could tell you what it looked like

               8        and -- but on a spreadsheet it's very hard

               9        for me to match.

              10                    MR. ROBINSON:  Let's make it clear

              11        we have -- we have produced this spreadsheet

              12        to them, to the Plaintiffs in this case, in

              13        lieu of printing out thousands of 3500s.

              14                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

              15                    MR. ROBINSON:  So this is -- we

              16        have stipulated that this information on the

              17        spreadsheet is the same as what would have

              18        occurred in the 3500.

              19                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

              20                    MR. ROBINSON:  All right.  So you

              21        can answer with that understanding in mind.

              22                    THE WITNESS:  Then I would answer

              23        yes.

              24                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.

                                                                    73


               1    Q.  I'm going to show you --

               2    A.  Okay.

               3    Q.  -- another exhibit.  This will be Zurn 10.

               4                    (Exhibit 10 marked.)

               5                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

               6        (Reviews document.)

               7    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               8    Q.  So does this --

               9    A.  Okay.

              10    Q.  -- look like a form 3500A that you're used

              11        to?

              12    A.  Yes.

              13    Q.  Okay.  And I don't believe this is the same

              14        PI number.

              15    A.  Okay.

              16    Q.  So my question is:  Do you see under the

              17        adverse event or product problem field, B,

              18        adverse event product problem field?

              19    A.  Yes.

              20    Q.  Okay.  Do you see that items number 6 and 7

              21        ask for, "Relevant tests, laboratory data

              22        including dates and then other relevant

              23        history including preexisting medical"?

              24    A.  I do.

              25    Q.  Okay.  Do you see those fields on this


                                                                    74


               1        spreadsheet?

               2    A.  Does this spreadsheet roll to page 2 for the

               3        same row?

               4    Q.  It does.

               5    A.  Okay.  So do you want to stipulate that it's

               6        not there or do you want me to review it and

               7        eyeball it back and forth?  Because I will.

               8        I will go through and look right now if you'd

               9        like, if that's what you're asking.

              10    Q.  Well, I just -- I want to know if that

              11        information was filled out and submitted for

              12        these MDRs or not because --

              13    A.  Well, I will tell you this -- before I go

              14        on --

              15    Q.  Sure.

              16    A.  -- there are parts of this form that, if you

              17        look at it, the form on the top says it's for

              18        use by facilities --

              19    Q.  Okay.

              20    A.  -- importers, distributors and

              21        manufacturers --

              22    Q.  Okay.

              23    A.  -- and there are certain fields that are

              24        required for manufactures, which is what

              25        Boston Scientific is.  There are other fields


                                                                    75


               1        filled out by user facilities.

               2    Q.  Okay.

               3    A.  It could be that this field is not

               4        something that's -- something that a

               5        manufacturer typically fills out but is more

               6        appropriate if it's a user facility, for

               7        example.

               8    Q.  Okay.  Do you know whether those two fields

               9        are things that would -- a manufacturer would

              10        fill out normally?

              11    A.  I -- I -- I don't know for certain.  So if

              12        you don't want me to guess, is my answer no?

              13    Q.  I -- I don't want you to guess.

              14    A.  I don't want to guess.

              15    Q.  Okay.

              16    A.  So I don't know for certain.

              17    Q.  Okay.  Okay.  Do you see that Section F says,

              18        "For use by user facility/importer"?

              19    A.  I do see that section.

              20    Q.  Okay.  And is there a similar kind of

              21        limitation to the heading for Section B?

              22    A.  Not that's written on here, but I do know

              23        that there is a guidance document that is

              24        available that guides manufacturers,

              25        importers on how to fill this form out.  I'd


                                                                    76


               1        have to look on that to see --

               2    Q.  Okay.

               3    A.  -- but...

               4    Q.  Okay.  So just so I'm clear, is it right that

               5        those two fields that we were talking about,

               6        Section B, number 6, "Relevant

               7        test/laboratory data, including dates," and

               8        Section B, number 7, "Other relevant history

               9        including preexisting medical," is not

              10        represented in this spreadsheet?

              11    A.  (Reviews document.)  That is correct.

              12    Q.  Okay.

              13    A.  I'm not seeing it.  Oh, there's a third page.

              14        (Reviews document.)  It's not there.

              15    Q.  Okay.  And then just looking at this row, the

              16        second row --

              17    A.  Okay.

              18    Q.  -- of events, do you see anywhere where it is

              19        identified that the implantation technique

              20        was off-label?

              21                    MR. ROBINSON:  Objection to form.

              22                    THE WITNESS:  I do not see

              23        anywhere that it says off-label.  What I do

              24        see is it matches, as I stated earlier, what

              25        was in the event description.


                                                                    77


               1                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.  Okay.  You

               2        can put that aside.

               3                    THE WITNESS:  (Complies.)

               4    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               5    Q.  During the 2007 to 2009 time period, was

               6        Boston Scientific allowed to report any of

               7        its MDRs on a quarterly basis?

               8    A.  Yes.

               9    Q.  And which MDRs were allowed to be reported

              10        quarterly?

              11    A.  You're asking a good question.  Um, we had an

              12        exemption, and I believe it covered

              13        pacemakers and defibrillators.  I believe it

              14        was all.  The exception to that would be --

              15        I -- I'd need to -- the vast majority was --

              16        were reported on a quarterly --

              17    Q.  Okay.

              18    A.  -- so, yeah.

              19    Q.  And do you know why Boston Scientific was

              20        given that exemption?

              21                    MR. ROBINSON:  I'm going to object

              22        to the form and the scope.

              23                 You can answer if you know.

              24                    THE WITNESS:  From a historical

              25        perspective, what I believe the answer to


                                                                    78


               1        that is the nature of the implanted

               2        pacemakers and defibrillators are such that

               3        we gain a lot of information throughout the

               4        lifecycle.  We also get devices back that we

               5        do testing on, but those devices don't always

               6        come back within the 30-day window.

               7                 So because of the volume, FDA

               8        granted a larger period of time for pacemaker

               9        and defibrillators in this case to allow us

              10        to be able to submit report, hopefully having

              11        the majority of the information as opposed to

              12        filing multiple supplemental reports.  That's

              13        the best of my recollection as to why it was

              14        in place when I took over the role.

              15    BY MR. ELLERBE:

              16    Q.  So just to be clear, this policy was in place

              17        when you took over which role?

              18    A.  My director of post market.  And this would

              19        have been an exemption that was granted by

              20        the FDA to Boston Scientific, actually, then

              21        probably Guidant.

              22    Q.  Okay.  Do you know when that exemption was

              23        granted?

              24    A.  I don't offhand.

              25    Q.  Okay.


                                                                    79


               1    A.  I don't.

               2    Q.  Do you know, was there any sort of document

               3        that reflected that exemption?

               4    A.  Yes, we would have -- FDA would -- we would

               5        have a document on file from FDA granting us

               6        that exemption.

               7    Q.  Okay.

               8                    MR. ELLERBE:  All right.  Then I

               9        believe I have no further questions for you.

              10                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

              11                    MR. ROBINSON:  Let's take a short

              12        break and then we'll come back.

              13                    THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are going

              14        off the record at 11:21 a.m.

              15                    (Recess.)

              16                    THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on

              17        the record at 11:33 a.m.

              19                          EXAMINATION

              20    BY MR. ROBINSON:

              21    Q.  Okay.  Ms. Zurn, I want you to pull -- first

              22        pull out Exhibit 3.

              23    A.  Okay.

              24    Q.  Okay.  And this was -- you answered questions

              25        to Mr. -- from Mr. Ellerbe about this event


                                                                    80


               1        that occurred in Germany on March -- the

               2        implant date was March 14th, 2008; is that

               3        correct?

               4    A.  Yes.

               5    Q.  And is that the event date as well?

               6    A.  The event date is March 18th, 2008.

               7    Q.  Okay.  Now let me ask you to turn to

               8        Exhibit 6.

               9    A.  (Complies.)

              10    Q.  Okay.  And I want you to look at page 26 --

              11    A.  (Complies.)

              12    Q.  -- where there's a description of various

              13        adverse events that -- that occurred.

              14    A.  Okay.

              15    Q.  Okay.  And I want you to -- the second event

              16        that's listed there is one that's been given

              17        the patient ID GEBOCGAO.

              18    A.  Okay.

              19    Q.  Do you see that there?

              20    A.  Yes.

              21    Q.  Okay.  Can you look at that the description

              22        of that event and tell me if that is the same

              23        event that's described in Exhibit 3?

              24    A.  So it appears that the dates line up and the

              25        description is the same -- very similar here.


                                                                    81


               1    Q.  Okay.

               2    A.  Okay.

               3    Q.  So do you believe these are the same event?

               4    A.  Yes.

               5    Q.  Okay.  So this event, GEBOCGAO, which is also

               6        described in the Complaint Summary Report in

               7        Exhibit 3, was included in the information

               8        given to the FDA in -- in Exhibit 6; is that

               9        correct?

              10    A.  Yes.

              11    Q.  And if you turn also to page 12 of Exhibit 6.

              12    A.  Okay.

              13    Q.  Do you see that the -- this is a section that

              14        describes certain adverse event observations

              15        related to noise during shock impedance

              16        measurement?

              17    A.  Yes.

              18    Q.  And do you see that in the third paragraph

              19        there are 15 events in which that issue was

              20        noted?

              21    A.  Yes.

              22    Q.  And do you see that one of those is the event

              23        that we're looking -- we've been talking

              24        about, GEBOCGAO?

              25    A.  Yes.


                                                                    82


               1    Q.  Okay.  So the FDA was also given a narrative

               2        description of that event as well?

               3    A.  Yes.

               4    Q.  So in addition to information about adverse

               5        events that the FDA would get through the MDR

               6        reporting process, did the FDA also get

               7        information about adverse events through the

               8        submission of the COGENT study report?

               9    A.  Yes.  It looks like it's right here.

              10    Q.  Okay.  Are you aware if after the FDA

              11        received the initial COGENT field following

              12        report at Exhibit 6, if the FDA ever asked

              13        the company why it had not filed MDRs for the

              14        events described in the field following?

              15    A.  No.

              16    Q.  Is that -- if the FDA had made such an

              17        inquiry, is that something that would have

              18        been brought to your attention in the

              19        positions you held at the company?

              20    A.  Yes.  Yup.

              21    Q.  All right.  Let me ask you now to turn to

              22        Exhibit 7.

              23    A.  Okay.

              24    Q.  And this was a Complaint Summary Report about

              25        another event that Mr. Ellerbe asked you


                                                                    83


               1        about which had the number 1358733; is that

               2        correct?

               3    A.  Yes.

               4    Q.  Okay.  And do you see on the page -- the

               5        third page of the document, it has the Bates

               6        number ending in 4285 at the bottom?

               7    A.  Yes.

               8    Q.  Where it asks for the description of the

               9        event, it says, "Refer to investigation

              10        text"?

              11    A.  Yes.

              12    Q.  Okay.  What -- when it says, "Refer to

              13        investigation text," what does it -- what is

              14        this document referencing?

              15    A.  More than likely an earlier complaint system

              16        record, I'm guessing.

              17    Q.  Would that be the RET system?

              18    A.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.

              19    Q.  Okay.

              20                    (Exhibit 11 marked.)

              21    BY MR. ROBINSON:

              22    Q.  All right.  So I'm going to ask the court --

              23        well, we're going to hand you what's been

              24        marked as Exhibit 11, Zurn 11, and ask you if

              25        this is the text information regarding the PI


                                                                    84


               1        number 1358733?

               2    A.  Yes, the numbers match.

               3    Q.  Okay.  And do you see at the bottom of the

               4        first page of Exhibit 11 there's a

               5        description of the call that came in to

               6        report this particular event?

               7    A.  Where it starts, "Merlin call" --

               8    Q.  Yes.

               9    A.  -- "from Angela Hobscheidt" -- "Hobscheidt"?

              10    Q.  Correct.

              11    A.  Yes.

              12    Q.  Okay.  And where in this document is the

              13        description of how the company's analyst

              14        analyzed whether or not an MDR report was

              15        required for this event?

              16    A.  So the first reference I see is on the bottom

              17        of the second page.  It starts with

              18        September 30th, 2008.  There's notations that

              19        they checked Trac, which was the device

              20        tracking system, and Merlin call log system,

              21        and it goes on to say, "MDR equals no," with

              22        the rationale for why they made that

              23        decision.

              24    Q.  Okay.  And when it says in the parenthetical

              25        that says, "Path 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11," what


                                                                    85


               1        does that refer to?

               2    A.  That refers to box numbers on the decision

               3        tree within the MDR reporting procedure.

               4    Q.  All right.  Now let me ask you about

               5        Exhibit 9, which is the spreadsheet that

               6        Mr. Ellerbe showed you.

               7    A.  Yes.

               8    Q.  And turning to the second page of the

               9        document, which is the first page of the

              10        spreadsheet --

              11    A.  Okay.

              12    Q.  -- and looking at the second event, which is

              13        1384682.

              14    A.  Yup.

              15    Q.  There's a -- this -- this indicates the

              16        description of the event that was sent to the

              17        FDA; is that correct?

              18    A.  On the 3500A form?

              19    Q.  Yes.

              20    A.  Yes.

              21    Q.  Okay.  And do you see in the -- what does it

              22        say about -- in the box marked Description,

              23        about how the physician and the nurse work

              24        together to connect the lead to the header?

              25    A.  It says, "The physician then held the lead


                                                                    86


               1        and the device together as the nurse

               2        tightened the setscrew.  All measurements

               3        were within normal range."

               4    Q.  And that's -- and that's information that was

               5        given to the FDA?

               6    A.  Yes, this was in the 3500A form.

               7    Q.  Okay.  And when was that report made?

               8    A.  The column that says, "Date of this report

               9        sent date," says May 7th, 2009.

              10                    (Exhibits 12-14 marked.)

              11    BY MR. ROBINSON:

              12    Q.  All right.  Ms. Zurn, I'm going to hand you

              13        three documents that -- the first Exhibit 12

              14        bears the number TEMP-BSC00040844 through 45.

              15                 The second document, Exhibit 13,

              16        bears the numbers TEMP-BSC00040486 through

              17        40500.

              18                 And the third document, Exhibit 14,

              19        bears the number TEMP-BSC00040583 through

              20        40675.

              21                 And after you've had a chance to

              22        take a look at them, I just would like you to

              23        identify the documents for the record.

              24    A.  (Reviews documents.)  Okay.  So you want me

              25        to tell you what I'm seeing here?


                                                                    87


               1    Q.  Yes, tell me what they are.

               2    A.  So Exhibit 12 looks like a cover letter for

               3        an IDE submission for a reverse mode switch.

               4    Q.  Okay.

               5    A.  Exhibit 13 says it's the reverse mode switch

               6        pre-IDE, so it looks like an IDE submission,

               7        which is probably the attachment referred to

               8        in 12.

               9    Q.  Okay.

              10    A.  And 14 is a field following study clinical

              11        report.

              12    Q.  Okay.  Do you see in Exhibit 12, the cover

              13        letter, there's a reference to the COGENT

              14        study data in the two bullets at the bottom

              15        of the page?

              16    A.  Yes.

              17    Q.  Okay.  And the COGENT study data is what

              18        appears in Exhibit 14?

              19    A.  Yes.

              20    Q.  Okay.  What's the relationship -- can you

              21        tell me what the relationship is between the

              22        COGENT study at Exhibit 14 and the COGENT

              23        study at Exhibit 6?

              24    A.  Exhibit 6 is -- is this, (indicating)?

              25    Q.  Correct.


                                                                    88


               1    A.  So the question is between these two?

               2    Q.  What's the -- yeah, is there a relationship

               3        between them?

               4    A.  They both are listed as field following

               5        clinical reports.  One seems to precede the

               6        other.  One was in April and the other

               7        followed -- April of 2008, the other was June

               8        of 2009.

               9    Q.  And both were provided to the FDA?

              10    A.  I believe so.

              11    Q.  And if you look at Exhibit 14, is -- starting

              12        at what would be page 60 of the document --

              13    A.  Okay.

              14    Q.  -- which has the number BSC00040642.

              15    A.  Yup.

              16    Q.  Is there information being provided to the

              17        FDA regarding adverse events that occurred

              18        during the COGENT field following?

              19    A.  Yes, the table is titled Serious Adverse

              20        Device Effects.

              21    Q.  And how long does that table go on for?

              22    A.  Do you want me to count the pages?  Many

              23        pages.

              24    Q.  Does it end at page 80?

              25    A.  Let's see.  (Reviews document.)  It appears


                                                                    89


               1        to -- let me check 81.  Yes, the Appendix B

               2        starts at 81, so appendix C goes 60 to 80.

               3    Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  I don't have any

               4        other questions about that now.

               5    A.  Okay.

               6    Q.  Let me ask you to go back to Zurn Exhibit 2.

               7    A.  Okay.

               8    Q.  Okay.  Mr. Ellerbe asked you about the second

               9        page, fifth bullet.

              10    A.  Yes.

              11    Q.  Okay.  I'm going to ask you -- I want to ask

              12        you about the sixth bullet where it says,

              13        "Regarding this bullet above, it should be

              14        noted that in response to the deep dive on

              15        the legacy BSC warning systems, CRM updated

              16        its procedures to expand our MDR reporting to

              17        include devices not yet marketed in the U.S.;

              18        however, this appears to be in conflict with

              19        legacy BSC's practices as noted in their

              20        letter to FDA dated March 18th, 2009.  This

              21        letter stated that," quote, "in the absence

              22        of formal legally reviewed guidance from FDA,

              23        we stand by our position stated," dot, dot,

              24        dot, "that MDR regulations in 21 CFR part

              25        803, limit all MDR reporting to devices


                                                                    90


               1        marketed in the United States," end of

               2        quotations.

               3                 Did I read that correctly?

               4    A.  Yes.

               5    Q.  Okay.  Now, when it refers to, "Legacy BSC,"

               6        what are you -- what is this document

               7        referring to?

               8    A.  It's referring to the -- the larger

               9        Boston Scientific company that ultimately

              10        acquired Guidant.  So we internally referred

              11        to legacy BSC as anything other than what was

              12        the cardiac rhythm management division.

              13    Q.  Okay.  And the legacy BSC was taking a

              14        different position regarding the definition

              15        of similar than the CRM division was taking?

              16    A.  That's correct.

              17    Q.  Okay.  And the rationale for that is stated

              18        in this bullet; is that correct?

              19    A.  That is correct.

              20    Q.  All right.

              21                    MR. ROBINSON:  I have no other

              22        questions.

              23                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.  Just a couple

              24        on redirect.

               1                      FURTHER EXAMINATION

               2    BY MR. ELLERBE:

               3    Q.  You talked about a Merlin call and some of

               4        the information about the adverse effects.

               5        What is a Merlin call?

               6    A.  Merlin is a computer system that the

               7        technical services team uses to -- a computer

               8        system that captures their -- the call that

               9        they have with the clinician or a patient,

              10        whoever may call in look for technical

              11        support.

              12    Q.  Okay.  And then also turning to Zurn 6,

              13        Mr. Robinson asked about you the description

              14        of the adverse event on page 26 for the

              15        patient ID GEBOCGAO.

              16    A.  Yes.

              17    Q.  And you said that the description in that

              18        event was very similar to the description of

              19        the adverse event in Zurn 3; is that right?

              20    A.  I'll grab Zurn 3.  Sorry, I've got too much

              21        of a mess here.  I'm trying to find Zurn 3.

              22        Here it is.  Yes, it's not verbatim, but it

              23        is, in essence, the same complaint.

              24    Q.  And the description in the COGENT field

              25        following table does not say that the lead's


                                                                    92


               1        terminal pin was not fully inserted when the

               2        revision procedure occurred, does it?

               3    A.  It does not.

               4                    MR. ELLERBE:  Okay.  No further

               5        questions.

               6

               7                      FURTHER EXAMINATION

               8    BY MR. ROBINSON:

               9    Q.  What does -- looking at the same language,

              10        what does it say about the -- what needed to

              11        be fixed?

              12    A.  The setscrew of the proximal shock coil was

              13        fixed.

              14    Q.  Okay.

              15                    MR. ROBINSON:  No other questions.

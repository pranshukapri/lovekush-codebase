      14   BY MR. BLUM:

      15        Q    Good morning, Mr. Smith.

      16        A    Good morning.

      17        Q    My name is Joseph Blum and I

      18   represent Mercedes-Benz in a case which has

      19   been brought by Capitol Indemnity Insurance.

      20             I'm going to ask you some questions

      21   today.  Any time you don't understand my

      22   question, please let me know, I'll be happy to

      23   restate it for you.  It's my responsibility to

      24   ask you a question you understand.


                                                         6




       1        A    Okay, sure.

       2        Q    We ask that you keep all your

       3   responses verbal, because the court reporter

       4   cannot take down nods of our head, shrugs of

       5   our shoulders and such.  So just please keep

       6   all of your responses verbal.

       7             The other thing I would ask you to

       8   do is to try and let me finish my question

       9   before you start to speak.  In normal

      10   conversation we kind of try to anticipate

      11   where everything is going, but it is hard for

      12   the court reporter to take down more than one

      13   of us at a time.  Do you understand that?

      14        A    Sure.

      15        Q    And is there anything which would

      16   prevent you from testifying accurately here

      17   this morning?

      18        A    No.

      19        Q    Okay.  Can you tell us, sir --

      20                  MR. GOGINENI:  Joe, just before

      21        you start, one instruction I'm going to

      22        tell you, at some point I may object.

      23        Unless I say I'm objecting and I'm

      24        instructing you not to answer the


                                                         7




       1        question, you can ignore me objecting and

       2        you can answer the question.

       3                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

       4                  MR. BLUM:  We'll work that out

       5        as we go.  Hopefully there won't be any

       6        problems.

       7                  MR. GOGINENI:  We always get

       8        into those awkward pauses that I like to

       9        avoid.

      10                  MR. BLUM:  Not a problem.

      11   BY MR. BLUM:

      12        Q    Mr. Smith, can you tell us your

      13   educational background, please?

      14        A    I have a Ph.D. in material science

      15   from Drexel.

      16        Q    And before that?

      17        A    Master's degree in mechanical

      18   engineering from Northeastern.

      19        Q    All right.  And your Bachelor

      20   degree?

      21        A    From Northeastern as well.

      22        Q    Mechanical engineering?

      23        A    Yes.

      24        Q    Okay.  And when did you receive your


                                                         8




       1   Ph.D.?

       2        A    1985.

       3        Q    And are you the owner and/or

       4   operator of a company S-Bond Technologies?

       5        A    Yes.

       6        Q    Okay.  Can you tell us like when you

       7   formed that company?

       8        A    2000.

       9        Q    So between the time when you got out

      10   of school and 2000, could you tell us just

      11   very briefly what your work history was?

      12        A    Sure.  I was an engineer at GE for

      13   ten years and then I was a Drexel faculty for

      14   ten years.

      15        Q    Okay.

      16        A    And then started my own company.

      17        Q    All right.  And when you were an

      18   engineer at GE, what kind of things did you

      19   work on?

      20        A    Gas turbines, jet engines,

      21   materials.

      22        Q    And when you taught at Drexel, in

      23   general, that were the things you taught?

      24        A    Material science, engineering.


                                                         9




       1        Q    Okay.  And when you formed S-Bond in

       2   2000, was that the original name or did it

       3   operate under another name?

       4        A    We had two companies at the same

       5   time, Material Resources International and

       6   then S-Bond Technologies formed kind of out of

       7   that, and then eventually we closed Material

       8   Resources International.

       9        Q    Approximately when did Material

      10   Resources close?

      11        A    I was a faculty at Drexel, so I

      12   think -- well, when it closed, when it closed

      13   it was probably maybe 2006 or 7.

      14        Q    Okay.  And so after that, the

      15   company that you were operating operated under

      16   the S-Bond name?

      17        A    Only, yes.

      18        Q    Are you the sole owner of S-Bond?

      19        A    Yes.

      20        Q    Is it a corporation?

      21        A    Yes, LLC.

      22        Q    An LLC formed in Pennsylvania?

      23        A    Yes.

      24        Q    Okay.  And could you tell us just


                                                        10




       1   very briefly, what is the business of S-Bond?

       2        A    We do joining of dissimilar

       3   materials using special deformulations of

       4   solders that we have patented, and so we use

       5   that as selling the material and we also sell

       6   some joining services.

       7        Q    All right.  And has that basically

       8   been the business the entire time that you

       9   have operated?

      10        A    Yes.

      11        Q    At some point did you come to

      12   operate in a building, did S-Bond come to

      13   operate in a building on West 5th Street in

      14   Lansdale?

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    About when did you move in there?

      17        A    Around 2000.

      18        Q    Okay.  So like right around the time

      19   of the formation?

      20        A    Yeah, it was very close to that.

      21        Q    Okay.  And when you moved into

      22   there, my recollection is there's like six

      23   kind of condo units in that building, were you

      24   in one of those units?

       6   BY MR. BLUM:

       7        Q    I'm going to mark as Exhibit 1 to

       8   your deposition a floor plan actually for that

       9   building.  Okay.  If you can just take a

      10   moment and look at that for me.

      11        A    Uh-huh.

      12        Q    Do you recognize that in general?

      13        A    Yes.

      14        Q    Okay.  And can you tell me, as you

      15   sit there, do you recognize that the bottom of

      16   that diagram is basically standing on West 5th

      17   Street; is that correct?

      18        A    Yes.

      19        Q    Okay.  If we were standing on West

      20   5th Street looking at the building, which unit

      21   would be the one that S-Bond Technologies

      22   moved into?

      23        A    This one here, I forget the number,

      24   what unit it was.

       1        Q    Doesn't matter, okay.  Is it the

       2   one, it almost likes like it has "MRI" written

       3   on it?

       4        A    Material Resources International,

       5   when we first took it.

       6        Q    When you moved in there, who was the

       7   landlord?

       8        A    Clemens Uniforms.

       9        Q    And from the time that you were

      10   there until the time that it ended, was

      11   Clemens your --

      12        A    Landlord.

      13        Q    -- landlord?

      14        A    Uh-huh.

      15        Q    I want to just talk physically about

      16   the space for a minute.  When you moved in

      17   there in 2000, did you do anything to like

      18   change the physical layout?

      19        A    No.

      20        Q    Is it accurate that when you first

      21   walked in off of 5th Street, there were some

      22   offices there?

      23        A    Yes.

      24        Q    Okay.  And did that remain the case


                                                        13




       1   until the fire occurred in 2016?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    Okay.  And when you walked into

       4   those offices, if you went through the office,

       5   would it be accurate that there would be what

       6   I would call warehouse space behind the

       7   office?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    And did you have a garage door or

      10   some type of opening onto the back parking

      11   lot?

      12        A    Yeah, there was a loading dock and

      13   then a ground level garage door.

      14        Q    Okay.  And was there also a man door

      15   there or just the garage door?

      16        A    Man door as well.

      17        Q    Okay.  And if we were standing in

      18   the warehouse looking at the office space, is

      19   it accurate that that kind of only went up one

      20   floor and there was like open space above the

      21   office?

      22        A    Yes.

      23        Q    Okay.  And if we were in your space,

      24   the, what I'll call the side walls of the


                                                        14




       1   space, what were they constructed of, if you

       2   know?

       3        A    To the left there was a concrete

       4   wall, if you're looking into the space from

       5   the back.  And to the right, it wasn't the

       6   same wall, it wasn't a firewall.  The other

       7   wall was a firewall, what they call a

       8   firewall.

       9        Q    So just to make sure I understood

      10   you correctly, if we're at the back at the

      11   loading dock when you're looking in, the wall

      12   on your left was cinder --

      13        A    Concrete, cinderblock wall.

      14        Q    Cinderblock, okay.  Were there any

      15   openings between your space where that

      16   cinderblock wall was and the neighbor next

      17   door?

      18        A    There might have been at one time

      19   but it was closed off.

      20        Q    When you say it was closed off, was

      21   it closed off by like concrete or closed off

      22   by like a door?

      23        A    I don't recall.

      24        Q    Okay.  And how about your, if we


                                                        15




       1   were standing at the back again and to the

       2   right of your space, was there any openings

       3   between your space and the neighbor to the

       4   right?

       5        A    None that I recall.

       6        Q    And going back to, let's say, the

       7   day before the fire occurred, had you had any

       8   discussions with Clemens up until that point

       9   about them asking you to change the unit that

      10   you were in?

      11        A    There was some discussions about

      12   that eventually happening.

      13        Q    Okay.  And when did those

      14   discussions start?

      15        A    I don't recall.

      16        Q    And just in general in terms of

      17   before the fire, weeks, months?

      18        A    Months.

      19        Q    And what do you recall the substance

      20   of those discussions being?

      21        A    If I recall, it was probably he was

      22   looking to grow and use that space and was

      23   asking me to take the end unit.

      24        Q    I'm sorry, take the --


                                                        16




       1        A    This unit here.

       2        Q    The end unit, is that what you said?

       3        A    Yes, end unit.

       4        Q    Had you discussed any timeline to do

       5   that?

       6        A    No.

       7        Q    And at the time before the fire, did

       8   you have a written lease with Clemens?

       9        A    We were on a, I think the lease is

      10   officially expired but we were on a year to

      11   year.

      12        Q    Okay.  And if you recall, what were

      13   you paying in rent at the time of the fire?

      14        A    I'd say nearly $3,000 a month,

      15   something like that.

      16        Q    Going back, let's say, the day

      17   before the fire occurred, how many employees

      18   did S-Bond Technologies have?

      19        A    Approximately, because I don't

      20   recall the exact number --

      21        Q    Sure.

      22        A    -- probably eight.

      23        Q    Okay.  And were you actually at that

      24   point in time, in like the early summer of


                                                        17




       1   2016, doing like real work in the warehouse in

       2   the back, were you actually producing material

       3   back there?

       4        A    Yes.

       5        Q    Okay.  And during that time frame

       6   did you have any flammable material stored in

       7   your space?

       8        A    We had solvents and we had a

       9   flammable cabinet that we stored solvents in.

      10        Q    Okay.  And did you store any

      11   material anywhere in this building or any

      12   related buildings other than in your

      13   individual space?

      14        A    No.

      15        Q    How did you learn that the fire had

      16   occurred at the property?

      17        A    Woken up by my wife.

      18        Q    Okay.  And how did she learn of it?

      19        A    The alarm company finally called her

      20   because I was ignoring the call from a 1-800

      21   service number at 11 o'clock or 11:30 at

      22   night.

      23        Q    Okay.  So did you have alarms of

      24   some type in your space?


                                                        18




       1        A    Smoke, fire, and burglar alarm

       2   system.

       3        Q    Okay.  And what was the name of that

       4   company?

       5        A    Czarstar is the folks who installed

       6   it.  I'm trying to remember the name of the

       7   company that was actually monitoring it.

       8        Q    Okay.  Do you know at what point in

       9   time you got the first call from them?

      10        A    Around 11:30 in the evening.

      11        Q    And what type of fire detection

      12   equipment was inside your space?

      13        A    When you say what type?

      14        Q    Was it a smoke detector?

      15        A    Smoke, fire, burglar.

      16        Q    And what type of fire detection was

      17   in there?

      18        A    I don't know.  It's part of the

      19   package.

      20        Q    And it did have some type of central

      21   station monitoring?

      22        A    Yes.

      23        Q    And do you, you have no recollection

      24   as you sit here today who the central station


                                                        19




       1   monitoring company was?

       2        A    Not at the moment, no.

       3        Q    Okay.  Could you find that

       4   somewhere?

       5        A    I can on bills.

       6        Q    Okay.

       7        A    But I'd have to find out.

       8        Q    All right.  I would, if you could

       9   find that for us, we would like to know who

      10   that was because I'd like to know the time

      11   when they received the first call, the first

      12   signal?

      13        A    The first signal was smoke, I do

      14   recall that.  And then later, I'm standing in

      15   the fire and they're still calling me.

      16        Q    So your wife awoke you, like did

      17   they call the house or --

      18        A    She was in California.

      19        Q    So did she have like, is she one of

      20   the alternative people for them to call?

      21        A    Yeah.

      22        Q    What did she tell you?

      23        A    That the alarm company is calling

      24   and I think she mentioned the smoke alarm was


                                                        20




       1   running.

       2        Q    Okay.

       3        A    And then shortly thereafter my

       4   coworker notified me because his dad is an

       5   avid listener to the fire station calls and

       6   said there was a fire at our address.

       7        Q    And did you drive there immediately?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    And where do you live?

      10        A    I live in Blue Bell.

      11        Q    Okay.  And what did you observe when

      12   you got there?

      13        A    Smoke, orange sky as I approached,

      14   and a lot of fire hoses.

      15        Q    And did you like walk, were you able

      16   to park locally and walk up to the scene?

      17        A    I parked a block or two away and

      18   then walked to the scene, yes.

      19        Q    And when you walked to the scene,

      20   which side of the building did you approach

      21   from?

      22        A    Whatever this side is, I forget the

      23   name of that side.

      24        Q    Mitchell Street?


                                                        21




       1        A    Yes.

       2        Q    And were you walking down 5th Street

       3   or down Mitchell?

       4        A    Mitchell.

       5        Q    As you walked down Mitchell, tell me

       6   what you saw as you got towards the building?

       7        A    Fire engines, ladders over the roof.

       8        Q    Okay.

       9        A    Water being poured onto the fire,

      10   end of the building, which was really this

      11   half, those two-thirds.

      12        Q    And when you say this half or

      13   two-thirds, you're indicating the half or

      14   two-thirds towards Mitchell Street?

      15        A    Correct.

      16        Q    And did you stay in front of the

      17   building or did you walk around to the back?

      18        A    Eventually walked to the back.

      19        Q    When you first got there, though,

      20   did you walk down the front?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    And tell me what you observed when

      23   you walked down the front of the building?

      24        A    Firemen all over the place, ladders


                                                        22




       1   on the back side dumping water, cutting holes

       2   in the roof, and breaking windows to get in.

       3        Q    And as you walked down 5th Street,

       4   there are a series of windows across the front

       5   of that building; is that correct?

       6        A    Correct.

       7        Q    Were you able or do you recall, did

       8   you see any actual fire through those windows?

       9        A    Yes.

      10        Q    Do you recall approximately what

      11   time it was when you arrived at the scene?

      12        A    12:30 time frame.

      13        Q    Okay.

      14        A    A.m.

      15        Q    Yes.  And as you walked down towards

      16   the S-Bond unit, can you tell me what

      17   conditions you saw around your unit?

      18        A    Quiet, there hadn't been any fire in

      19   that unit yet.  They were dumping water over

      20   that unit into the hot side of the unit.

      21        Q    Okay.  And then did you walk around

      22   to the rear of the building at some point?

      23        A    Yes.

      24        Q    And tell me what you observed at the


                                                        23




       1   rear of the building?

       2        A    They were trying to get some doors

       3   open.  Again, I saw the opposite side of the

       4   ladders that were dumping water, I think some

       5   firemen were on the roof cutting holes.

       6        Q    Were any of the doors at the rear

       7   open when you walked back there?

       8        A    When I walked back, no, but while I

       9   was there, they got them open.  They opened my

      10   unit and the one adjacent to it.

      11        Q    All right.  And when they opened

      12   your unit, were you are able to see inside?

      13        A    Yes.

      14        Q    And what did you observe?

      15        A    A very expensive piece of equipment

      16   that belonged to my customer in a safe

      17   condition.  It was just smoke.  There was no

      18   fire involved.

      19        Q    Okay.  And when was the first time

      20   that you were ever able to walk back into your

      21   unit?

      22        A    Went home that night at around 5:00,

      23   4:00 a.m., came back around 9:30, and probably

      24   about lunchtime the following day, the fire


                                                        24




       1   marshal escorted us through.

       2        Q    And do you remember who the fire

       3   marshal was?

       4        A    I forget his name.

       5        Q    Jay Daveler, does that ring a bell?

       6        A    Might be.

       7        Q    Okay.  And when you say he escorted

       8   you through, who was with you?

       9        A    The gentleman who was the, I think

      10   EDS -- no, emergency -- EDS person was there

      11   at the scene.  They were disaster service.

      12        Q    Right.

      13        A    So I had just called my insurance

      14   company, asked them what I should do.  They

      15   said do whatever you have to do, if you need

      16   to hire that person, go ahead.  So I went up

      17   to him and so he escorted -- he was escorted

      18   with me and my coworker through the unit just

      19   to see what had to get removed quickly.

      20        Q    And tell me what you observed when

      21   you walked through the unit at that time?

      22        A    Dark, dank, wet, smoky, black

      23   everywhere, water about an inch on the floor

      24   everywhere, some water dripping through some


                                                        25




       1   of the ceiling tiles.  That's what I recall.

       2        Q    Okay.  And was there any evidence to

       3   you or indication to you that there had been

       4   any fire in the unit itself?

       5        A    When we went up to the upper

       6   mezzanine, which is the upper level, some fire

       7   had entered the very corner of that upper

       8   mezzanine.  Otherwise there was no fire in the

       9   unit.

      10        Q    Tell me what you mean by the upper

      11   mezzanine?

      12        A    Sorry for pointing, but it's this

      13   upper corner because that evening prior we had

      14   seen the firemen breaking into that area

      15   because that was a hotspot they were trying to

      16   get water on.

      17        Q    When you say the upper area, is that

      18   the area above the offices?

      19        A    Above that office, yes.

      20        Q    And what kind of space was up there

      21   above the office, was it space that you could

      22   walk on or --

      23        A    Yes.  It was probably 8 foot high to

      24   the beams, steel beams, and then there was a


                                                        26




       1   steel roof above that.

       2        Q    And did your company use that for

       3   any purpose?

       4        A    We used it for storage.

       5        Q    Okay.  And what type of things were

       6   stored up there?

       7        A    Solder materials, old files,

       8   tooling, stuff that you use temporarily,

       9   metal.

      10        Q    And after you walked through the

      11   property that first day after the fire, tell

      12   me what occurred next?

      13        A    The fire marshal mentioned that

      14   there was a good chance that they would be

      15   tearing the building down, and he gave us six

      16   hours to get all our stuff out.

      17        Q    Okay.  So --

      18        A    So we immediately started dragging

      19   stuff out the back doors, and the EDS company

      20   was pulling up all kinds of trucks, we were

      21   loading stuff on trucks just to get as much

      22   salvage equipment and office things out of

      23   there.  And then the computers were picked up,

      24   and all that stuff, and given to another


                                                        27




       1   company who had responsibility for making sure

       2   those computers remained operational.

       3        Q    And do you remember who that company

       4   was?

       5        A    I forget the -- well, EDS was the

       6   contractor, so they had a subcontractor --

       7        Q    Okay.

       8        A    -- who handles electronic equipment.

       9   I forget the name of that company.

      10        Q    Okay.  And so at the end of that six

      11   hours, had you removed everything that you

      12   thought was salvageable?

      13        A    Yes.

      14        Q    And what did EDS do with that

      15   material?

      16        A    Stored it in a unit that they owned

      17   maybe six miles away.

      18        Q    And what did you do, if anything, to

      19   then get your business back in operation?

      20        A    Went out and rented a space.

      21        Q    Okay.

      22        A    Within a week.

      23        Q    And where did you rent that space

      24   out?

       1        A    2299 Amber Drive in Hatfield.

       2        Q    And in your space at the Clemens

       3   facility, how many square feet did you have

       4   there?

       5        A    About 4,600 on the floor level and

       6   probably another 1,000 feet at the mezzanine.

       7        Q    And when you got to your spot in

       8   Hatfield, how much space did you have

       9   available to you?

      10        A    The space that was available was

      11   15,000, and then we checked with the insurance

      12   company if we could co-locate with another

      13   company that I had a relationship with and

      14   share the space.  And we did, and Cap approved

      15   that in terms of us making that deal to get

      16   into that space to get operational.

      17        Q    And what was the rental, the total

      18   rental, on that new space?

      19        A    Roughly 10,000.

      20        Q    And how much of that was your

      21   company responsible for?

      22        A    When the first year was decided, it

      23   was, we were responsible for 10 and the other

      24   company was responsible for 5 thousand square


                                                        29




       1   feet.

       2        Q    Okay.  And what was the amount of

       3   rent that you paid and the other company paid?

       4        A    I don't recall exactly, but maybe it

       5   was 7,000 for us and 3,000 for them or

       6   6,500/3,500, something in that order.

       7        Q    All right.  I'm going to show you a

       8   document which we marked at another

       9   deposition, so the exhibit number on it is

      10   going to be Farr 1.  I'm going to ask you if

      11   you can just take a look at that for a moment,

      12   please.

      13        A    Uh-huh.  When you day document, all

      14   the pages?

      15        Q    Yes, just flip through it once, and

      16   the first question I'm going to ask you is

      17   have you ever seen that in that format before?

      18        A    I think I provided them some of the

      19   photos, but I don't recall seeing the format.

      20        Q    In the beginning there are a whole

      21   series of photographs of the outside of the

      22   building and the truck, which I'm going to

      23   skip, so if you go to Page 15, do you know, is

      24   that a photograph that you took?


                                                        30




       1        A    I don't recall if I took this one.

       2        Q    All right.  So do you recognize what

       3   is shown in the photograph that's on Page 15

       4   of Farr Exhibit 1?

       5        A    Yes.

       6        Q    Can you just tell us briefly what

       7   that is?

       8        A    That's our shop area, the warehouse

       9   space in behind the office area.

      10        Q    And can you tell me like which

      11   direction and how we're looking at it?  It

      12   appears that there's some doors to the

      13   right-hand side?

      14        A    This is coming in the man door in

      15   the back and looking into the shop, so those

      16   two doors -- well, you don't see two, the

      17   first door is what you call the loading dock

      18   door and on the other side of the steel beam

      19   is the drive-up door.

      20        Q    Okay.  And where would the offices

      21   be?

      22        A    To the left.

      23        Q    Okay.  And is this photograph, to

      24   the best of your knowledge, taken immediately


                                                        31




       1   after the fire and before anything was

       2   removed?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    Okay.

       5        A    No, wait a minute.  It was taken --

       6   there's something that's not there anymore, so

       7   something has been removed.

       8        Q    Do you know what it was that was

       9   removed?

      10        A    Our hot plate system that we had

      11   here that had some very expensive equipment on

      12   it, so.

      13        Q    And removed as part of the cleanout

      14   that you talked about earlier?

      15        A    I believe so, from what I'm seeing

      16   here.

      17        Q    Okay.  And can you tell me, there

      18   appears to be on the left side of the

      19   photograph some equipment there.  What is that

      20   equipment?

      21        A    I can't tell from this angle.

      22        Q    Okay.  If you could look at the next

      23   page, which is Page 16, can you tell me, is

      24   this another photograph of the interior of


                                                        32




       1   your space?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    And can you tell me in what

       4   direction we're looking?

       5        A    It's looking to that cement wall

       6   that's on the left of the space as you walk in

       7   the back.

       8        Q    Okay.  And where would the offices

       9   be if we were --

      10        A    To the right.

      11        Q    Okay.  And in fact to the right

      12   there's a door that's standing open there.

      13        A    Right.

      14        Q    Is that the office space?

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    And to the best of your knowledge is

      17   this the way the space looked before the

      18   cleanout or after the cleanout?

      19        A    In the middle of it, from what I'm

      20   seeing here.

      21        Q    Okay.  Let's take a look at Pages 16

      22   and 17, are those photographs of some of your

      23   equipment that was in the space?

      24        A    Yes.


                                                        33




       1        Q    The drill press that's on Page-- I

       2   should ask, is that a drill press on Page 18?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    Was that saved or not, do you know?

       5        A    Yes, it was saved, it had to get

       6   cleaned.

       7        Q    And if you take a look at Pages 19

       8   and 20, do you recognize that as equipment

       9   that was inside your space?

      10        A    Yes.

      11        Q    And it's tougher, but can you tell

      12   me what it is?

      13        A    19 is a grinding unit and 20 is a

      14   belt sander.

      15        Q    And do you know whether or not those

      16   two pieces of equipment were saved?

      17        A    I believe they were replaced.

      18        Q    So as far as you know, when you

      19   walked out at the end of that six-hour period,

      20   was that left behind?

      21        A    I'm not sure it was left behind.

      22   But later as we were cleaning certain things

      23   were inoperable.

      24        Q    Okay.


                                                        34




       1        A    I don't recall.

       2        Q    If you could take a look at Page 21

       3   for me, please.

       4        A    Uh-huh.

       5        Q    Do you know what that is depicted

       6   on --

       7        A    It's a benchtop lathe.

       8        Q    Do you know whether or not that was

       9   saved?

      10        A    That was replaced.

      11        Q    Okay.  Let's skip ahead, if we

      12   could, to Page 25.  Can you tell us what the

      13   equipment is that appears on Page 25?

      14        A    Grit blasting equipment.

      15        Q    And was this equipment saved?

      16        A    No.

      17        Q    Was there any attempt to remove it

      18   or was it just left behind?

      19        A    I believe these were left behind.

      20        Q    If you could skip ahead to Page 42

      21   for me, please.

      22        A    Uh-huh.

      23        Q    Can you tell me what the equipment

      24   is that's depicted in 42?


                                                        35




       1        A    This is a small blasting unit, grit

       2   blasting unit.

       3        Q    And do you know whether or not that

       4   was salvaged in the --

       5        A    That was replaced.

       6        Q    And now if you skip ahead to

       7   Page 48, is that a picture of what I would

       8   call the front door off of 5th Street?

       9        A    Yes.

      10        Q    And that would have been taken like

      11   from in the office space?

      12        A    Yes.

      13        Q    And if you look at Page 49, like 49

      14   and 50, are those pictures of the office space

      15   after the fire?

      16        A    After the fire, but there's been

      17   some things removed, so this was probably in

      18   the process of us emptying it.

      19        Q    And like is the computer equipment

      20   is already out of here?

      21        A    Yes.  That was the first thing we

      22   got out of there.

      23        Q    Okay.  If you can skip ahead to

      24   Page 68, can you tell me what that equipment


                                                        36




       1   is that's depicted on Page 68?

       2        A    That's the ultrasonic C-scan tank

       3   and unit.

       4        Q    And what is that used for?

       5        A    It's used for using ultrasound to

       6   detect defects in material.

       7        Q    All right.  And was that unit

       8   operable before the fire occurred?

       9        A    Yes.

      10        Q    And after the fire occurred, tell me

      11   what, to the best of your knowledge, happened

      12   with that piece of equipment?

      13        A    We sent the whole unit to this

      14   electronic cleaning company, cleaned up a lot

      15   of the equipment, tried to get it operational.

      16        Q    And was it ever made operational

      17   again?

      18        A    Eventually, yes.

      19        Q    All right.  If you could, let's turn

      20   to Page 69.  Is that the same piece of

      21   equipment?

      22        A    Yes.

      23        Q    Okay.  And is that also true of

      24   Page 70?


                                                        37




       1        A    Yes.

       2        Q    Page 71, could you tell us what that

       3   is?

       4        A    No.

       5        Q    Okay.  Page 72, any idea what that

       6   picture is?

       7        A    Yes.  That would have been a support

       8   structure for hot plates.

       9        Q    And was that support structure saved

      10   or was it --

      11        A    It was salvaged.

      12        Q    Okay.  And on Page 73, do you know

      13   what that is?

      14        A    Those are hot plates.

      15        Q    And when you say hot plates, tell us

      16   a little bit more specifically what kind of

      17   hot plates?

      18        A    They are aluminum cast plates that

      19   have heaters in them that we use to heat

      20   material up.

      21        Q    And were those salvaged?

      22        A    Yes.

      23        Q    Page 74, can you tell me what that

      24   is?


                                                        38




       1        A    We did have to replace the

       2   controllers, but not the hot plates, on

       3   Page 73.

       4        Q    Okay.  And when you say controllers,

       5   you mean like the electronic controllers?

       6        A    Some electronic controllers were

       7   shot by dust and smoke probably.

       8        Q    Okay.  And Page 74?

       9        A    Same hot plates, just picture of the

      10   connection end.

      11        Q    All right.  And Page 75?

      12        A    Stuff.

      13        Q    None of it appears to be anything

      14   what I would call like specific valuable

      15   equipment for the company?

      16        A    The only thing would have been the

      17   lift that's in the picture, probably, and

      18   there's another lift that you can't see, but

      19   we had to replace the pallet jack.  Other than

      20   that not specifically, drawers from some of

      21   the units.

      22        Q    And pallet jack, it was like a

      23   hand-operated pallet jack?

      24        A    Yes.


                                                        39




       1        Q    In fact, if you look at Page 76,

       2   does that depict --

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    -- a pallet jack, okay.

       5             If you look at Page 77 for me,

       6   please, can you tell me what that is?

       7        A    There's some rolling equipment in

       8   the right foreground for rolling foil.  On the

       9   left, that's thrown away, so I forget what

      10   this was, to be honest.

      11        Q    Do you know whether or not that

      12   equipment survived the fire?

      13        A    The one on the left, no.  The one on

      14   the right, yes.

      15        Q    And on Page 78, can you tell me what

      16   that is?

      17        A    Pallets of stuff.

      18        Q    Okay.  But in the middle there, that

      19   appears to be some kind of a piece of

      20   equipment?

      21        A    I can't tell from this photo.

      22        Q    Can I see it -- you know, I'm

      23   looking at a different page.  You're on 79, go

      24   back to Page 78.


                                                        40




       1        A    All right.  Sorry.

       2        Q    That's all right.

       3        A    That was our customer's very

       4   expensive piece of equipment and the box for

       5   it.

       6        Q    Okay.  And was that piece of

       7   equipment salvaged or what happened to it?

       8        A    Yes, it was salvaged and shipped

       9   back to the customer.

      10        Q    And were you responsible for any

      11   damage to that equipment?

      12        A    Thank heavens, no.

      13        Q    What kind of piece of equipment was

      14   it?

      15        A    It was a silicon carbine mirror for

      16   laser processing.

      17        Q    And why did you have it in your

      18   unit?

      19        A    We were soldering stainless

      20   components to it or cooling components.  That

      21   was our job, one of our bonding jobs.

      22        Q    Okay.  And had you already completed

      23   the work?

      24        A    No.


                                                        41




       1        Q    Did you ever complete that work?

       2        A    It was completed at the customer's

       3   location.

       4        Q    Skip ahead to Page 82, if you could,

       5   for me, please.  Can you identify what that

       6   piece of equipment is?

       7        A    It's a press.

       8        Q    And was that press saved?

       9        A    The press was.  We had to replace

      10   the control unit.

      11        Q    And Page 84?

      12        A    That's a scale for measuring

      13   sensitive weights, that we had to replace that

      14   scale.

      15        Q    Page 85?

      16        A    That's a tabletop smaller wood

      17   lathe.

      18        Q    And was that saved or not?

      19        A    No.

      20        Q    And on Page 86, can you tell us like

      21   in the left corner there, there appears to be

      22   a piece of equipment?

      23        A    Well, the left corner with the

      24   yellow base is a hot plate.


                                                        42




       1        Q    How about in the center of that

       2   picture?

       3        A    The center of that is an oven,

       4   convex heating oven.

       5        Q    What was that used for?

       6        A    Curing epoxy, heating, drying

       7   materials.

       8        Q    Was that piece saved?

       9        A    Saved, but we had to replace the

      10   electronics, controller.

      11        Q    And on Page 87?

      12        A    A hot plate.

      13        Q    All right.  Was that hot plate

      14   saved?

      15        A    I don't know if this specific one

      16   was because we did throw away some, so I'm not

      17   sure whether this specific one was.  And

      18   behind it is an ultrasonic soldering part

      19   that's been salvaged.

      20        Q    Okay.  You could put that aside now.

      21             Can you tell me in terms of the

      22   payments that you received from the insurance

      23   company, I just want to verify, you were paid

      24   for equipment, like business personal


                                                        43




       1   property; correct?

       2        A    Uh-huh.  Yes.

       3        Q    I missed that.  You were also paid

       4   for what I'll call extra expenses that you had

       5   as a result of the move --

       6        A    Yes.

       7        Q    -- for that interruption.

       8             And you were also paid some extra

       9   lease expense that you had; is that correct?

      10        A    That's correct.

      11        Q    Were there any other categories of

      12   damages that you were being paid for by the

      13   insurance company?

      14        A    If you mentioned it, I wasn't quite

      15   sure, but business loss.

      16        Q    Yes.

      17        A    Yes.

      18        Q    So to me the business loss and the

      19   extra expense I think run together.

      20        A    Yes, okay.

      21        Q    So I want to talk for a minute now,

      22   if we could, just about what you were paid and

      23   how you were paid for the equipment that was

      24   lost.  Okay?


                                                        44




       1        A    Uh-huh.

       2        Q    I'm going to show you a document

       3   which we marked the other day as Farr Exhibit

       4   No. 2.  And the first thing I want to ask you

       5   to do is, can you identify what appears to be

       6   a spreadsheet which is on the front of that

       7   document?

       8        A    When you say identify --

       9        Q    Do you recognize it?

      10        A    Yes.

      11        Q    What is that spreadsheet?

      12        A    It's a list of items that we

      13   replaced.

      14        Q    Okay.  And who is the author of that

      15   spreadsheet?

      16        A    Myself.

      17        Q    Okay.  And how did you go about

      18   putting that together?

      19        A    Taking the various items, receipts,

      20   collating them and putting them in a

      21   spreadsheet for submission to Cap Specialties.

      22        Q    And when you did this, had you

      23   already gotten, like you said, all of your

      24   equipment went to a temporary space.  Did the


                                                        45




       1   equipment like come to your new space and then

       2   you worked on it or when did you work on it

       3   just in terms of not the date, but in terms of

       4   logistics of what was happening?

       5        A    Most of the stuff sat in EDS's

       6   warehouse for about a week until we had the

       7   space available.  And then we palletized

       8   everything, brought it over to the new space,

       9   and then over the next two to three months

      10   emptied the pallets, cleaned things off.  We

      11   didn't hire EDS to do that.  We did that

      12   ourselves.

      13        Q    And was this spreadsheet that's

      14   marked as Farr Exhibit 2 put together as the

      15   things came off the pallets?

      16        A    A combination of things.  Immediate

      17   replacement, so I don't know the date of this

      18   one, but as we went into finding which was

      19   operable, which wasn't, then we replaced

      20   certain items.  So it's probably some

      21   combination.

      22        Q    If you look at the top of this, it's

      23   dated July 15th to August 15th; okay?

      24        A    Yes.


                                                        46




       1        Q    So to the best of your knowledge is

       2   this the first of these spreadsheets that you

       3   put together?

       4        A    I believe so, the time frame would

       5   suggest that.

       6        Q    Okay.  And if we could, I just want

       7   to identify what each of the columns are for.

       8   The first --

       9        A    Where it was -- these were the

      10   locations codes that I gave to Farr to

      11   identify where they were so that he could like

      12   tie them to pictures if he needed to.

      13        Q    So the first column says "Location,"

      14   and just tell us what each of those initials

      15   means as you go down, if you remember.

      16        A    I don't recall.

      17        Q    Okay.  But those initials would have

      18   stood for locations where they were in the

      19   original space?

      20        A    Yes.

      21        Q    The next column over says "Item" and

      22   there are some codes there.

      23        A    For example, some of them would be

      24   like office equipment or shop equipment, so I


                                                        47




       1   don't know all the codes now that I'm looking

       2   at them, but that's kind of what those codes

       3   stood for in terms of the classification of

       4   the kind of equipment that was being replaced.

       5        Q    Okay.  And then as we go across, the

       6   next thing it appears there's something filled

       7   in is "Replacement Cost."  Do you see that?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    Did you put those replacement cost

      10   numbers in there?

      11        A    Yes.

      12        Q    And are they the actual cost that

      13   you spent to replace those items?

      14        A    I think they were guesstimates at

      15   the time and the actual cost is the cost in

      16   the "Cost" column.

      17        Q    Okay.  So then there's another,

      18   after replacement cost there's, I think it's

      19   "Status" column?

      20        A    Uh-huh.

      21        Q    Can you tell us what the codes mean

      22   in there?

      23        A    I don't recall.

      24        Q    RP, replace?


                                                        48




       1        A    Replace, probably, yes.

       2        Q    Then there's a column that says

       3   "Cost."

       4        A    Uh-huh.

       5        Q    Is that the actual cost of what you

       6   spent?

       7        A    Yes, I would believe so, yes,

       8   because they're very specific.

       9        Q    Then there's a space for "Vendor."

      10   Is that the vendor that you went to to replace

      11   it?

      12        A    Yes.

      13        Q    "Receipt" and there's a number.  Is

      14   that like a number of a receipt?

      15        A    We wrote numbers on receipts, yes.

      16        Q    And then it says, "Submit Date."

      17        A    This is, what I would do is

      18   accumulate something and submit, so that would

      19   be that column.

      20        Q    Okay.  So what this appears to be

      21   then is the receipts and the spreadsheet you

      22   put together for the period July 15th to

      23   August 15th that you then submitted to the

      24   insurance company?


                                                        49




       1        A    Yes.

       2        Q    Okay.  And is it accurate that the

       3   insurance company paid you the replacement

       4   value of the things that you replaced?

       5        A    Yes.

       6        Q    So, in other words, what they didn't

       7   do is say to you, "You had a used piece of

       8   equipment, we're just going to pay you the

       9   used value"?

      10        A    I don't recall that discussion.  But

      11   I submitted our expenses to get operational,

      12   yes.

      13        Q    And to the best of your knowledge,

      14   did you get reimbursed for all the items that

      15   were listed on Farr Exhibit 2?

      16        A    I don't recall if it was exactly

      17   every one, but substantially, yes.

      18        Q    Okay.  I want to move ahead, if we

      19   could now, to Farr Exhibit 3 for a minute, and

      20   ask you if you recognize this spreadsheet?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    And is this another group of items

      23   that you submitted to the insurance company?

      24        A    I would assume so, but, it looks


                                                        50




       1   like it, yes.

       2        Q    And, again, the same, the columns

       3   are all the same on that and they appear to

       4   have the same kind of information as on the

       5   first spreadsheet we looked at?

       6        A    Yes.

       7        Q    Okay.  And as we sit here today, do

       8   you know whether or not you were reimbursed

       9   the replacement cost for all those items?

      10        A    I believe so.

      11        Q    Okay.  Moving ahead, if we could

      12   now, to Farr Exhibit No. 4, again, I'm going

      13   to ask you if you can identify that

      14   spreadsheet?

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    And this one actually has a date at

      17   the top now, it says August 16th through

      18   September 3rd?

      19        A    30th.

      20        Q    30th, I'm sorry, reading upside

      21   down.  And is that, again, a spreadsheet of

      22   replaced items that you put together?

      23        A    Yes.

      24        Q    And were you reimbursed for those


                                                        51




       1   items?

       2        A    Substantially, yes.

       3        Q    Okay.  I'm going to show you a

       4   document which was marked previously as Farr

       5   Exhibit No. 6 and ask you if you know what

       6   that document is?

       7        A    It's items that we threw away,

       8   didn't specifically replace, probably.

       9        Q    Okay.  When you say items we threw

      10   away, are they items that essentially were

      11   left at the old facility?

      12        A    It might be a combination, but there

      13   was a salvage done of what was remaining that

      14   we didn't pull out of the building, due to

      15   time and just not worth the effort.  So the

      16   answer is maybe these were most of the things

      17   that were left but not necessarily all of

      18   them.

      19        Q    So some of them might have come out

      20   and were scrapped?

      21        A    Were scrapped, sitting in the back

      22   that we couldn't do anything with, because

      23   then we had time to assess their utility.

      24        Q    Sure.  Now, in terms of the columns


                                                        52




       1   on this one, "Location" and "Item" are the

       2   same?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    "Description" is the same thing,

       5   right?

       6        A    Uh-huh.

       7        Q    Now column here, "Original Cost."

       8   Okay?

       9        A    Uh-huh.

      10        Q    Did you personally put in that

      11   original cost item?

      12        A    They were guesstimates that I made,

      13   yes.

      14        Q    And did you do any research when you

      15   put those numbers together?

      16        A    We had done some but not directly,

      17   just knowing what things generally cost.

      18        Q    Okay.  So it wasn't like you sat

      19   down and you went on the Internet and you

      20   looked up the cost of those particular items?

      21        A    No.

      22        Q    And did you have any like business

      23   records that you used in order to look for the

      24   original cost of those items?


                                                        53




       1        A    If they were, they were lost, but

       2   the answer is no.

       3        Q    Then there's a column for "Age," I

       4   believe?

       5        A    Yes.

       6        Q    And is that an age in years that you

       7   assigned to each of those things?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    And, again, was that based upon your

      10   personal recollection of how old those items

      11   were?

      12        A    Yes.

      13        Q    All right.  Then there's a column

      14   that says "Scrap Value," I think it says

      15   "Estimated at 20%."  Do you see that?

      16        A    Yes.

      17        Q    What does that column represent?

      18        A    Just kind of a guess at what the

      19   value could be if you, what do you call it,

      20   depreciated it.

      21        Q    And the amount, the 20%, what, if

      22   anything, did you do to arrive at that number?

      23        A    Guess.

      24        Q    Okay.  Was it based on any


                                                        54




       1   discussion you had with anyone from the

       2   insurance company?

       3        A    No.

       4        Q    And the replacement cost that's

       5   listed there, right here in this column, did

       6   you personally determine those replacement

       7   costs or how did that come about?

       8        A    On some, probably.  On others they

       9   were estimates.

      10        Q    Okay.  And do you know what amount

      11   did the insurance company pay you on these

      12   items that were on the scrapped list?

      13        A    I don't recall that number.

      14        Q    Okay.  Were any of these items

      15   subject to negotiation where you and the

      16   insurance company went back and forth on any

      17   particular item?

      18        A    Not on a line by line, no.

      19        Q    Okay.  Was there any discussion on a

      20   general basis of what you would be paid on the

      21   scrapped items?

      22        A    I don't recall.

      23        Q    Okay, all right.  I'm going to show

      24   you a document which was marked as Farr


                                                        55




       1   Exhibit 5, and I'm just going to ask you

       2   really about the first page of this.  Do you

       3   recall being billed for some portion of the

       4   demolition?

       5        A    Yes.

       6        Q    Okay.  What was it that you recall

       7   that you were paying for, what were they

       8   doing?

       9        A    The removal of stuff that was left

      10   in the building.

      11        Q    So it really wasn't so much

      12   demolition, as it was what I'll call like

      13   cleanout --

      14        A    Yes.

      15        Q    -- of the remnants of what you had

      16   left there?

      17        A    Yes.

      18        Q    Okay.  So it had nothing to do with

      19   them like knocking down a particular portion

      20   of the building?

      21        A    No.

      22                  MR. BLUM:  Let's take a break

       3   BY MR. BLUM:

       4        Q    Mr. Smith, I'm going to show you a

       5   document which was marked as Farr Exhibit

       6   No. 10 in a prior deposition.  I'm just going

       7   to ask you if you can tell me, if you can

       8   identify what that document is?

       9        A    It's a payroll report.

      10        Q    And is it a payroll report from the

      11   books and records of S-Bond Technologies?

      12        A    Yes, it is.

      13        Q    And is it a specific report for

      14   something that you ran?

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    Okay.  Tell us why you ran that

      17   specific report?

      18        A    It was -- because we had opted to do

      19   our cleaning ourselves, so we submitted our

      20   personal expenses and our labor for getting,

      21   for the recovery.

      22        Q    And does Farr Exhibit 10 document

      23   the amount of labor that your company expended

      24   doing that cleaning?


                                                        57




       1        A    Not in its entirety, but for this

       2   pay period, yes.

       3        Q    Okay.  And can you look at the other

       4   pages behind, it's a multipage document there.

       5        A    Yes.

       6        Q    And are those also further reports

       7   documenting time that was spent cleaning

       8   equipment?

       9        A    For different pay periods, yeah.  We

      10   pay twice a month.

      11        Q    And can you tell me from what,

      12   what's the total time period this covered in

      13   that exhibit for --

      14        A    For all pages?

      15        Q    For all pages, yes.

      16        A    So June 16, 2016, until November

      17   30th.

      18        Q    Again, November 30th of 2016?

      19        A    Yes.

      20        Q    And is it accurate that by November

      21   30th of 2016 all of the cleaning had been

      22   completed by your employees?

      23        A    As I recall, yes.

      24        Q    Okay.  And did you submit to the


                                                        58




       1   insurance company a request for payment for

       2   those hours that people spent cleaning?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    And were you paid for those hours?

       5        A    I believe so.  I don't know if in

       6   its entirety, but generally, yes.

       7        Q    All right.  I'm going to show you a

       8   document which was previously marked as Farr

       9   Exhibit No. 8.  And I'm going to ask you if

      10   you have ever seen this document in its

      11   entirety before?

      12        A    Yes.

      13        Q    Okay.  And have you read the cover

      14   letter that comes from Johns Eastern that's on

      15   the front of that document?

      16        A    I believe I have.

      17        Q    And does it accurately summarize all

      18   of the payments that were made to your company

      19   as a result of the fire?

      20        A    Yes, I believe so.

      21        Q    Okay.  If you look at the last page,

      22   there is what's called a Sworn Statement in

      23   Proof of Loss.  Do you see that?

      24        A    Yes.


                                                        59




       1        Q    Does your signature appear at the

       2   bottom there?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    And what was your understanding of

       5   what that Sworn Statement in Proof of Loss

       6   was?

       7        A    If I recall at the time, it was like

       8   a closing of our claim period for the fire

       9   loss.

      10        Q    Okay.  And it was closing the claim

      11   period, in other words, in terms of it was

      12   documenting everything that had been paid to

      13   you as a result of the loss?

      14        A    Yes, I believe so.

      15        Q    All right.  And what is the date of

      16   that letter on the front?

      17        A    May 31, 2017.

      18        Q    Okay.  And is it accurate that then

      19   by May 31st of 2017 like all of the claims had

      20   been submitted by you and paid for?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    Okay.  Do you recall how was it that

      23   you made the claim for extra expense and loss

      24   of profit to the insurance company?


                                                        60




       1        A    I compared it to our previous period

       2   the year prior and also in the quarters prior

       3   to the fire.

       4        Q    Okay.  And when you say "it," tell

       5   me what it was that you compared?

       6        A    The, I guess the net income of the

       7   business.

       8        Q    Okay.  And I'm going to show you a

       9   document, I received this from the insurance

      10   company, I don't know that you have ever seen

      11   this before.

      12                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to mark

      13        this as Exhibit Smith 2.

      19   BY MR. BLUM:

      20        Q    Mr. Smith, I'm showing you a

      21   document which we marked as Exhibit No. 2 to

      22   your deposition.  My first question is, have

      23   you ever seen this before?

      24        A    I don't recall, but I believe so.


                                                        61




       1        Q    Okay.  So when you submitted your

       2   claim for the extra expense, do you recall who

       3   it was you spoke to or how you submitted it?

       4        A    I submitted it to this forensic

       5   accounting firm.

       6        Q    Okay.  And who was it you were

       7   dealing with this?

       8        A    I forget the gentleman's name.

       9        Q    All right.  But did you deal with a

      10   particular person throughout the handling of

      11   that claim?

      12        A    Yes.

      13        Q    Okay.  And when you submitted the

      14   information, did they at times request

      15   additional information from you, the insurance

      16   company?

      17        A    I believe so.

      18        Q    Okay.  So this appears to be a claim

      19   for extra or loss of income for the period

      20   from I think July 2016; is that correct?

      21        A    It appears that way, yes.

      22        Q    Okay.  And it also is covering extra

      23   expenses at the bottom.  Do you see that?

      24        A    Yes, I do.

       1        Q    And there's a company there called

       2   Power ER.  Do you recognize who that is?

       3        A    Yes.  They were the people who

       4   cleaned up the electronic equipment and also

       5   reinstalled our networking systems in the

       6   company.

       7        Q    And were they the subcontractor?

       8        A    Subcontractor to EDS.

       9        Q    All right.  And then it's Bergey's

      10   Electrical, electrical install, is that the

      11   install at your new facility?

      12        A    Yes.

      13        Q    Okay.  And the July excess rent, is

      14   that the amount that you were claiming above

      15   your original rent expense?

      16        A    Yes.

      17        Q    If you look at the next page -- I'm

      18   sorry, it appears to just be a copy of the

      19   same thing.

      20             What was your typical business

      21   income in a month in the 2016 period?

      22        A    I don't recall.

      23        Q    Okay.  There is a number listed

      24   here, it says "Business income through July


                                                        63




       1   $29,206."  Do you see that?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    Does that sound about accurate of

       4   what your business income would have been?

       5        A    For the month of July?

       6        Q    Yes.

       7        A    I'm just trying to see --

       8        Q    Right.

       9        A    The answer would be close, yes.

      10        Q    Okay, all right.

      11                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to show

      12        you another document which we will mark

      13        as Exhibit 3.

      14                       - - -

      15                  (Business Income & Extra

      16        Expense Summary, Bates number CIC000660,

      17        marked Smith Exhibit 3.)

      19   BY MR. BLUM:

      20        Q    Again, this is another document that

      21   came from Insight Forensic Accountants.  My

      22   first question is, have you ever seen this

      23   before?

      24        A    I believe so.


                                                        64




       1        Q    And now on this document it shows

       2   advance payments that were made to you,

       3   advances number 1 through 4.  Do you see that?

       4        A    Yes, I do.

       5        Q    And do you recall having received

       6   those payments?

       7        A    Yes, I do recall.

       8        Q    And it says "Business income" at the

       9   top, "Business income through September

      10   $51,000."  Do you know, is that documenting

      11   the amount of business income that you were

      12   claiming?

      13        A    I guess from June through September,

      14   I would believe so.

      15        Q    Okay.  And it lists here, it

      16   schedule Schedule 2.  Have you ever seen that

      17   Schedule 2?  It's not attached, I have not

      18   found it.

      19        A    I don't recall.

      20                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to show

      21        you a document we'll mark as Exhibit 4.

       3   BY MR. BLUM:

       4        Q    I'll ask you if you have ever seen

       5   this document before?  Again it's from Insight

       6   Accountants.

       7        A    I would believe I have.

       8        Q    This appears to be a Schedule 2,

       9   although it doesn't match in dating to the one

      10   before it.  If you look at this one, it has a

      11   row for sales shortfall.  Do you see that?

      12        A    Yes.

      13        Q    And do you know, did you have a

      14   sales shortfall in June of 2016 of

      15   approximately $32,000?

      16        A    I believe that was the number, yes.

      17        Q    And did you have a sales shortfall

      18   in July of 2016 of $16,000?

      19        A    Yes, I believe so.

      20        Q    And when, if ever, do you know, did

      21   your sales go back to their normal amount?

      22        A    I would say about October things had

      23   been settled in.

      24        Q    There is in a box below that, that


                                                        66




       1   it says, "Saved Expenses."  Do you see that?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    Were those numbers that you provided

       4   or was that something that was provided by

       5   Insight Forensic?

       6        A    I don't recall.

       7        Q    Okay.

       8                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to show

       9        you a document which we're marking as

      10        Exhibit No. 5.

      11                       - - -

      16   BY MR. BLUM:

      17        Q    Mr. Smith, do you recognize Exhibit

      18   No. 5?

      19        A    Generally, yes.

      20        Q    Okay.  And, again, is this, it's an

      21   Insight Forensic document and it now appears

      22   to document the sales shortfall through August

      23   of 2016?

      24        A    Correct.


                                                        67




       1        Q    It appears that there's a column for

       2   $19,000 of lost sales in August of 2016; is

       3   that correct?

       4        A    Yes.

       5        Q    All right.  And would that be based

       6   upon information that you, again, had provided

       7   to Insight Forensics?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    So tell me why did your company, why

      10   would you have lost sales in August?

      11        A    We were still cleaning up.

      12   Everything wasn't installed yet.  Labor was

      13   being diverted for cleaning things.

      14        Q    Okay.  When would you say was the

      15   date that all of your equipment was

      16   operational in the new facility?

      17        A    Some time between October and

      18   November.

      19        Q    And that would have been of 2016?

      20        A    2016, yes.

      21        Q    And do you recall when it was that

      22   was the last time that you were reimbursed

      23   anything from the insurance company for a

      24   business income loss, like when was the last


                                                        68




       1   month?

       2        A    I don't recall at the moment.

       3        Q    Okay.

       4                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to mark,

       5        if we could, another document as Exhibit

       6        No. 6.

       7                  (Email chain with attachments,

       8        Bates numbers CIC000134 through 144,

      10                       - - -

      11   BY MR. BLUM:

      12        Q    This is a document that was produced

      13   by the insurance company and it all came

      14   through in this format together.  My question

      15   to you is actually going to be about the last

      16   three pages of this document.

      17        A    Okay.

      18        Q    So there's a Schedule 2 here.  It

      19   appears to me there's a typo on this where

      20   it's June, July, August, and it should be

      21   September and it says August again?

      22        A    Probably is.

      23        Q    And here it appears that there were

      24   sales shortfalls of $17,987 in September of


                                                        69




       1   2016?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    Okay.  And would that, again, have

       4   been because of the company was not fully

       5   operational at that point?

       6        A    Yes.

       7        Q    All right.  If you can take a look

       8   at the next page, which is a Schedule 3, this

       9   says Historical Sales Data.  Did you

      10   personally put this schedule together?

      11        A    This schedule may have been prepared

      12   by the accountant, I just don't recall,

      13   obviously off of data we gave him.

      14        Q    So here it shows that for the 12

      15   months ended 12/31/14, it appears that your

      16   total year annual sales are $906,000,

      17   approximately?

      18        A    Correct.

      19        Q    Does that sound accurate to you?

      20        A    Fairly accurate, yes.

      21        Q    Okay.  And for the 12-month period

      22   ending on 12/3/15 it looks like your 12-month

      23   sales would have been $862,000.  Does that

      24   sound accurate?


                                                        70




       1        A    Yes, approximately.

       2        Q    Okay.  And for the five months ended

       3   on 5/31/16 it was $342,000 and change.  Does

       4   that sound correct?

       5        A    Yes, I would say, yes.

       6        Q    Were the sales of the business going

       7   down slowly from 12/31/14 through the first

       8   half of 2016?

       9        A    Based on this data, yes.

      10        Q    Okay.  Do you have any reason to

      11   dispute that data?

      12        A    No.

      13        Q    And it appears that the average that

      14   they used over that period was about $70,890

      15   in sales per month?

      16        A    Correct.

      17                  MR. BLUM:  Let's go off the

      18        record for one minute.

      22   BY MR. BLUM:

      23        Q    I just have some followup questions

      24   real quick.  After the fire occurred, were you


                                                        71




       1   interviewed in any way by the fire marshal at

       2   the fire scene about, you know, what occurred?

       3        A    No.

       4        Q    Was there anyone from the

       5   Pennsylvania State Police who interviewed you?

       6        A    No.

       7        Q    Anybody from any of the insurance

       8   companies ever take what I'll call a sworn

       9   statement from you, like a written statement?

      10        A    No.

      11        Q    Okay.  Anyone ever take a recorded

      12   statement from you?

      13        A    No.

      14        Q    And did anyone ever ask you to

      15   provide any information from your alarm

      16   company about, other than me, about the alarm

      17   and when it went off?

      18        A    No.

      19        Q    The alarm system that was in your

      20   unit, was S-Bond the people who put that alarm

      21   system in?

      22        A    No.

      23        Q    I don't mean -- was S-Bond the

      24   people who --


                                                        72




       1        A    We contracted for it.

       2        Q    Versus it wasn't the landlord who

       3   put it in, it was you?

       4        A    Correct, yes.

       5        Q    Was there ever any discussion about

       6   putting sprinkler systems in your unit at all?

       7        A    No.

       8        Q    And I apologize, I might have asked

       9   you this, do you recall when it was that you

      10   had that alarm put in?

      11        A    No.  I mean, I would guess three,

      12   four years prior.

      13        Q    Okay.  And after the fire occurred,

      14   did you have any discussions with anyone about

      15   what caused the fire?

      16        A    Discussions, no.

      17        Q    Okay.  Did anyone ever tell you what

      18   caused the fire?

      19        A    I overheard discussions.

      20        Q    Okay.  Tell me what you overheard?

      21        A    That the source of the fire, because

      22   the fire marshal, everyone is kind of around,

      23   had indicated that it had come, that the

      24   source of the fire was in a vehicle parked in


                                                        73




       1   the unit adjacent to mine.

       2        Q    All right.  And was that actually on

       3   like the day after the fire occurred?

       4        A    The day that we were in there, yes,

       5   right after the fire.

       6        Q    Okay.  So it's like the night into

       7   that next day?

       8        A    Correct.

       9        Q    Is when you heard that from the fire

      10   marshal?

      11        A     Not discussions with me, but in a

      12   general discussion.

      13        Q    Okay.  And has anyone ever told you

      14   anything else about what caused the fire?

      15        A    No.

      16        Q    Has your company at some point moved

      17   back to the Clemens facility there?

      18        A    No.

      19        Q    Do you have any relationship with

      20   anything, with Clemens there at this point?

      21        A    No.

      22        Q    Have you had any discussions with

      23   any other investigators who are investigating

      24   the cause or the origin of the fire?


                                                        74




       1        A    No.

       2                  MR. BLUM:  I have no further

       3        questions.  But I really would like you

       4        to search for that alarm information for

       5        me, if you could.

       6                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I will.  I

       7        know the guy who installed it, but he

       8        owns a separate company.

       9                  MR. BLUM:  Right, okay.

      10                  THE WITNESS:  It's the people

      11        that do the monitoring, that's who you

      12        want; right?

      13                  MR. BLUM:  I would like to know

      14        from them if they have information about

      15        when they received, when they first

      16        received the signal from the building.

      17                  THE WITNESS:  Okay, sure.

      18                  MR. BLUM:  Great.  I have no

      19        further questions.

      20                  THE WITNESS:  How long would

      21        they normally have records for?

      22                  MR. BLUM:  I have no idea.  I

      23        mean, they could easily tell us --

      24                  THE WITNESS:  They could say I


                                                        75




       1        don't have that record, but I'll give you

       2        the name of the company.

       3                  MR. BLUM:  Sure.

       4                  MR. GOGINENI:  So just quickly,

       5        at the conclusion of the deposition, the

       6        court reporter is going to create a

       7        transcript.  What I will do or Gus will

       8        do is send you a copy of that transcript

       9        so that you can review it.  You'll also

      10        get something called an errata sheet.  So

      11        if the court reporter transcribed

      12        anything incorrectly, like say it was

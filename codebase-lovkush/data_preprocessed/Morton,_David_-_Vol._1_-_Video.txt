 1       Q. Okay.  And did you touch it with your bare
 2   hands?

 4       Q. And did handling this piece of insulation
 5   create airborne dust?
 6          MR. COSTA:  Objection to form.
 7          MR. BECERRA:  What's the basis of the
 8   objection?
 9          MR. COSTA:  Form.
10          MR. BECERRA:  What exactly?  I need an
11   opportunity to correct the question.  This is a
12   trial preservation deposition.
13          MR. COSTA:  I understand that at this
14   time, unless I've missed something, that all
15   objections, except as to form, are reserved until
16   the time of trial.
17          MR. BECERRA:  I did not agree to that.
18          MR. COSTA:  Leading.
19          MR. BECERRA:  Leading.

24       Q. When you had to remove this piece of
0014
 1   insulation from the boiler, what did you see?
 2       A. What did I see?
 3       Q. Yeah.  Was anything created from handling
 4   this piece of insulation?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. And what was that?
 7       A. Dust.
 8       Q. And where was that dust coming from?
 9       A. Insulation.
10       Q. Did you breathe the dust that was coming
11   from the insulation when you had to handle it?
12       A. Yes.
13       Q. How close was the piece of insulation to
14   your face when you were handling it?
15       A. Obviously, arm's length, meaning anywhere
16   from a foot to a foot and a half, approximate.
17       Q. Did you ever wear any respiratory
18   protection when you were doing maintenance on this
19   Weil-McLain boiler?
20       A. No.
21       Q. Once you had removed the top plate, the

0015
 1       A. With a cleaning brush, to clean the
 2   baffles.
 3       Q. Did the process of cleaning the baffles
 4   create any dust?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. Okay.  Did you breathe that dust?
 7       A. Yes.
 8       Q. And the dust that was created when you
 9   were cleaning the baffles, where was that dust
10   coming from?
11       A. From the baffles.
12       Q. After you had cleaned the baffles, what
13   did you do next?
14       A. You vacuumed out as much of the debris
15   that I could.
16       Q. And what did you use to vacuum out that
17   debris?
18       A. Vacuum.
19       Q. Once you were done vacuuming the interior
20   of the boiler, what did you do next?
21       A. Then put the baffle plate on, the

23       Q. And how did you put the insulation back in
24   its place?

16       A. Yes.
17       Q. Some of the lawyers may object to my
18   questions this morning, Mr. Morton, which means
19   that, unfortunately, I may be required to ask you
20   these questions in a different way because of the
21   objection.  Just so you're not confused.  Okay?
22       A. Yeah.
23       Q. When you scraped out the gaskets that were
24   between the pipes and the boilers, what did you
0020
 1   see?

10       A. Yes.
11       Q. Just now you told us that as part of this
12   removal process, you had to also remove the burner
13   and the housing.  Do you recall that testimony?
14       A. Yes.
15       Q. The housing that you referenced, what was
16   that -- the purpose of that housing?
17       A. To hold the burner in place.
18       Q. And after you detached the burner and the
19   housing, was there any type of material between
20   those parts and the boiler?
21       A. Yes.
22       Q. And what was that?
23       A. That was gasket.
24       Q. And when you detached the burner and the
0021
 1   housing from the boiler, Mr. Morton, did that
 2   release any airborne dust?
 3       A. Yes.
 4       Q. And where was that dust coming from?
 5          MR. COSTA:  Objection.  Leading.

17       Q. And why is it that after your father
18   passed, you continued doing that type of work for
19   a couple more years?
20       A. Because we had customers that wanted me to
21   continue.  So I sort of helped them out for, yeah,
22   another two years and wound down Groton
23   Refrigeration.
24       Q. And during that time when you worked in

23   nut back on and tightened it up.
24       Q. Can you walk us through a little more
0040
 1   specifically how you put in the new packing
 2   material.
 3       A. Either they were precut gaskets or
 4   sometimes I had to cut my own.
 5       Q. Okay.  And during those times when you had
 6   to cut your own packing material, why did you have
 7   to cut it?
 8       A. Because I didn't have the proper size of
 9   the gasket to replace on the valve.
10       Q. How did you know what type of packing
11   material to use on these valves?
12       A. Because it was a rope-type substance that
13   was made for packing.
14       Q. Did cutting the packing material create
15   dust?

 6       Q. I want to focus now on some of the
 7   circulating pumps that you told us a few minutes
 8   ago that you worked on in the commercial
 9   refrigeration business with your father.
10          Do you recall the brand name of any of
11   those circulating pumps?
12       A. Crane and Bell & Gossett.
13       Q. And what was the substance that was
14   flowing through these circulating pumps?

 3   specifically how you replaced those gaskets.
 4       A. You basically removed -- there were some
 5   with two nuts and bolts.  There were some with
 6   four.  And you loosened them up, exposing the
 7   gasket.  If need be, you scraped the gasket and
 8   cleaned the flanges.
 9       Q. And what tools did you use to scrape out
10   the gaskets?
11       A. Either a chisel or a sharp instrument.

 8   bolts, and tightened it up.
 9       Q. And the new gaskets that you put in, were
10   these precut gaskets, or did you have to make
11   them?
12       A. Both.
13       Q. With respect to the precut gaskets that
14   you installed on these Bell & Gossett circulating
15   pumps, did that require you to handle the gaskets
16   with your hands?
17       A. Yes.
18       Q. With respect to the gaskets that you had
19   to make for these Bell & Gossett circulating
20   pumps, can you walk us through how you did that
21   process.
22       A. Through a sheet of gasket material.  And
23   you place the old gasket on top of the sheet and
24   use it as a template, and you cut it out as close
0044
 1   as you could.
 2       Q. When you had to cut out the gasket, did

17       Q. And can you walk us through that process?
18       A. Replacing the pump, you mean?
19       Q. Let me reask the question.  Can you please
20   walk us through the process of just removing a
21   Bell & Gossett circulating pump.
22       A. Yes.  Loosening up, as I say, the inlet
23   and outlet flanges, removing the pump,
24   disconnecting it from the electrical source, and
0045
 1   cleaning your flanges.
 2       Q. Why did you have to clean the flanges?
 3       A. Because of the old gasket.
 4       Q. And how did you clean the flanges?
 5       A. With a chisel, sharp object.
 6       Q. And when you had to clean out those
 7   flanges, did that create dust?
 8       A. Yes.

24   everything up, and replace the electrical supply.
0046
 1       Q. And did the new Bell & Gossett circulating
 2   pumps come with any gaskets?
 3       A. Some did, some did not.
 4       Q. And did the installation process of these
 5   pumps require you to handle these gaskets with
 6   your hands?
 7       A. Yes.
 8       Q. And during the installation process -- I'm
 9   sorry.  Strike that.
10          Are you able to estimate, Mr. Morton, how

24   the jury can get an idea of the size of these
0054
 1   printing press machines, are you able to estimate
 2   or approximate the dimensions of these two
 3   machines?
 4       A. They varied depending on how many colors,
 5   how many units that were involved in the printing
 6   machine.
 7       Q. Okay.  Can you compare it to, like, a
 8   standard size vehicle, for example?  Is it bigger
 9   than that or smaller than a standard size vehicle?
10       A. Anywhere from standard size vehicle to
11   trailer truck.

19   any of the printing press machines at Hale-Moore?
20       A. Yes.
21       Q. And how were you involved in the operation
22   of these machines?
23       A. For some reason, if the pressman wasn't in
24   or had to do something, I would fill in.
0055
 1       Q. And typically, how did the press -- a
 2   pressman work with the machines?
 3       A. Basically, he set it up, whether cleaning
 4   the blankets, putting on new plates.
 5       Q. And did a pressman spend most of his time
 6   in close vicinity to the printing press machines?
 7       A. Yeah.
 8       Q. Did you ever perform any maintenance work
 9   on any of the printing press machines at
10   Hale-Moore?
11       A. Yes.
12       Q. And what type of maintenance work did you
13   perform?
14       A. It was dealing with the brake and clutch
15   assembly on either the delivery or the receiving
16   end.
17       Q. How many brake assemblies did each one of
18   these printing press machines have?
19       A. Two.

14   what happens to it?
15       A. Created dust and dirt.
16       Q. Where did that dust and dirt go?
17       A. We blew it out and lubricated it and
18   readjusted it.
19       Q. Why was it important to blow out the brake
20   assemblies on these printing press machines?
21       A. Because it would get to the point where it
22   was not operating properly and they had to be
23   cleaned and readjusted.
24       Q. Okay.  What was the purpose of the clutch
0057
 1   assemblies on these printing press machines?
 2       A. To keep the pile heights at a proper

11       A. Dust.
12       Q. And where did that dust accumulate when
13   it --
14       A. Within the housing.
15       Q. And did you do anything to clean the
16   accumulation of clutch dust on these machines?
17       A. You would have blown out the -- and
18   cleaned it and readjust it.

 4       Q. Okay.  Mr. Morton, I'm going to switch
 5   gears again.  At any point in your career,
 6   Mr. Morton, with respect to any of the products or
 7   equipment that we've discussed this morning, did
 8   you ever see any warnings on those products or
 9   that equipment telling you that the products or
10   equipment contained asbestos?
11          MS. ROSENBLEET:  Objection.  Overly broad.
12       Q. Let's take them one at a time, then.
13   Mr. Morton, let's start with the Weil-McLain
14   boiler that was in your home and that you
15   installed in the '60s.  Did you ever see any
16   warnings on that boiler?
17          MR. COSTA:  Objection.  Mischaracterizes
18   former testimony.
19       A. No.
20       Q. Let me rephrase the question.  With
21   respect to the first Weil-McLain boiler that was
22   installed at your home at 180 Gay Road, did you
23   ever see any warnings on that boiler telling you
24   that the boiler had asbestos?
0069
 1       A. No.
 2       Q. Did you ever see any warnings telling you
 3   that asbestos may cause cancer?
 4       A. No.
 5       Q. If I asked you the same questions about
 6   the second Weil-McLain boiler, would your answers
 7   be the same?
 8       A. Yes.
 9       Q. With respect to any of the motors that you
10   worked on between 1950 and 1972, did you ever see
11   any warnings on those motors telling you that the
12   motors contained asbestos?
13       A. No.
14       Q. Did you ever see any warnings on the
15   motors telling you that asbestos may cause cancer?
16       A. No.
17       Q. Let's take the pumps and the valves that
18   you worked on that you discussed earlier today
19   between 1950 and 1972.  Did you ever see any
20   warnings on any of the pumps or valves that you
21   worked on telling you that those products had
22   asbestos?
23       A. No.
24       Q. Did you ever see any warnings on any of
0070
 1   the pumps or valves telling you that asbestos may
 2   cause cancer?
 3       A. No.
 4       Q. Did you ever see any warnings on any of
 5   the printing press machines that you worked with
 6   or around during your career telling you that
 7   those machines had asbestos?
 8       A. No.
 9       Q. Did you ever see any warnings on the
10   printing press machines telling you that asbestos
11   may cause cancer?
12       A. No.
13       Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of
14   the jury, Mr. Morton, without guessing, if you
15   would had seen warnings telling you that any given
16   product contained asbestos and that asbestos could
17   cause cancer, would you have done something to
18   protect yourself?
19          MR. SIMONS:  Objection.  Speculation.
20       A. Yes.
21       Q. If you had seen warnings on any given
22   product or equipment telling you to use
23   respiratory equipment while working with that
24   product or equipment because it contained
0071
 1   asbestos, would have followed those warnings?
 2          MR. SIMONS:  Objection.  Speculation.
 3       A. Yes.
 4       Q. Okay.  Mr. Morton, we're getting close to
 5   finishing, so thank you for bearing with me.  I do
 6   want to switch gears again and ask you about some
 7   of the reasons why we -- all of us are,
 8   unfortunately, here today and why you're involved
 9   in this lawsuit.
10          When did you first realize, Mr. Morton,
11   that there may have been something wrong with you?
12       A. Basically, it was in the spring of '16,
13   2016.
14       Q. And what were you experiencing during that
15   time that made you think that there may have been
16   something wrong?
17       A. Shortness of breath and fatigue factor.
18       Q. What were you doing at that time that made
19   you realize you were suffering from shortness of
20   breath and fatigue?
21       A. Well, one of the things was skiing.
22       Q. And is skiing something that you've
23   enjoyed doing over the course of your life?
24       A. Yes.
0072
 1       Q. And how often -- before all of this began,
 2   how often did you typically go skiing?
 3       A. Anywhere from 30 to 45 times a year, a
 4   season.
 5       Q. Are you still able to do that?
 6       A. No.
 7       Q. And what did you do after you were skiing
 8   that time and you noticed that you were suffering
 9   from shortness of breath and fatigue?
10       A. I was working with my cardiologist to try
11   to determine what was wrong.
12       Q. What did your cardiologist tell you?
13       A. Well, he didn't tell me anything until we
14   did some testing.
15       Q. What type of testing did you guys do?
16       A. Came down to a chest x-ray and an echo.
17       Q. And who is the one that suggested that
18   you -- it may be beneficial to have an x-ray and a
19   heart echo?
20       A. Something that Dr. Cerel and myself, we
21   discussed it.
22       Q. And did you end up having an x-ray as a
23   result of those concerns you had at that time?
24       A. Yes.
0073
 1       Q. After the x-rays were taken, what did the
 2   doctors find?
 3       A. They found that I had fluid build-up in my
 4   lung -- chest cavity, in between my chest cavity
 5   and my lung, and it was collapsing my right lung.
 6       Q. Did the doctors do anything to remove the
 7   fluid you had between your chest cavity and your
 8   lung?
 9       A. Yes.  They drained it.
10       Q. Tell us a little bit more about that
11   procedure.
12       A. They take a needle and go in through the
13   back, get it into the chest cavity area, and then
14   vacuum out the liquid.
15       Q. And were you awake during this procedure?
16       A. You're awake during that procedure.
17       Q. How much fluid did they drain?
18       A. Better than a liter.
19       Q. And at this point in time, did the doctors
20   tell you anything about why you had this fluid
21   build-up?
22       A. At that time, they weren't sure.
23       Q. So what happened after they drained the
24   fluid from your chest cavity?  Did they send you
0074
 1   home?
 2       A. Went home.  They made an appointment to
 3   have a scan done.  And the next day I had a scan
 4   done.
 5       Q. What kind of scan was it?  Like, a CT
 6   scan?
 7       A. Yeah.
 8       Q. And what did the doctors tell you after
 9   you had your CT scan?
10       A. They called my cardiologist in.  They
11   discussed it.  They met with me and told me that I
12   did have cancer in my right lung, liver and
13   lymphnodes.  They did not, obviously, say what
14   kind of cancer or anything like that.
15       Q. And what were you feeling when you heard
16   that you had cancer at this point in time?
17       A. I guess I really can't even describe it.
18   Obviously, at that time I didn't know how serious
19   it was.  I guess my first concern was my family.
20       Q. And who were you with when the doctors
21   told you what the results of the --
22       A. Myself.
23       Q. You were by yourself?
24       A. Yup.

 1       Q. And after you left the hospital that day,
 2   who did you first speak to about what the doctors
 3   had found as a result of --
 4       A. My doctor called my daughter and my wife
 5   and informed them, because this was a Friday
 6   afternoon.  They knew that nothing would take
 7   place until Monday.
 8          So I basically spent the weekend at home
 9   and then went to an appointment, to Beth Israel,
10   on Monday.
11       Q. And what was the purpose of that
12   appointment on that following Monday?
13       A. Determined what they could do about the
14   collapsed right lung and what they could do about
15   that fluid building up.
16       Q. So had the fluid come back at this point?
17       A. Yes, it did.
18       Q. And what did the doctors determine at that
19   point as far as what the next steps were?
20       A. They gave me a choice of two different
21   procedures.  And they would not know until they
22   got in there which procedure they would do.
23          One was to insert a drain.  And the other
24   was to do what they called a talc procedure,
0076
 1   meaning they actually put in some type of glue to
 2   glue the lung back to the cavity wall, the chest
 3   wall.
 4       Q. And what's the purpose of a talc
 5   procedure?
 6       A. To get your lung back to full capacity.
 7       Q. And is it also to prevent additional fluid
 8   build-up?
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. And before -- and which procedure did
11   you --
12       A. They did the talc procedure.
13       Q. Okay.  Before they did the talc procedure,
14   did they have to drain the fluid that had been --
15       A. Yes.
16       Q. In the same fashion that they did the
17   first time around?
18       A. Yes.
19       Q. And when they performed the talc
20   procedure, were you awake or under anesthesia?
21       A. No.  You were under anesthesia.
22       Q. So you were completely knocked out?
23       A. You were out.
24       Q. And when you woke up from that procedure,
0077
 1   how did you feel?
 2       A. Obviously, they did a biopsy of my lung at
 3   the same time.  When I woke up, I still had a
 4   drain.  I wasn't in terrible pain because
 5   obviously they give you something for the pain.
 6   So it wasn't terrible, put it that way.
 7       Q. Okay.  How long did it take to receive the
 8   results of the biopsy?
 9       A. I'm going to say the next day.  I was
10   there for a week.
11       Q. And who was the person that delivered the
12   results of the biopsy?
13       A. Dr. Mijay.
14       Q. And do you remember who you were with when
15   Dr. Mijay came to speak to you about the biopsy
16   results?
17       A. I believe it was my daughter and wife.
18       Q. And what did Dr. Mijay tell you about the
19   results?
20       A. The talc procedure was fine.  The biopsy
21   was not fine.
22       Q. What do you mean by that?
23       A. They determined that it was definitely
24   stem cell cancer of my lung.
0078
 1       Q. What was the first question that you had
 2   after the doctors had confirmed what their initial
 3   concerns were about cancer?
 4       A. At that point in time -- well, there was
 5   still more tests to be done.
 6       Q. Okay.  What were those tests?
 7       A. Liver biopsy.
 8       Q. Any others?
 9       A. No.  That was the main one.
10       Q. And how soon after that did you have the
11   liver biopsy?
12       A. Like, the next day.
13       Q. And then how soon did you get the liver
14   biopsy results?
15       A. That was another day or so.
16       Q. Okay.  And what were the results of the
17   liver biopsy?
18       A. It was the same type of cancer as my lung.
19       Q. And what type of cancer is that?
20       A. It was stem cell cancer.
21       Q. And at that point in time, Mr. Morton --
22   what were you feeling or what were you thinking at
23   that point in time?
24       A. I guess, to stay as positive as possible
0079
 1   and just not let it get the best of me.
 2       Q. During this time, did the doctors tell you
 3   anything about a prognosis for expected life
 4   expectancy?
 5       A. At this time, it was discussed where is
 6   the best place to be, the best doctors to see.
 7   And they took care of those arrangements for me.
 8       Q. Okay.  Did you -- did the doctors tell you
 9   anything about whether the cancer was operable at
10   this time?
11       A. Not at this point.
12       Q. Okay.  When did that discussion take place
13   regarding whether the doctors could operate to try
14   to remove the cancer?
15       A. When I had the appointment at Dana-Farber.
16       Q. And what did the doctors tell you about
17   that?
18       A. My question was what kind of time frame.
19   He gave me anywhere from six months to a year.
20       Q. And what were you feeling when you heard
21   that?
22       A. I didn't like it.
23       Q. And your family, how did they react?
24       A. Well, all I can -- we're a very close
0080
 1   family.  And I have a lot of family support.  So
 2   they didn't like it either.
 3       Q. So at this point in time, Mr. Morton,
 4   after all of the tests and after the doctors had
 5   confirmed everything, did they put you on a
 6   treatment plan?
 7       A. Yes.
 8       Q. And what was that plan?
 9       A. Basically, they put me on a six-week
10   program of chemotherapy.  And that was once every
11   three weeks.
12       Q. And did you start that chemotherapy
13   treatment plan?
14       A. Yes.
15       Q. Sitting here today, are you done with
16   those six treatments?
17       A. I'm done with all six treatments.
18       Q. And after you were done with the six
19   treatments, did the doctors tell you anything
20   about whether the chemotherapy had worked or not?
21       A. It was not working.
22       Q. Were there any side effects from the
23   chemotherapy?
24       A. Yes.
0081
 1       Q. What were those?
 2       A. Unfortunately, chemotherapy really does a
 3   job on your white blood cells, your appetite, and
 4   it really knocks the hell out of you for a week or
 5   two.
 6       Q. And that's after each session?
 7       A. Yes.
 8       Q. So what did the doctors tell you,
 9   Mr. Morton, about what the next steps were after
10   the chemotherapy had failed?
11       A. I was lucky enough that they did have a
12   second choice, experimental drugs that had not
13   been approved.  But I got into what they said was
14   Stage 2 of this experimental study.  So I was
15   lucky enough to get involved in that.
16       Q. Is this like a clinical trial?
17       A. Yes.
18       Q. Have these drugs -- are these, like, drugs
19   that have been approved or --
20       A. No, they have not been approved.
21       Q. And are you still in that clinical trial?
22       A. Yes.
23       Q. And tell us a little bit about how these
24   drugs are administered.
0082
 1       A. Through IV.  Every four weeks I spend one
 2   day down in Boston.  And it's a day's process
 3   between scans, blood work, and getting the drug
 4   administrated.
 5       Q. And is there any guarantee that these
 6   experimental drugs are going to work?
 7       A. No.
 8       Q. And have you thought about -- if they
 9   don't work, have the doctors said anything about
10   what options may be next?
11       A. No, not at this point in time.
12       Q. You talked a little bit about how one of
13   your hobbies is skiing.  Before all of this began,
14   Mr. Morton, just generally, how was your health?
15       A. Actually, I thought it was good.
16       Q. Were you pretty active before all of this
17   began?
18       A. Yes.
19       Q. And has this cancer slowed you down a
20   little bit?
21       A. Yes.
22       Q. What's the main reason why it's slowed you
23   down?
24       A. Basically, shortness of the breath,
0083
 1   fatigue.  And I just can't do what I used to do.
 2       Q. And how does that make you feel,
 3   Mr. Morton?
 4       A. Terrible.
 5          MR. BECERRA:  Thank you, Mr. Morton.  I
 6   know those were difficult questions.  I appreciate
 7   that.  And those are all the questions that I have
 8   for you this morning.
 9          Let's go off the record.
10          THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:26 a.m.
11   We are going off the video record.
12          (Recess taken)
13          THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:36 a.m.
14   This begins Media Unit 2.  And we are back on the
15   record.
16          MR. HOOVER:  Thank you.
17               EXAMINATION
18   BY MR. HOOVER:
19       Q. Good morning, Mr. Morton.
20       A. Good morning.
21       Q. Mark Hoover.  You and I have had the
22   pleasure over the past several days to take your
23   discovery deposition.  And we're here to kind of
24   wrap up the trial portion of your testimony.
0084
 1   Okay?
 2       A. Okay.
 3       Q. And as I mentioned during the course of
 4   your discovery deposition, if there is any
 5   question that I ask or that any other lawyer here
 6   in the room or on the phone asks during the course
 7   of this testimony that you don't understand or it
 8   doesn't seem clear, let us know and we will
 9   rephrase the question for you.  Okay?
10       A. Yes.
11       Q. Okay.  Otherwise, we are going to assume
12   that you understood our question and answered it
13   truthfully.  Fair enough?
14       A. Fair enough.
15       Q. As mentioned, you were deposed over the
16   course of a couple of days, including yesterday
17   morning.  We wrapped up.
18          And while we go along through both my
19   questions and any others, we have clean copies of
20   your deposition transcripts from at least the
21   first two days, so if you need to refer to your
22   prior testimony, we can get that for you.  Fair
23   enough?
24       A. Yup.
0085
 1       Q. Okay.  When you first sat down with us for
 2   your deposition, you were put under oath.  And you
 3   understood the significance of the oath.  Correct?
 4       A. Correct.
 5       Q. And you testified truthfully to the
 6   questions that were posed to you by the various
 7   attorneys in this case.  Correct?
 8       A. Correct.
 9       Q. And as I understand it, sir, you don't
10   have any changes to your testimony from your
11   discovery deposition.  Is that correct?
12       A. That's correct.
13       Q. And you understood the questions as they
14   were posed to you during the course of your
15   deposition testimony.  Correct?
16       A. Yes.
17       Q. And if there was ever the occasion where
18   you didn't understand it, you let us know and we
19   rephrased it for you.  Correct?
20       A. Correct.
21       Q. And we gave you that opportunity to ask us
22   if you didn't understand it.  Correct?
23       A. Yes.
24       Q. I wanted to kind of fill in a little bit
0086
 1   about your background, sir.  I understand, as you
 2   mentioned, you grew up on kind of a small farm in
 3   Groton, Massachusetts.  Correct?
 4       A. Correct.
 5       Q. And while you were growing up on that
 6   small farm, there were some home renovations work
 7   that were done to the family home.  Correct?
 8       A. Correct.
 9       Q. And some of that work involved the use of
10   drywall and sheetrock.  Correct?
11       A. That's correct.
12       Q. And I think you told us during your
13   discovery deposition that some of that work would
14   involve when you had to repair some of the damaged
15   walls that might happen in the house.  Right?
16       A. Correct.
17       Q. All right.  Sometimes kids might be kind
18   of messing around --
19       A. Yup.
20       Q. -- and damage happens to the house.
21   Right?
22       A. Yes.
23       Q. And so in order to -- and you helped
24   repair the walls?  You and your siblings would do
0087
 1   that sometimes.  Correct?
 2       A. Yes.
 3       Q. And to do that, as I understood it, you
 4   talked about having to cut out the damaged portion
 5   of the wall for whatever reason.  Right?
 6       A. Correct.
 7       Q. And that particular portion of the
 8   farmhouse -- and this was a fairly old home.
 9   Correct?
10       A. Correct.
11       Q. And so some of the wall that you were
12   removing to fix you kind of described as that kind
13   of old horsehair type of plastering-type material.
14   Correct?
15       A. Correct.
16       Q. And when you were cutting out and removing
17   the portion of the wall that had been damaged,
18   that cutting process, that would create dust while
19   you were cutting.  Correct?
20       A. Correct.
21          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to the form.
22       Q. Would that cutting of the damaged portion
23   of the wall that you were removing, would that
24   have created dust?
0088
 1       A. Yes.
 2       Q. And would you have breathed in that
 3   particular dust while you were cutting out that
 4   wall?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. And when you were cutting out the old
 7   portion of the old wall, would you wear any sort
 8   of breathing protection or anything like that?
 9       A. No.
10       Q. And then what you would need to do is,
11   once you would cut out the old portion of the
12   walls, you had to obviously replace it with a new
13   piece of sheetrock.  Correct?
14       A. Correct.
15       Q. And in order to do that, you would have to
16   cut the sheetrock, the new sheetrock, to the size
17   of the damage that you were replacing.  Correct?
18       A. Correct.
19       Q. And to do that, as I understood and
20   remembered your testimony, you would take a sharp
21   knife, and you would have to cut the appropriate
22   size.  Correct?
23       A. Correct.
24       Q. And you would cut one end and then you'd
0089
 1   snap it?
 2       A. Yes.
 3       Q. All right.  And that cutting and the
 4   snapping of the replacement sheetrock, that was a
 5   dusty process.  Correct?
 6          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
 7       A. Correct.
 8       Q. And in order to -- Strike that.
 9          And when that dust was created by the
10   cutting of the replacement sheetrock, was that
11   dust that you breathed in, sir?
12          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
13       Q. Did you breathe in that dust, sir?
14       A. Yes.
15       Q. And when you were doing this particular
16   cutting of the new sheetrock, you didn't wear any
17   sort of mask or any sort of breathing protection.
18   Correct?
19       A. Correct.
20       Q. And you had also mentioned that at the
21   farmhouse that you worked on with your folks, that
22   you had to remove some of the old tiles that were
23   in the house.  Correct?
24       A. Correct.
0090
 1       Q. And I think I remember you saying there
 2   were some tiles in the bathroom and the tiles in
 3   the kitchen?
 4       A. Correct.
 5       Q. And these were old tiles that had been in
 6   the farmhouse for quite some time?
 7       A. Yes.
 8       Q. Before -- they were there before you were
 9   even born?
10          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.  Lack of
11   foundation.
12          You're asking him to speculate.
13       A. I don't know.
14       Q. Okay.  Fair enough.  But regardless, they
15   were old at the time that you were removing them.
16   Correct?
17       A. Yes.
18       Q. And in order to remove the old tiles, you
19   would have to -- I think you talked about using
20   some type of a chisel to get underneath to break
21   them off.  Right?
22       A. Yes.
23       Q. And during the course of removing those
24   old tiles, sometimes they would break?
0091
 1       A. Correct.
 2       Q. And when the tiles would break that you
 3   were removing, the old ones, that would sometimes
 4   also create dust.  Correct?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. And that dust, again, would become
 7   airborne.  And you would breathe in that dust.
 8   Correct?
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. And when you were doing that work of
11   removing the old tiles when they would break and
12   create this dust, you were not wearing any sort of
13   mask or any sort of breathing protection.
14   Correct?
15       A. Correct.
16       Q. And then, as I understand it, back at the
17   time that you were doing this -- and this was when
18   you were a youngster.  Right?
19       A. Yes.
20       Q. And at that point in time, to get rid of
21   the old tiles back then, you could take them to
22   the dump and just throw them away.  Correct?
23       A. Correct.
24       Q. And remember I was asking you about that?
0092
 1   And you mentioned that if you had tried to do that
 2   today, to take those old tiles, a dump today would
 3   not accept those kind of old tiles.  Correct?
 4       A. Correct.
 5       Q. You'd have to take them someplace special
 6   to get rid of them.  Right?
 7          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
 8       A. Right.
 9       Q. That's what you told me.  Right?
10          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
11       A. Right.
12       Q. And then underneath the old tiles that you
13   removed was also this old, dried-up cement that
14   had been used to seal the old tiles to the old
15   floor.  Right?
16       A. Yes.
17       Q. And in order to put down new tile, you had
18   to obviously get rid of the old cement, as it
19   were.  Correct?
20       A. You had to smooth it out the best you
21   could.
22       Q. Right.  And I think you talked about that.
23   That would be done by hand.  Correct?
24       A. Correct.
0093
 1       Q. And you'd use some sort of sandpaper to
 2   kind of smooth it all down?
 3       A. Yup.
 4       Q. And again, when you were doing this hand
 5   sanding, I'm assuming you'd be down on your hands
 6   and knees?
 7       A. Yeah.
 8       Q. And you'd have to be sanding it.  And when
 9   you were doing that to the old cement, that was
10   also a dusty process.  Correct?
11          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
12       A. Correct.
13       Q. And did that process create dust that went
14   up into the air?
15       A. Yes.
16       Q. And did you breathe in that dust?
17       A. Yes.
18       Q. And as with the tiles that you were
19   removing, were you wearing any sort of breathing
20   protection or any sort of mask when you did this
21   work?
22       A. No.
23       Q. And you did it in the kitchen and you also
24   did it in the bathroom.  Right?  A smaller area.
0094
 1   Correct?
 2       A. Correct.
 3       Q. You talked about the new home -- and by
 4   "new," I mean, right after you got married in '61,
 5   you moved into a new home that was being
 6   constructed, where you've lived since that time.
 7   Correct?
 8       A. Correct.
 9       Q. And my understanding was that it was
10   initially a Cape house.  And you did the drywall
11   work and sheetrock work on the second floor.
12   Correct?
13       A. Correct.
14       Q. Well, let me back up a little bit because
15   I want to go back to -- before I get to the new
16   home, just finish up with the old farmhouse, when
17   you were doing the sheetrock.  We talked about the
18   cutting of the sheetrock.
19          But after that piece of sheetrock was put
20   back into the wall, back at the old farm, did you
21   then have to put some sort of joint compound on
22   the seals of the piece that you were putting in
23   there?
24       A. Yes.
0095
 1       Q. And part of that joint compound would then
 2   have to dry.  Right?
 3       A. Correct.
 4       Q. And back in the time when you were
 5   applying the joint compound, was it the kind that
 6   came premixed, or would you have to mix it?
 7       A. You had to -- at that point in time, you
 8   had to mix it.
 9       Q. So it came in a dry powder form?
10       A. Dry powder.
11       Q. And you would add water to it?
12       A. Add water.
13       Q. And then you would mix it?
14       A. Yeah.
15       Q. And then to get it to the appropriate
16   consistency.  Correct?
17       A. Right.
18       Q. And the mixing would be done by hand, or
19   would you have a special tool to mix it?
20       A. No.  Just a bucket and a -- yeah -- a
21   stick or whatever.
22       Q. All right.
23       A. No special tool.
24       Q. And when you would pour the dry mix into
0096
 1   the bucket -- because that's how you would start.
 2   Correct?
 3       A. Yes.
 4       Q. And doing so would release the dust of the
 5   dry mix as it went into the bucket.  Correct?
 6       A. Yes.
 7       Q. And would you breathe in that dust as you
 8   were pouring the dry mix into the bucket?
 9          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
10       A. Yes.
11       Q. And again, while you're doing that,
12   pouring the dry mix in, you're not wearing any
13   mask or any sort of breathing protection?
14       A. No.
15       Q. And when you would add water to the mix --
16   you would add a little bit of water, stir it, add
17   a little bit more water?
18       A. Yes.
19       Q. And when you would do the water initially,
20   would that release more dust as the water hits the
21   dry powder?
22       A. Yes.
23       Q. And that -- again, that dust is released.
24   And that's dust that you would breathe in while
0097
 1   you're preparing the mix?
 2       A. Yes.
 3          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 4       Q. So now the mix is ready to the consistency
 5   that you want for the wall.  And at that juncture,
 6   you apply the joint compound to the seams to kind
 7   of hold the piece in place.  Right?
 8       A. Correct.
 9       Q. And then you have to let that joint
10   compound dry?
11       A. Yup.
12       Q. And at that juncture, you want to sand
13   down the or smooth out the joint compound to make
14   it flush with the wall.  Correct?
15       A. Correct.
16          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
17       Q. And would that, sir, be a dusty process if
18   you had to sand down the joint compound?
19       A. Yes.
20       Q. Is that something, sir, that when you were
21   doing that, you would breathe in that dust?
22       A. Yes.
23       Q. Now, kind of taking that same type of
24   process, that same type of work over to the new
0098
 1   home, as I understand it, the second floor had
 2   been framed out for you.  Right?
 3       A. Yes.
 4       Q. You come up the Cape.  You got the bedroom
 5   on the right and the bedroom to the left?
 6       A. Right.
 7       Q. At that juncture, you've done enough
 8   sheetrock work that you felt that you could
 9   sheetrock the upstairs and do the two bedrooms.
10   Correct?
11       A. Correct.
12       Q. And I thought I remember from Day 1, was
13   there a bathroom in the back?
14       A. Yes.
15       Q. So you'd come to a set of stairs.
16   Straight ahead is the bathroom.  Right?
17       A. Yes.
18       Q. So those three rooms had been framed out
19   but needed to be drywalled?
20       A. Right.
21       Q. And that was work that you did.  Correct?
22       A. Yes.
23       Q. And again, we talked about the sheetrock
24   work at the farmhouse.  You'd have to cut the
0099
 1   pieces of sheetrock to the appropriate size.
 2   Correct?
 3       A. Correct.
 4       Q. And again, that process of cutting them,
 5   you'd measure twice, cut once.  But you would cut
 6   them to make sure it fit to the area that you
 7   needed.  And that cutting process created dust.
 8   Correct?
 9       A. Correct.
10       Q. And again, that kind of dust is arm's
11   length away as you're cutting.  Right?
12       A. Yup.
13       Q. And you're breathing in that dust while
14   you're doing the work?
15       A. Yes.
16       Q. And did you also have to use joint
17   compound back in 1961, '64 time frame?
18       A. Yes.
19       Q. And was it still the pre -- was it still
20   the dry mix at this time?
21       A. No.  Now it's premixed.
22       Q. It had gone to premix.  Okay.  So you
23   would apply the joint compound as you would have
24   done in the barn -- I'm sorry -- in the farmhouse.
0100
 1   Correct?
 2          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 3       A. Yes.
 4       Q. And would you let that then dry?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. And I understand that there were
 7   sometimes -- you said in the new house you might
 8   use the -- now kind of a wet sponge?
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. But in tight quarters, you might have to
11   do a little bit of sanding and touch up.  Correct?
12       A. Correct.
13       Q. And that sanding in some sections that you
14   had to do, that created some dust.  Correct?
15       A. Correct.
16       Q. And again, you would breathe in that dust.
17   Correct?
18       A. Correct.
19       Q. And you were not wearing any sort of
20   breathing apparatus or mask or anything?
21       A. Correct.
22       Q. I know that your father owned some farm
23   equipment for the small family farm.  Correct?
24       A. Yup.
0101
 1       Q. And this was not a commercial farm?
 2       A. No.
 3       Q. And you spoke during the course of your
 4   discovery deposition of your father performing
 5   maintenance and repairs on these pieces of
 6   equipment.  Correct?
 7       A. Correct.
 8       Q. And as a matter of fact, you talked later
 9   on about doing some of your own automotive repair
10   work to engines and brakes.  We talked about that.
11   Right?
12       A. Yeah.
13       Q. And you told us that you kind of learned
14   about auto mechanics, as it were, by watching your
15   father do it.  Correct?
16       A. Correct.
17       Q. And so if your father did any sort of
18   engine work on some of the farm equipment, you
19   were there when he was doing it.  Correct?
20       A. Yes.
21       Q. And that's kind of how you were taught.
22   Your dad was doing it.  And you saw what he was
23   doing.  Right?
24       A. Yes.
0102
 1       Q. And kind of the same thing.  If your
 2   father was doing sort of repairs to brakes to any
 3   of the vehicles, you would be there while he was
 4   doing it.  Correct?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. And that's, again, how you learned how to
 7   do it.  Right?
 8       A. Correct.
 9       Q. And so we then asked you a little bit
10   about automobile -- automotive repair work that
11   you did do.  And you told us that you had done
12   some exhaust work, brake work, and engine work on
13   old cars.  Correct?
14          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
15       A. Correct.
16       Q. And let me ask you a little bit about some
17   of the brake work that you told us about.
18          You talked about some old vehicles that
19   you owned, that you purchased used.  Correct?
20       A. Correct.
21       Q. And some of those vehicles you performed
22   brake work on.  Correct?
23       A. Correct.
24       Q. And in order to do that -- these were drum
0103
 1   brakes?
 2       A. Drums, yes.
 3       Q. And when a drum brake needed to be
 4   replaced, you basically needed to remove the old
 5   shoe?
 6       A. After you remove the drum.  Yes.
 7       Q. Right.  So the process works, as I
 8   understand, you have to remove, obviously, the
 9   tire.  That exposes the drum?
10       A. Yeah.
11       Q. You remove the drum?
12       A. Yeah.
13       Q. And the shoes back in the day are the kind
14   that press up against the drum.  Right?
15       A. Right.
16       Q. And so you would remove the old friction
17   products from the shoes?
18       A. Yeah.
19       Q. And you mentioned how you would also have
20   to blow out the drums.  Right?
21       A. Correct.
22       Q. And blowing out the drum, you would do
23   that with compressed air?
24       A. Compressed air.
0104
 1       Q. And you told us that that per drum -- the
 2   blowing, the cleaning out of the drum, would take
 3   about 30 minutes?
 4       A. Yeah, give or take.
 5       Q. All right.  So you're cleaning out all the
 6   drums and whatnot?
 7       A. Yeah.
 8       Q. And that's a dusty process.  Correct?
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. And while you were doing this cleaning out
11   of the drums from the old brakes, you would be
12   using the air hose about arm's length away?
13       A. Yeah.
14       Q. And while you were doing that, did you
15   breathe in the dust that was created when you blew
16   out the old drums?
17       A. Yes.
18       Q. And you were not wearing any sort of mask
19   or respirator.  Correct?
20       A. No.
21       Q. Meaning, I'm correct?
22       A. Yes.
23       Q. Okay.  You also talked about when you were
24   doing automotive work, about -- on personal
0105
 1   vehicles now.  You also did some work removing old
 2   gaskets from cars.  Correct?
 3       A. Correct.
 4          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 5       Q. And to do that, I think you talked about
 6   you would sometimes have to scrape off these old
 7   gaskets that were on these cars.  Right?
 8          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. And that scraping of the old gaskets would
11   create some sort of dust while you did that.
12   Correct?
13       A. Correct.
14       Q. And that's dust that you would breathe in.
15   Correct?
16       A. That's correct.
17       Q. I believe you had a little bit more
18   automotive experience as well as just doing
19   personal automotive repairs on your own cars.  You
20   worked, at least in high school, for Martins
21   Service Station.  Right?
22       A. A genny in Groton.
23       Q. That was a genny station?
24       A. Yeah.
0106
 1       Q. And I think you told us that occasionally
 2   there you might help out and do a brake job there.
 3   Correct?
 4       A. Yes.
 5          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 6       Q. And the brake job that you might help out
 7   at Martins is kind of essentially the same process
 8   as what we talked about.  Right?
 9       A. That's correct.
10       Q. And you used the compressed air at Martins
11   Service Station to remove the dust from the
12   friction products that had been on there.
13   Correct?
14       A. Correct.
15       Q. And that, again, gets the dust into the
16   air.  And that's dust you would have breathed in?
17       A. Right.
18       Q. And as I understand it, too, that not
19   only -- strike that.
20          Your primary job, though, I think you said
21   you were doing some pumping of gas.  Right?
22       A. Yes.
23       Q. But if that wasn't happening, there might
24   be times that you would be in the service station
0107
 1   while the other mechanics were performing
 2   automotive repair.  Correct?
 3          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.
 4       A. Right.
 5       Q. And then, finally, in terms of automotive
 6   work, there were a couple summers that -- in high
 7   school that you got to go down with your brother
 8   down to Florida?
 9       A. Correct.
10       Q. And worked for -- what was it called?  B&D
11   Paint, I think.
12       A. Yeah.  Correct.
13       Q. And down there, they were doing automotive
14   body work.  Right?
15       A. Correct.
16       Q. You would do the body work.  And then they
17   would repaint cars that got dinged and banged up?
18       A. Right.
19       Q. And your job for those two summers, I
20   think it was --
21       A. Yeah.
22       Q. -- was to go down, and you were in charge
23   of prepping the cars for painting?
24       A. Correct.
0108
 1       Q. So filling in whatever dings or dents so
 2   that it could be prepared to have your brother do
 3   the actual painting.  Right?
 4       A. Correct.
 5       Q. And to do that type of automotive work,
 6   you'd have to -- the use of Bondo.  Correct?
 7       A. That's correct.
 8       Q. And so Bondo was a substance that you'd
 9   apply to the car to try to fill in the dents and
10   fill in the dings.  Right?
11       A. Right.
12       Q. So kind of like compound.  You apply it
13   and you have to let it dry.  Right?
14       A. Correct.
15       Q. And the Bondo back at this time, in high
16   school, is that premix Bondo, or did it come in a
17   dry form?
18       A. You had to add a dryer to it.  It was
19   basically premixed, but you had to mix in the
20   dryer --
21       Q. Okay.
22       A. -- until you got a toothpaste.
23       Q. And then once you have the material ready,
24   that's when you apply it to the car as needed.
0109
 1   Right?
 2       A. Correct.
 3       Q. It dries.  Correct?
 4       A. Yes.
 5       Q. And then you need to sand it to make sure
 6   that it's nice and smooth because when you paint
 7   it, you don't want to see it?
 8       A. Right.  Correct.
 9       Q. And that sanding of the dried Bondo,
10   again, that's a dusty process.  Correct?
11          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.
12       A. Yes.
13       Q. And would you have breathed in that dust
14   created by the sanding of the Bondo?
15       A. Yes.
16       Q. And during the course of that time, those
17   two summers down there, did you wear any sort of
18   mask or respirator?
19       A. No.
20       Q. We talked -- your attorney asked you a
21   little bit about the printing business that you
22   owned for a period of time.  And as I understand,
23   sir, you closed that business in approximately
24   2014?
0110
 1       A. 2014.
 2       Q. Okay.  And the reason for that, as I
 3   understand it, sir, was because, as you said, it
 4   was just getting too expensive to do the printing.
 5   Right?
 6       A. Yes.  The equipment became obsolete,
 7   basically.  And there was new equipment.  And I
 8   just did not -- I knew that I was too old to
 9   invest in new equipment.
10       Q. Right.
11          MS. ROSENBLEET:  Could we go off the
12   record.  The phone connection was lost.
13          THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:59 a.m.
14   We are going off the record.
15           (Off the record)
16          THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 12:01 p.m.,
17   and we are back on the record.
18       Q. Sorry about that quick little
19   interruption.  I just want to wrap up with one
20   last area to ask you a little bit about.
21          You started smoking cigarettes around the
22   age of 12 or 13.  Is that correct?
23       A. Yes.
24          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.
0111
 1       Q. And as I understand your testimony, you
 2   stopped smoking around 1989.  Correct?
 3       A. I stopped it -- exactly.
 4       Q. 1989.  So approximately 1950 to 1989 you
 5   were smoking cigarettes.  Correct?
 6       A. Correct.
 7       Q. And you told us at one point, at the high
 8   end, it might have been about a pack a day?
 9       A. Correct.
10       Q. And at the low end, it might have been
11   about 10 cigarettes per day, which is about a half
12   a pack?
13       A. Correct.
14       Q. And when we were asking you yesterday
15   about warnings that came on packages of
16   cigarettes, you said you didn't notice any sort of
17   warnings until the mid 1980s.  Is that fair?
18       A. Correct.
19       Q. Sir, were you aware that warnings came
20   onto packs of cigarettes in 1966?
21          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
22       A. No.
23       Q. So from 1966 until the mid 1980s, is it
24   your testimony, sir, that you never saw any
0112
 1   warnings on any packs of cigarettes?
 2          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 3       A. No, I did not.
 4       Q. You did not.  Okay.
 5          MR. HOOVER:  Sir, those are all the
 6   questions that I have for you.  I want to thank
 7   you again for not only today -- taking the time to
 8   speak with me today, but the past couple of days
 9   during our discovery deposition.  I wish you all
10   the best.
11          Thank you very much.
12               EXAMINATION
13   BY MR. COSTA:
14       Q. Mr. Morton, can you hear me okay?
15       A. Yeah.
16       Q. If you need me to speak up, let me know.
17   But I've never been accused of being soft spoken.
18   Okay?
19       A. Yup.
20       Q. My name is Ken Costa.  Are you okay to go
21   on?
22       A. Yeah.
23       Q. I'm going to be fairly brief.  I represent
24   a company by the name of Weil-McLain.  So my
0113
 1   questions are going to be tailored just to talk
 2   about the boilers that were located at your home.
 3   Okay?
 4       A. Correct.
 5       Q. All right.  Starting with the installation
 6   of the first Weil-McLain boiler in approximately
 7   1964, that was by a company May & Hally.  Correct?
 8       A. Correct.
 9       Q. You weren't involved in the installation
10   of that boiler.  Is that correct?
11       A. That's correct.
12       Q. And just so I'm clear, you don't have any
13   formal boiler training or licenses?
14       A. Correct.
15       Q. You never worked on any commercial boilers
16   during your time -- during your employment?
17       A. No.
18       Q. At some point in time, be it a year, two
19   years, you performed some maintenance work on that
20   boiler.  Correct?
21          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
22       A. Correct.
23       Q. Do you recall the first year that you
24   performed any maintenance to that boiler?
0114
 1       A. Obviously, '65.
 2       Q. I've done some boiler work myself, so I
 3   want to clarify something between us so we're on
 4   the same page.  You referred to baffles.  Are
 5   baffles tubes?
 6       A. They're like a, yeah, water.
 7       Q. In other words, what the soot falls in.
 8   Correct?
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. I want to make sure, if I say the word
11   "tubes," I'm also referring to baffles, so you and
12   I are on the same page.
13       A. Yes.
14       Q. Now, you went over the process of cleaning
15   these baffles.  Correct?
16       A. Correct.
17       Q. Your attorney asked you about those
18   questions earlier today.  Correct?
19       A. Correct.
20       Q. And you performed this work annually.
21   Correct?
22       A. Correct.
23       Q. Usually in the fall?
24       A. Yes.
0115
 1       Q. And you told us that it took you
 2   approximately 30 minutes from start to finish to
 3   perform this maintenance work.  Correct?
 4          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 5       A. Correct.
 6       Q. Aside from that maintenance work, you
 7   didn't perform any other types of maintenance or
 8   repairs to the boilers at your home.  Correct?
 9       A. To the boiler, no.  Correct.
10       Q. I want you to take me through the process
11   of this annual maintenance work.  Okay?
12          To start with, you had to remove the metal
13   jacket from the boiler.  Correct?
14          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
15   answered.
16       A. The top plate.
17       Q. How did you remove the top plate?  Did you
18   use a screwdriver?  A ratchet?  How did it come
19   off?
20       A. It was either a screwdriver or a Phillips
21   screwdriver.  I don't know which.
22       Q. And how long did it take you to remove
23   that top plate?
24       A. I believe there was, I'm going to say,
0116
 1   four.  For each corner.  So, you know, how long?
 2       Q. A matter of minutes?
 3       A. Yeah.
 4       Q. Once you removed the top plate, am I
 5   correct there was some insulation?  Correct?
 6       A. Yes.
 7       Q. And then you removed that insulation.
 8   Correct?
 9       A. Correct.
10       Q. Were there any screws involved with
11   removing the insulation?
12       A. No.
13       Q. How long did it take for you to remove the
14   insulation?
15       A. Not long.  Minutes.
16       Q. Once you removed the top plate and the
17   insulation, did you put it to the side?
18       A. Set it aside.
19       Q. Put it down.  Correct?
20       A. Yes.
21       Q. And then that exposed the baffles or the
22   tubes.  Correct?
23       A. You had one more plate.
24       Q. Is that another metal plate?
0117
 1       A. Metal plate.
 2       Q. Were there screws involved in that metal
 3   plate?
 4       A. I can't -- don't know.
 5       Q. And that's a perfectly acceptable answer,
 6   sir.
 7          Once you removed that plate, did you set
 8   that aside?
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. Now the baffles and tubes are exposed.
11   Correct?
12       A. Correct.
13       Q. And you told us that you used something
14   like a pipe cleaner to clean out those tubes and
15   baffles?
16       A. Yes.
17       Q. And that's where all the soot lies.
18   Correct?
19       A. Yes.
20       Q. And that soot is black.  Correct?
21       A. Correct.
22       Q. And that's the oil -- excuse me.  That's
23   the combustion of the oil and the fuel that builds
24   up over time.  Correct?
0118
 1       A. Correct.
 2       Q. And once you use that pipe cleaner, you
 3   got inside those tubes to get the soot out.
 4   Correct?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. And then I think you told us you used a
 7   vacuum cleaner to suck up the dirt?
 8       A. Yes.
 9       Q. And when you were using the pipe cleaner
10   to remove the soot, that created dust.  Correct?
11       A. Correct.
12       Q. But you vacuumed up all that dust with
13   your vacuum cleaner?
14       A. Correct.
15       Q. By any chance, you wouldn't happen to
16   remember the name of the vacuum cleaner?
17       A. No.
18       Q. And would I be correct, once you're done
19   with that process, you put everything back.
20   Correct?
21       A. Correct.
22       Q. In other words, you put the lower plate
23   back on and bolt it up.  Correct?
24       A. Yup.
0119
 1       Q. And then you take the insulation --
 2          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
 3       Q. -- put it back?
 4       A. Correct.
 5       Q. And then you put the final top plate on.
 6   Correct?
 7       A. Correct.
 8       Q. Did we just go over the entire process
 9   that you performed when you performed an annual
10   maintenance of these boilers?
11       A. Yes.
12       Q. And did that change at all from, say, the
13   first boiler you had in your home or the second
14   boiler?
15       A. No.
16       Q. It was always the same process?
17       A. Yes.
18       Q. At some point in time, you told us that
19   you removed the first Weil-McLain boiler from your
20   home.  Correct?
21       A. Correct.
22       Q. And that was some point in the 1980s.
23   Correct?
24          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.
0120
 1       A. Correct.
 2       Q. And you purchased that boiler from
 3   Fitchburg Plumbing.  Correct?
 4       A. Correct.
 5       Q. Did you have to pull any permits to
 6   perform that work?
 7       A. No.
 8       Q. And you said you did this work with your
 9   nephew.  Correct?
10       A. Removing the boiler?
11       Q. Yes, sir.
12       A. Correct.
13       Q. Do you recall which nephew?
14       A. No.
15       Q. And you testified today that you had to
16   remove two flange gaskets from the boiler when you
17   removed it.  Is that correct?
18       A. That's correct.
19       Q. The inlet and the outlet gaskets, if you
20   will?
21       A. Yes.
22       Q. Aside from those two connections, the
23   inlet and the outlet, was the boiler connected to
24   anything else?
0121
 1       A. Obviously, electrical supply.
 2       Q. Understood.  Were there any other types of
 3   pipe connecting that boiler?
 4       A. There were tube pipes.
 5       Q. Was that the inlet and the outlet?
 6       A. Yes.
 7       Q. Would you agree with me, there is a gasket
 8   at the inlet and a gasket at the outlet?
 9       A. That is correct.
10       Q. Once you removed those two gaskets and
11   disconnected the piping and removed the
12   electrical, the boiler could come out.  Correct?
13       A. Removed the burner and the --
14       Q. And I want to get to that.  But just for
15   the time being, once you've disconnected the two
16   flange gaskets and the electrical, the boiler
17   could have come out.  Correct?
18       A. Correct.
19       Q. I understand that's not what you did.  But
20   it's not connected to the house right now?
21       A. Right.
22       Q. Okay.  Those original gaskets were
23   installed by May & Hally.  Correct?
24          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.  Lack of
0122
 1   foundation.
 2       A. I don't know.
 3       Q. Let me ask you, do you know who installed
 4   the original gaskets to that first Weil-McLain
 5   boiler?
 6       A. No.
 7       Q. It wasn't you.  Correct?
 8       A. It was not me.
 9       Q. And do you know the chemical composition
10   of those gaskets?
11       A. No.
12       Q. Once you -- strike that.
13          You then told us, or I believe you
14   testified at your discovery deposition, you wanted
15   to lighten up the boiler, so you removed the
16   burner.  Is that correct?
17       A. That's correct.
18       Q. And today you told us that when you
19   removed the burner, there was a gasket housing it
20   in place.  Correct?
21       A. Yeah.
22       Q. You ultimately ended up disposing of this
23   boiler.  Correct?
24       A. Correct.
0123
 1       Q. Did you have to remove the gasket that
 2   housed the burner as well?
 3       A. You didn't have to, and didn't.
 4       Q. So I just want to make sure what you did.
 5       A. When you remove the burner, all right,
 6   depending whether the gasket stayed with the
 7   burner or whether it stayed with the housing.
 8       Q. Do you recall what happened in your
 9   particular circumstance?
10       A. No.
11       Q. You didn't have to clean that gasket?  In
12   other words, you didn't have to manipulate that
13   gasket or scrape that gasket to remove the
14   housing?
15       A. Not on the old one.
16       Q. Because you're getting rid of it.
17   Correct?
18       A. Correct.
19       Q. Aside from removing the burner, am I
20   correct that the rest of the boiler was removed in
21   one piece, on a dolly?
22       A. Except for the housing where the burner is
23   attached is a housing.
24       Q. And you removed that housing separately?
0124
 1       A. Yes.
 2       Q. And then once the boiler came out, it came
 3   out in one piece, the remainder?
 4       A. Yes.
 5       Q. And I think you told us earlier, you
 6   replaced it with a packaged Weil-McLain boiler.
 7   Correct?
 8       A. Yes.
 9       Q. And if I was going in the process in
10   reverse, you attached the two flange connections,
11   the inlet and the outlet.  Correct?
12       A. Correct.
13       Q. And the electrical system.  Correct?
14       A. Yeah.
15       Q. Did you have to use a gasket when you
16   connected the inlet and outlet?
17       A. Yes.
18       Q. Do you recall the chemical composition of
19   the gaskets you used?
20       A. No.
21       Q. Do you recall who manufactured the
22   gaskets?
23       A. No.
24       Q. Do you recall where you purchased those
0125
 1   gaskets?
 2       A. No.
 3          MR. COSTA:  Sir, I'm going to look over my
 4   notes, but I promised to keep it short and sweet.
 5   And I thank you for your time.
 6          THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
 7               EXAMINATION
 8   BY MS. SHANNON:
 9       Q. Hi, Mr. Morton.  How are you?
10       A. I'm fine.
11       Q. My name is Anne Shannon.  I have some
12   questions for you regarding your motor testimony.
13          While helping your father in his
14   refrigeration business, if a motor failed, you and
15   your father had to replace it.  Correct?
16       A. If what?
17          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
18       Q. If a motor failed, you and your father had
19   to replace it.  Correct?
20       A. Yes.
21       Q. And to remove a motor, you remove the
22   pulley and fan assembly from the motor.  Correct?
23       A. Correct.
24       Q. And then you would be able to pick up the
0126
 1   motor.  Correct?
 2       A. Correct.
 3       Q. And you would bring that motor back to
 4   your father's shop until you brought it to a guy
 5   in Leominster.  Correct?
 6       A. Uh-hmm.  Correct.
 7       Q. And the guy in Leominster would fix the
 8   motor.  Correct?
 9       A. Correct.
10       Q. So you did not repair the motors.
11   Correct?
12          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
13       A. The only repair to the motor was replacing
14   brushes.
15       Q. Okay.  But you didn't rebuild the motor?
16       A. Did not rebuild.
17       Q. You did not rewind the motor?
18       A. No.
19       Q. Regarding the maintenance work with the
20   motors, that consisted of cleaning the motors with
21   an air blower.  Correct?
22       A. That's correct.
23       Q. And the air blower was the size of a
24   hairdryer?
0127
 1       A. It was a little bigger than a hairdryer.
 2       Q. And blowing out the unit, not just the
 3   motor, it --
 4       A. The condenser?
 5       Q. The condenser, the receiver, the
 6   compressor.  It took about five minutes.  Correct?
 7          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
 8   Misstating his earlier testimony.
 9       A. The motor, five minutes.
10       Q. The motor was five minutes?
11       A. Yeah.
12       Q. Now, regarding the maintenance work, you
13   also replaced the brushes on these motors.
14   Correct?
15       A. Correct.
16       Q. And you would change the brushes?
17       A. Correct.
18          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Asked and
19   answered.
20       Q. And the brushes snapped into the motor?
21       A. Yes.  They had brush holders.
22       Q. And while you were replacing the brush,
23   you didn't disturb any of the component parts of
24   the motor.  Correct?
0128
 1       A. Correct.
 2          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 3       Q. Now, when you installed the new GE motor,
 4   that included rehabbed motors.  Correct?
 5          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 6       A. Do you want to repeat that question?
 7       Q. Earlier today you testified that you would
 8   install new GE motors.  Did that installation
 9   consist of previously rehabbed or repaired motors?
10          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
11       A. I still do not understand the question.
12       Q. I'll rephrase.  Earlier today you
13   testified that you installed new General Electric
14   motors.
15       A. Right.
16       Q. Of those installation of new motors, did
17   that include repaired motors?
18       A. I still . . .
19       Q. I'll rephrase again.
20       A. I'm sorry.
21       Q. No, no.  That's fine.
22          The motors you received from the guy in
23   Leominster, were those some of the motors you
24   replaced for the new installation?
0129
 1          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 2       A. I'm still -- I'm sorry.
 3       Q. I might come back to that in a second.
 4       A. I can maybe --
 5          MR. BECERRA:  We don't want you to guess,
 6   Mr. Morton.  If you're confused at all, just tell
 7   her that.
 8       Q. We don't want you to guess.
 9       A. Yeah.
10       Q. On your second day of testimony, you
11   mentioned when you bought -- you were asked, "Did
12   you buy new motors at all?"
13          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Improper
14   impeachment.
15       Q. And you answered "Very seldom."
16          If I show you your testimony, will that
17   refresh your memory?
18          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
19          That's not how you impeach somebody in
20   Massachusetts.
21       Q. I'm going to show you . . .
22          So Mr. Morton, when you were replacing --
23   when you were installing new motors, where did you
24   get them from?
0130
 1       A. The new motors?
 2       Q. Yes.
 3       A. They would come with a complete
 4   refrigeration unit, the compressors and the
 5   condenser.
 6       Q. So where did you buy them from?
 7          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 8       A. Those would have been bought as a new
 9   unit, not just the motor.
10       Q. How often did you buy a new unit?
11       A. Over a 22-year span, I can't answer that
12   question.
13       Q. Do you recall -- okay.  Do you recall how
14   many times you purchased a new motor?
15          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
16       A. Just a new motor?
17       Q. Correct.
18       A. Very few.
19       Q. Okay.  Now, a lot of the motors, at least
20   in the earlier -- strike that.
21          The older motors you worked with, with
22   your father, were separated as opposed to
23   enclosed.  Correct?
24       A. Correct.
0131
 1          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 2       Q. Now, all the motors that we've talked
 3   about, the General Electric and the Westinghouse
 4   motors, were they AC motors?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. Now, when you were performing your
 7   maintenance work or your installation, was there
 8   ever insulation on the outside of the motor?
 9       A. Insulation?
10       Q. On the outside.
11       A. No.
12       Q. And because you brought the motors to the
13   guy in Leominster, you don't know whether there
14   was thermal insulation on the inside.  Correct?
15          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
16       A. Correct.
17       Q. Now, regarding GE motors, you never spoke
18   to a GE representative regarding their motors.
19   Correct?
20       A. Correct.
21       Q. And you never consulted a GE manual
22   regarding --
23       A. Right.
24          MS. SHANNON:  Okay.  I'm going to just
0132
 1   look over my notes, but I think that's all I have
 2   for you today.
 3          THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
 4               EXAMINATION
 5   BY MS. ROSENBLEET:
 6       Q. Can you hear me okay from down here at
 7   this end of the table?  I will switch.
 8       A. Thank you.
 9       Q. I don't speak very loudly, so I apologize.
10          My name is Shaina Rosenbleet, and I have
11   just two questions, I believe, for you about
12   Westinghouse.
13          You did not review any Westinghouse
14   materials for motors.  Is that correct?
15       A. In what -- do you want to rephrase that or
16   just repeat it?
17       Q. That I can do for you.  Did you ever
18   review any repair manuals before you replaced a
19   brush in a Westinghouse motor?
20       A. No.
21       Q. Did you ever talk with a Westinghouse
22   representative before repairing any of the brushes
23   in a Westinghouse motor?
24       A. No.
0133
 1          MS. ROSENBLEET:  Those are all the
 2   questions I have for you.  Thank you very much,
 3   sir.
 4          THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
 5               EXAMINATION
 6   BY MR. SIMONS:
 7       Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Morton.
 8       A. Good afternoon.
 9       Q. My name is Michael Simons.  We've met
10   before in your discovery deposition.
11       A. Right.
12       Q. Are you okay to keep going for a little
13   bit, or do you need a break?
14       A. I'd like to take a break.
15       Q. Let's do that, then.  Absolutely.
16          THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 12:24 p.m.
17   We are going off the video record.
18          (Recess taken)
19          THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 12:30 p.m.,
20   and we are back on the record.
21       Q. Hello again, Mr. Morton.
22       A. Hello.
23       Q. We took a quick break.  We're back now.
24   Are you okay to now continue at this point?
0134
 1       A. Yes.
 2       Q. I know I took a while during your
 3   discovery deposition.  I'm going to try and be
 4   much quicker today.  All right?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. You testified earlier today when you were
 7   being questioned by Mr. Becerra that you worked on
 8   hundreds of Crane Co. pumps.  Is that correct?
 9       A. That's correct.
10       Q. And sir, do you recall -- I think
11   Mr. Hoover talked about this.  Do you recall if
12   you were deposed in a discovery deposition about a
13   month or so back?
14       A. Yes.
15       Q. And do you recall that -- I wasn't there
16   in person that day, but I asked you questions over
17   the phone about your work with Crane Co. valves,
18   on June 28th of 2018.  Do you recall that?
19       A. Yes.
20       Q. Sir, you testified on June 28th, during
21   your discovery deposition, that you changed out
22   just a few Crane Co. pumps while working with your
23   dad.  Isn't that correct?
24          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
0135
 1       A. Don't remember.
 2       Q. Okay.  Let me have this -- I've got a copy
 3   of your deposition transcript from June 28th.  I'm
 4   going to hand it to your attorney.  Your attorney
 5   can hand it to you.
 6          MR. SIMONS:  I'd ask this be marked as an
 7   exhibit.
 8          (Exhibit 1 marked for identification)
 9       Q. And then I'd ask you to take a look at a
10   section of the transcript.
11          MR. BECERRA:  Is there a specific page?
12          MR. SIMONS:  Absolutely.  464, starting on
13   line 2, going through, for purposes of this, line
14   14.
15       Q. All right.  Sir, you've just been handed a
16   copy of the deposition transcript by your
17   attorney.  Correct?
18       A. (No verbal response)
19       Q. And do you see page 464?  It's the
20   top-left corner.
21       A. Okay.  Now what?
22       Q. I'm going to read this transcript and ask
23   you if I've read this correctly.
24          MR. BECERRA:  And I'm going to object
0136
 1   because in Massachusetts you're not allowed to
 2   read transcripts into the record at trial.
 3          Feel free to do whatever you need to.
 4          MR. SIMONS:  Great.
 5       Q. Sir, I'll tell you what, why don't you
 6   read to yourself lines 2 through 14 on that page.
 7       A. Line 2?
 8       Q. Lines 2 through 14.
 9          MR. BECERRA:  Let me just help you out.
10   So you see these numbers here, Mr. Morton?
11          THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
12          MR. BECERRA:  He wants you to just read,
13   starting at number 2 and then going down to number
14   14, just those questions and those answers.
15          And again, I'll object to the form.
16          (Pause)
17       A. All right.
18       Q. You've had an opportunity to read your
19   prior testimony now.  Correct?
20       A. Yeah.
21       Q. And am I correct that you testified that
22   you only changed out a few Crane Co. pumps, not
23   hundreds?
24          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
0137
 1   Misstating his prior testimony.  I never asked him
 2   about changing.
 3          You can answer if you understand his
 4   question, Mr. Morton.
 5       A. I believe I was referring to the ones in
 6   my home, in the farmhouse.
 7       Q. Well, sir, let me then take you --
 8       A. And that would have been a few.
 9       Q. Let me take you back to page 463, then.
10   Okay?
11          MR. SIMONS:  Maybe you can help him with
12   that.  Start 463.
13          MR. BECERRA:  Sure.  What lines?
14          MR. SIMONS:  Actually, I take that back.
15   462, lines 12 through 17.
16          MR. BECERRA:  Starting here, Mr. Morton.
17          You're free to read whatever you like
18   that's there so you can refresh your memory.  Take
19   as much time as you need, sir.
20       A. Starting with which number?
21       Q. Lines 12 through 17.
22       A. 12?
23       Q. 12 to 17.  Correct.
24          MR. BECERRA:  And I'll object to the
0138
 1   extent that the question is misleading because
 2   that's not what immediately precedes the question
 3   that you're trying to impeach him on.
 4          MR. SIMONS:  Jose, are you really going to
 5   challenge that I'd moved on from the questioning
 6   about work in his home to work with his father
 7   from that point forward?
 8          MR. BECERRA:  I'm not challenging
 9   anything.  I'm just voicing my objection for the
10   record.
11          MR. SIMONS:  Okay.
12       Q. I tell you what, why don't you read from
13   line 12 on page 462 all the way to page 464, some
14   of which you previously read, just so the context
15   is clear.
16          (Pause)
17       A. I'm sorry.  I'm totally confused now.
18          MR. BECERRA:  That's okay, Mr. Morton.
19   Just let him ask his question.  Okay?
20       Q. Sir, I'll represent to you -- given you're
21   confused, what I'll do is --
22          MR. SIMONS:  You can have your objection.
23       Q. But I'll read it into the record myself.
24          Starting on 462, line 14 -- sorry.  Line
0139
 1   12.  I apologize.
 2          "QUESTION:  Okay.  All right.  So let's
 3   move on from -- from the pump in your home.  You
 4   testified that you encountered Crane Co. pumps
 5   during your work with your father; is that
 6   correct?
 7          "ANSWER:  That's correct.
 8          "QUESTION:  Okay.  Are you able to
 9   identify any specific jobsite, or is it just a
10   general memory that Crane Co. is one of the brands
11   of pumps that you encountered throughout your
12   career with your father?
13          "ANSWER:  Basically -- I guess you're
14   going to have to repeat that question just so I
15   want to make sure I answer it the proper way.
16          "QUESTION:  Absolutely.  Do you recall
17   working with or around a Crane Co. pump at any
18   specific jobsites with your father, or do you --
19   rather, do you just have a memory that this was a
20   brand of pump that you encountered generally over
21   your career working with your father?
22          "ANSWER:  Just -- I have -- yes,
23   generally.  Not one particular jobsite.
24          "QUESTION:  Okay.  Thank you.  As I
0140
 1   understood it, one of the types of work that you
 2   did with Crane Co. pumps was you would install new
 3   ones, correct, with your father?
 4          "ANSWER:  Correct.
 5          "QUESTION:  Okay.  You described for me
 6   the process of installing a pump in your home -- a
 7   Crane Co. pump in your own home.  Would the
 8   process be the same with regard to the
 9   installation of any Crane Co. pump at any of the
10   jobsites you may have encountered one?"
11          There is an objection as to form from
12   Mr. Becerra, and then your answer is,
13          "ANSWER:  Yes.
14          "QUESTION:  Okay.  Anything different
15   about the installation process between what you
16   testified about in terms of installing one in your
17   home versus installing one at a jobsite with your
18   dad?
19          "ANSWER:  Basically, no.
20          "QUESTION:  Okay.  Could you tell me the
21   size ranges of the Crane Co. pumps that you
22   encountered in the field with your father?
23          "ANSWER:  I really can't give you the
24   exact horsepower because we changed -- did not
0141
 1   change a lot.  We changed a few.
 2          "QUESTION:  When you say 'a few,' are you
 3   able to give me a good faith estimate, without
 4   guessing, as to what you mean by 'a few'?
 5          "ANSWER:  Without guessing, no.  That was
 6   not a large situation.  In other words, they were
 7   unfortunately very dependable, so I was not
 8   changing them on a weekly basis or a monthly
 9   basis."
10          Did I read that testimony correctly, sir?
11          MR. BECERRA:  And I'm going to object to
12   the form of the question, to the improper reading
13   of the transcript into the record, and I'm going
14   to move to strike entire portion of the question.
15       Q. Did I read that testimony correctly, sir?
16       A. Yes.
17       Q. All right.  Sir, in regard to the Crane
18   Co. pumps that you encountered, you said the
19   flange gaskets that you used were precut.  Is that
20   correct?
21       A. That's correct.
22       Q. And you previously testified that you
23   didn't know the brand name, trade name or
24   manufacturer's name of those precut gaskets.
0142
 1   Correct?
 2       A. Correct.
 3       Q. And sir, you also testified that when you
 4   encountered a Crane Co. pump which was in the
 5   field, you didn't know if the gaskets on the
 6   pump -- flange gaskets came with the pump or were
 7   purchased separately.  Correct?
 8       A. Correct.
 9       Q. And you didn't do any maintenance work on
10   any Crane Co. pumps.  Correct?
11          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
12       A. Repeat that question again.
13       Q. Sure.  Am I correct that you previously
14   testified you did not do any maintenance work on
15   any Crane Co. pumps?
16       A. Correct.
17       Q. And you testified previously that you
18   removed a few Crane Co. pumps but not a lot.
19   Correct?
20       A. That's correct.
21       Q. And in those few situations where you
22   removed a Crane Co. pump, you didn't know the
23   maintenance history of those pumps.  Correct?
24          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.
0143
 1       A. I'm going to say "incorrect" on that.  I
 2   did know the maintenance.
 3       Q. Sir, I'm going to ask you to refer to page
 4   470 of the transcript, if you would, please.  And
 5   sir, I'd ask you to take a look at lines 21 on
 6   page 470 through line 1 on page 471.
 7          (Pause)
 8       Q. All right.  Sir, having reviewed the
 9   testimony, does that refresh your recollection as
10   to whether you previously testified that when you
11   did encounter a Crane Co. pump that you had to
12   remove out in the field, you would not know the
13   maintenance history of that pump.  Is that
14   correct?
15          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
16       A. We were the only ones that took care of
17   that pump.
18       Q. Sir, let me try this.  I'm going to read
19   lines [sic] 470 to 471 and ask you if I've read it
20   correctly.
21          "QUESTION:  Okay.  And if you did
22   encounter a Crane Co. pump that you had to remove
23   out in the field, am I correct that you wouldn't
24   know the maintenance history of that pump?
0144
 1          "ANSWER:  Right."
 2          Did I read that correctly from the
 3   transcript?
 4          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.  And move
 5   to strike.
 6       A. Yeah.
 7       Q. All right.  And sir, in those situations
 8   when you encountered a Crane Co. pump in the
 9   field, you also wouldn't know whether the
10   components were original to those pumps.  Correct?
11       A. Correct.
12       Q. I'm going to move on to Crane Co. valves
13   at this point.  Okay?
14       A. Okay.
15       Q. Sir, you previously testified that the
16   Crane Co. valves you encountered or worked with
17   ranged in size from approximately one-half inch to
18   one-and-a-half inches.  Correct?
19       A. Correct.
20       Q. And you testified that most of the Crane
21   Co. valves that you worked with were soldered
22   rather than flanged.  Correct?
23          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
24       A. Correct.
0145
 1       Q. And you previously testified that -- well,
 2   strike that.
 3          And just so the jury is clear, what's the
 4   difference between a soldered connection versus a
 5   flanged connection?
 6       A. A soldered connection is, it's soldered
 7   into the pipe.  A flange, it is threaded.  There's
 8   a nipple.  And the flange is attached that way.
 9       Q. And sir, am I correct that soldered
10   connections don't use a flange gasket?
11       A. Correct.
12       Q. Okay.  And sir, you previously testified
13   that for the Crane Co. valves which weren't
14   soldered and had a flange connection, that you
15   used a precut-to-size flange gasket which you'd
16   obtained from a local supply house.  Correct?
17       A. That's correct.
18       Q. And sir, you testified that if you had to
19   perform maintenance on a Crane Co. valve out in
20   the field which was already in service, you would
21   not know the maintenance history of that valve.
22   Correct?
23       A. This was a new customer.  I would not know
24   the -- correct.
0146
 1       Q. And in such a situation, you wouldn't know
 2   if the gaskets or any packaging material
 3   associated with that valve were original to the
 4   valve or not.  Correct?
 5       A. I had no idea.
 6       Q. Okay.  And sir, I think you previously
 7   testified that the first action you would
 8   undertake if you encountered a leaking valve would
 9   be to tighten the packing nut.  Correct?
10       A. Correct.
11       Q. To see if that stopped the leak?
12       A. Correct.
13       Q. And you testified that, generally, the
14   first time you did that, that would solve the
15   problem.  Correct?
16       A. Correct.
17       Q. And you testified that --
18          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
19          Sorry.
20          MR. SIMONS:  That's okay.
21          MR. BECERRA:  Belated.
22          MR. SIMONS:  That's okay.
23       Q. You testified that a second time, let's
24   say, you encountered that valve, sometimes
0147
 1   retightening that packing nut would work and
 2   sometimes it wouldn't.  Correct?
 3       A. Correct.
 4       Q. And obviously, if it did correct it the
 5   second time, you were done.  Right?
 6       A. Right.
 7       Q. And if it didn't correct it, then and only
 8   then would you need to change any of the packing.
 9   Correct?
10       A. Correct.
11       Q. And sir, when you were changing out the
12   packing -- I know you talked about the process
13   with Mr. Becerra -- you would be careful not to
14   damage the valve itself.  Correct?
15       A. Correct.
16       Q. What would happen if you had damaged the
17   valve?
18       A. You'd wind up replacing the valve.
19       Q. And you testified about changing gaskets
20   with Mr. Becerra.  Correct?
21       A. Yes.
22       Q. And again, would you want to be careful
23   when you were scraping off an old gasket to make
24   sure you didn't damage the face of the flange?
0148
 1       A. Definitely.
 2       Q. Okay.  Again, what would happen if you did
 3   damage it?
 4       A. Then you would have to replace it.
 5       Q. Okay.  And sir, you testified at your
 6   deposition when we spoke last month that the
 7   replacement packing you used on any Crane Co.
 8   valves was obtained by your father from a local
 9   supply house.  Correct?
10       A. Correct.
11       Q. And you didn't -- am I correct that you
12   didn't know the manufacturer, brand name or trade
13   name of the replacement packing because it came on
14   a spool with no markings?  Correct?
15       A. Correct.
16       Q. And with regard to Crane Co. valves that
17   you serviced out in the field, you wouldn't know
18   the maintenance history of those valves.  Correct?
19          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.
20       A. Correct.
21       Q. And you testified that given that you
22   wouldn't know the maintenance history of the
23   valves, you wouldn't know whether any of the
24   components, such as the packing or, if it called
0149
 1   for flange gaskets, the flange gaskets were
 2   original to that valve.  Correct?
 3       A. Correct.
 4       Q. Okay.  All right.  I want to switch
 5   topics, ask you a few general questions, and then
 6   we'll be done.  Okay?
 7       A. Yup.
 8       Q. All right, sir.  Thank you.
 9          You testified during your discovery
10   deposition that you first learned about potential
11   health hazards of asbestos in approximately 1985.
12   Correct?
13       A. That's correct.
14       Q. And you testified that after you learned
15   about those potential health hazards in 1985, you
16   were unsure if you came into contact with asbestos
17   after that?
18       A. Repeat that.
19       Q. Sure.  Absolutely.  You testified that
20   after you learned about the potential health
21   hazards of asbestos in 1985, you weren't sure if
22   you did or did not work with asbestos products
23   after that?
24       A. Correct.
0150
 1       Q. But sir, even though you are unsure
 2   whether you were encountering asbestos after you
 3   learned about the hazards, you testified that you
 4   still didn't change your work practices.  Correct?
 5          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 6       A. Correct.
 7       Q. So sir, is it fair to say that you don't
 8   necessarily follow health or safety warnings?
 9          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
10          That's a completely improper question.
11   It's misleading.  It's harassing.  There's been no
12   testimony whatsoever either today or back in late
13   June that Mr. Morton doesn't follow health
14   hazards.  None at all.  No testimony at all.
15       Q. Sir, when you first learned about the
16   health hazards of smoking, you continued to smoke
17   after that date.  Correct?
18          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
19       A. Correct.
20       Q. Okay.  Sir, just a couple more and I am
21   done.  I promise.
22          I'm going to show you a document that was
23   marked as an exhibit at your discovery deposition.
24   I'm going to ask that it be marked as an exhibit
0151
 1   here as well.
 2          (Exhibit 2 marked for identification)
 3       Q. And it's a copy of your certified Social
 4   Security records.  Okay?
 5       A. Yup.
 6       Q. And sir, you've just been handed a copy of
 7   your Social Security records, which as I mentioned
 8   were previously marked as an exhibit at your
 9   discovery deposition.  Okay?
10       A. Yeah.
11       Q. Okay.  You testified that your dad started
12   his company, Groton Refrigeration, in the 1940s
13   and that he ran it until his death in '69 or '70.
14          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
15       Q. Is that correct?
16       A. Yes, that's correct.
17       Q. Looking at your Social Security records --
18          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
19          MR. SIMONS:  I haven't finished my
20   question yet.  Do you want to wait?
21          MR. BECERRA:  Was there a question there?
22   I'm objecting to the use of the Social Security
23   records.
24          MR. SIMONS:  That's fine.
0152
 1       Q. You testified that you worked for your
 2   dad's company from approximately 1959 until '71,
 3   '72.
 4          MR. BECERRA:  1950 to --
 5          MR. SIMONS:  1950.  I'm sorry.  You're
 6   right.
 7       Q. Let me restate that.  You testified that
 8   your worked for your dad's business from
 9   approximately 1950, when you were 10 years old,
10   until 1971, '72, when you closed out the business?
11       A. Right.
12       Q. And sir, am I correct that there is no
13   reference to your father's company, Groton
14   Refrigeration, in your Social Security records?
15       A. That's correct.
16          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  The document
17   speaks for itself.
18       Q. And sir, I'm going to show you one more
19   document which I had asked you about over the
20   phone at your discovery deposition.  I'll ask that
21   this be marked as the next exhibit, please.
22          MR. BECERRA:  I'll object to the exhibit,
23   the authenticity of it, and to the extent that it
24   was established back in the discovery deposition
0153
 1   that Mr. Morton -- strike that.
 2          Go ahead.
 3          (Exhibit 3 marked for identification)
 4       Q. Sir, I'm going to show you a document.
 5   And I'll represent that this came from the
 6   Vansant-Mills Funeral Home website.
 7          Are you familiar with that funeral home?
 8          MR. BECERRA:  Mr. Morton, just answer his
 9   question.
10       A. No, I am not.
11       Q. Well, let's take a look at the title.  The
12   title -- I'll represent this is an obituary for
13   Walter F. Morton, Senior, refrigeration engineer.
14   Did I read that correctly?
15          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.  The
16   document speaks for itself.
17       A. Yeah, that's correct.
18       Q. And sir, I'd ask you to take a look at
19   this document and read it through for me, and then
20   I'll ask you a couple of questions.  Okay?
21          MR. BECERRA:  Again, improper use of the
22   document.  There's been no testimony that would
23   suggest that this document is refreshing
24   Mr. Morton's recollection in any way.
0154
 1       A. And what's the question about it?
 2       Q. Have you had an opportunity to review that
 3   document?
 4       A. Yeah.
 5       Q. Okay.  So the document -- would you read
 6   this as -- this is the obituary for your father?
 7       A. Yes.
 8       Q. Would you agree that the document
 9   references your father's work at Fort Devens?
10       A. Correct.
11       Q. And it references his work prior to Fort
12   Devens for the J.P. Sullivan Packing Company?
13       A. Correct.
14          MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  The document
15   speaks for itself.
16       Q. There's no reference to his ownership of
17   Groton Refrigeration, which he ran for
18   approximately 30 years.  Correct?
19       A. That's correct.
20          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
21          MR. SIMONS:  Those are all the questions I
22   have.  I thank you for your time.  And I wish you
23   all the best and your family.
24          THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
0155
 1          MR. SIMONS:  Thank you, sir.
 2          MR. BECERRA:  Anybody else?
 3          I just have a few follow-up questions.
 4               FURTHER EXAMINATION
 5   BY MR. BECERRA:
 6       Q. Okay, Mr. Morton.  You recall yesterday
 7   morning, Mr. Morton, we concluded the discovery
 8   portion of your deposition?  Do you recall that?
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. And you were asked some questions about
11   smoking.  Do you remember that?
12       A. Yes.
13       Q. And I asked you some questions about
14   smoking.  Do you recall that?
15       A. Yes.
16       Q. And do you recall telling us yesterday
17   morning that the first time that you noticed the
18   warnings on cigarette packs was at some point in
19   the 1980s.  Do you recall that?
20       A. Correct.
21       Q. And I asked you whether after having seen
22   those warnings, whether you developed concerns
23   about your health.  Do you recall those questions?
24       A. Yes.
0156
 1       Q. And remind us again, Mr. Morton, what did
 2   you do after those concerns came about?
 3       A. Tried to quit smoking, unsuccessful,
 4   several times.
 5       Q. And why is it that it was so difficult to
 6   quit smoking?
 7       A. Because it's very addictive.
 8       Q. I want to switch gears and ask you about
 9   your father's work under Groton Refrigeration.
10   Okay?
11       A. Yup.
12       Q. Do you know if that was a legal entity
13   that he had registered with the state of
14   Massachusetts?
15       A. I have no idea.
16       Q. Do you know if the business was officially
17   incorporated under the state of Massachusetts?
18       A. No.
19       Q. And how did your dad pay you?  In cash?
20   Strike that.
21          How did your dad pay you?
22       A. I don't know.  I don't really remember, to
23   tell you the truth.
24       Q. No problem, sir.
0157
 1       A. I know there was a checking account.  All
 2   I know is that I did not work at an hourly rate.
 3       Q. Okay.  I want to switch gears again and
 4   ask you -- Mr. Hoover was asking you some
 5   questions about some of the work you did both in
 6   the family home and in your own home growing up.
 7   Do you recall those questions from earlier this
 8   morning?
 9       A. Yes.
10       Q. One of the products that we talked about
11   was sheetrock that you had to cut.  Do you recall
12   those questions?
13       A. Yes.
14       Q. And do you know if any of that sheetrock
15   had asbestos?
16       A. I have no idea.
17       Q. What about any of the joint compound, do
18   you know if any of that had asbestos?
19       A. No.
20       Q. What about the floor tiles that you had to
21   remove from the family home, do you know if those
22   tiles had asbestos?
23       A. No.
24       Q. Switching gears one more time, Mr. Morton.
0158
 1   Earlier this morning you told us about how while
 2   working in the commercial refrigeration business
 3   between 1950 and 1972, you installed new Crane
 4   stem valves.  Do you recall that testimony?
 5       A. Yes.
 6       Q. You also told us that you installed new
 7   Crane gate valves.  Do you recall that testimony?
 8       A. Yes.
 9       Q. You also told us that you installed new
10   Crane circulating pumps.  Do you recall that
11   testimony?
12       A. Yes.
13       Q. You also told us, Mr. Morton, that with
14   respect to the jobsites that you were able to
15   remember, that these were accounts, basically,
16   that your father had where you or your father
17   primarily was the man in charge of maintaining the
18   equipment associated with those companies.  Is
19   that accurate?
20       A. That is accurate.
21       Q. Okay.  So if you were to install a new
22   valve or a new pump, did you ever come back to
23   those jobsites to perform work on those products
24   thereafter?
0159
 1       A. Yes.
 2       Q. Okay.  And would that be what -- one of
 3   the scenarios where maybe you did know the
 4   maintenance history on those products?
 5       A. Yes.
 6          MR. BECERRA:  I think those are all the
 7   questions that I have, Mr. Morton.  Thank you
 8   again.
 9          MR. HOOVER:  Just real quick.
10               FURTHER EXAMINATION
11   BY MR. HOOVER:
12       Q. Just for clarification, you were asked a
13   few moments ago -- Mark Hoover again -- whether or
14   not you knew if the sheetrock and the joint
15   compound that you worked with on the family home
16   and in your home, whether or not that contained
17   asbestos, and your answer was no.
18          And I just want to make sure, for
19   clarification purposes, when you said that, you
20   meant no, you don't know one way or the other.  Is
21   that fair to say?
22       A. That's correct.
23       Q. Okay.  Just wanted to clarify.
24          MR. HOOVER:  Thank you, sir.
0160
 1          MR. SIMONS:  One quick one.
 2               FURTHER EXAMINATION
 3   BY MR. SIMONS:
 4       Q. Just a moment ago you were asked by
 5   Mr. Becerra whether your dad basically had
 6   accounts and would be responsible for doing the
 7   maintenance work at the various jobsites.
 8   Correct?
 9       A. Correct.
10       Q. And sir, you worked on a part-time basis
11   for your father.  Correct?
12       A. That's correct.
13       Q. And sir, is it fair to say that there may
14   have been occasions where your father went back to
15   a jobsite, did some work without you?
16       A. That's correct.
17       Q. And so is it, then, fair to say that you
18   wouldn't necessarily know if --
19       A. That's correct.
20       Q. Hold on.  I appreciate that, but hold on.
21          MR. BECERRA:  Let him finish.  We're
22   almost done.
23       A. I'm sorry.
24       Q. So it would be fair to say that since your
0161
 1   dad did work without you, you wouldn't know on any
 2   particular jobsite whether by the time you went
 3   back with him, whether any components in any Crane
 4   Co. pump or valve were original to the valve -- to
 5   the product.  Correct?
 6          MR. BECERRA:  Objection to form.
 7       A. Correct.
 8          MR. SIMONS:  Thank you so much.  I
 9   appreciate your time.
10          MR. HOOVER:  Anyone on the phone?
11          MR. BECERRA:  I'm done.
12          THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 1:02 p.m.
13   We are going off the video record.  This concludes
14   Media Unit 2 and the deposition.

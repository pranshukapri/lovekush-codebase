          15   BY MS. SEREDA

          16   Q.     Good afternoon, Ms. Thomas.  My name

          17   is Devon Sereda.  I represent the defendant

          18   in this matter.

          19          Have you ever had your deposition

          20   taken before?

          21   A.     Yes, I have.

          22   Q.     You're familiar with the process, but

          23   I'm just going to go over some rules because

          24   I'm guessing that deposition was not

                                                            6



           1   yesterday.

           2   A.     No.

           3   Q.     We have a court reporter that's

           4   sitting between us.  Everything that you and

           5   I say is being taken down by her.  For that

           6   reason, it's important that all your

           7   responses be verbal.  It's easy in everyday

           8   conversation to nod, shrug your shoulders,

           9   say uh-uh or uh-huh, but that won't make a

          10   clear record.  If you do that, I'm going to

          11   give you a quick reminder we need a verbal

          12   response, okay?

          13   A.     Okay.

          14   Q.     It's also easy in everyday

          15   conversation to anticipate where my next

          16   question is going and start to talk before I

          17   finish my question, but that makes her job

          18   harder.  Try to make sure I finish my

          19   question before you start your answer.  If

          20   for any reason I cut off your answer and

          21   started my next question, let me know so we

          22   can get your full answer on the record.

          23   A.     Okay.

          24   Q.     I'm sure your attorney has advised you

                                                            7



           1   of this, but we don't want you to guess at

           2   any answers today.  If you don't know the

           3   answer to my question or you don't remember

           4   the answer to my question, those are

           5   perfectly acceptable responses as long as

           6   they are the truth, okay?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     There may be questions that I ask you

           9   to estimate time or distance.  Once again, we

          10   don't want you to guess.  But if you feel

          11   like you're able to make an estimate, go

          12   ahead and do so.  Just let me know that

          13   you're making an estimate, okay?

          14   A.     All right, yes.

          15   Q.     I don't typically take very long with

          16   depositions, but if at any point you need to

          17   take a break, use the restroom, speak with

          18   your attorney, whatever it may be, I'd be

          19   happy to give you that time.  I just ask, if

          20   there is a question pending, we take that

          21   break after the question is answered, okay?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     If I ask a question that you don't

          24   understand, please let me know.  Because if

                                                            8



           1   you answer it, I'm going to assume you

           2   understood it.  If any part of my question

           3   seems unclear, let me know.  I'll be happy to

           4   rephrase it so that it is clear, okay?

           5   A.     Okay, yes.

           6   Q.     Do you have any questions about those

           7   instructions?

           8   A.     No, I do not.

           9   Q.     Are you under the influence of

          10   anything; drugs, alcohol, medication, lack of

          11   sleep, anything that would prevent you from

          12   being able to understand and answer my

          13   questions truthfully and accurately today?

          14   A.     No, I'm not.

          15   Q.     Ready to begin?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     Can you give me your full name.

          18   A.     Gilda Lee Thomas.

          19   Q.     What's your date of birth?

          20   A.     1/15/67.

          21   Q.     We're going to go off the record for

          22   this.

           1   Q.     Is there a particular provider you go

           2   to see?

           3   A.     Well, I just saw her, Alexis Waters.

          10   years.

          11   Q.     Who did you see before you saw Alexis

          12   Waters?

          13   A.     He just graduated.  Before him, I

          14   remember she was my favorite doctor,

          15   Dr. Danielle Dang, but her replacement was

          16   very short.  I can't think of his name now.

           1   Q.     Was the vehicle on, or was it off?

           2   A.     It was off.

          10   of the accident?

          11   A.     My boyfriend's vehicle, Joseph

          12   Woodlyn.

          13   Q.     Describe for me what happened.

          14   A.     Well, the car was parked.  I was

          15   siting in the passenger seat.  I was on my

          16   Kindle.  I was reading a book on my Kindle,

          17   just sitting there relaxing.

          18          All of a sudden I heard tires and then

          19   this bang, this really hard bang.  I went

          20   flying forward, and my Kindle came out of my

          21   hands and hit the dashboard.  I hit the dash.

          22          Then for a second time the same thing

          23   happened again, not even 30 seconds the exact

          24   same thing happened again before I could even

                                                           16



           1   adjust myself.  I went forward and hit the

           2   front.  Now, I'm still jostled, so I hit the

           3   side, the right side, on second impact.  My

           4   Kindle cracked.  I also have it with me, too.

           5   Q.     You hit the dashboard again.

           6          What body part struck the dashboard?

           7   A.     I hit my chest, and the Kindle hit the

           8   dashboard, also.

           9   Q.     Then you said you hit the right side?

          10   A.     Yes.  On second impact, I hit the

          11   right door panel, like the door panel went

          12   right into my side and my hip.

          13   Q.     You said your Kindle got a crack in

          14   it?

          15   A.     Yes, I have it.  It's totally broken.

          16   Q.     Can I take a photograph of it?  Would

          17   that be okay?

          18   A.     Sure.  I also brought my receipt

          19   because it was actually only a few month's

          20   old.

          21   Q.     You said there was less than 30

          22   seconds between the two impacts?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     What happened after the second impact?

                                                           17



           1   A.     I was pretty much so shocked and

           2   startled.  I opened the car door.  When I

           3   opened the car door, the lights came on in

           4   the car.  The driver, by that time, his car

           5   was fully parked.

           6          He saw me get out, and he started

           7   yelling at me because I guess he didn't

           8   realize there was someone in the car because

           9   it was dark.  When I opened the door, the

          10   lights came on.

          11          I got out.  I kept saying, sir, sir,

          12   sir.  He started yelling at me, using

          13   profanity.  He was yelling in Spanish, which

          14   I presume it was profanity because it was not

          15   very nice.

          16          At that point, I got back in the car

          17   because I was really upset and in pain.  I

          18   called my boyfriend, which he was around the

          19   corner at the barbershop.  That's the reason

          20   why I was sitting in the car.  He was in the

          21   barbershop getting a haircut.

          22          I called him and told him what

          23   happened.  He came and the gentleman

          24   continued to -- he got more irate and started

                                                           18



           1   yelling.  He was also intoxicated.

           2   Q.     How do you know he was intoxicated?

           3   A.     He had a beer can in his hand, and he

           4   had some other people with him that were very

           5   rowdy.  They were going to a house that was

           6   two houses from where we were parked.  There

           7   was a lot of people outside.

           8   Q.     When you say he had other people with

           9   him, other people that had been in the

          10   vehicle with him or just other people that

          11   were around the vehicle?

          12   A.     They were coming to the vehicle

          13   because he was going to a house on that

          14   street.  They saw what happened, I guess, or

          15   they heard it.

          16   Q.     You don't know if they were actually

          17   in his vehicle?

          18   A.     No, I do not.

          19   Q.     Did they also seem to have alcohol or

          20   were holding alcohol?

          21   A.     They were very rowdy.

          22   Q.     You said they were going to a house

          23   party?

          24   A.     I don't know if it was a party or

                                                           19



           1   anything, but there was a lot of people

           2   sitting on the steps at the house where the

           3   gentleman was heading.

           4   Q.     Are you aware of any witnesses that

           5   came up to you and said, hey, here is my

           6   name, my information, I saw this accident

           7   occur?

           8   A.     No one did that.  No, they were too

           9   busy yelling.  The people that he was with

          10   were yelling at me.

          11   Q.     Were any of them speaking English as

          12   they were yelling at you?

          13   A.     No, not really.  I only heard Spanish,

          14   but I think someone was speaking English,

          15   too.  It was so loud.  I couldn't discern

          16   between the two.

          17   Q.     You said your boyfriend came to the

          18   scene?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Did your boyfriend speak to the driver

          21   of the other vehicle?

          22   A.     Yes, he tried to speak to him, but the

          23   gentleman was getting very belligerent.  I

          24   told my boyfriend just wait for the police to

                                                           20



           1   come because I didn't want -- it was just the

           2   two of us, and it was a lot of whatever was

           3   going on there.  I didn't want anything bad

           4   to happen.

           5   Q.     Where are you located at this point?

           6   A.     I got back in the car.  I sat down

           7   because I was in pain.  He just was asking me

           8   was I okay and for me to calm down.

           9   Q.     Did your boyfriend call the police, or

          10   did you call the police?

          11   A.     I called and he called.

          12   Q.     Did you have a cell phone in the

          13   vehicle with you?

          14   A.     Yes, I did.

          15   Q.     Did the police come to the scene?

          16   A.     A very long time.

          17   Q.     How long did it take them?

          18   A.     Maybe 45 minutes.  It got to the point

          19   where he tried to go flag a police officer

          20   down.

          21   Q.     Your boyfriend did?

          22   A.     Yes, on Chestnut Street.

          23   Q.     What about the driver of the other

          24   vehicle, where was he at this point while

                                                           21



           1   you're waiting for the police?

           2   A.     Still yelling over at the house

           3   wherever he had went to.  It was like two

           4   spaces from where we were parked.

           5   Q.     He was at the house, sort of outside?

           6   A.     Yes, outside, pacing back and

           7   forwards, yelling to his self and back and

           8   forth.

           9   Q.     When the police arrived, was he still

          10   doing that?

          11   A.     I was in the car with the door shut at

          12   that point.

          13   Q.     Did the police speak to him?

          14   A.     Yes, I believe they did, and they came

          15   and tapped on the window and talked to me.

          16   Q.     Did they tell you anything about their

                                                           22

           6   need an ambulance, no.

           7   Q.     You said that you were feeling pain,

          20   Q.     How about activities that you're still

          21   doing, but you're doing with some sort of

           9   park?  Where would you walk?

          10   A.     In the park.  Actually, there is one

          11   thing.  I had a gym membership, and I had to

          12   put the gym membership on hold.  Then I

          13   totally cancelled it.  Actually, it's in

          14   their notes, LA Fitness, because I was

          15   continuing to pay them every single month for

          16   the last two years.  I finally wised up and

          17   stopped paying them because it was put on

          18   hold ever since that.

          22   before the accident?

           1   pool, and the water exercise, pool exercise.

           2   Q.     Did you go to classes, or would you do

           3   pool exercises on your own?

           4   A.     On my own.

           5   Q.     Did any of your treating doctors tell

           6   you not to do that activity after the

           7   accident?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Who was that?

          10   A.     My primary, and also the doctor at

          11   Gentle Health and Wellness told me I couldn't

          12   go back there.

          13   Q.     You said you used to walk for exercise

          14   three times a week, a couple blocks, would

          15   walk in a park.

          16          Do you still walk at all for exercise?

          17   A.     Very little because my hip starts to

          18   hurt and my high.

          19   Q.     How long can you walk before your hip

          20   starts to hurt?

          21   A.     Maybe two blocks.

          22   Q.     How often are you doing it now?

          23   A.     Very infrequent.  Maybe once a week,

          24   if that.

           2   affected or changed?

           3   A.     That's about it.  I do my housework.

           4   Actually, going up and down the stairs.  I

           5   kind of decide if I'm going to be upstairs or

           6   downstairs, whatever I'm going to do for the

           7   next couple hours.  I don't make a practice

           8   of going up and down the steps.  I kind of

           9   settle in place either upstairs or

          10   downstairs.

          11   Q.     Stairs, walking, gym membership,

          13   or been altered?

          14   A.     No, not really.

          15   Q.     If you think of something else as

          16   we're going along, just let me know, okay?

          17   A.     Okay.

           8   Q.     Right leg?  Left leg?

           9   A.     Left.  It wasn't my leg.  It was my

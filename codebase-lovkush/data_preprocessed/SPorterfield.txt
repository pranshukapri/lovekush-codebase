               1             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  We're on

               2  record.

               3               JOHN SCOTT PORTERFIELD,

               4             WHO, BEING FIRST DULY SWORN,

               5                 TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  As we have done in

               7  previous depositions, we have raised an issue,

               8  objection to the testimony about the relevance of

               9  patient information.  And to the extent that

              10  patients are identified here, we'd ask that they

              11  be identified by initials only.

              12             MS. SILVERS:  I would join in that

              13  objection.  And for the record, I'm Kyle Silvers

              14  representing Mr. Porterfield.

              15                     EXAMINATION

              16  BY MR. ARCHINACO:

              17          Q.   Mr. Porterfield, could you state

              18  your full name for the record, please?

              19          A.   John Scott Porterfield.

              20          Q.   And are you currently employed,

              21  or have you retired?

              22          A.   I'm semi-retired.  I have a

              23  company that does practice management, and

              24  occasionally I get a call to do something, but

              25  it hasn't happened in a while.



                                                                5


               1          Q.   So you're moving into retirement?

               2          A.   Pretty much.

               3          Q.   Fair enough.

               4             The events that we'll be talking

               5  about today occurred during time periods when

               6  I believe you were employed by the Toledo

               7  Clinic, Inc.

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   And how long were you employed at

              10  Toledo Clinic, Inc.?

              11          A.   I -- I was employed from

              12  October 28, 2010 until December 15th, 2015.

              13          Q.   And when you left Toledo Clinic,

              14  that was when you went to basically

              15  transitioning to semi-retirement?

              16          A.   I did some consulting for a

              17  couple of years, and then I didn't, so ....

              18          Q.   Was your departure amicable?

              19          A.   I wouldn't say that.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Well, we'll get to that

              21  later then.  I'm going to try to go through --

              22          A.   Okay.

              23          Q.   -- things in chronological order

              24  for you.

              25          A.   Sure.



                                                                6


               1          Q.   Can you just give me a little,

               2  some background in terms of your educational

               3  background and training?

               4          A.   I have a graduate degree in

               5  public administration.  I trained to be a city

               6  manager, but I spent 45 years in healthcare,

               7  and that's how that goes.  I have worked

               8  overseas in healthcare, I worked for

               9  University Hospitals of Cleveland, in the

              10  early '80s.  I was kind of their ambulatory

              11  services guy, outpatient guy.  And I moved,

              12  relocated to Sylvania in 1988, and got a

              13  position as a VP at Flower in physician

              14  services.

              15             I've spent all my adult life

              16  working on the physician side of the equation,

              17  usually with the hospitals.  And then, you

              18  know, I -- we merged, that's the wrong word,

              19  but we merged with The Toledo Hospital in

              20  January of '96.  And then three years later,

              21  they -- I moved to work for a company owned by

              22  St. Luke's called Providers Solutions.  I

              23  worked there for about three years.  They

              24  decided to close the company, and I bought it.

              25  And that was a really good -- that was a -- it



                                                                7


               1  still is a good company, it's just not the

               2  size it -- 2008 kind of wiped everybody out.

               3  And my clients were all physicians, and they

               4  started baling to hospital systems, because

               5  there is just -- it's safer there, so they

               6  thought.

               7             And then I was approached by the

               8  president of the clinic around 2010 to apply

               9  for the administrator job at the clinic, and I

              10  did, and I got it.  And so that's what I did

              11  for that stretch of five years.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Let me go through some

              13  general back -- have you ever given a

              14  deposition before?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   Okay.  What type of case?

              17          A.   Medical.

              18          Q.   Malpractice type matters or -- or

              19  business?

              20          A.   One was -- I can't really recall.

              21  One was angry physicians, and you know, suing

              22  his former employer.

              23          Q.   Got it.  I'm going to go through

              24  basic ground rules.  There is a videographer,

              25  but the court reporter is the official



                                                                8


               1  transcript, so the formatting is question,

               2  then potential objection from your counsel, or

               3  Mr. Wiencek.  Give them a chance to make an

               4  objection.  If they're making an objection,

               5  let them finish it.  Normally, you can answer

               6  the question after objections are made, unless

               7  your counsel directs you not to answer a

               8  question.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   So normally you'll answer, even

              11  if there is an objection, relevance, whatever.

              12             But try to keep it in that format.

              13  You and I will probably get a little

              14  colloquial.  My client says you're an easy guy

              15  to speak to, so we might get a little

              16  colloquial.  And when that happens, we start

              17  talking over one another, even if we're not

              18  trying to insult each other.  It becomes more

              19  conversational.  The court reporter has a

              20  difficult time.  She'll throw her hands in the

              21  air and tell us not to, so we'll try to keep

              22  that idea in mind of question, give the

              23  opportunity for the objection, then answer.

              24             If you answer a question, I'll

              25  assume you both heard and understood it.  And



                                                                9


               1  if for some reason so you don't hear or

               2  understand a question, please let me know.

               3             And then the last thing is to keep

               4  your answers audible.  Some people get into

               5  nods and shakes of the head, and have to be

               6  reminded, but as long as you keep your answers

               7  audible, we're fine.  So those are the basic

               8  rules.

               9             You also have attorney-client

              10  privilege.  Even though you're a former

              11  employee, during periods in time that you were

              12  employed there, and there is other parameters,

              13  you have an attorney representing you today,

              14  so I'm not trying to inquire about privilege

              15  matters, or your actual conversations with

              16  counsel today.  I'm just trying to seek your

              17  independent information.  Fair?

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   Okay.  In terms of -- where did

              20  you graduate from college?

              21          A.   Western Michigan University.

              22          Q.   And so going back a second, just

              23  to go back, when you said 2008 wiped everyone

              24  out, what were you speaking about?

              25          A.   Well, you know, the stock market,



                                                               10


               1  the banks, it was a big push, and it just, you

               2  know, in small business, there is the quick

               3  and the dead.  That's about it.  So I survived

               4  it, but I lost about probably 60 percent of my

               5  clients right away.  And so I had to downsize

               6  and keep moving, and I mean, a little bit of

               7  downsizing, a smaller space, and it got harder

               8  to make a living.

               9          Q.   And when you said you worked on

              10  -- and I just want to hit on one other point,

              11  in terms of a trend, I think you were pointing

              12  out, which was that physicians at one time

              13  were more independent groups, and then there

              14  was a flight or movement towards hospitals.

              15  Is that right?

              16          A.   That's my opinion.

              17          Q.   When -- when did you start

              18  noticing that?

              19          A.   About two -- well, in Toledo,

              20  it's been cyclical over the years.  It

              21  literally has.  Because in the early '90s,

              22  ProMedica and Mercy started employing

              23  physicians.  And then they -- they went back

              24  and forth.  I worked for Flower Hospital.  We

              25  employed them, but we didn't have as many as



                                                               11


               1  those two groups, and we didn't build medical

               2  office buildings like they did.  We rented

               3  space.  And my physicians were happier than

               4  the ones working for the other system.

               5             We didn't have a noncompete,

               6  because I didn't believe in them, so my guys

               7  could go anywhere they wanted.  And the model

               8  worked really well.

               9          Q.   And you saw -- did you also see

              10  sort of a movement towards the large medical

              11  institutions acquiring or becoming -- strike

              12  that.

              13             Did you also see the fact that a

              14  ProMedica and Mercy, for example, each have

              15  their own insurance programs, or programs that

              16  would direct clients to them?

              17          A.   I believe ProMedica had

              18  Paramount.  I'm not sure whether Mercy had

              19  their own insurance plan or not.

              20          Q.   ProMedica basically created like

              21  a captive insurance, so to say?

              22          A.   They did.

              23          Q.   And then so when they did that,

              24  when patients would be ProMedica-insured

              25  patients, typically, those patients, just to



                                                               12


               1  your knowledge, would be referred to ProMedica

               2  institutions?

               3          A.   The thing -- and not in all

               4  cases, because not everybody has all the

               5  specialists.  And they have to cut pieces out,

               6  so that if the doctor, or the patient really

               7  needed to go someplace, it would happen.  But

               8  that was the goal, was to capture market

               9  share, in my opinion.

              10          Q.   Okay.  So basically what you have

              11  seen -- well, you saw, although it was

              12  cyclical with doctors, you have seen, or saw

              13  in the industry, where the large medical

              14  institutions started to employ physicians, as

              15  opposed to where they used to be --

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   -- more independent groups?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19             MS. SILVERS:  Let him finish.  Let

              20  him finish.

              21          Q.   (By Mr.  Archinaco) And then

              22  insurance, also, is sometimes is part of that,

              23  like with ProMedica.  Not necessarily always,

              24  but sometimes you see an instance where a

              25  hospital also will have their own captive



                                                               13


               1  insurance to help refer?

               2          A.   In the Toledo market, I would say

               3  yes.

               4          Q.   Okay.  And I'm not asking you for

               5  anything else.  I mean, I -- I do work in

               6  Pittsburgh.  I could tell you all about UPMC

               7  and all kinds of stuff there, but that's not

               8  for you to worry about today.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   The next -- the next exhibit we

              11  have, I'm going to mark your affidavit.  I'm

              12  not going to ask a lot of questions about it

              13  right now.  We'll come back to it, but you

              14  signed an affidavit in this case.  We'll mark

              15  this as Exhibit 115, and I have copies for

              16  counsel.

              17             MS. SILVERS:  Thank you.

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  You're welcome.

              19             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 115

              20  was marked for identification.)

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Does this

              22  appear to be an affidavit that you signed?

              23          A.   It does.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Now, a couple of

              25  questions.  Are you -- are you -- you're not



                                                               14


               1  an attorney, are you?

               2          A.   No.

               3          Q.   Okay.  People laugh.  Sometimes

               4  people are happy they're not attorneys.

               5             What -- what do you recall about

               6  the circumstances surrounding how this

               7  affidavit came to be?

               8             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.  May be

               9  protected by privilege, but you can answer.

              10          A.   I thought it was just part of

              11  this process that has gotten me to this table

              12  today.  I was supposed to sign a document, and

              13  which I did, to the best of my knowledge, that

              14  these are the things that happened, so that's

              15  what I did.

              16          Q.   Well, do you know who prepared

              17  this document?

              18             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, privilege.

              19  You may answer.

              20          A.   I'm -- I guess I don't know who

              21  prepared it.

              22          Q.   Okay.  What involvement did you

              23  have, if any, in the language that was

              24  selected or put --

              25          A.   None.



                                                               15


               1          Q.   -- into the affidavit?

               2             So you were just simply asked to

               3  sign it, essentially?

               4          A.   Well, I was asked to read it, and

               5  you know, if I thought the -- I objected to

               6  anything, I could state so at that time, and

               7  then I signed it.

               8          Q.   Did you have any emails with

               9  people?  I'm not asking you to disclose

              10  content right now with anyone.  Did you have

              11  any emails forwarded back and forth, whether

              12  between your attorneys, or with Mr. Wiencek

              13  from Mercy, about this affidavit?

              14             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, privilege.

              15  For the record, I would state that any emails

              16  pertaining to this affidavit were solely

              17  between my client and myself.  You may answer.

              18             THE WITNESS:  I may answer?

              19             MS. SILVERS:  You may.

              20          A.   I corresponded with my attorney.

              21          Q.   Only your attorney?

              22          A.   Only my attorney.

              23          Q.   Okay.  And so you don't know

              24  where your attorney got the affidavit?

              25             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.



                                                               16


               1          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Or whether she

               2  prepared it?

               3          A.   I do -- I don't know.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Were you shown any

               5  documents before you signed it?

               6          A.   On this?

               7          Q.   Before you signed the affidavit?

               8          A.   No, I don't believe I -- I don't

               9  believe so.

              10          Q.   Like any of your old emails or

              11  anything like that?

              12          A.   I didn't get copies of the old

              13  emails until, like, I think last week.  I

              14  don't have access to the Toledo Clinic emails.

              15  That's where all that stuff is.

              16          Q.   No.  And I, and Mr. Porterfield,

              17  there is no -- there is no accusation being

              18  directed at you in any way.  Just asking for

              19  informational --

              20          A.   Okay.

              21          Q.   -- purposes about what you saw,

              22  what you didn't see, when you had it, because

              23  it puts it in perspective --

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   -- when you signed things.



                                                               17


               1             So very recently you saw -- you

               2  didn't have access -- strike that.

               3             You did not have access to

               4  Toledo Clinic's emails, because you don't work

               5  there anymore, correct?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   Okay.  And that's, you know,

               8  there is an attorney involved in this process

               9  and has been involved for Toledo Clinic,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   For the Toledo Clinic?

              12          Q.   Yes.

              13          A.   I'm not aware of what the Toledo

              14  Clinic is doing in this matter.

              15          Q.   Okay.  So you have personal

              16  counsel here today?

              17          A.   I do.

              18          Q.   All right.  And where did you

              19  obtain these doc -- you just obtained emails

              20  or documents recently in the last week or so?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Where did you obtain those

              23  from?

              24          A.   My attorney.

              25          Q.   And what were those documents?  I



                                                               18


               1  don't want to know about conversations with

               2  your attorney.  I'm not entitled to know them,

               3  what you talked about.

               4          A.   They were copies --

               5             MS. SILVERS:  Limited objection as

               6  to privilege, but you may answer the question

               7  as presented.

               8          A.   They were copies, not all mine,

               9  but they were copies of emails that went back

              10  and forth from the time Dr. Holland arrived,

              11  and it was like 59 pages worth of stuff.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Did you retain a copy of

              13  that that we could have a copy of?

              14          A.   With me here?

              15          Q.   No.  Did you retain a copy of

              16  those 59 pages?

              17          A.   I don't have it with me.

              18          Q.   Okay.  It's fair enough that you

              19  don't have it.  The question is just whether

              20  you have it.

              21          A.   I received it from my attorney.

              22          Q.   Okay.  So we will make a request

              23  for those, those documents to review.

              24             MS. SILVERS:  And I will object on

              25  the basis of privilege, but we'll provide.



                                                               19


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Okay.  Thank you.

               2  And I don't know if it's easier to do it

               3  today.  We can talk during a break about how

               4  to handle it.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco)

               6  Mr. Porterfield, I'm going to show you some

               7  documents we've already marked in this case,

               8  and some emails and things, and some that we

               9  haven't marked yet.  Some of them may be ones

              10  that you have seen or not, so I'll just ask

              11  that as we go along, and if it is one that was

              12  one of your 59, you know, please let me know,

              13  as we go through it.

              14             The first one I'd like to direct

              15  you to is Exhibit 24, which is -- should be in

              16  the binder in front of you.

              17          A.   Binder one or two?

              18          Q.   Should be in binder one, I

              19  believe.

              20          A.   And it's numbered by the column?

              21             MS. SILVERS:  Yes.

              22             MR. ARCHINACO:  Yes.

              23             MS. SILVERS:  And you said 24,

              24  correct?

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Yes, 24.



                                                               20


               1          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And also, when

               2  I ask you to look at a document, you're

               3  welcome to take -- you know, you're welcome to

               4  take time to look at it and review it.  This

               5  isn't, you know?

               6          A.   Okay.  Okay.

               7          Q.   All right.  Have you had a chance

               8  to review Exhibit 24?

               9          A.   Yes.  It's -- to be honest, it's

              10  a pretty standard email that most every

              11  employed physician at the clinic would have

              12  gotten from me, or Dr. Elliott, because it

              13  just covers how -- how it works.

              14          Q.   All right.  So this is

              15  December 19th, 2012, is an email from you to

              16  Dr. Holland, with a cc to Thomas Arquilla and

              17  also Tom Leeds, correct?

              18          A.   Correct, right.

              19          Q.   Now, just to go back a second.

              20  One of the reasons I gave this up front, I'm

              21  going to try to use exhibits to kind of anchor

              22  thought processes in your head about time

              23  periods.

              24             Were you involved in recruiting

              25  Dr. Holland?



                                                               21


               1          A.   The way the recruitment -- I can

               2  only speak to the clinic side of this

               3  equation.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Please.

               5          A.   It was driven by the, in this

               6  case, by the cardiology -- cardiology division

               7  of the Toledo Clinic.  They had -- well, in

               8  the '90s, they had pretty strong

               9  cardiothoracic coverage, and then they didn't.

              10  And they just -- and, you know, the clinic

              11  tries very hard to straddle the fence between

              12  the health systems in town.

              13          Q.   Uh-huh.

              14          A.   And they're pretty good at it,

              15  but the cardiology -- cardiology department

              16  decided they wanted to recruit a

              17  cardiothoracic surgeon.  And Tom Leeds is

              18  their recruiter.  And you know, that's -- we

              19  went fishing for cardiothoracic surgeons, but

              20  Mercy was the lead on that, and -- and I

              21  believe we -- we got two.  We got

              22  Dr. Holland, and a guy, I think his name is

              23  Mundinger, but he -- he didn't -- he didn't

              24  stay long.  He was -- he was -- anyway, he did

              25  not -- he was not a serious competitor.  He



                                                               22


               1  wasn't interested really.

               2          Q.   Okay.  All right.  So first of

               3  all, just to cover one thing you said, you

               4  indicated Mercy was the lead in terms of the

               5  advertising; is that right?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   Why -- why was Mercy the lead, as

               8  opposed to Toledo Clinic, to your knowledge?

               9          A.   To my knowledge?

              10          Q.   Yes.

              11          A.   Well, we were trying to, as I

              12  said before, partner with everybody

              13  successfully.  You know, we -- we tried to do

              14  it with ProMedica.  Had a huge agreement with

              15  them.  It never worked out.  And ProMedica was

              16  shutting the physicians out of their

              17  hospitals, slowly, but surely, okay?  And

              18  Mercy was interested, and we -- I'm speaking

              19  with my clinic -- that was interested in

              20  seeing what we could do together, okay?  So

              21  they -- excuse me.  They have a budget for

              22  physician recruitment.  I don't have one at

              23  the clinic.  I mean, we did it on occasion,

              24  but normally it was just doctors showing up,

              25  who wanted to join the clinic, so there were



                                                               23


               1  no recruitment fees involved.

               2          Q.   Okay.  So Mercy, was it your

               3  understanding, Mercy needed a cardiothoracic

               4  surgeon?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.  Misstates

               6  the record.

               7             MS. SILVERS:  Join.

               8          A.   I can't answer that as because

               9  I'm looking at it through the lens of the

              10  clinic.  They're the ones that came to the

              11  board meeting and said we'd like to, our board

              12  meeting, we'd like to recruit a cardiothoracic

              13  surgeon, and let's see who we can get help us.

              14          Q.   Who came to the board meeting and

              15  --

              16          A.   Would be Dr. Nahhas.

              17          Q.   Okay.

              18          A.   Who is kind of the head of the

              19  cardiology department.

              20          Q.   Did you have -- well, as of

              21  today, do you still have -- strike that.

              22             Did you have a good relationship

              23  with Dr. Nahhas --

              24          A.   Yeah.

              25          Q.   -- overall?



                                                               24


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   Do you think you still do, as you

               3  sit here today?

               4          A.   He friended me on Facebook.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Did you have an

               6  opportunity, though, that because of what

               7  ProMedica was doing in terms of shutting

               8  people out, that there was a problem or an

               9  issue that was developing at Mercy with regard

              10  to cardiothoracic surgery coverage?

              11          A.   I actually just -- I was not well

              12  versed with what was going on at Mercy per se.

              13  Okay?  This was a new, you know, we had been a

              14  Flower Hospital clinic for years.  That's

              15  where, you know, 30 years ago, it was run by

              16  Toledo Clinic physicians.  And then they

              17  acquired the hospital in '96, and just started

              18  -- they wanted to own the Toledo Clinic, and

              19  they're independent.  They're all independent

              20  doctors, if you will.  They're

              21  entrepreneurial, that's where they want to be.

              22  They don't want to be owned by a hospital

              23  system.  So that's the model.  It's a --

              24  they're cash basis, they're for profit,

              25  they're good doctors, but they're very



                                                               25


               1  independent.  And I believe we were just

               2  getting our toe in the water to see what, if

               3  anything, we could do with Mercy.  But driving

               4  it was this trouble with ProMedica, because

               5  they were causing a lot of trouble for us.

               6          Q.   Okay.  So -- well, just to -- to

               7  put it in perspective, the Toledo Clinic was

               8  independent and had a group of cardiologists

               9  employed there, correct?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And then there is also an entity

              12  called TCI, which was a competitor of Toledo

              13  Clinic, that was run by Dr. Kabour.  Do you

              14  know that group?  I'm sorry, TCC.  TCC, do you

              15  know who Dr. Kabour is?

              16          A.   Of course I do.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Do you know Dr. Kabour had

              18  his own group of independent physicians?

              19          A.   I see him on TV every Sunday.

              20          Q.   Okay.  He has a television show,

              21  correct?

              22          A.   Yeah.  I was his patient.  Point

              23  of disclosure.

              24          Q.   The -- fair enough.  Fair enough.

              25  And Dr. Kabour said -- well, anyway.



                                                               26


               1             We deposed Dr. Kabour.  We had him

               2  in here.  And well, tell me about that.  As

               3  you sit here today, do you have any ill will

               4  or animosity toward my client?

               5          A.   None whatsoever.

               6          Q.   Dr. Kabour had indicated a

               7  willingness to actually sit down and have

               8  dinner with my client.  And if such a dinner

               9  would occur, and you were invited, would you

              10  attend as well?

              11             MS. SILVERS:  Objection to the form

              12  of the question, but you may answer.

              13          A.   I believe there was such a dinner

              14  planned, but I believe Dr. Holland and I

              15  talked about it.  He was going to take his

              16  wife.  I believe Dr. Kabour was supposed to

              17  show up with his wife.  And I thought we were

              18  better served by letting that happen, because

              19  doctor to doctor is the way it works best, in

              20  my view of the world.  And evidently, I don't

              21  know the outcome, quite frankly.  It's been a

              22  while.

              23          Q.   Okay.  We'll come to that in a

              24  second.  All right.  Now, coming back to the

              25  recruitment issue.  On the email I showed you,



                                                               27


               1  Tom Leeds is on that email.  And do you know

               2  who Mr. Leeds was?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   And who was Mr. Leeds?

               5          A.   He's the longtime physician

               6  recruiter for the Mercy system in Toledo.

               7          Q.   Okay.

               8          A.   He's very good at what he does.

               9          Q.   And Mr. Thomas Arquilla, do you

              10  know who he was?

              11          A.   I do.

              12          Q.   And who is Mr. Arquilla?

              13          A.   Well, he had many changing hats

              14  while he was there, but he was second in

              15  command, I believe, for the -- the Mercy

              16  system in Toledo, you know, up through

              17  Dr. Andrabi.

              18          Q.   So he was sort of, in your

              19  viewpoint, Dr. Andrabi's right-hand man?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Did you know about Mr. Arquilla's

              22  involvement with, or strike that.  Did you

              23  ever hear the name Adam Middleton before?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   And how did you hear that name?



                                                               28


               1          A.   Well, Adam Middleton is a

               2  consultant, as I understand it, and occupied

               3  my boardroom for about two months one time

               4  working on a project for the oncology group,

               5  the Toledo Clinic oncology group, and that's

               6  where I first met him.  He took no orders from

               7  me.  He wasn't paid by me.  He was just taking

               8  up space in my boardroom.

               9          Q.   Did you ever have any knowledge

              10  of any investigations he conducted for Mercy?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   Or at Mercy's request?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Did Thomas Arquilla ever advise

              15  you, or disclose to you, what his relationship

              16  was with Mr. Middleton?

              17          A.   I -- he did.  And in -- in way of

              18  introducing me to him.  He says he's going to

              19  help us crunch some numbers for the oncology

              20  group.  I used him before in my former life in

              21  Dayton, and that was the extent of it.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Did Mr. Arquilla ever tell

              23  you that he had employed or would you --

              24  strike that.

              25             Did Mr. Arquilla ever -- strike



                                                               29


               1  that.

               2             All right.  Coming back to

               3  Exhibit 24.  And the last sentence of the

               4  second, in the main body paragraph, the last

               5  sentence, he wrote to Dr. Holland, with a cc

               6  to Mr. Arquilla and Mr. Leeds.  Your

               7  recruitment and employment are a joint

               8  endeavor with Mercy and TCI, which is why I

               9  have copied Tom Arquilla and Tom Leeds on an

              10  email to make sure we are all on the same

              11  page.

              12             Did I read that portion correctly?

              13          A.   You did, but let me tell you,

              14  that does not mean joint venture.  It doesn't.

              15          Q.   Well, I didn't say joint -- it

              16  doesn't say joint venture.

              17          A.   Yeah.

              18          Q.   It says -- let me read it again,

              19  because I'm not going to change the words.

              20  You wrote them.

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   Let's go back a second.  What you

              23  -- what you wrote to Dr. Holland, was that

              24  true on December 19th, 2012?

              25          A.   I don't think I'd rewrite it.



                                                               30


               1  What I was trying to express is that we were

               2  trying to work together on a project.  That's

               3  it.  And you know, we were trying to work on a

               4  lot of things.  I mentioned oncology, but we

               5  were just getting our toe in the water on all

               6  this stuff.  I mean, historically, the clinic

               7  just didn't do much.  They didn't do much with

               8  the -- with the medical school, and they

               9  didn't do much with Mercy over the years.  And

              10  that was having to change, just because of the

              11  market.

              12          Q.   Do you agree that the words I

              13  read to you are written in your email?

              14          A.   You know, this email was written

              15  in --

              16             MS. SILVERS:  Answer the question.

              17          A.   -- 2012.  Okay?  It looks like my

              18  style, but yes, it looks accurate to me.  I

              19  don't think you can change it, once you send

              20  it.

              21          Q.   Okay.  And so I'll represent to

              22  you that in any email I show you today that

              23  has your name on it, we have not done anything

              24  to alter or modify it.

              25          A.   I know that.  I know that.



                                                               31


               1          Q.   Is there some reason that you

               2  would not want to use the words today that you

               3  used at the time in December of 2012?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Is there some reason you would

               6  want to change those words?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   But you don't believe that

               9  they're actually accurate?

              10             MS. SILVERS:  Objection,

              11  mischaracterization.

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              13          A.   Is there still a question here?

              14          Q.   Yes.  It says your recruitment

              15  and employment are a joint endeavor with Mercy

              16  and TCI.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   First part.

              19             MS. SILVERS:  Continuing --

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Is that

              21  correct?

              22             MS. SILVERS:  Continuing objection.

              23  You may answer.

              24          A.   It is a -- working on a process

              25  where, you know, they could help us recruit



                                                               32


               1  physicians to join the Toledo Clinic to expand

               2  our market share.  That's what we were trying

               3  to do.

               4          Q.   Okay.  So my question was, is it

               5  a correct statement that Dr. Holland's

               6  recruitment and employment were a joint

               7  endeavor with Mercy and TCI?

               8             MS. SILVERS:  Objection to form.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) As of

              10  December 19th, 2012?

              11             MS. SILVERS:  Objection to form of

              12  the question.  You may answer, if you can.

              13          A.   I have to let the email speak for

              14  itself.

              15          Q.   Well, at the time, did you

              16  understand the words that you were using in

              17  the email?

              18          A.   Well, you know, I don't set

              19  policy.  I never set policy at the clinic.

              20  The board did.  Okay?  And so, you know, I was

              21  trying to make it clear to Dr. Holland how the

              22  malpractice -- I was trying to make it clear

              23  to the physician, a new -- a new person

              24  joining the clinic, as simple as possible what

              25  the groundwork was, and how it was going to



                                                               33


               1  work.  That's all I was trying to do.

               2          Q.   Well, do you have -- do you have

               3  some reason that you can think of today why

               4  you would have, you personally would care, if

               5  it is a true statement, that Dr. Holland's

               6  recruitment and employment are a joint

               7  endeavor with Mercy and TCI?

               8             MS. SILVERS:  Objection to the form

               9  of the question.  You may answer.

              10          A.   I don't know how to answer that.

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              12          A.   So ....

              13             MS. SILVERS:  Can you rephrase?

              14          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Okay.  Well,

              15  do you have some -- you don't have an economic

              16  interest in this case?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   In this lawsuit, right?

              19          A.   No.  I'm losing money as I sit

              20  here.

              21          Q.   Well, nobody -- you can petition

              22  congress to change the rules on the witness

              23  fees, and you know what, maybe people should

              24  listen, but let's continue.

              25             Do you have an economic interest,



                                                               34


               1  or have you been promised money from anyone?

               2          A.   Absolutely not.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Well, good.  So you have

               4  -- so why -- do you care if you're -- I mean,

               5  strike that.

               6             Do you have any reason, business

               7  reason, that you would dispute the statement

               8  that you wrote in December of 2012 that

               9  Dr. Holland's recruitment and employment were

              10  a joint endeavor with Mercy and TCI?

              11             MS. SILVERS:  Objection to the form

              12  of the question.  You may answer.

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, asked and

              14  answered as well.

              15             MS. SILVERS:  True.

              16          A.   I think I've answered that to the

              17  best of my ability.

              18          Q.   You copied Mr. Arquilla and

              19  Mr. Leeds, correct?

              20          A.   Correct.

              21          Q.   And we have not been given any

              22  responsive emails stating -- objecting.  I

              23  mean, I'll represent that to you.

              24             Do you recall ever receiving an

              25  email back from Mr. Arquilla or Mr. Leeds



                                                               35


               1  saying, you got this wrong, Scott, this is no

               2  joint recruitment and employment between Mercy

               3  and TCI?

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

               5             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  -- form and

               7  foundation.

               8             MS. SILVERS:  Join.  You may

               9  answer.

              10          A.   I -- I don't recall getting

              11  anything back from either one of those guys

              12  on this.  Okay?

              13             Now, Mr. Leeds is a full-time

              14  recruiter, that's what he does, you know?  And

              15  you tell him what you want specialty wise, and

              16  he goes out and gets them.  You know, Tom was

              17  second in command, and again, what we were

              18  trying to do was reposition ourselves, in the

              19  market, the clinic was, in the marketplace to

              20  compete better with ProMedica.  And so we were

              21  -- we were doing things with cardiothoracic

              22  surgery, through our cardiology department,

              23  and we were working on things with the

              24  oncology department, which is what Adam

              25  Middleton was doing, as far as I know.  But it



                                                               36


               1  was all kind of new stuff, because we just

               2  hadn't worked together like we had with

               3  ProMedica over the years.

               4          Q.   How many cardiothoracic surgeons

               5  did Toledo Clinic employ as of December 2012?

               6             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, relevance.

               7  Go ahead.

               8          A.   We didn't have any.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And so what type of

              10  surgical equipment did Toledo Clinic possess,

              11  as of December 2012, that would enable a

              12  cardiothoracic surgeon to perform surgeries at

              13  the Toledo Clinic?

              14             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, relevance.

              15  You may answer.

              16          A.   I believe -- I'm not qualified to

              17  answer the cardiothoracic part of that.  We

              18  obviously weren't doing cardiothoracic

              19  procedures there, because we didn't have a

              20  cardiothoracic surgeon.  Okay?

              21             To my knowledge, the, you know,

              22  Dr. Holland was employed by the Toledo Clinic.

              23  Dr. Holland was a voting member of the Toledo

              24  Clinic.  He came to the annual meetings.  He

              25  -- in -- he had the benefit structure of the



                                                               37


               1  Toledo Clinic.

               2          Q.   Why -- why would it matter at all

               3  if Dr. Holland was a joint -- jointly employed

               4  by Mercy and TCI, as opposed to just

               5  singularly employed by TCI?

               8  foundation.

               9          A.   He had an employment contract

              10  with Toledo Clinic.

              11          Q.   And I'm just wondering, I'm

              12  asking you why it matters to you, if at all,

              13  if Dr. Holland was actually, his recruitment,

              14  or strike that.

              15             If -- that his -- why would it

              16  matter to you at all if Dr. Holland's

              17  employment was actually a joint endeavor with

              18  Mercy and TCI, as opposed to just -- just

              19  employment through TCI?

              20             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, foundation

              21  and asked and answered.  You may answer.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              23          A.   He was employed by the Toledo

              24  Clinic.  We -- I'm sure it's in here

              25  someplace, his employment contract with the



                                                               38


               1  Toledo Clinic.  He did not have -- to my

               2  knowledge, he did not have an employment

               3  contract with Mercy.

               4          Q.   So what definition of the word

               5  employee are you using, to your knowledge?

               6          A.   Yeah.  It's pretty

               7  straightforward.  You get a W-2 at the end of

               8  the year.

               9          Q.   So you think if you get a W-2,

              10  that makes you an employee of one company, and

              11  you can't be an employee of another company?

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You're not a

              16  -- let me strike that.  You're not an

              17  attorney, correct?

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   Okay.  So why is it that you feel

              20  that you are capable of telling a Court, or

              21  anyone else, in an affidavit who Dr. Holland

              22  is employed by?  What do you think makes you

              23  qualified to say that?

               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               2             MS. SILVERS:  Go ahead.

               3          A.   I've done a lot of employment

               4  contracts with physicians over the years, a

               5  lot of them.  And at the clinic, they're

               6  standard fare.  One does not vary from the

               7  other.  At the time, there were 150, 175

               8  physicians there.  Their verbiage is all the

               9  same.  The dollar amount may have been

              10  different, but they're on the same model, same

              11  formula.  Dr. Holland was employed by the

              12  Toledo Clinic.

              13          Q.   So to understand this then,

              14  according to you, all the -- all of the -- all

              15  of the doctors that were employed at the

              16  Toledo Clinic had 100 percent of their

              17  salaries reimbursed by Mercy?

              18             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              19          A.   No.

              21  testimony, form, foundation.

              23             MS. SILVERS:  You may answer.

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              25          A.   This was a professional services



                                                               40


               1  agreement between the clinic, Mercy and

               2  Dr. Holland.  Okay?  But he was anchored, he

               3  was employed by the Toledo Clinic and on their

               4  benefits package, et cetera.  That's how it

               5  worked.

               6          Q.   Okay.  So who reimbursed his

               7  salary?

               8          A.   Mercy did.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Why did they do that?

              10          A.   Have to ask Mercy.

              11          Q.   Weren't you involved in the

              12  discussions?

              13          A.   I was there to learn, quite

              14  frankly.  I mean, this was the first time --

              15  this was the first professional services

              16  agreement that we had done with Mercy.  And

              17  again, it was market driven.

              18          Q.   What do you mean by that, market

              19  driven?

              20          A.   I think I've been pretty clear.

              21  We were having a terrible time with market

              22  share with ProMedica, because they -- they

              23  kind of just throw things into the market.

              24  They can outspend you.  And we were trying to,

              25  as the clinic, we didn't have that kind of



                                                               41


               1  money.  You know, we're an eat what you kill

               2  model.  That's what we did.  And to restart

               3  the cardiothoracic program, after a decade of

               4  not having one, we knew we were going to have

               5  to have some help on that.

               6          Q.   Well, okay.  So you're counting

               7  on Mercy to lend its support to restart Toledo

               8  Clinic's cardiothoracic program?

               9             MS. SILVERS:  Objection,

              10  mischaracterization.

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              12             MS. SILVERS:  You may answer.

              13          A.   This started as a request from

              14  the head of the department of cardiology in

              15  the Toledo Clinic to get a cardiothoracic

              16  surgeon.  It was not Scott's idea.  Okay?  And

              17  we, you know, ProMedica didn't want to have

              18  anything to do with it, which we knew.  And

              19  you know, we just started talking to Mercy,

              20  and they were interested.  And you know, I

              21  don't recall all of it, but we had, I think,

              22  one or two dinner meetings with, you know, the

              23  physicians from Mercy and Dr. Holland and

              24  myself, Dr. Nahhas.  I thought they went

              25  really well.



                                                               42


               1          Q.   Dr. Nahhas spoke highly of

               2  Dr. Holland, correct?

               3          A.   Yeah.  It would have been his

               4  call, as the department head, to go, no go on

               5  that, and it was full speed ahead.

               6          Q.   All right.  In terms of -- in

               7  terms of the way the services agreement was

               8  structured, do you recall who actually

               9  prepared the documentation?

              10          A.   Our attorney was involved.  It

              11  was kind of a -- we had an attorney, Mercy had

              12  an attorney.  I think we used probably

              13  Kevin Devaney to, you know, do that.  He was

              14  kind of our lead guy.  There were lots of

              15  attorneys involved.

              16          Q.   When Dr. Holland was being

              17  recruited, what, if any, negative things were

              18  you told about him?

              19          A.   I had -- I heard no negative

              20  things about him.

              21          Q.   And what type of positive things

              22  did you hear about him, while he was being

              23  recruited?

              24          A.   Well, I -- you know, I met with

              25  the -- with the Doctor in my office on



                                                               43


               1  occasion.  And he's a fallible, he's friendly,

               2  you know, he's upbeat, you know, as opposed to

               3  some of the other guys I worked with at the

               4  clinic.  And you know, mostly it was just kind

               5  of, you know, it was just small talk.  He was

               6  moving to a, you know, a new town and trying

               7  to get his family settled.  I just -- I didn't

               8  know him until he walked in the door, you

               9  know, for the interview.

              10          Q.   Fair enough.  Did Dr. Nahhas tell

              11  you positive things about him?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   Prior to him coming?

              14          A.   He wouldn't be here, unless

              15  Dr. Nahhas wanted him to be here.

              16          Q.   Now, in terms of referrals, TCI

              17  was the cardiologists and -- correct, as

              18  opposed there was -- strike that.

              19             TCI were cardiologists, correct?

              20          A.   Toledo Clinic?

              21          Q.   Toledo Clinic were cardiologists,

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Well, they're one division of the

              24  clinic.

              25          Q.   All right.



                                                               44


               1          A.   We have many specialties.

               2          Q.   And so their referrals were not

               3  limited.  They could refer to ProMedica

               4  institutions or Mercy, correct?

               5          A.   Again, it -- that would depend on

               6  the insurance class, like all the Paramount

               7  stuff had to go to ProMedica, for the most

               8  part.

               9          Q.   Uh-huh.

              10          A.   The clinic tried very hard to sit

              11  on the fence, but sometimes, in the case of

              12  ProMedica, you wouldn't get the patient back.

              13  You'd send them down there for open heart, and

              14  you'd never see them again, because they'd get

              15  reassigned to a primary care doc with

              16  ProMedica, so we were getting tired of that.

              17          Q.   So from a business perspective,

              18  you saw, on ProMedica's part, cannibalism of

              19  patients, even though the primary cardiologist

              20  was a Toledo Clinic cardiologist?

              21             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              23  foundation.  Same.

              24          A.   That's how I saw it, and I --

              25  that's how the board saw it.  We were having a



                                                               45


               1  lot of stress in the market from these huge

               2  corporations, and we want to sit on the fence.

               3  That's what the clinic likes to do.

               4          Q.   Do you recall what dis -- at the

               5  time that Dr. Holland was being recruited, do

               6  you recall what discussions, if any, you had

               7  with Tom Arquilla about him?

               8          A.   Well, it was being driven by

               9  Dr. Nahhas, okay?  This was his show.  We were

              10  trying to figure out how to make it work, fund

              11  it, do everything legal and by the book.

              12             You know, Mercy is a

              13  not-for-profit.  We're a for-profit.  It was

              14  kind of -- that's why you had to have

              15  attorneys from both sides in the room, because

              16  you don't want to mess it up.  But it was

              17  mostly like how do we get the business model

              18  up and running.  That was it.  Because our

              19  plan was, if it worked, which we believed it

              20  would, we could use it in other departments.

              21          Q.   So essentially most of your

              22  discussions were through Dr. Nahhas about the

              23  recruitment of Dr. Holland?

              24          A.   I would say it's -- it was --

              25  Dr. Nahhas was the one that got it started.  I



                                                               46


               1  spent some time with Tom Leeds, because he

               2  would send candidates.  He only found two,

               3  okay?  Because they're hard to find,

               4  especially to come to Toledo.  But of course,

               5  I -- I -- I did talk with Tom Arquilla.  We

               6  had a number of things we were trying to do

               7  with oncol -- we had multiple departments we

               8  were trying to see what we could do between

               9  the Toledo Clinic and Mercy.  Oncology was a

              10  big push, okay?  Cardiology was a big push.

              11             But again, I mean, that was --

              12  these things were all in early stages.  I

              13  mean, they -- I believe Dr. Holland was our

              14  first one that we did with another venture

              15  with a hospital.

              16          Q.   Did you ever -- did Toledo

              17  Clinic, to your knowledge, ever do another

              18  transaction like one similar to Dr. Holland's

              19  with Mercy or any other hospital?

              20          A.   They did -- I can't even -- the

              21  oncology department, you -- it's not apples to

              22  apples, okay?  But it was trying to, you know,

              23  again, capture the oncology market from

              24  ProMedica.  Okay?  And they did hire, some

              25  Mercy oncologists joined the Toledo Clinic,



                                                               47


               1  okay, as employees of the Toledo Clinic.  I

               2  think we had about 12, 10 or 12 oncologists.

               3  And so that -- there were a lot of balls in

               4  the air going on.  But by the time these

               5  things got up to where they were working, you

               6  know, I -- I was gone by the end of 2015,

               7  so ....

               8          Q.   Well, other than Dr. Holland's

               9  arrangement, where basically his salary was

              10  reimbursed by Mercy, do you know of any other

              11  instances at Toledo Clinic, while you were

              12  there, a similar transaction occurred?

              13             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

              14  answered.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to the

              16  characterization of reimbursed by Mercy.

              17             MS. SILVERS:  Join.

              18          A.   How do I answer that?  They

              19  helped -- they helped us with recruitment,

              20  because they have a -- Mercy has a -- a strong

              21  recruitment team.  And our recruitment team

              22  was -- was one, me.  Okay?  And I was running

              23  a, you know, trying to run a $250,000,000

              24  company, with a thousand employees, and 150,

              25  180 medical providers, so I was happy to let



                                                               48


               1  Mercy help with that.

               2             We had done it with ProMedica too.

               3  I mean, over the, you know, 10 or 15 years,

               4  they'd help recruit some, but they always

               5  ended up leaving us and joining ProMedica.

               6          Q.   I know.  I'm not -- I'm not

               7  asking about -- I hear you on the recruitment.

               8  Mercy had a recruiter, and it would -- there

               9  was a benefit, because then you wouldn't have

              10  to put expense and things of that nature,

              11  correct?

              12          A.   I believe so, yes.

              13          Q.   It reduced expense for Toledo

              14  Clinic --

              15          A.   It did.

              16          Q.   -- if Mercy also assists

              17  with recruits?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19          Q.   But in terms of payment of

              20  salary, or reimbursement of any portion of

              21  salary, any other doctor, other than

              22  Dr. Holland, you can think of?

              23          A.   Yes.  They had a general surgeon,

              24  boy, this is pushing me, they helped us

              25  recruit a general surgeon, who joined late in



                                                               49


               1  my career there.  And I believe -- they did

               2  that with a couple of general surgeons, and I

               3  believe, and I'm not sure I'll get it

               4  accurate, so I'll put that disclaimer out

               5  there, but I believe they gave Mercy help with

               6  a year's worth of salary support, until they

               7  got on their feet.  And they, you know, they

               8  would get privileges at Mercy, they would, you

               9  know -- that's how we did it.

              10          Q.   But Dr. Holland's deal, to your

              11  recollection, was a multi-year deal of salary

              12  support from Mercy, correct?

              13          A.   Yes.

              14          Q.   And do you recall who it was that

              15  negotiated the terms of the salary with

              16  Dr. Holland?

              17          A.   Well, I'm fairly certain it

              18  wasn't me.

              19          Q.   Was not you?

              20          A.   Was not me.  I believe -- look, I

              21  believe it was done with Dr. Nahhas', you

              22  know, input.  I mean, sooner or later,

              23  everybody up there sees what the other guy's

              24  making, and it causes trouble, so he would

              25  have been sensitive to that.



                                                               50


               1          Q.   The deal, though, that was set

               2  up, though, was not one that required

               3  Dr. Holland to do a certain level of wRVU, or

               4  RVUs, and/or a certain volume of work; isn't

               5  that correct?

               6          A.   I believe that is correct.

               7          Q.   And you were not -- you had not

               8  seen Dr. Hashmi's contract, correct?

               9          A.   I never saw Dr. Hashmi's

              10  contract.

              11          Q.   And we're not -- today is not a

              12  show and tell thing.  I'm just asking you your

              13  own knowledge.

              14             If you can turn to exhibit -- oh,

              15  Exhibit 24, before I move on, is this a

              16  document that you saw in your preparation for

              17  your deposition?

              18          A.   I got 59 pages late last week.  I

              19  -- I kind of just sped read through them.  It

              20  looks familiar to me, okay?

              21          Q.   Just defer to whatever is in the

              22  59 pages, correct?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   Okay.  I'm just trying to get

              25  your best recollection.  We'll get to those



                                                               51


               1  later.

               2          A.   That's what you're getting, sir.

               3          Q.   Did, at any point in time, do you

               4  recall Tom Arquilla or Tom Leeds ever telling

               5  you that they were not "on the same page" when

               6  it came to Dr. Holland's recruitment and

               7  employment?

               8          A.   Never.  Let me rephrase.  Not

               9  that I recall.

              10          Q.   Okay.

              11          A.   You know?

              12          Q.   Exhibit 27 is the next one I

              13  wanted you to look at.

              14          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Hmm.

              15          Q.   I bet if this one was one that

              16  was in your packet, that you'll remember it.

              17          A.   I remember it.

              18          Q.   Okay.  To the center of the

              19  page --

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   -- where I was -- you,

              22  January 12, 2013, did you write an email to

              23  Thomas Arquilla, forward, Holland updates.

              24  Looks like the cat is out of the bag.  We need

              25  to start looking under our cars for



                                                               52


               1  explosives.

               2          A.   Can I put that in context?

               3          Q.   You can.  I'm just, first, you

               4  wrote it, correct?

               5          A.   Some of my best work.

               6          Q.   Okay.  And I think what you're

               7  pointing to, and you probably will explain

               8  this to me, is that because Dr. Holland is

               9  coming in, ProMedica is not going to take this

              10  favorably, but --

              11          A.   I have a better story than that.

              12          Q.   -- am I right?  Go ahead.  Please

              13  --

              14          A.   You are right.

              15          Q.   -- please tell me.

              16          A.   You are right.

              17          Q.   Please tell me.

              18          A.   My wife and I went -- can I tell?

              19  Can I wander?

              20             MS. SILVERS:  Within reason, yes.

              21          A.   Okay.  We went to the Ronald

              22  McDonald fundraiser.  Nice thing, give money

              23  for the kids, et cetera.  And I was at the bar

              24  getting one for my wife, one for me, and I

              25  turned around, and a cardiothoracic surgeon



                                                               53


               1  from Toledo Hospital was standing there right

               2  in front of me.  I'm looking down at him, by

               3  the way.  And he thumps me in the chest with

               4  his finger and flies off in this tirade of

               5  what the F we're doing hiring him.  And I

               6  said, because we want to compete in the

               7  marketplace.  And then he thumped me again,

               8  and I put down my drinks, and I said, you're

               9  not doing that a third time, and he stormed

              10  off.  So that -- I mean, I knew it was going

              11  to cause trouble.  I didn't realize it was

              12  going to cause that much trouble, but he was

              13  pretty dramatic.

              14          Q.   Is the initials of the physician

              15  MM?  The doctor who poked you with the finger

              16  --

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   -- is the initials MM?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   Okay.  By the way, is that

              21  surgeon known, he's known to be an excellent

              22  surgeon; is that correct?

              23          A.   Yes, he is.  He's not very good

              24  at chest thumping, though.

              25          Q.   Okay.  But he's at Toledo



                                                               54


               1  Hospital, which is owned by the ProMedica

               2  group, correct?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   So basically what had happened

               5  is, is at -- where -- it was at the Ronald

               6  McDonald charity event?

               7          A.   Yeah.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

               9             So this is basically -- Exhibit 27,

              10  you made a joke here about --

              11          A.   Well, it was right on the -- it

              12  was, you know, I was -- I wasn't upset.  We

              13  would have had a different outcome, if I

              14  didn't have a drink in my hand, so it, you

              15  know, he had no -- he had no right or reason

              16  to do that.  Okay?  And you know, you want to

              17  have a meeting with me and talk about things,

              18  I'm happy to do that, but I didn't think it

              19  was the right arena.

              20          Q.   And basically when you -- when

              21  you're recruiting a surgeon, what you're

              22  concerned, what you care about is not just

              23  market share, but you're also caring about

              24  trying to bring people to Toledo, so the

              25  quality of care here is better?



                                                               55


               1          A.   That's the goal.  That's what we

               2  strive for.  I want the physician to be

               3  successful.  I mean, we wouldn't be very good

               4  if we didn't, okay?  I mean, that's -- again,

               5  I have -- I have done recruitment a long time

               6  and you know?

               7          Q.   And recruitment, as you saw it,

               8  recruitment of a top-level cardiothoracic

               9  surgeon to Toledo is not easy; is that

              10  correct?

              11          A.   That's my opinion.

              12          Q.   Okay.  But that's what you saw

              13  from working in that --

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   -- arena?

              16             It would be accurate to say that

              17  one of the things you wanted, or like to

              18  stress with your -- with physicians that

              19  worked with you, was that you were pro

              20  physician and cared about them personally?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall whether it

              23  was before or after -- or strike that.

              24             So this email that you wrote about

              25  the cat being out of the bag, that would have



                                                               56


               1  happened after the event --

               2          A.   I believe so.

               3          Q.   Okay.  So probably that event was

               4  around the holidays or something?

               5          A.   I believe it was the first of the

               6  -- I think it was, you know, early part of the

               7  year.

               8          Q.   Uh-huh.

               9          A.   The other thing -- I don't know

              10  if it's in here -- the other thing ProMedica

              11  was doing were their cardiothoracic surgeons

              12  had never set foot in Flower Hospital in the

              13  history of the world, and they gave them

              14  privileges there, just to stick a fork in us.

              15  So that's -- that's the game we were playing,

              16  you know?

              17          Q.   And I'm going to come up -- there

              18  were some other ones I am going to ask you

              19  about, about what they were doing, what they

              20  were doing with this, but let me just

              21  continue.

              22             All right.  So -- and then at the

              23  top, Mr. Arquilla responds, I'm sorry,

              24  Mr. Arquilla responds, but he does not respond

              25  to you.  He responds to Michele Montague and



                                                               57


               1  Tom Leeds, correct?

               2          A.   That's what it looks like.

               3          Q.   And Mr. Leeds is one of the

               4  people you were working with in terms of the

               5  recruitment of Dr. Holland, correct?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   Okay.  All right.

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Mike, next one is

               9  3629.

              10             We're at 1:55.  I'm going to grab

              11  some documents.  Probably a good time for a

              12  break --

              13             MS. SILVERS:  That's fine.

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- to be fair.

              15  It's about an hour, so if you want to take 10

              16  minutes or so for the restroom.  Thank you.

              17             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off

              18  record.

              19             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              20  1:55 until 2:09.)

              21               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on

              22  record.

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco)

              24  Mr. Porterfield, we took a break.  We're back

              25  on record.  I'm going to try to go through



                                                               58


               1  some documents that haven't been marked also.

               2  This is Exhibit 116.

               3             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 116

               4  was marked for identification.)

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Just quickly,

               6  for the record, this is MSV 3629-30.  And

               7  Mr. Porterfield, if you could just review

               8  these sequence, and then I just had a couple

               9  of questions for you.

              10          A.   Okay.  I'm ready.

              11          Q.   There is a -- there is an email

              12  from Beth to you.  Beth Stykemain?

              13          A.   Stykemain.

              14          Q.   And who is that?

              15          A.   She's our credentialing person.

              16          Q.   And -- and it indicates here,

              17  Mary Ellen just told me Dr. Holland is going

              18  to be working out of our outpatient surg,

              19  which means we will be billing for him,

              20  correct?

              21             And then there is a reference to

              22  Dr. Mundinger.

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   Do you see that?

              25          A.   I do.



                                                               59


               1          Q.   Do you -- do you know what this

               2  email sequence is basically talking about?

               3          A.   Well, Beth and Mary Ellen would

               4  be at the lower end of the need-to-know basis

               5  on this whole process.

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7          A.   And all Beth does is

               8  credentialing, that very tedious, awful work

               9  that you have to do, getting registered with

              10  insurance companies.  She's very good at it.

              11             Mary Ellen is actually, or was the

              12  -- she's been at the clinic 40 years.  There

              13  is nothing she couldn't do, but I don't know

              14  where this -- I don't know where Mary Ellen

              15  came up that Dr. Holland was going to be

              16  working in the outpatient surgery.  This --

              17  that might have been something we discussed,

              18  in a drive-by, if you will, but I don't

              19  believe that ever happened, just because we

              20  weren't set up for it.  So there is confusion

              21  in the lower ranks, is what I'm trying to say.

              22          Q.   Fair enough.  Do you recall who

              23  wound up doing the billing for Dr. Holland?

              24  Was -- whether it was Toledo Clinic or Mercy?

              25          A.   It was Mercy.



                                                               60


               1          Q.   And why was it that Mercy was

               2  doing the billing?

               3          A.   He was stationed at Mercy.

               4  That's where they -- his office was, with his

               5  Mercy partners.

               6             (Whereupon, at 2:12, Greg Hood came

               7  into the deposition.)

               8          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) So Dr. Holland

               9  worked out of the same office with Dr. Hashmi;

              10  is that correct?

              11          A.   I'm not sure I ever saw his

              12  office, but I believe that to be true, yes.

              13          Q.   Well, I don't mean like the same

              14  actual like, you know, four by four space or

              15  whatever, but in the same general office

              16  space?  Mr. Hood just joined us, just for --

              17          A.   Hi.

              18          Q.   -- the record.

              19          A.   And who -- he is?

              20          Q.   Gregory Hood.  He's a

              21  representative for the hospital.

              22          A.   Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  Could

              23  you repeat the question?

              24          Q.   Sure.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.

              25  Can you please just --



                                                               61


               1             (Whereupon, the court reporter read

               2  back the requested testimony.)

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Okay.  Yeah.

               4  Mr. Hood had walked in, so let me just re --

               5  let me withdraw the question, and I'll restate

               6  it.

               7             Dr. Holland was stationed -- his

               8  office was at Mercy in the same general suite,

               9  so to say, with Hashmi and others?

              10          A.   I believe so.

              11          Q.   Okay.  Next exhibit is going to

              12  be 117.  Just give me one second here.  Before

              13  I mark this all as one exhibit, I want to make

              14  sure it's all the same thing.

              15             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 117

              16  was marked for identification.)

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) I'm just going

              18  to note that this is MSV 3684 through 3709.

              19  Mr. Porterfield, this may be a -- a chain of a

              20  series of emails.  I'm not sure if these are

              21  actually separate documents or not, or whether

              22  or not they were all forwarded up together.

              23  That's why they're included here.  So I'm not

              24  going to be suggesting to you, or trying to

              25  have you review the entire content of this and



                                                               62


               1  verify it.  I just want to ask you about the

               2  general topic of it.

               3             On the first page, there is a cc to

               4  you on the top email, dated March 26, 2013

               5  from Jayne Beckstead, correct?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   And then below that, there

               8  appears to be an email from you to Lori Kohler

               9  and Kendra Doriot and cc to Charles Kopitke

              10  and also Jackie Juarez, correct?

              11          A.   Correct.

              12          Q.   And then below that, on the next

              13  page, there appears to be this Lori Kohler

              14  sending an email to you and to Kendra Doriot,

              15  with ccs to Jackie Juarez and Charles Kopitke,

              16  correct?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   And these all generally have to

              19  do, or at least the emails I've referenced you

              20  to just now, have to do with Dr. Holland's

              21  business cards, correct?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   And what do you recall -- do you

              24  recall anything independent, outside of

              25  looking at these emails --



                                                               63


               1          A.   What I re --

               2          Q.   -- about that topic?

               3          A.   You know, this is stuff that

               4  would just blow by my desk.  I really don't --

               5  there might have been some -- I think there

               6  was a discussion at some point in time that he

               7  would either -- he might have a set of TCI

               8  cards and a set of Mercy cards, depending on

               9  what clientele he was going to be visiting.  I

              10  don't know what became of it, you know?  I

              11  really don't.

              12          Q.   Do you recall what type of

              13  business cards Dr. Holland wound up carrying?

              14          A.   I do not.

              15          Q.   But you do recall that there was

              16  discussions surrounding the potential that he

              17  would have two different business cards,

              18  depending upon which clientele he was seeing,

              19  correct?

              20          A.   I don't really recall that.  I

              21  don't recall that.  Again, I wouldn't be the

              22  lead on the business cards.

              23          Q.   Well, did you recall discussions

              24  around the fact that Dr. Holland that --

              25  strike that.



                                                               64


               1             That -- do you recall discussions

               2  around the fact that Dr. Holland's business

               3  cards would show the TCI logo and the Mercy

               4  logo?

               5             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.  You may

               6  answer.

               7          A.   I think we were trying to get

               8  closure on which one it was going to be, and I

               9  don't recall the outcome.

              10          Q.   If you can turn to Exhibit 26

              11  that's already been marked in your binder.

              12          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              13          Q.   And Exhibit 26, on the first

              14  page, you see at the top, this is not an email

              15  to you, sir.  Just to be clear.  There is an

              16  email from Ms. Deming to Suzanne Henry and a

              17  cc to Jayne Beckstead.  And Ms. Deming is

              18  representing, yes, this was approved by Tom

              19  Arquilla.  Do you see that at the top, on the

              20  first page of Exhibit 26?

              21          A.   I don't think I'm in the right

              22  page yet.  Yes, now I'm at the right page.

              23  Okay.

              24          Q.   Yes, this was approved by Tom

              25  Arquilla?



                                                               65


               1          A.   I see that.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Now, when is the last time

               3  you spoke with Mr. Arquilla?

               4             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.  As to

               5  this matter or in general?

               6             MR. ARCHINACO:  In general.

               7             MS. SILVERS:  You may answer.

               8          A.   I -- in the last two years, or in

               9  the last two weeks, or the last -- I spoke to

              10  Tom Arquilla Friday.

              11          Q.   And --

              12          A.   On a personal matter.

              13          Q.   And how frequently do you speak

              14  to Mr. Arquilla about personal matters?

              15          A.   Well -- well, when he was here,

              16  he was a sounding board.  I was -- he was a

              17  sounding board for me on occasion, but then so

              18  is my mother, but you know?

              19          Q.   Would you regard -- when

              20  Mr. Arquilla was here, would you have regarded

              21  him as a friend?

              22          A.   I regarded him as a friend and

              23  professional colleague, like I did our lawyer,

              24  like I did Dr. Elliot, like I did Dr. Nahhas.

              25          Q.   And how often would you go out



                                                               66


               1  with Mr. Arquilla outside of work?

               2          A.   Maybe once a month, but it was

               3  usually in context with business, and we would

               4  have our attorney with us.

               5          Q.   And then after you were

               6  terminated from Toledo Clinic, how frequently

               7  did you speak with Mr. Arquilla?

               8             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.  There's

               9  been no prior reference to termination, but

              10  you can answer.

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Oh, I'm sorry.

              12  Your departure.

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.  Same

              14  objection.

              15          A.   I probably spoke with him weekly,

              16  daily sometimes.

              17          Q.   And has that increased or

              18  decreased?

              19          A.   Decreased.

              20          Q.   And what is the frequency now?

              21          A.   Boy, I think this year I've

              22  spoken to him, I believe I called him, or to

              23  wish him a happy Christmas, and I spoke to him

              24  last Friday.

              25          Q.   Did you advise him you were going



                                                               67


               1  to be giving your deposition?

               2          A.   I did not.  It was a personal

               3  matter.

               4          Q.   Have you ever spoken to

               5  Mr. Arquilla about the fact he gave his

               6  deposition in this case?

               7          A.   I have not.

               8          Q.   Did you ever review

               9  Mr. Arquilla's transcript in this case?

              10          A.   His transcript?

              11          Q.   Yes, of his deposition testimony?

              12          A.   I mean, I have got that

              13  voluminous bunch of papers I got last week,

              14  but again, I did -- like I just sped read

              15  through them.

              16          Q.   Did the voluminous papers include

              17  deposition transcripts?

              18          A.   I'm not familiar with deposition

              19  transcripts.  This was broken up.  I wouldn't

              20  call it a coherent document.  Some of the

              21  emails were, and I was -- anyway, that's --

              22  that's my statement.

              23          Q.   Was it deposition excerpts?

              24          A.   I believe it could have been.

              25          Q.   And do you believe that you had



                                                               68


               1  certain excerpts of Doctor -- of

               2  Mr. Arquilla's deposition?

               3          A.   I believe I could have.

               4          Q.   And was that part of the 59

               5  pages?

               6          A.   Probably was.

               7          Q.   Or do you think that there were

               8  other materials that you were also given?

               9          A.   You know, it was a shotgun

              10  approach.  There was a lot of stuff in there.

              11  A lot of emails.  Some I was, you know,

              12  familiar with, some I wasn't.

              13          Q.   Do you recall what testimony of

              14  Mr. Arquilla's that you reviewed?

              15             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

              16  answered.  My client's already testified he

              17  doesn't know if he actually reviewed

              18  deposition transcript excerpts.

              19          A.   I don't know.

              20          Q.   Do you recall whether or not you

              21  looked at affidavits?

              22          A.   I don't know.

              23          Q.   Exhibit 26, the third page is a

              24  business card with Dr. Holland's name on it.

              25  Just -- this is Exhibit 26, the third page.



                                                               69


               1             MS. SILVERS:  Eh-heh.

               2             THE WITNESS:  Is there a third

               3  page?

               4             MS. SILVERS:  Yes.

               5          A.   Okay.

               6          Q.   This is a business card with

               7  Dr. Holland's name on it.  Do you ever recall

               8  seeing this business card?

               9          A.   I -- I do not.

              10          Q.   Do you know whether or not this

              11  was a business card that was used to identify

              12  --

              13          A.   I -- I --

              14          Q.   -- Dr. Holland with Mercy's name

              15  on it?

              16             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

              17  answered.  My client's already testified --

              18          A.   I don't know.

              19             MS. SILVERS:  -- he doesn't know

              20  what the business card that ultimately was

              21  used was.

              22          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) That did not

              23  help to refresh your recollection, correct?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   Okay.  Is there any other



                                                               70


               1  document you can think of, other than -- that

               2  could help refresh your recollection, or you

               3  never actually saw his ultimate, final

               4  business card?

               5          A.   I don't believe I saw a working

               6  card, if you will.  I just don't.

               7          Q.   Do you recall lawyers being

               8  involved in the process, and I don't want to

               9  know what the discussions were, but do you

              10  recall lawyers from Mercy being involved in

              11  the process of approving Dr. Holland's

              12  business card?

              13          A.   I have no recollection of that.

              14          Q.   One way or the other?

              15          A.   I don't.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Next is Exhibit 118.

              17             MS. SILVERS:  Thank you.

              18             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 118

              19  was marked for identification.)

              20          A.   Yeah, it's me.

              21          Q.   Okay.  And so this is an email

              22  that you wrote on or about May 15th, 2013,

              23  correct?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Subject:  Skullduggery, correct?



                                                               71


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   You like to sometimes use

               3  colorful, joking language in emails?

               4          A.   It always comes back to bite me,

               5  but yes.

               6          Q.   I don't know that it will today,

               7  but in any event, without getting to all the

               8  details, this is -- this is an email speaking

               9  about issues with ProMedica and the doctor

              10  that had poked you in the chest previously,

              11  correct?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And that's Dr. Moront,

              14  correct?

              15          A.   It is.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Essentially, you saw

              17  maneuvers by ProMedica to shut out Dr. Holland

              18  and -- strike that.

              19             You saw efforts being made to shut

              20  out Dr. Holland, correct?

              21          A.   I did.

              22          Q.   And were you also made aware that

              23  ProMedica had taken efforts to shut out also

              24  Dr. Hashmi and Dr. Burdine?

              25          A.   That would be -- I don't think



                                                               72


               1  it's in the email, but that would be a,

               2  probably an accurate assumption.

               3          Q.   And did you know Dr. Hashmi and

               4  Dr. Burdine?

               5          A.   I never met Dr. Bur -- Burdine?

               6          Q.   Dr. Burdine?

               7          A.   I never -- I never met him, but I

               8  had one or two meetings with Dr. Hashmi,

               9  dinner meetings.

              10          Q.   But other than that, that was --

              11          A.   That was it.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Did -- were you informed

              13  ultimately that even though ProMedica had been

              14  attempting to prevent Dr. Holland from

              15  obtaining privileges that -- at Flower

              16  Hospital, he did anyway?

              17          A.   Well, I don't know.  I just don't

              18  remember that.  Okay?  I remember -- I

              19  remember this email, because I knew that what

              20  they were doing, but that's -- that's all I

              21  can recall.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Do you remember ever being

              23  told that Dr. Holland ultimately did obtain

              24  privileges at Flower Hospital, but Dr. Hashmi

              25  and Dr. Burdine had not?



                                                               73


               1          A.   I do not recall that.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Doesn't mean it didn't

               3  happen, you just don't recall being told that,

               4  correct?

               5          A.   That's true.

               6          Q.   Next exhibit I'd like you to take

               7  a quick look at is Exhibit 31, which is

               8  already in the binders.  And you're not carbon

               9  copied on these emails, but I just wanted to

              10  let you look at them in context, and then

              11  there is an exhibit we're going to be marking

              12  for you.

              13          A.   Okay.

              14          Q.   That you are on.  This will be

              15  Exhibit 119.

              16             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 119

              17  was marked for identification.)

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  I'll just hand this

              19  out now.

              20             Are you marking the ones we need

              21  also?

              22             MS. SILVERS:  Yes.

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  I don't think there

              24  is too many of them.

              25             MS. SILVERS:  No.  I believe I have



                                                               74


               1  three.

               2          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) So

               3  Mr. Porterfield, you had a chance to look at

               4  your email and also Exhibit 31?

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   Okay.  So Exhibit 31 that I

               7  referenced you to, I just was trying to give

               8  you the context, and you had mentioned this

               9  earlier, I believe.  You're aware that

              10  Dr. Holland was attempting to set up a dinner

              11  with Dr. Kabour, correct?

              12          A.   I was.

              13          Q.   And -- and you knew something

              14  about inviting wives, or something like that;

              15  is that correct?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Now, and then Exhibit 119

              18  is an email that you wrote to Dr. Holland on

              19  February 19, 2014; is that correct?

              20          A.   Correct.

              21          Q.   And I'm going to ask you some

              22  more details about what you can recall outside

              23  of the email itself, which is just -- first,

              24  you refer to a board meeting that was held

              25  the night before this email, correct?



                                                               75


               1          A.   Correct.

               2          Q.   And that it was mentioned at the

               3  board meeting that Dr. Kabour never showed up

               4  for the dinner meeting that Dr. Holland had

               5  invited him to, correct?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   And then Dr. Nahhas, you noted,

               8  gave quite a fiery commentary --

               9          A.   Yeah.

              10          Q.   -- about how badly Mercy and its

              11  physicians had been treating Dr. Holland.  Is

              12  that right?

              13          A.   I believe he did.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Now, can you tell me what

              15  you can recall, outside of just that summary

              16  of fiery commentary?  I mean, what was -- what

              17  do you recall from this meeting?

              18          A.   Well, board meetings are, all the

              19  docs there, there is 13 board members and me,

              20  and the CFO.  And that's where we do the

              21  business of the clinic.  And I had -- I didn't

              22  brief Dr. Nahhas on anything.  I think he had

              23  his own source of what was going on with

              24  Dr. Holland.  And you know, he -- he got up

              25  and spoke his mind and was -- he just thought



                                                               76


               1  we ought to get to the bottom of it, okay?  So

               2  that's sort of -- a lot of yelling goes on at

               3  the board meetings once a month, but ....

               4          Q.   Do you recall more specifics

               5  about how -- what Dr. Nahhas was saying about

               6  how badly Mercy and its physicians --

               7          A.   I think that was it.  I mean, he

               8  -- he just was unhappy with -- you know, I did

               9  not relate that to him.  That would have been

              10  somebody else.  His source is not me on that.

              11  Okay?  But you'd have to ask Dr. Nahhas for --

              12  for that.

              13          Q.   The next sentence, I chimed in

              14  with a report of the meeting we had with

              15  Arquilla, you and myself.

              16             Do you -- do you see that there?

              17          A.   I do.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Now, what meeting were you

              19  referencing?

              20          A.   The only meeting that I believe

              21  Dr. Holland and I had, one meeting with Tom

              22  Arquilla, and that -- that I arranged.  I --

              23  I'm an advocate for the physicians at the

              24  Toledo Clinic.  That's part of my job.  And I

              25  asked Mr. Arquilla if he wouldn't mind if



                                                               77


               1  Dr. Holland and I came down and talked to him

               2  about his issues, and he said not at all.

               3          Q.   Okay.  So now, when you say that

               4  you're going to go talk to Mr. Arquilla about

               5  Dr. Holland's issues, what -- what do you

               6  recall, those were issues that Dr. Holland

               7  wanted to raise?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And what do you recall

              10  were the issues that Dr. Holland wanted to

              11  raise at that time?

              12          A.   Okay.  I believe Dr. Holland had

              13  some initial trouble with the office manager.

              14  I mean, it's kind of low-level stuff, when we

              15  first got here, like his office not being set

              16  up and stuff like that, which I have no -- no

              17  control over.  All I can do is kind of be a

              18  sounding board.  I believe it pertained to

              19  some of the issues that might have been going

              20  on with the physicians in the office, and

              21  that's why I set the meeting up.  And you

              22  know, Dr. Holland was gracious enough,

              23  gracious enough to make time, as was

              24  Mr. Arquilla.  And I believe we met for like

              25  45 minutes, maybe, an hour.



                                                               78


               1          Q.   All right.  Well, you said some

               2  of the issues going on with the physicians.

               3          A.   I think it was referral issues.

               4          Q.   And what do you recall learning

               5  about with regard to referrals?

               6          A.   That they're hard to get.  Okay?

               7  They're just hard to get.  It's a very

               8  dynamic, fluid, you know, it's a lot of work

               9  for a new guy from anywhere to get referrals

              10  right out of the gate.  And that's with any

              11  specialty, okay?  It takes time to build.

              12          Q.   So just to be clear.  You believe

              13  that Dr. Holland was that type of surgeon that

              14  fell into the category of just hard to build

              15  referrals, because you're the new guy?

              16          A.   No.

              17             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              18          A.   It was a general statement.

              19          Q.   Okay.  I just want to know about

              20  Dr. Holland, because you're --

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   -- you were aware about his

              23  capabilities before he came to Toledo,

              24  correct?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               79


               1          Q.   And do you -- do you agree that

               2  Dr. Holland provided a high quality of care

               3  here?

               4             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               5          A.   Personally?

               6          Q.   Yes, personally.

               7          A.   I heard no complaints about

               8  Dr. Holland's patient care during the time he

               9  was here.

              10          Q.   You were aware he had been a

              11  chief twice before coming to Toledo, correct?

              12          A.   I don't recall that, but wouldn't

              13  -- chief here?

              14          Q.   Chief in other hospitals?

              15          A.   Probably at the time of

              16  recruitment, we knew that.  It would have been

              17  in his resume.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall Dr. Holland

              19  raising complaints that the referral pattern

              20  did -- did not appear to be based upon quality

              21  or outcomes?

              22          A.   In the context of that meeting?

              23          Q.   Yes.

              24          A.   That was -- I believe that was

              25  discussed, but I was -- I was like -- I was



                                                               80


               1  like second chair there.  I wasn't doing the

               2  talking.  He and Tom Arquilla were.

               3          Q.   Mr. Porterfield, I completely

               4  understand.  Let's go back a second.

               5             You were a person who helped

               6  facilitate that meeting in the first place --

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   -- correct?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   And would you agree with me that

              11  absent your attempts to do that, there may not

              12  have been that meeting?

              13             MS. SILVERS:  Objection,

              14  speculation.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              16          A.   I don't believe that.  I -- I

              17  think that Dr. Holland and I were talking, and

              18  we exchanged emails, and I said, you know,

              19  let's just go down and talk to the guy.

              20          Q.   Okay.

              21          A.   You know, he'll -- I believe

              22  he'll take the meeting, and he did.

              23          Q.   Whatever you would call it,

              24  whether you're the oil, the vinegar, or

              25  somewhere in between, you assisted in setting



                                                               81


               1  up that meeting --

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   -- correct?

               4             And so you weren't the guy doing

               5  the talking at the meeting.  You were just,

               6  you know --

               7          A.   I was there as his administrator.

               8  And he brought some documentation on his --

               9  his surgical cases, which I had not seen

              10  before.  Okay?  You know, I learned a lot at

              11  that meeting about cardiothoracic surgery, how

              12  they track it.

              13          Q.   STS data, do you recall him

              14  discussing the -

              15          A.   Well, I don't recall the acronym,

              16  but it's a national -- I believe it's a

              17  national database.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  And you

              19  recall Dr. Holland making some type of

              20  presentation to Mr. Arquilla?

              21          A.   He passed documents out to him,

              22  yes.

              23          Q.   Okay.  And what -- tell me what

              24  you can remember.  I know that you were more

              25  passive in terms of what was going on, but



                                                               82


               1  tell me what you remember happening.

               2          A.   You know, it was a -- I wouldn't

               3  call it a freewheeling discussion, but

               4  Dr. Holland had good data he wanted

               5  Mr. Arquilla to see, and he looked at it.

               6  They talked about it.  And, you know, my gut,

               7  I just -- I think we're really down there just

               8  to get -- I was trying to get him a footing

               9  with Tom Arquilla, because I didn't, like I

              10  said, I've never met Dr. Kabour, even though I

              11  have been a patient on his service.  Okay?

              12  I've seen him on TV every Sunday.

              13          Q.   Uh-huh.

              14          A.   But I was trying to be a

              15  facilitator.  That's what I was trying to do.

              16          Q.   Okay.  And what do you recall

              17  Mr. Arquilla saying at that meeting about

              18  serving as a reference for Dr. Holland?

              19          A.   I recall that he said he would,

              20  if Dr. Holland was unhappy, he would help

              21  serve as a reference for him.

              22          Q.   Now, at this meeting, did -- was

              23  Dr. Holland yelling and ranting?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   Was he just normal conversation?



                                                               83


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   Seem to be presenting facts in an

               3  orderly fashion, to the best of your

               4  understanding?

               5          A.   I understood them.

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7          A.   That's always a plus.

               8          Q.   And did, at the end of that

               9  meeting, do you recall Mr. Arquilla saying

              10  anything, or words to the effect of anything

              11  about the hospital, or Mercy, was going to do

              12  anything about what Dr. Holland was telling

              13  him about?

              14          A.   I don't believe anything was said

              15  on that.  I don't think any decisions were

              16  made that day.

              17          Q.   Okay.  But he did say if

              18  Dr. Holland was unhappy, he would serve as a

              19  reference for him, correct?

              20          A.   He did.

              21          Q.   Now, do you recall any

              22  discussions with Dr. Holland, after walking

              23  out of the meeting -- well, strike that.

              24             Before we move out of the meeting,

              25  anything else you can remember --



                                                               84


               1          A.   Sure.

               2          Q.   -- from jogging your memory --

               3          A.   Well, just --

               4          Q.   -- from the meeting itself?

               5          A.   I thought the meeting went pretty

               6  well.  I don't think he did.

               7          Q.   Dr. Holland, you mean?

               8          A.   No, I don't think he did.

               9          Q.   Because the only reason I said

              10  Dr. Holland is because you were indicating

              11  towards him.  The video will pick that up,

              12  because he's present, but the court reporter

              13  wouldn't.  Go ahead, continue.  I'm sorry.

              14          A.   So we had a -- you know, we drove

              15  -- I believe we drove separately.  And we just

              16  had a little discussion on the sidewalk, and

              17  he says, you know, maybe I should just -- he

              18  says, I think I got fired, jee, maybe I should

              19  retire.  He was just having an emotional

              20  moment.  I didn't get the same negative

              21  feedback up there.  I mean, if one of my

              22  doctors is unhappy, and I'd offer the same

              23  thing to him, you know, I'd be glad to give

              24  you a good reference.  I don't think it was

              25  mean spirited at all.



                                                               85


               1             But he -- he -- Dr. Holland, he

               2  wasn't -- he was just talking.  I mean, I

               3  didn't get a sense he was crushed.  He just,

               4  you know, probably thought the meeting could

               5  have gone better, but who knows?  You never

               6  know when you go into those meetings.  And

               7  anyway, that's what I recall.

               8          Q.   Do you recall Dr. Holland

               9  discussing at that meeting the fact that two

              10  patients had both undergone, or strike that.

              11             Do you recall whether or not any

              12  discussion occurred with Mr. Arquilla about

              13  two patients that had both undergone minimally

              14  invasive surgery and died within a 48-hour

              15  time period?

              16          A.   You know, I'm sorry, I don't

              17  recall that.

              19  foundation.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you recall

              21  Dr. Holland communicating to you --

              22             MR. ARCHINACO:  I'm sorry,

              23  Mr. Wiencek.

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  I object to form and

              25  foundation to the last question.



                                                               86


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Thank you.  I'm

               2  sorry.  Did not mean to interrupt you.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Did you get

               4  the impression from Dr. Holland that he was

               5  visibly or physically upset about patients

               6  dying at the hospital, at Mercy, and he felt

               7  that he couldn't do anything about it?

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Form, foundation,

              12  speculation.

              13             MS. SILVERS:  Join.  You can

              14  answer.

              15          A.   I just don't recall it.

              16          Q.   Well, you indicated about

              17  Mr. Arquilla, and you used the words mean

              18  spirited.  You don't believe he was being mean

              19  spirited?  How do you know that?

              20             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              21          A.   It's a figure of speech.  I

              22  thought the meeting went well, okay, but

              23  Dr. Holland had more at stake there than I

              24  did, okay?  And I -- I thought we'd get some

              25  resolution, and we didn't get enough for his



                                                               87


               1  satisfaction, so ....

               2          Q.   Did -- in your experience, do you

               3  believe, or have you witnessed, that a

               4  physician who speaks out about something that

               5  is unpopular, such as patient safety concerns,

               6  that that person could -- strike that.

               7             Have you, in your experience, seen

               8  physicians who have encountered any type of

               9  retaliation when they speak up about patient

              10  safety issues?

              11             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              13  speculation, form and foundation.

              14             MS. SILVERS:  Competence.

              15          A.   In my -- you know, I've got

              16  45 years of experience in this stuff.  I have

              17  seen it.  Okay?  I did not necessary -- I have

              18  not seen it in the Toledo market.  I saw it in

              19  the Cleveland market, okay, when I was there.

              20  I have heard physicians complain about it in

              21  all markets, but you know, they could just rub

              22  somebody the wrong way and not get another

              23  referral.  There is all sorts of dynamics

              24  there, and a lot of them don't make sense, a

              25  lot of them are emotional.  But if your -- if



                                                               88


               1  your quality isn't good, you're not going to

               2  get referrals, okay?  And I believe, you know

               3  -- I believe we screened Dr. Holland very

               4  well, because we wanted him to succeed.  I

               5  believe Mercy wanted him to succeed.  Why

               6  would we bring somebody in and set him up and

               7  pay him a salary for them to fail?  That

               8  doesn't make any sense to me.  That's not what

               9  we do.  We'd never get another -- we wouldn't

              10  get another candidate.  We wouldn't.

              11          Q.   Do you think somebody's accused

              12  Toledo Clinic of trying to set up Dr. Holland

              13  to fail?

              14          A.   No.

              15             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              16          Q.   You know that they -- Toledo

              17  Clinic was not sued in this case?

              18          A.   Yeah, I know that.  I don't know

              19  why they would be.

              20          Q.   Right, they weren't.

              21          A.   Yeah.

              22          Q.   Okay.  So in terms of Dr. Holland

              23  having more -- more of a stake in that

              24  meeting, would you at least agree with me in

              25  part that by a stake in the meeting, he was



                                                               89


               1  talking about patient safety issues, and a

               2  pattern of referrals, and that he did stand to

               3  place himself at personal risk raising those

               4  issues?

               5             MS. SILVERS:  Objection --

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               7             MS. SILVERS:  -- form, foundation,

               8  competence, speculation and hearsay.

               9          A.   I don't believe he articulated

              10  that at the meeting.  I really -- I don't

              11  remember it.  Okay?

              12          Q.   Well, okay.  So at the meeting

              13  you recall him pointing out that,

              14  statistically, he pointed out his own --

              15          A.   His scores.

              16          Q.   -- his scores.  And then he also

              17  pointed out how the referral patterns appeared

              18  to be not quality based, correct?

              19          A.   He was able to compare his -- I

              20  have to answer that a different way.  He was

              21  able to compare his scores with other members

              22  of the cardiothoracic group.  That was, in

              23  that national database.  And that -- that is

              24  what I believe was talked about the most.  I

              25  just don't recall any, at that meeting, any

               1  referral, discussions on referrals taking

               2  place, but could be a bad memory.

               3          Q.   Do you recall that Dr. Holland

               4  was taking notes in that meeting?

               5             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               6          A.   I don't recall that.

               7          Q.   Do you know whether or not he was

               8  -- strike that.

               9             So you don't recall that he took

              10  notes during that meeting?

              11          A.   I --

              12             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

              13  answered.

              14          A.   -- do not.

              15          Q.   Do you recall whether or not he

              16  raised with Mr. Arquilla the concerns that he

              17  had put in writing to -- to Mr. Arquilla in

              18  November of 2013 about nursing care?

               1          Q.   I'm not going to -- Mr. --

               2  Mr. Porterfield, I'm not going to ask you to

               3  read this entire three-page letter.  You're

               4  welcome to, if you want to, but that's not the

               5  purpose of it.  This is a letter drafted

               6  November 14th, 2013 from Dr. Holland to

               7  Mr. Arquilla.  Do you see that at the top?

               8          A.   I do.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And it starts, I have

              10  great reluctance to send this communication to

              11  you, but I'm compelled to do so, as other

              12  avenues of resolution have led to no avail.

              13             You see that there?

              14          A.   I do.

              15          Q.   Do you recall having discussions

              16  with Dr. Holland in or about November, or this

              17  time period in 2013, where he was

              18  communicating to you that he needed to talk to

              19  somebody in management at Mercy, because there

              20  were serious problems with healthcare?

              21          A.   Now, I -- I -- I just don't

              22  recall that.

              23          Q.   Okay.

              24          A.   I have not seen this letter

              25  before, until just now.



                                                               92


               1             MS. SILVERS:  And I would note for

               2  the record there is no indication that my

               3  client was cc'd on this letter.

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Well, if you

               5  look at the last paragraph, and I'm skip --

               6  I'm skipping over all the various details of

               7  certain cases that he has, all referred in

               8  there, you don't need to worry about them.

               9  I'm just referring you to the last paragraph.

              10             Tom, these are but a few of the

              11  situations which have occurred in the last

              12  month.  I have reported them to Dr. Hashmi,

              13  nursing administration, and the PAC, without

              14  results.  The unit lacks leadership and

              15  accountability.

              16             Did I read that part correctly?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Now, do you recall

              19  Dr. Holland discussing, in or about this time

              20  period, prior to the meeting with

              21  Mr. Arquilla in January of 2014, patient

              22  safety issues that he was concerned about

              23  because of --

              24          A.   I do not.

              25          Q.   So -- so -- so to be clear then,



                                                               93


               1  you think then that even though I just showed

               2  you this letter that he wrote to Mr. Arquilla

               3  in November, that at the January meeting,

               4  Dr. Holland didn't talk about any quality

               5  issues at all in that meeting?

               6             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, form,

               7  foundation, and misstatement of the prior

               8  testimony.

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              10          A.   I just don't recall it.

              11          Q.   All right.  Back to Exhibit 31

              12  for a second, please.  Exhibit 31 in the

              13  binder.

              14             In Exhibit 31, in the bottom, there

              15  is an email dated February 11, 2014 from

              16  Thomas Arquilla to Dr. Holland.  And then

              17  below that is an email from Dr. Holland to

              18  Tom Arquilla on February 10th.

              19             Do you see that?

              20             MS. SILVERS:  No.  Hang -- just --

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Bottom of page

              22  31.

              23             MS. SILVERS:  Hang on.  We're at

              24  the wrong exhibit.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  That's okay.

               1          A.   Okay.  I have it now.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Now, if you turn onto the

               3  next page.

               4          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

               5          Q.   And Dr. Holland writes this to

               6  Mr. Arquilla.  Thank you for taking time on 21

               7  Jan 2014 to discuss the matter of referrals

               8  and program statistics with Scott and myself.

               9             You see that sentence there?

              10          A.   I do.

              11          Q.   And are you saying that you don't

              12  recall referrals being discussed, or are you

              13  saying that you can't -- you don't remember

              14  one way or the other?

              15             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Asked and answered.

              17          A.   I remember discussion on the

              18  statistics, because they were convincing.  His

              19  scores were good, so --

              20          Q.   Okay.

              21          A.   -- I -- I just don't remember

              22  referrals.

              23          Q.   Okay.  You're not saying it

              24  didn't happen, you just can't remember as you

              25  sit here today?



                                                               95


               1          A.   Can't remember.

               2             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

               3  answered.

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               5          A.   I answered it.  I can't remember.

               6          Q.   Okay.  It's -- it's perfectly

               7  okay not to remember things.  I'm not

               8  insinuating otherwise.

               9             Okay.  Exhibit 119, back to

              10  Exhibit 119, which is before you, the

              11  February 19th email.  The board -- so we were

              12  just talking about the meeting that Jamie and

              13  you had with Mr. Arquilla, correct?

              14          A.   Yes, right.

              15          Q.   You said the board has asked me

              16  to "summon" Arquilla to the next executive

              17  committee meeting, committee, as they are

              18  demanding an explanation of why Mercy would

              19  allow this to happen to you.  I'm sorry for

              20  all this trouble.

              21             Did I read that part generally

              22  correctly?

              23          A.   That's generally correct.

              24          Q.   Okay.  And what do you recall,

              25  other than what you wrote here, do you recall



                                                               96


               1  anything else about the summoning request?

               2          A.   If that happened, I would have --

               3  I would have -- I would have called

               4  Tom Arquilla's office and invited him to come

               5  to the executive committee.  Whether he did it

               6  or not, whether I did that or not, I don't

               7  recall.

               8          Q.   Do you ever recall Mr. Arquilla

               9  actually coming to an executive committee

              10  meeting at Toledo Clinic?

              11          A.   I do.

              12          Q.   And how often did you recall him

              13  doing that?

              14          A.   When he -- he came maybe, during

              15  my tenure, maybe a total of three or four

              16  times, but all in different topics.

              17          Q.   Did he ever come and discuss

              18  Dr. Holland?

              19          A.   Not to my knowledge.

              20          Q.   So even though the board of

              21  Toledo Clinic appeared to have summoned

              22  Mr. Arquilla, or wanted him to be summoned to

              23  the next executive committee, you don't

              24  believe that he ever appeared to talk about

              25  Dr. Holland, correct?



                                                               97


               1          A.   I --

               2             MS. SILVERS:  Objection,

               3  mischaracterization, but you may answer.

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               5          A.   I don't recall that.  I believe I

               6  would have asked him to come through his

               7  office formally.  I just don't recall whether

               8  he came for -- for Dr. Holland or not.

               9          Q.   Now, this is -- this email you

              10  wrote is approximately one month after the

              11  meeting with Mr. Arquilla, correct?

              12          A.   You mean the meeting with

              13  Dr. Holland and Tom Arquilla --

              14          Q.   Yes.

              15          A.   -- and myself?  I guess.

              16          Q.   Okay.  And this is also referring

              17  to Dr. Kabour not showing up for dinner with

              18  Dr. Holland, correct?

              19          A.   Yeah.

              20          Q.   And so what was -- was what going

              21  on at this time the fact that Dr. Holland had

              22  just raised the quality concerns -- strike

              23  that.

              24             Dr. Arquilla did not appear, to the

              25  best of your recollection, to address any



                                                               98


               1  quality concerns Dr. Holland had raised, or

               2  any referral issues Dr. Holland had raised,

               3  correct?

               4          A.   I do not recall that.

               5             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, form,

               6  foundation, speculative and

               7  mischaracterization of the testimony.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  Did he give an

              10  answer?  We got -- we got an answer.  Okay.

              11  Thank you.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) What

              13  discussions, if any, do you recall surrounding

              14  this issue about summoning Mr. Arquilla to the

              15  executive committee meeting, other than what

              16  we have already talked about today, if

              17  anything?

              18          A.   If I was ordered by the executive

              19  committee to do it, or the board, I would have

              20  done it.  And if -- if, you know, obviously if

              21  I put it in email to Dr. Holland, you know, I

              22  believe I would have done it, or paid a price

              23  at the board.

              24          Q.   What do you recall Dr. Holland

              25  telling you about quality with -- and



                                                               99


               1  Dr. Hashmi?

               2          A.   Not much at all.  I don't recall

               3  anything.

               4          Q.   You never heard Dr. Holland

               5  complaining about patient deaths to you?

               6             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

               7  answered.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               9          A.   I do not recall that.

              10          Q.   Did you ever -- did you ever --

              11  do you recall ever -- anyone ever using the

              12  analogy with you, it was like a person going

              13  in a church with a gun --

              14             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              15          Q.   -- over time?

              16             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

              17  answered.

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              19             MS. SILVERS:  You may answer.

              20          A.   I -- I have nothing to say about

              21  it.  I had not heard that before.

              22          Q.   You ever recall being told words

              23  to the effect of, if all these patients were

              24  killed in a -- in a single day, there would be

              25  a federal investigation, but nothing happens



                                                               100


               1  here at Mercy?

               2             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

               3  answered.

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

               5  foundation.

               6             MS. SILVERS:  Join.

               7          A.   I do not recall that at all.

               8          Q.   Exhibit 120.

               9             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 120

              10  was marked for identification.)

              11          Q.   You can put it over there.

              12             Mr. Porterfield, Exhibit 120, there

              13  are -- there is an -- an email on here that

              14  you are carbon copied on, not all of them.

              15  But if you look at the second page, you'll see

              16  that you're carbon copied on an email from

              17  Dr. Nahhas to Dr. Holland.

              18             Done reading it?

              19          A.   Yeah.

              20          Q.   Okay.  I was waiting for you.  So

              21  do you -- do you recall -- this is from

              22  November of 2014.  Do you see that?

              23          A.   I do.

              24          Q.   And Dr. Nahhas says, Excellent

              25  results, too much politics.  Maybe share this



                                                               101


               1  with Tom Arquilla and Dr. Andrabi, as well as

               2  Dr. Burdine and also Brad Bertke, Ed, correct?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   And then it appears to be there

               5  are issues with something having to do with

               6  staffing, correct, or --

               7          A.   Appears to be.

               8          Q.   And an uncomfortable environment;

               9  is that right?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And do you recall Dr. Holland

              12  telling you that he felt like he was

              13  practicing medicine in an uncomfortable

              14  environment?

              15          A.   You know, I don't recall that.  I

              16  -- he had complaints about the office manager,

              17  initially.  Reading this email, you know, I --

              18  I just don't recall at this level of detail.

              19          Q.   But do you -- so when you said

              20  office manager, you're talking Ms. Sheroian --

              21  Sheroian?

              22          A.   Don't remember her name, but

              23  maybe that's the one on the first page.

              24          Q.   She was a person provided by

              25  Mercy?



                                                               102


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   She was not employed by Toledo

               3  Clinic, correct?

               4          A.   Was not.  No, she was not.

               5          Q.   And what control did Toledo

               6  Clinic have over her day-to-day activities, if

               7  anything?

               8          A.   Absolutely nothing.

               9          Q.   And what involvement did she have

              10  with regard to scheduling Dr. Holland with --

              11  for surgeries?

              12             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.  My

              13  client's already testified Toledo Clinic was

              14  not involved.

              15          A.   We were not involved in that.

              16          Q.   Do you recall Dr. Holland

              17  complaining to you about the nights he was

              18  being given for on call, to be on call?

              19          A.   I vaguely do recall that.  I do.

              20          Q.   Do you recall Dr. Holland

              21  complaining to you that Dr. Hashmi would

              22  schedule him, when he learned that he had a

              23  vacation, so Dr. Hashmi would intentionally

              24  schedule him while he was supposed to have

              25  vacation?



                                                               103


               1          A.   I recall that as a complaint

               2  Dr. Holland made.

               3          Q.   Is that the kind of thing that

               4  you -- strike that.

               5             Do you recall -- do you recall

               6  Dr. Holland saying words to the effect that

               7  the environment that he was practicing in

               8  could give rise to malpractice?

               9          A.   I don't recall that.

              10          Q.   Okay.  But who provided

              11  Dr. Holland's malpractice insurance, to your

              12  knowledge?

              13          A.   If he was employed by the Toledo

              14  Clinic, it would be through the Toledo Clinic

              15  and their offshore malpractice program.

              16          Q.   So, but you do recall Dr. Holland

              17  complaining about problems with staff,

              18  correct, that were not employed by Toledo

              19  Clinic?

              20          A.   The office manager, I recall.

              21          Q.   And you recall various issues

              22  with Dr. Hashmi that Dr. Holland complained

              23  about, correct?

              24          A.   I re -- I vaguely recall the --

              25  the vacation schedule.

               1          Q.   How frequently would you talk

               2  with Dr. Nahhas?

               3          A.   Well, he was a board member at

               4  the time, and I tried to make the rounds

               5  almost, you know, at least quarterly with him,

               6  but Dr. Nahhas was a busy guy.  And I saw him

               7  not as much as I did other executive committee

               8  meeting members.  They're busy.  I mean, he's

               9  going to multiple hospitals, he's got a big

              10  patient base, and ....

              11          Q.   Did you ever have, at Toledo

              12  Clinic, did you ever have any issues with

              13  Dr. Nahhas' veracity or ability to tell the

              14  truth?

              17          A.   None whatsoever.

              18          Q.   Do you recall Dr. Nahhas ever

              19  using the term mafia with you in connection

              20  with Mercy or Dr. Hashmi?

              21          A.   I do not.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Were you ever made aware

              23  that Dr. Nahhas was recorded in this --

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   -- in connection with this case?

               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   Did you ever hear complaints, or

               3  strike that.

               4             Was it ever communicated to you

               5  that -- strike that.

               6             Did you know a surgeon by the name

               7  of Dr. Brunsting?

               8          A.   I do not.

               9          Q.   Did Dr. Nahhas ever talk to you

              10  about complaints Dr. Brunsting had made to him

              11  about his inability to obtain referrals?

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And do you

              18  recall any discussions around the fact that

              19  Dr. Brunsting had complained to Dr. Nahhas

              20  that he could not obtain referrals because it

              21  was like Hashmi had a mafia behind the scenes?

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you -- did

               5  -- were you ever advised, or strike that.

               6             Did you ever hear that there was a

               7  term that was used at Mercy called the

               8  brotherhood?

               9             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   Okay.  Next exhibit is 121; is

              12  that right?

              13             THE REPORTER:  Yes.

              14             MS. SILVERS:  Yes.

              15             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 121

              16  was marked for identification.)

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) This is an

              18  email dated December 1, 2014 from Dr. Holland

              19  to Dr. Arquilla with a thank you.  It's not an

              20  email to you.

              21             Do you see that?

              22          A.   I do.

              23          Q.   Okay.  It says in here, Tom,

              24  thank you for speaking with Scott today.

              25             Do you see that?



                                                               107


               1          A.   I do.

               2          Q.   And do you recall -- and then

               3  Dr. Holland says, I know you have a lot on

               4  your plate.  I really would like to see the

               5  situation improve so that we could capture

               6  more of the market.  Hope you had a restful

               7  holiday!

               8             With that context in mind, do you

               9  recall having a discussion with Thomas

              10  Arquilla on or about December 1, 2014?

              11          A.   I have no recall of it.

              12          Q.   You don't recall what was being

              13  -- what the situation was that --

              14          A.   No, I don't.

              15             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

              16  answered.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) If we can look

              18  at Exhibit 32 next, please.

              19          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              20          Q.   And this is an email from you to

              21  Dr. Holland dated May 7, 2015.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Once again, this is

              23  one of the emails that we have objected to the

              24  top of the page, where it says Scott

              25  Porterfield, Arquilla, intent to renew.  This



                                                               108


               1  isn't part of the actual email content.  It's

               2  something that has been characterized by

               3  presumably Dr. Holland.

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Arquilla,

               5  I'm sorry, Mr. Porterfield, do you see the

               6  email, Scott Porterfield, May 7th, 2015 to

               7  Jamie Holland, follow-up?

               8          A.   I do.

               9          Q.   You wrote, Jamie, I spoke with

              10  Tom Arquilla last night about some of our

              11  conversation last night.  In particular, I

              12  asked him why you were not allowed to directly

              13  interview the new cardiac director at St. V's.

              14  Tom stated "I was furious that Dr. Holland was

              15  not involved in a proper interview."  I did

              16  not know of it until after the fact."  I asked

              17  him what your future was when your contract

              18  was up.  He told me that he would like to

              19  renew it.  He is very aware of the political

              20  arena you are currently stuck in.  Thanks,

              21  Scott.

              22             Did I generally read that

              23  correctly?

              24          A.   You generally read that

              25  correctly.



                                                               109


               1          Q.   Okay.  Now, at first it

               2  references a conversation from May 6th, 2015.

               3  There is no reason that you would remember

               4  that date in particular, correct?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   Okay.  You're not disputing you

               7  wrote here that you had a conversation with

               8  Mr. Arquilla the night before, so --

               9          A.   I'm not disputing that.

              10          Q.   And so you were attempting to be

              11  accurate in this email to my client, correct?

              12          A.   I was.

              13          Q.   And -- and you asked

              14  Mr. Arquilla, as you documented here, why

              15  Dr. Holland was not allowed to interview the

              16  new cardiac director at St. V's, correct?

              17          A.   Correct.

              18          Q.   And Mr. Arquilla indicated to you

              19  that he was furious that Dr. Holland was not

              20  involved in that process, correct?

              21          A.   Correct.

              22          Q.   Now, what else do you remember

              23  Mr. Arquilla saying to you about that, if

              24  anything?

              25          A.   I think I put it in the context



                                                               110


               1  of the email.

               2          Q.   And so why would it matter that

               3  Dr. Holland was not allowed to directly

               4  interview the new cardiac director?  Why did

               5  that matter?

               6          A.   Why did it matter to me?

               7          Q.   Yes.

               8          A.   I thought it was reasonable that

               9  he would interview that person.

              10          Q.   Well, what -- what was your

              11  understanding as to why Dr. Holland was not

              12  allowed to do that?

              13          A.   I have no -- you know, I got this

              14  after the fact, okay?  I mean, I didn't -- I

              15  believe it -- the incident was over when I was

              16  contacted, and then I contacted Tom Arquilla,

              17  and I followed up with Dr. Holland.

              18          Q.   Did anyone ever give you an

              19  explanation as to why Dr. Holland was not

              20  permitted to be involved in that process?

              21          A.   Not -- not that I recall.

              22          Q.   And did you in fact, as you

              23  documented here, ask Mr. Arquilla what

              24  Dr. Holland's future was when his contract was

              25  up?



                                                               111


               1          A.   I did.

               2          Q.   And Mr. Arquilla told you that he

               3  would like to renew Dr. Holland's contract?

               4          A.   I believe he did.

               5          Q.   And Mr. Arquilla acknowledged, at

               6  least as of May -- May of 2015, that

               7  Dr. Holland was involved in a political arena,

               8  he was stuck in one; is that right?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   Okay.  And what was the political

              11  arena he was stuck in?

              12          A.   The entire medical community of

              13  Toledo, ProMedica, Mercy, University of

              14  Toledo, you name it.  It's the whole ball of

              15  wax.

              16          Q.   So you don't think it was more

              17  specifically the fact that Dr. Hashmi, with

              18  inferior results, kept having referrals sent

              19  to him and patients were dying, and

              20  Dr. Holland was complaining, and no one was

              21  doing anything about it?

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

                                                               112


               1  everything.

               2          A.   I just explained that sentence

               3  for my context of what I believe it says.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Well, let's talk about the

               5  things that Dr. Holland had in his immediate

               6  vicinity.  He was complaining about office

               7  staff not doing things correctly.

               8          A.   Early on, he was.

               9          Q.   Okay.  You were aware he

              10  complained about nursing care being sub --

              11  subpar?

              12             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.  There's

              13  been no reference to nursing care.

              14          A.   I just don't recall that.

              15          Q.   You don't recall that?

              16          A.   I wasn't in that arena.  I was in

              17  my arena, okay?

              18          Q.   What arena were you in?

              19          A.   I was at the Toledo Clinic.  He

              20  was downtown at Mercy.

              21          Q.   Okay.

              22          A.   That's where his office was.

              23          Q.   Right.  He was stuck in a

              24  political arena.

              25             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               2          A.   I've explained what I believe

               3  that to be.

               4          Q.   Okay.  So let's go through it.

               5  So does political arena include the fact that

               6  Dr. Hashmi is getting a -- was getting a

               7  disproportionate number of referrals to

               8  Dr. Holland?

               9             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, form,

              10  foundation, misstatement of the prior

              11  testimony.

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              13  foundation.

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  And I'm going to

              15  move to strike your objection and have you

              16  sanctioned if you keep trying to -- to suggest

              17  answers to the witness.

              18             MS. SILVERS:  I'm not suggesting

              19  any answers to the witness.  It was a

              20  mischaracterization of the prior testimony.

              21             MR. ARCHINACO:  No, it wasn't.  I'm

              22  asking a question.

              23          A.   Could you restate the question,

              24  please?

              25          Q.   I'll have -- I'll look back at



                                                               114


               1  it.

               2             Did the political arena include the

               3  fact that Dr. Hashmi, according to

               4  Dr. Holland, was getting a disproportionate

               5  number of referrals compared to Dr. Holland?

               6             MS. SILVERS:  Continuing objection.

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               8          A.   I can't speak to that one way or

               9  the other.

              10          Q.   So did the political arena have

              11  to do with the fact that Dr. Holland had

              12  raised quality concerns at Mercy, and the

              13  administration turned a blind eye to it?

              14             MS. SILVERS:  Objection --

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              16             MS. SILVERS:  -- asked and

              17  answered.

              18          A.   I can't speak to that either.

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Form and foundation.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Did the

              21  political arena include the patient deaths

              22  that were occurring that Dr. Holland felt he

              23  couldn't stop from happening?

              24             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked,

              25  answered, form and foundation.



                                                               115


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               2          A.   I can't speak to that issue.

               3          Q.   So you just thought the political

               4  arena was just all these general factors in

               5  the marketplace, not really the things that

               6  Dr. Holland might be encountering on a

               7  day-to-day basis?

               8          A.   I think they all mattered, but

               9  there's a lot of them.  Okay?  There's just a

              10  lot of them, and they're all different arenas.

              11  You know, ProMedica was trying to kill

              12  everybody.  You know, that -- that is what I

              13  believe.

              14          Q.   What does ProMedica have to do

              15  with Jamie Holland and his work at Mercy?

              16          A.   I can retell my story about

              17  getting my chest thumped, but ....

              18          Q.   Well, why -- why is -- why is

              19  ProMedica part of a political arena he's stuck

              20  in in Mercy?

              21          A.   I think there is plenty of

              22  reference to that in his attempt to get

              23  privileges at Flower, and ProMedica trying to

              24  stop him.  Okay?

              25          Q.   Okay.  But that was years



                                                               116


               1  earlier.

               2          A.   All of this was years earlier.

               3          Q.   This is -- no.  This is 2015.

               4  Email about Flower from, what, 2013?  That was

               5  two years prior.

               6          A.   Okay.  Now it's five years prior

               7  to the whole thing.

               8          Q.   Well, this is 2015 --

               9          A.   No, I'm talking --

              10          Q.   -- we're talking about the

              11  political arena --

              12          A.   -- about today.  I mean --

              13          Q.   -- and I'm just wondering what

              14  ProMedica has to do with the political arena

              15  Jamie Holland was stuck in over at Mercy.

              16          A.   I think I have talked enough

              17  about that.

              18          Q.   Did someone from ProMedica --

              19          A.   I've answered to the best of my

              20  ability.

              21          Q.   -- put their hats in this --

              22             THE REPORTER:  Guys, wait.

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- is that

              24  fair?

              25             Did someone from ProMedica reach



                                                               117


               1  out to Mercy to try to interfere with

               2  Dr. Holland?

               3             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               4          A.   Other than the Ronald McDonald

               5  story, that's all I have to report --

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7          A.   -- on that.

               8          Q.   So --

               9          A.   I -- I believe the credentialing

              10  issue at Flower, that ProMedica put up, was

              11  part of the problem too.

              12          Q.   But when it came to referrals

              13  internally at Mercy, do you believe that

              14  ProMedica had anything to do with the --

              15          A.   No, I do not.

              16          Q.   -- internal referrals at Mercy?

              17          A.   No, not that I know of.

              18          Q.   And in terms of the referrals

              19  that was -- when they -- do you know how --

              20  strike that.

              21             And if you don't know, don't --

              22  please don't guess or speculate.  Do you know

              23  how the referral process worked?

              24          A.   I do not.

              25          Q.   All right.  So you indicated



                                                               118


               1  there were a lot of factors that went into the

               2  political arena, so let's just go through

               3  which ones you believe were included.

               4             What do you believe is included in

               5  that?

               6          A.   I'm -- I'm kind of given a

               7  30,000-foot view of the whole medical

               8  community in Toledo.  Obviously, referrals are

               9  an issue, if a doctor is not getting them.

              10  The how and why of that, I don't know.  Okay?

              11  It happens.  It happens to a lot of

              12  physicians, okay?

              13          Q.   Okay.  So referrals, not getting

              14  referrals.

              15             What else do you think went into

              16  political arena?  And then we'll break that

              17  down in a minute.

              18          A.   I don't have any more to add.

              19          Q.   Okay.  Now, you said you're

              20  speaking for Toledo.  You haven't been asked

              21  to come here by the -- is it a city, I believe

              22  it's city of Toledo, right?

              23          A.   Eh-heh.

              24          Q.   You haven't been asked to come --

              25          A.   I'm here of my own free will.



                                                               119


               1          Q.   Okay.  Because you had said that

               2  you were --

               3             (Whereupon, at 3:17, Dr. Holland's

               4  phone went off.)

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- speaking on

               6  behalf of Toledo, and maybe you just misstated

               7  it.

               8          A.   I misstated it.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Now, when you say not

              10  getting referrals.  Now, Dr. Kabour, and his

              11  group, were a referring group of doctors,

              12  correct?

              13          A.   I believe so.

              14          Q.   And you were aware prev, as

              15  previously, that Dr. Holland attempted to get

              16  dinner with Dr. Kabour, and Dr. Kabour did not

              17  either -- either was conflicted, or did not

              18  show up, correct?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   Okay.  And so did you have a --

              21  and the Dr. Kabour meeting Dr. Holland

              22  attempted to have after the meeting with you

              23  and Mr. Arquilla, where Dr. Holland had spoken

              24  about his statistics, correct?

              25          A.   Correct.



                                                               120


               1          Q.   And so you didn't have any

               2  understanding, is that what you're telling me?

               3  You had no understanding whatsoever about why

               4  it would be that Dr. Kabour's group would

               5  refer the majority of their cases to

               6  Dr. Hashmi, as opposed to Dr. Holland?

               7          A.   That's not my group.  I never

               8  understood how they worked.  And you know,

               9  that's the cardiology group.  I have my own

              10  cardiology group to worry about.

              11          Q.   All right.  So in terms of not

              12  getting referrals, we have Dr. Kabour's group,

              13  but then we have Dr. Nahhas and the people

              14  that worked under your group, correct?

              15          A.   Right.

              16          Q.   And there were no problems with

              17  referring cases to Dr. Holland?

              18          A.   I never heard of any.

              19          Q.   Okay.  And I believe -- you're

              20  aware Dr. Holland assisted in setting up the

              21  St. Anne's program, correct?

              22          A.   I was aware of that.

              23          Q.   And did you see the type of

              24  effort that he put into doing so?

              25          A.   I did.  Well, I heard about it.



                                                               121


               1  I didn't see it.

               2          Q.   Okay.

               3          A.   I heard about it.

               4          Q.   What kind of things did you hear

               5  about it?

               6          A.   I heard good things about it.  I

               7  mean, they didn't have a program before, as

               8  far as I knew.

               9          Q.   Did it seem like that was a --

              10  strike that.

              11             Were you ever made aware that was

              12  -- it was difficult for him to set that up?

              13          A.   I was not made aware of that.

              14          Q.   But generally speaking, you heard

              15  positive things about that program, when it

              16  was set up?

              17          A.   I -- I did, mostly from my

              18  cardiology group --

              19          Q.   Okay.

              20          A.   -- so ....

              21          Q.   And did -- did your -- if your

              22  cardiologists did not like the quality of

              23  Dr. Holland, they were free to refer to other

              24  people as well, correct?

              25          A.   Well, sure.  I mean, that's the



                                                               122


               1  way it works.

               2          Q.   So you saw consistent pattern of

               3  referrals from the group that you were in

               4  charge of to Dr. Holland, correct?

               5          A.   I -- I have no way to document

               6  that, other than he would know he'd be getting

               7  them.  If there had been issues about his

               8  quality, we would have heard about it from

               9  Dr. Nahhas himself or the group.  I have no

              10  recollection of that ever came up of quality

              11  issues.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  Thank you.

              13             In terms of the political arena, I

              14  just wanted to ask a couple more questions in

              15  this time frame.  Do you recall a time period

              16  when Dr. Phillips, Christopher Phillips, was

              17  hired at Mercy?

              18          A.   I do not.

              19          Q.   Do you know Doctor, who

              20  Dr. Phillips is?

              21          A.   I don't think I do.

              22          Q.   Okay.

              23          A.   I'm bad with names, I'm sorry.

              24          Q.   Fair enough.

              25             Doctor --



                                                               123


               1          A.   Can I ask what specialty he was?

               2          Q.   Cardiothoracic surgeon.

               3          A.   Okay.

               4          Q.   You don't recall him?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   People have described him

               7  differently.  One person described him as a

               8  bull in a China closet.  I don't know that I

               9  would agree with that at all, but someone did.

              10  You don't recall someone coming in like a bull

              11  in a China closet?

              12          A.   No.  I don't think he was a

              13  Toledo Clinic physician either.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Okay.  Do you know --

              15  strike that.

              16             Were you ever made aware, through

              17  Dr. Holland, that another physician had come

              18  in to Mercy, and that he was verifying

              19  essentially what Dr. Holland had been seeing

              20  about quality issues?

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              22  foundation.

              23             MS. SILVERS:  Join.

              24          A.   I don't recall that.

              25          Q.   Do you recall words to the effect



                                                               124


               1  of, that Mercy had hired a new physician, and

               2  that he had identified quality concerns?  Do

               3  you recall anything along those lines?

               4          A.   No.

               5             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, asked and

               6  answered.

               7          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you recall

               8  Mr. Arquilla telling you that Mr. -- do you

               9  recall -- strike that.

              10             Do you recall in or about -- well,

              11  let's go back for a second.

              12             You continued to work with Toledo

              13  Clinic until the end of December 2015; is that

              14  correct?

              15          A.   December 15th.

              16          Q.   December 15th.  Okay.  And what

              17  was the reason that you departed?

              18          A.   We had a falling out.

              19          Q.   Anything to do with Dr. Holland?

              20          A.   Not at all.  No.

              21          Q.   Operational issues?

              22          A.   They said I was old.  Okay?  And

              23  they wanted a change.  Now, it wasn't they.

              24  It was one physician, and that cost them a few

              25  things.



                                                               125


               1          Q.   And you reached some type of

               2  resolution with the company?

               3          A.   I did.

               4          Q.   Did it require you to continue to

               5  cooperate with the company into the future?

               6          A.   I think they were sort of done

               7  with me.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Well, in terms of your

               9  affidavit that you signed in this case, did

              10  you have an understanding that you had to sign

              11  that affidavit?

              12             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.  You may

              13  answer.

              14          A.   No, I don't think -- I didn't

              15  feel I had to.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Or did you feel that the

              17  affidavit was in any way connected to any

              18  release or agreement you had signed --

              19             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- with the

              21  company?

              22             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              23          A.   I did not feel that.

              24          Q.   And then you entered, probably,

              25  into a typical, it had some type of



                                                               126


               1  confidentiality clause in your separation,

               2  correct?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  We don't

               5  need to know your specifics today.

               6             Were you made aware, shortly before

               7  you departed, that Mr. Arquilla had involved

               8  Mr. Middleton in performing an investigation

               9  or consulting work at Mercy?

              10             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.  You may

              11  answer.

              12          A.   I knew Mr. Middleton had been

              13  hired by Tom Arquilla to work on our oncology

              14  department, but not -- not in the area of an

              15  investigatory role.  He was crunching numbers.

              16          Q.   From what you saw with oncology,

              17  that's what he did --

              18          A.   Yeah.

              19          Q.   -- Mr. Middleton, crunched

              20  numbers?

              21          A.   Yeah.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Were you ever made aware

              23  that at or about the time that you were

              24  leaving Toledo Clinic, that a surgeon at

              25  Mercy, who I've identified as Dr. Phillips,



                                                               127


               1  was placed on probation?  Did you ever hear

               2  anything like that?

               3             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               4          A.   I did not.

               5          Q.   Did you ever hear that, or words

               6  to the effect, that a physician who was

               7  working with Dr. Holland at Mercy had been

               8  placed on probation, after he had raised

               9  quality concerns about Dr. Hashmi?

              10             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              12  foundation.

              13             MS. SILVERS:  Join.

              14          A.   I did not hear that.

              15          Q.   Do you know Adam Carruthers?

              16          A.   The name is familiar, but I'm not

              17  -- I've heard it before.  I don't know in what

              18  context.

              19          Q.   He was a -- he was an assistant,

              20  first assistant, or a physician's assistant,

              21  that assisted Dr. Holland on a number of his

              22  cases --

              23          A.   Oh --

              24          Q.   -- at St. Anne's.

              25          A.   -- I did not know that.



                                                               128


               1          Q.   Okay.  I'm just trying to give

               2  you a little background.  But staff like that

               3  were provided through Mercy, not through

               4  Toledo Clinic --

               5          A.   Correct.

               6          Q.   -- correct?

               7             This might be a natural breaking

               8  point, and then I will -- yeah.  Why don't we

               9  take a break right now.  It's 3:26.  We have

              10  been going a while.  I don't think I'll be too

              11  much longer.  I have a different topic, but

              12  why don't we just take the break now, and then

              13  I'll try to finish up as quickly as I can.

              14  Mr. Wiencek may have some questions also.

              15             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off record.

              16             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              17  3:26 until 3:40.)

              18             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  We're

              19  back on record.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco)

              21  Mr. Porterfield, you were not, or you do not

              22  have any knowledge, one way or the other,

              23  about what happened with the service agreement

              24  with Dr. Holland, whether it was terminated or

              25  not, correct?



                                                               129


               1          A.   I don't have any knowledge of

               2  that.

               3          Q.   Now, in terms of your tenure with

               4  Toledo Clinic, had you ever seen a services

               5  agreement between it and Mercy terminated

               6  early, before its term is to expire?

               7          A.   I don't recall that.

               8          Q.   Earlier you had mentioned that

               9  there were one or two surgeons, I believe,

              10  where Mercy agreed to reimburse salary, but I

              11  believe it was only for a limited period of

              12  time; is that correct?

              13          A.   About a year.

              14          Q.   Okay.  And in Dr. Holland's

              15  instance, was it to be the entire term of the

              16  agreement that was to be reimbursed?

              17          A.   That's what I recall.

              18          Q.   Okay.  You never spoke to

              19  Mr. Arquilla at any time about this case in

              20  any way; is that right?

              21          A.   About this case?

              22          Q.   Yes.

              23          A.   No.

              24          Q.   Now, in terms of the scheduling

              25  of Dr. Holland's surgeries, those would be



                                                               130


               1  scheduled through Mercy personnel; is that

               2  correct?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   And the surgeries were performed

               5  at Mercy hospitals; is that correct?

               6          A.   I believe so.

               7          Q.   Dr. Holland had no office at

               8  Toledo Clinic; is that right?

               9          A.   He did not.

              10          Q.   The equipment that was used for

              11  Dr. Holland to perform his surgeries was not

              12  provided by Toledo Clinic, but instead by

              13  Mercy, correct?

              14          A.   It was not provided by Toledo

              15  Clinic.

              16          Q.   You don't know who provided it?

              17          A.   I don't.

              18          Q.   But you had expected that when

              19  Dr. Holland was working in a Mercy hospital,

              20  Mercy would provide him with the equipment and

              21  supplies he needed?

              22          A.   That's usually the case.

              23          Q.   Okay.  And Mercy provided

              24  Dr. Holland with staff that assisted him with

              25  his surgeries, correct?



                                                               131


               1          A.   That's an assumption on my part.

               2          Q.   But Toledo Clinic didn't?

               3          A.   We did not.

               4          Q.   Okay.  So if there was someone

               5  other than Dr. Holland in the surgery, they

               6  were being provided by Mercy, not Toledo

               7  Clinic?

               8          A.   I believe so.

               9          Q.   Okay.  In terms of the way the

              10  service agreement worked, essentially Mercy

              11  would make a payment to Toledo Clinic under

              12  that service agreement, and then Toledo Clinic

              13  would make, in turn, a payment to Dr. Holland;

              14  is that correct?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.  The

              17  service agreement speaks for itself.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you -- did

              19  Mercy, to your knowledge -- strike that.

              20             To your knowledge, did Toledo

              21  Clinic perform peer review of Dr. Holland, or

              22  was it your understanding that was occurring

              23  at Mercy?

              24          A.   To my knowledge, during my

              25  tenure, Toledo Clinic did no peer review on



                                                               132


               1  Dr. Holland.  And I was in all of the peer

               2  reviews that were held there.

               3          Q.   To your knowledge, if Mercy

               4  terminated the service agreement with Toledo

               5  Clinic, by which the payments were being made

               6  to Toledo Clinic, what then was to happen in

               7  terms of Dr. Holland, to your knowledge?  And

               8  if you don't have it --

               9          A.   I don't have it.

              10          Q.   Okay.  Just be speculating or

              11  guessing?

              12          A.   Well, it was a five-year

              13  contract, which I believe expired after I

              14  left, so I can't fill in any of the blanks

              15  there.

              16          Q.   You didn't have any anticipation

              17  it was going to end early, correct?

              18          A.   No.  No.

              19          Q.   In fact, what we showed earlier

              20  was an indication from Mr. Arquilla that he

              21  would like to renew it at the end of the term?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   Do you know how the salary amount

              24  was arrived at in terms of what Dr. Holland

              25  was paid?



                                                               133


               1          A.   Having spent some time in the

               2  hospital systems, they -- they're under very

               3  rigid guidelines on what they can pay a

               4  physician.  And they have consultants they

               5  use, they have national databanks.  That's, I

               6  believe, where they would have come up with

               7  that number.

               8          Q.   Okay.

               9          A.   Hospitals have far more hoops to

              10  jump through than a for profit does, although

              11  it's dangerous in both arenas.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall what --

              13  yeah.

              14             Do you recall with any of the

              15  physicians, where Mercy paid salary to Toledo

              16  Clinic, that was then paid to the doctor?  So

              17  whether it was Holland, or any of these other

              18  surgeons, do you know if you had any

              19  discussions in any of those instances what

              20  would happen if Mercy stopped making those

              21  payments?

              22          A.   Well, in the ones I'm familiar

              23  with, they were -- they were for a year.  And

              24  the payments stopped after the year, and the

              25  doctor was on their own.



                                                               134


               1          Q.   That was planned?

               2          A.   That was planned.

               3          Q.   Okay.  So you hadn't had the --

               4  as you stated earlier, you didn't have

               5  discussions about Dr. Holland's, because you

               6  didn't anticipate it was going to be ended

               7  early, correct?

               8          A.   That's correct.

               9          Q.   In terms of Dr. Holland's

              10  day-to-day performing of physician services,

              11  whether surgery or follow-up visits, what

              12  involvement did Toledo Clinic have in that?

              13          A.   None that I know of.

              14          Q.   That was essentially done all

              15  through Mercy?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Come back to your affidavit,

              18  Exhibit 115.  It's the first one we handed out

              19  today, so it might be at the bottom of the

              20  pile.

              21          A.   It's at the top.

              22          Q.   Oh, it's at the top.

              23             I believe, unless I misunderstood

              24  your testimony, am I -- I believe you

              25  testified that you were not involved in the



                                                               135


               1  referral process to Dr. Holland, correct?

               2          A.   I was not involved in the

               3  referral process.

               4          Q.   Okay.  So you don't know how

               5  referrals were made whatsoever, correct?

               6          A.   I do -- well, first of all, I'm

               7  not a potted plant, and there is -- there is

               8  -- referrals are made in certain ways, okay?

               9  You go to the market, and you try to get

              10  referrals.  I'm familiar with that.  I don't

              11  know specifically what Mercy did for him.

              12          Q.   Right.

              13          A.   Okay.  I know what referrals are.

              14          Q.   Okay.  No.  I -- I'm sorry.  I

              15  didn't mean to infer you didn't know generally

              16  what referrals were.  I was talking about

              17  Mercy.  I'm sorry if my question --

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   -- didn't include the word.

              20  Thank you for correcting it.

              21             In paragraph 6 of your affidavit --

              22  by the way, first of all, were you in front of

              23  the notary public when you signed this --

              24          A.   I was.

              25          Q.   -- document?



                                                               136


               1             And in paragraph 6, if you can just

               2  read that to yourself for a minute.

               3          A.   Okay.

               4          Q.   You say, in this paragraph, based

               5  upon your understanding of the facts of the

               6  relationship between Dr. Holland and

               7  Defendants, correct?

               8          A.   Correct.

               9          Q.   I had no reason to believe that

              10  either Defendant mistreated Dr. Holland based

              11  upon his race or national origin in any way,

              12  correct?

              13          A.   Correct.

              14          Q.   Now, in terms of the method that

              15  the referrals were made at the hospital, you

              16  don't have any knowledge as to how they were

              17  made, correct?  Internally at Mercy?

              18          A.   I don't.

              19          Q.   And so you don't have knowledge,

              20  one way or the other, as to whether race or

              21  national origin played into those referrals at

              22  all?  You don't know one way or the other, do

              23  you?

              24          A.   I guess I don't.

              25          Q.   Well, do you know why it is



                                                               137


               1  though that this affidavit -- I know you

               2  didn't prepare it, sir.  But do you know why

               3  this affidavit would contain this statement,

               4  when you really don't know one way or the

               5  other, as you sit here today?

               6          A.   I -- I'm not familiar with the

               7  entire case of -- of Dr. Holland, okay?  But

               8  if I answer the question accurately, if, you

               9  know, I don't know that -- I have no knowledge

              10  that he was being mistreated, based upon his

              11  race or national origin.  I just don't.

              12          Q.   Right.  And you don't have any

              13  knowledge that he wasn't, the opposite?

              14          A.   That's true.  I don't.

              15          Q.   Okay.  But you didn't say the

              16  opposite here.  You just said the affirmative,

              17  which benefits Mercy.

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              19             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you see

              21  that here?

              22             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) In any event,

              24  you've given sworn testimony today, correct?

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  Form and foundation.



                                                               138


               1          A.   I hope so.

               2          Q.   Yeah.  This is under oath.  And

               3  you're doing your best here today to tell the

               4  truth; is that correct?

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   Okay.  So to the extent that that

               7  paragraph would have to be modified by your

               8  answer, you -- you would modify it, correct?

               9          A.   I think it's a fair statement,

              10  that I have no reason to believe he's been

              11  mistreated, based upon race or national -- I

              12  heard none of that.

              13          Q.   Okay.  But you have no reason to

              14  believe the opposite, do you?

              15             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Just like I

              18  just said to you.

              19          A.   I don't know how to answer the

              20  question.  I think I've answered it to the

              21  best of my ability.

              22          Q.   Well, for example, did anyone

              23  ever tell you that -- that Mercy attempted to

              24  replace Dr. Holland with a Pakistani doctor

              25  that --



                                                               139


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               2             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- Dr. Hashmi

               4  had personally picked out named Dr. Hasan?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Form and foundation.

               6             MS. SILVERS:  Objection, form and

               7  foundation.

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   You never heard anything --

              10          A.   I never heard any of that.

              11          Q.   Okay.  Well, I'm just, you know,

              12  I'm just looking in terms of like when you're

              13  signing an affidavit, things that you may not

              14  know.  You didn't know that part, correct?

              15          A.   I have an opinion on it.

              16          Q.   About a Pakistani doctor --

              17          A.   No.  I have an opinion that he

              18  wasn't mistreated, based --

              19          Q.   Hold on.

              20          A.   -- on race or national origin.

              21          Q.   All right.  All right.  You have

              22  an opinion?  And what are the facts --

              23          A.   I believe he wasn't.  I don't

              24  know anything about it.

              25          Q.   Okay.  You don't know anything



                                                               140


               1  about it?

               2          A.   In my arena, that was not a topic

               3  of conversation, in my arena at the Toledo

               4  Clinic.

               5          Q.   Okay.  So let's go back for a

               6  second.  You're telling me that Dr. Nahhas

               7  never said anything to you, or strike that.

               8             Dr. Nahhas never said anything to

               9  you about Dr. Brunsting complaining about the

              10  mafia at the hospital, correct?

              11             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              12          A.   He did not.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And Doctor --

              18  and Dr. -- Dr. Nahhas never told you anything

              19  along the lines that Dr. Brunsting complained

              20  he couldn't break in with referrals, because

              21  of Dr. Hashmi controlling things behind the

              22  scenes?

              23             MS. SILVERS:  Same objection --

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) He didn't tell

              25  you that, correct?

               4  foundation, mischaracterization of the record.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And, sir, to

               6  be clear, this is on -- this is on audiotape,

               7  just so you're aware.

               8          A.   I have not had -- I haven't said

               9  anything.  I'm aware.

              10          Q.   Okay.  But he didn't talk to you

              11  about that, correct?

              12          A.   No.

              13             MS. SILVERS:  Continuing objection.

              14          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And then you

              15  also didn't have discussions at -- at all with

              16  Dr. Burdine about why he believed he wasn't

              17  getting referrals?

              18          A.   I never met Dr. Burdine.  I -- he

              19  -- I believe he was ill for some point, a long

              20  period of time, if it's the same guy.

              21          Q.   He wound up passing.  He got sick

              22  and passed away.

              23          A.   I didn't know that, but I had no

              24  conversations with him.  I -- I just didn't.

              25  I never met the guy.

               1          Q.   You never heard words to the

               2  effect that he was complaining about Muslims

               3  --

               4          A.   No.

               5             MS. SILVERS:  Objection --

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

               7             MS. SILVERS:  -- asked and

               8  answered.

               9          Q.   -- or that he wasn't getting

              10  referrals because of the quality?

              12  and --

              13             MS. SILVERS:  Form, foundation,

              14  asked and answered, mis --

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  --

              16  mischaracterization of the record.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Now --

              18             MS. SILVERS:  Join.

              19             MR. ARCHINACO:  Okay.  Just to be

              20  clear, I am going to finish my question before

              21  you start objecting.  You keep doing this, and

              22  you keep objecting.  I'm watching the

              23  transcript.  You keep objecting in the middle

              24  of my question, and it doesn't allow me to

              25  finish my question.  So you're permitted to



                                                               143


               1  make your objections, but let me finish my

               2  questions first, because by doing that, we do

               3  not have a correct record, so I just ask for

               4  that professionalism.

               5             Can we go back to read that last

               6  question that got interrupted?

               7             (Whereupon, the court reporter read

               8  back the requested testimony.)

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  Right.  Thank you.

              10          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Were you ever

              11  provided any information that Dr. Phillips,

              12  who is at the hospital, also complained about

              13  referrals seeming to be skewed, based upon the

              14  fact that he was white?

              15          A.   No.

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

              17             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

              22          A.   I have no knowledge of that.

              23          Q.   Did anyone -- have you ever heard

              24  that there is a pattern at Mercy, where at

              25  least four different white surgeons, with



                                                               144


               1  superior quality results, were not provided

               2  referrals, but instead the patients were sent

               3  to Dr. Hashmi?

               4             MS. SILVERS:  Objection --

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form --

               9  mischaracterization of the record.

              10          A.   I have -- I have not heard that

              11  ever.

              12          Q.   What did you know about

              13  Dr. Hashmi's statistics, if any?

              14          A.   I only -- I saw them very, very

              15  briefly when Dr. Holland and I were down

              16  meeting with Tom Arquilla, and it was really

              17  just a flash.  And I didn't study them.  We

              18  were there to talk about Dr. Holland's

              19  concerns, and -- and look at his data.

              20          Q.   You never -- now, in your

              21  affidavit, do you -- did you have any

              22  understanding as to what -- strike that.

              23             In paragraph 6, you're -- the word

              24  race is used and national origin.  Do you see

              25  that?



                                                               145


               1          A.   I do.

               2          Q.   Okay.  What is your definition of

               3  the word race?

               4          A.   Race?

               5          Q.   Yes.  As you're using it in the

               6  affidavit.

               7          A.   Someone else wrote the affidavit.

               8          Q.   Okay.  So you're not sure what --

               9          A.   Well, I have an understanding of

              10  what race is.

              11          Q.   Okay.  How about national origin?

              12          A.   National origin, I'm -- I

              13  understand what that is.

              14          Q.   Do you think there is any

              15  distinction between race and national origin?

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              17  speculation.

              18          A.   I think, in context of what we're

              19  talking about today, I don't.  I just don't.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Did you ever hear words

              21  used that if Dr. Holland changed his first

              22  name to Mohammed, he would receive more

              23  referrals?

              24          A.   I did not --

                                                               146


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               2  foundation, and --

               3          A.   I did not hear that ever.

               4          Q.   Do you know who Dr. Eltaki is?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   Do you know what Dr. Andrabi's

               7  national origin is?

               8          A.   You know, I really don't.  I

               9  didn't -- I tried not -- I tried to look at

              10  everybody there as -- in the world as humans

              11  and physicians and people.

              12          Q.   Uh-huh.

              13          A.   It doesn't ring my bell like it

              14  does some people.

              15          Q.   Fair enough.  So you subscribe to

              16  the theory we're all part of one race, the

              17  human race, at the end of the day --

              18          A.   I do.

              19          Q.   -- correct?

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And that

              22  variances between people's skin colors have to

              23  do with the chemicals in their skin, as

              24  opposed to being a separate race, correct?

              25             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.



                                                               147


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               2  speculation.

               3          A.   Are we getting Biblical now?

               4          Q.   No.  No.  I'm just, actually, I

               5  want to know your understanding of it.

               6          A.   My understand --

               7          Q.   Do you believe that -- do you

               8  believe that -- do you believe that people are

               9  all one race, but their skin color can vary

              10  based upon pigmentations included in them?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              12  speculation.

              13             MS. SILVERS:  Objection,

              14  speculation, form.

              15          A.   If you follow the DNA back far

              16  enough, we're all one people, yes.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              18             And I think I might be done, so let

              19  me just check my notes.

              20             I might have some follow-up when

              21  Mr. Wiencek asks questions, but for now, I'm

              22  done.  Thank you for your time.

              23          A.   Where did he go?

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Right here.

              25          A.   Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.

               1             MR. WIENCEK:  I do have a few

               2  questions.

               3                     EXAMINATION

               4  BY MR. WIENCEK:

               5          Q.   Let's go back to your affidavit

               6  and Exhibit 115.

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   Is there anything in that

               9  affidavit that you believe is incorrect?

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

              11  extent it -- asked and answered, or to the

              12  extent it would exclude any testimony from

              13  today.

              14          A.   I believe this is accurate.

              15          Q.   Was there anything in that

              16  affidavit that you were forced to agree to?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   Is there anything in that

              19  affidavit that -- that you would now recant?

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   Now, you were an administrator at

              22  the Toledo Clinic between 2010 and 2015; is

              23  that correct?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Did that position provide you



                                                               149


               1  with knowledge of the Toledo Clinic's

               2  corporate structure and operations?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   Did that include knowledge of the

               5  Toledo Clinic's relationship with

               6  Mercy-St. Vincent?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   Were you employed in your

               9  administrative position at the Toledo Clinic

              10  when Dr. Holland was hired by the clinic in

              11  2013?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   Were you involved in recruiting

              14  Dr. Holland to the clinic?

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              16          A.   On the periphery.

              17          Q.   Excuse me?

              18          A.   I was one of the people he met

              19  with.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Why was he being

              21  recruited?

              22          A.   The cardiology department had not

              23  had a cardiothoracic surgeon in about a

              24  decade.  There were enormous market pressures

              25  from ProMedica to, you know, take over all of



                                                               150


               1  the cardiothoracic surgery, and we needed help

               2  recruiting.

               3          Q.   Did you, or anyone else that you

               4  know of at the Toledo Clinic involved in the

               5  recruiting of Dr. Holland, ever inform anyone

               6  that Mercy-St. Vincent was seeking to hire a

               7  staff surgeon, because they were aware that

               8  their mortality or other statistics were

               9  deficient?

              10          A.   Never heard that.

              11          Q.   Was Dr. Holland interviewed by

              12  people at the clinic?

              13          A.   He was.

              14          Q.   How many?

              15          A.   Well, he would have certainly --

              16  I'm speculating.  I know when I interviewed

              17  him.

              18          Q.   Well, you didn't -- you

              19  interviewed him?

              20          A.   Yeah.

              21          Q.   Okay.

              22          A.   As the administrator, I

              23  interviewed him.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Did you sit in on any of

              25  the other interviews?



                                                               151


               1          A.   I do not.

               2          Q.   Now, at any time during the

               3  process of interviewing, were you aware that

               4  anyone told Dr. Holland he was being hired to

               5  beef up the Mercy-St. Vincent cardiac surgery

               6  program with a competent valve surgeon?

               7          A.   No.

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

               9  to the extent it calls for speculation.

              10          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Was Dr. Holland

              11  interviewed by people at Mercy-St. Vincent?

              12          A.   If he was, I was not present.

              13          Q.   Okay.  I believe you testified

              14  earlier, and correct me if I'm wrong, that it

              15  was Dr. Nahhas who was driving the -- the

              16  retention of Dr. Holland to the Toledo Clinic?

              17          A.   Well, he was representing the

              18  entire department, cardiology department, but

              19  he was the -- he was the spokesperson.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Was he the one who was

              21  making the ultimate decision?

              22          A.   Well, he had a lot of sway, yes.

              23  I mean, he didn't have the ultimate decision.

              24          Q.   Who did?

              25          A.   I believe it was -- we all sit



                                                               152


               1  down and vote.  Okay, we want this physician

               2  or not, and we wanted the physician.  But his

               3  vote would have counted big.

               4          Q.   When you say we all sit down and

               5  vote, who was -- who are the people that were

               6  voting?  Were they Toledo Clinic --

               7          A.   Let me rephrase that.  After --

               8  let's take Dr. Holland, for example.  After

               9  he'd been through all the interviews and his

              10  credentialing look good, we knew we could go

              11  forward, we'd talk about him, either during or

              12  after an executive meeting like we would every

              13  new hire, new physician.  And basically say

              14  how do we feel about this.  And the cardiology

              15  department was gung-ho, and that's all I

              16  needed, from where I sat.

              17          Q.   When you say we, is that the

              18  Toledo Clinic?

              19          A.   It is.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Did anyone from

              21  Mercy-St. Vincent have authority as to whether

              22  or not the Toledo Clinic actually hired

              23  Dr. Holland?

              24             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              25          A.   I don't -- I don't -- you know, I



                                                               153


               1  don't believe so.  I mean, if -- if they

               2  didn't -- I don't know.  It was their money.

               3  They probably -- I mean, I'm speculating now.

               4          Q.   Don't speculate.

               5          A.   Okay.

               6          Q.   What was your understanding of

               7  Dr. Holland's employment status at the clinic?

               8          A.   He was a -- he was a Toledo

               9  Clinic employee.

              10          Q.   Did he ultimately become partner?

              11          A.   I believe so.

              12          Q.   And what privileges would he have

              13  as a -- as a Toledo Clinic partner?

              14          A.   You -- you get to vote in the

              15  annual meeting, you can run for open positions

              16  on the board, or the executive committee, you

              17  can be assigned to, you know, the finance

              18  committee, the personnel committee, if -- if

              19  you're up to doing it.  You get to come to the

              20  annual meeting, and you get to go to the --

              21  well, if you're on the -- well, any member was

              22  welcome to come to the board retreats, but

              23  they were always on Saturday morning at

              24  7:00 a.m., and just the board guys would show

              25  up.



                                                               154


               1          Q.   And that's all Toledo Clinic,

               2  correct?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   Now, on what basis do you claim

               5  he was an employee of the clinic?

               6          A.   Because he had a Toledo Clinic

               7  employment contract.

               8          Q.   Have you seen that contract

               9  before?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   Handing you what's been marked

              12  earlier as Defendant's Exhibit G.  Just want

              13  you to take a look at that.  Does that look

              14  like Dr. Holland's employment contract?

              15          A.   Yes.  Yeah, it is.  And it --

              16  there is two -- it's for a physician without

              17  an existing practice.

              18          Q.   Okay.

              19          A.   So if he'd been a, for example,

              20  if he'd been established here for 20 years, he

              21  would have had one that said for physician

              22  with existing practice.

              23          Q.   Okay.

              24          A.   But the language is basically the

              25  same.  They're pretty much boilerplate.



                                                               155


               1          Q.   Okay.  Did anyone from

               2  Mercy-St. Vincent write or provide the terms

               3  of Dr. Holland's employment contract with the

               4  clinic?

               5          Q.   No.

               6             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

               7  extent it calls for speculation.

               8          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) What was your

               9  understanding of your -- of Dr. Holland's

              10  employment status with Mercy-St. Vincent?

              11          A.   He was employed by the Toledo

              12  Clinic, and we had a professional services

              13  agreement between the entities.

              14          Q.   And have you read the services

              15  agreement?

              16          A.   I did at one point in time.  I

              17  haven't in five or six years, but ....

              18          Q.   Did you recall anything in the

              19  services agreement that establishes

              20  Dr. Holland as a Mercy-St. Vincent employee?

              21             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              22          A.   No.

              23          Q.   Did you ever tell Dr. Holland he

              24  was going to be a Mercy employee?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               156


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               2          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Who had the

               3  right to control the manner and means of how

               4  Dr. Holland practiced as a surgeon at

               5  Mercy-St. Vincent?

               6          A.   In -- in the clinic model, which

               7  he was in, that's driven by, you know, if

               8  you're -- if you're practicing well, nothing

               9  happens.  You get paid, your -- your volumes

              10  build.

              11             If -- if he had gotten into

              12  trouble, say, he would be -- he could be

              13  summoned for peer review at the clinic.  I

              14  don't -- that did not happen on my watch.

              15          Q.   Uh-huh.

              16          A.   Okay?  I just don't -- wasn't

              17  any.  I would have been there.  But that's all

              18  I can -- I can only speak to the clinic.  I

              19  can't speak to what Mercy would do.

              20          Q.   Well, who had the ultimate

              21  decision as to how to perform surgery?

              22             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              23          A.   I think it's the physician.

              24          Q.   Okay.  And who determines the

              25  skill required to perform that surgery?



                                                               157


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               2          A.   Well, that's -- we look for board

               3  certification, we look for credentialing, we

               4  look at the malpractice.  Okay?  That's --

               5  that was what we always looked at.

               6          Q.   So that would be something Toledo

               7  Clinic would review?

               8          A.   Of course, if he was our

               9  employee, which he was.

              10          Q.   Now, were there any wage payments

              11  made to him directly by Mercy-St. Vincent?

              12          A.   Not that I know of.

              13          Q.   And who determined the amount of

              14  Dr. Holland's compensation?

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object as asked and

              16  answered.

              17          A.   Again, that goes back to kind of

              18  the rules and regulations that both companies

              19  have to follow under federal law.  I mean,

              20  there is a salary range, that you don't want

              21  to get the attention of Medicare.  And you

              22  look at the community, what the community

              23  standard is, what they're paid in the

              24  community.

              25             And I believe Mercy had access to



                                                               158


               1  better data than I did.  I looked at the MGMA

               2  data, Medical Group Management Association,

               3  which is pretty accurate.  And that's the

               4  figure that we -- that they came up with, that

               5  everyone thought we could live with.

               6          Q.   Did -- did Mercy pay any

               7  additional fees above the salary to --

               8          A.   I believe they --

               9          Q.   -- to --

              10          A.   -- I believe they paid -- I can't

              11  recall if there was a recruitment fee

              12  involved, but they would have paid that, and

              13  they would have paid for relocation fees, I

              14  believe.

              15          Q.   Was there any further service

              16  fees, management fees?

              17          A.   Not that I know of.

              18          Q.   Who paid Dr. Holland's benefits?

              19          A.   Well, under the Toledo Clinic

              20  contract, those benefits would be -- they're

              21  not covered by the clinic.  They're charged to

              22  your cost center.  There is no free lunch

              23  there.

              24          Q.   So who provided Dr. Holland with

              25  medical benefits?



                                                               159


               1          A.   Toledo Clinic did.

               2          Q.   Did Dr. Holland receive medical

               3  reimbursement insurance and 401(k) profit

               4  sharing from the Toledo Clinic?

               5          A.   That would be available to him.

               6          Q.   By the Toledo Clinic?

               7          A.   Well, it's a -- you have access

               8  to a 401(k) that you can put your money into,

               9  you know?  And I believe physicians can put up

              10  to 50,000 of their, a year of their own money

              11  in, but I -- that wasn't my bailiwick.  He

              12  would have done that with the human resource

              13  people, if he wanted to take advantage of it.

              14          Q.   But would that be Toledo Clinic

              15  human resource people?

              16          A.   Yeah.

              17          Q.   Now, who made his deductions for

              18  tax purposes?

              19          A.   That would be a process of the

              20  Toledo Clinic.

              21          Q.   How was Dr. Holland treated for

              22  tax and payroll purposes at the Toledo Clinic?

              23          A.   W-2.

              24          Q.   And what does W-2 mean?

              25          A.   It's -- it's an IRS penalty form



                                                               160


               1  that we all have to pay every year, taxes,

               2  federal, state, local are taken out.  It's a

               3  cash corporation, and they cash out at the end

               4  of every year, so the accounting department

               5  gets no sleep for the last two weeks in

               6  December, and then they start fresh in

               7  January.

               8          Q.   Are W-2s done only for employees?

               9          A.   Only done for employees?

              10          Q.   That's correct.

              11          A.   I believe so.

              12          Q.   Was Dr. Holland required to

              13  practice exclusively at Mercy-St. Vincent?

              14          A.   Not by the Toledo Clinic.

              15          Q.   Could he have maintained a

              16  separate private surgical practice while he

              17  was practicing at Mercy-St. Vincent?

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              19          A.   Under the auspices of the Toledo

              20  Clinic, he could have done that.

              21          Q.   Okay.  Could he have had

              22  privileges at other hospitals in the Toledo

              23  market, if there was a need for his skill set?

              24          A.   I believe so.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.



                                                               161


               1          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Who paid

               2  Dr. Holland's malpractice insurance?

               3          A.   He did, under the Toledo Clinic

               4  model.

               5          Q.   Did Mercy have any authority to

               6  terminate Dr. Holland as a surgeon?

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               8          A.   I believe at the end of five

               9  years, his contract was up.  I was gone by

              10  then.  You know, Mercy could quit -- again, I

              11  haven't read his contract in like seven years.

              12  I believe they could renew, or choose not to

              13  renew, in which case, he would be a Toledo

              14  Clinic employee still, but would be on his own

              15  to generate income.

              16          Q.   Could Mercy terminate Dr. Holland

              17  as a surgeon mid-contract without the Toledo

              18  Clinic's approval?

              19          A.   I don't think so.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Who supervised

              21  Dr. Holland?

              22          A.   Dr. Holland did.

              23          Q.   Did anyone from Mercy-St.

              24  Vincent, that you're aware of, supervise

              25  Dr. Holland?



                                                               162


               1          A.   I wouldn't know about that.  I

               2  doubt it.  I mean, he was a -- again, he was a

               3  clinic employee.

               4          Q.   Who determined when and how long

               5  Dr. Holland worked each day?

               6          A.   It's up to the physician.  We're

               7  an eat what you kill model.

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               9          A.   Yeah.

              10          Q.   Now, with respect to the

              11  relationship between Mercy-St. Vincent and the

              12  Toledo Clinic, I am going to ask you a set of

              13  questions.  Are you aware of any common

              14  ownership between the two entities?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   Are you aware of any common

              17  management between the two entities?

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

              19  of the last question.  Object to the same.

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   Are you aware of any centralized

              22  control of labor relations between the two

              23  entities?

              24          A.   No.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.



                                                               163


               1          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Are you aware of

               2  any common financial control between the two

               3  entities?

               4          A.   No.

               5             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               6          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Are you aware of

               7  the two entities sharing any common assets?

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   Are you aware of whether that

              11  both entities share common identification and

              12  provider numbers?

              13          A.   I don't believe -- they do not.

              14          Q.   Do you know whether they share

              15  common human resource departments?

              16          A.   No.

              17          Q.   Are there any transfers of

              18  personnel or funds between the two entities?

              19          A.   You know, other than

              20  Dr. Holland's contract, that was a

              21  professional services agreement, that's the

              22  only one I know of.

              23          Q.   Okay.  Do they share common

              24  officers and board of directors?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               164


               1          Q.   Do they share common accounts

               2  receivable?

               3          A.   No.

               4             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Do they share

               1          Q.   Did they share accountants?

               2          A.   I'm sorry?

               3          Q.   Do they share accountants?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Now, we've had some testimony by

               6  you earlier about the phrase joint endeavor.

               7  But the question that wasn't asked is, what

               8  did you mean by that statement when you made

               9  it?

              10          A.   Well, what I meant by it was we

              11  were trying to, which I think I laid out

              12  pretty clear today --

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              14  Go ahead.  You can answer.

              15             MS. SILVERS:  You may answer.

              16             MR. ARCHINACO:  Please do.

              17          A.   -- was that we were trying to

              18  expand into the marketplace better than we had

              19  on our own, and we wanted to see what things

              20  we could work together on with Mercy.  We

              21  tried it with ProMedica and failed.  And we

              22  tried it with the medical school and failed.

              23             And, you know, they -- their

              24  administrative team over there was, we thought

              25  pretty good, from where we sat, and you know,



                                                               166


               1  open to ideas.  And that's how it got started.

               2  And that's what I meant by it.  It was just,

               3  you know, I don't think I'd change the word

               4  again, but it was like kind of new beginning,

               5  you know, let's see what we can do.

               6          Q.   Yeah.  Have you ever heard of the

               7  phrase joint employer?

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   Okay.  Did the Toledo Clinic

              11  cardiologists make patient referrals to

              12  Dr. Holland?

              13          A.   I believe they did.

              14          Q.   And how many cardiologists did

              15  the clinic employ while you were there between

              16  2013 and 2015?

              17          A.   Oh, boy.  I want to say about

              18  eight.

              19          Q.   Did all of them refer patient

              20  consults to Dr. Holland?

              21          A.   I -- I doubt it.  I mean, it

              22  would depend on the insurance.

              23          Q.   Okay.

              24          A.   Okay?

              25          Q.   How many of the cardiologists



                                                               167


               1  between 2013 and 2015 at the Toledo Clinic

               2  were Caucasian when -- when Dr. Holland was

               3  there?

               4          A.   See, now we're getting under that

               5  race issue.

               6          Q.   Uh-huh.  By Caucasian, I mean

               7  white skin.

               8          A.   We --

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              10          A.   I'm sorry?

              11             MS. SILVERS:  You may answer.

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  I objected.  I

              13  don't agree there are different races of

              14  people.  Object.

              15          A.   That the cardiology -- the

              16  cardiology group at the Toledo Clinic is made

              17  up of -- of entirely Middle Eastern

              18  physicians, maybe a Pakistani, mostly Syrians.

              19  That's who they are.  The clinic is a -- is a

              20  melting pot.

              21          Q.   Are they people of color?

              22          A.   I -- you know, I don't --

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              24          A.   -- that troubles me.  I don't

              25  know how to answer the question.



                                                               168


               1          Q.   What color did you view their

               2  skin as, is it white?

               3          A.   Well, the Syrians, to me, they

               4  look -- they look Caucasian to me.  The

               5  Pakistani was darker.

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7          A.   But it didn't matter.  They were

               8  all good doctors.

               9          Q.   And so these Middle Eastern

              10  people that you have described in Toledo

              11  Clinic, they had no issues with -- with

              12  referring consults to Dr. Holland?

              13          A.   They wanted him here in Toledo.

              14  It doesn't make any sense that they wouldn't.

              15          Q.   Are you aware of any issues --

              16          A.   None.

              17          Q.   -- that -- on behalf of any of

              18  the cardiologists that you're aware of that

              19  were of color or Middle Eastern who had issues

              20  --

              21             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object -- object to

              22  the form.  Object as it mischaracterized his

              23  testimony.  He's already testified he doesn't

              24  know about the Mercy doctors.

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  We don't need your



                                                               169


               1  testimony.

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  I'm not testifying.

               3  You're just trying to mislead into an answer

               4  you want.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) You can answer.

               6          A.   Could you restate the question?

               7          Q.   Are you aware of any issues that

               8  Dr. Holland had receiving referrals from

               9  Middle Eastern or other doctors of color?

              10          A.   No.

              11             MR. ARCHINACO:  Same objection.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did Dr. Holland

              13  ever complain to you that he was not receiving

              14  referrals based on his race or national

              15  origin?

              16          A.   Not to me.

              17          Q.   Did he ever say anything to you

              18  that suggested he thought he was not receiving

              19  referrals based on race or national origin?

              20          A.   Not to me.

              21          Q.   Based on your experience with

              22  your relationship between Mercy-St. Vincent

              23  and the Toledo Clinic, do you believe

              24  referrals were made based on a surgeon's race

              25  or national origin?



                                                               170


               1          A.   Absolutely not.

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Now, you

               4  testified earlier that you attended a meeting

               5  with Dr. Holland and Thomas Arquilla, where

               6  Dr. Holland was addressing the nature of

               7  referrals and Arquilla offered him an

               8  opportunity to provide a reference, if he was

               9  unsatisfied.  Did you attend that meeting?

              10          A.   I did.

              11             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

              12  of the question.

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did you ever

              14  express surprise to Dr. Holland, after that

              15  meeting, that Mr. Arquilla made such a

              16  statement?

              17          A.   Did I -- I don't know.  I don't

              18  recall.

              19          Q.   Did you ever express your view to

              20  Dr. Holland you felt Mr. Arquilla's statement

              21  was a threat to him?

              22          A.   I did not.

              23          Q.   Did you ever apologize to

              24  Dr. Holland on behalf of Mercy-St. Vincent,

              25  because you felt it was discriminating against



                                                               171


               1  Dr. Holland regarding referrals based on his

               2  race or national origin?

               3          A.   No.

               4             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did you ever

               6  apologize, because you felt the physicians

               7  from the Toledo Cardiac Consultants were

               8  discriminating against Dr. Holland regarding

               9  referrals based on his race or national

              10  origin?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   During the time you had been in

              13  your administrative position at the Toledo

              14  Clinic, while Dr. Holland was employed there,

              15  has anyone, including Dr. Holland, complained

              16  to you that referrals were being made based on

              17  a person's race or national origin?

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object --

              19          A.   No.

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- to the form.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did you receive

              22  any complaints from Dr. Holland, or anyone at

              23  the Mercy, at Mercy-St. Vincent, or the Toledo

              24  Clinic, who indicated that Dr. Holland's --

              25  any of Dr. Holland's terms or conditions were



                                                               172


               1  affected in any way because of his race or

               2  national origin?

               3             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Did Dr. Holland ever discuss any

               6  concerns with you about adequate number of

               7  referrals because of his race or national

               8  origin?

               9          A.   Not to me.

              10          Q.   Did he ever allege that he was

              11  not getting referrals, because he had

              12  protested discrimination at Mercy-St. Vincent?

              13          A.   Not to me.

              14          Q.   Did he ever complain to you that

              15  he was treated differently in any aspect of

              16  his relationship with Mercy-St. Vincent

              17  because he had filed an EEOC discrimination

              18  claim?

              19             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   What is the professional

              22  relationship, if you know, between the Toledo

              23  Clinic and TCC, the cardiac consultants?

              24          A.   I don't know much about that, to

              25  be honest with you.  I don't.



                                                               173


               1          Q.   Have you ever heard that they

               2  were competitors?

               3          A.   You know, I didn't focus on that

               4  group at all.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

               6             Did you ever get any negative

               7  feedback from referring cardiologists about

               8  Dr. Holland?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   When you used the word earlier in

              11  Plaintiff's Exhibit 32, when you used the

              12  phrase political arena, did you intend to

              13  communicate anything about race or national

              14  origin as part of politics?

              15          A.   No.

              16             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did the Toledo

              18  Clinic pay for Tom Leeds' recruitment effort?

              19  Was there a service fee that they paid?

              20          A.   The clinic?

              21          Q.   Yes.

              22          A.   No.

              23          Q.   No.  Okay.  I don't have any

              24  further questions.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Just some



                                                               174


               1  follow-up.  I'm not going to keep you too

               2  long.

               3                    REEXAMINATION

               4  BY MR. ARCHINACO:

               5          Q.   Toledo Clinic, Dr. Nahhas, what

               6  -- where is he from, descended from, Syria --

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   -- is that correct?

               9             And you didn't see any problem

              10  between Dr. Nahhas and Dr. Holland, where they

              11  had any tension --

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   -- because he was from Syria and

              14  Dr. Holland wasn't, correct?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   No.  None at all?

              17          A.   None.

              18          Q.   And -- and to be clear, with

              19  people of Middle Eastern descent that worked

              20  at Toledo Clinic, there was no evidence at

              21  all, to be clear, of any racial motivation,

              22  discrimination of any sort against -- against

              23  Dr. Holland, correct?

              24          A.   I had not seen it.

              25          Q.   And you didn't see any



                                                               175


               1  discrimination by Dr. Holland back against the

               2  doctors at the Toledo Clinic, such as

               3  Dr. Nahhas, correct?

               4          A.   I -- I have no knowledge of that.

               5          Q.   You saw them having a normal

               6  synergy of physicians who worked together; is

               7  that right?

               8          A.   If I saw them, yes.

               9          Q.   Yes, but I mean, you knew --

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   -- just generally, for board

              12  members?

              13          A.   I would know if there was

              14  trouble.

              15          Q.   Okay.  Got it.  So to be clear,

              16  you -- you don't believe -- or strike that.

              17             Do you have any reason to think

              18  that Dr. Holland has ever once accused anyone,

              19  Dr. Nahhas, or anyone else at the Toledo

              20  Clinic, of being racist or racially motivated?

              21          A.   I have no information.  I don't

              22  -- I do not know that.

              23          Q.   Okay.  Well, to be clear, he's

              24  not done that.  He's not accused anyone there

              25  of that.



                                                               176


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               2             MS. SILVERS:  Join.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) I don't want

               4  you walking out of here believing that for

               5  some reason, but he has not done that.

               6             Couple of other questions, just

               7  following up about things.  In terms of

               8  Dr. Holland's hiring initially, did Mercy have

               9  any say whatsoever in whether or not he would

              10  get hired?

              11          A.   Well, they recruited him.  They

              12  got him to our table, our door.  And my

              13  assumption was whatever test they had, he

              14  passed.

              15          Q.   Got it.

              16          A.   Okay?

              17          Q.   Fair enough.  It terms of patient

              18  records, when Dr. Holland would see a patient,

              19  where would those patient records ordinarily

              20  be kept?

              21          A.   Probably down at Mercy.

              22          Q.   Okay.  It wasn't such that if he

              23  had a patient at Mercy for surgery, that

              24  copies would be made and then brought to

              25  Toledo Clinic as well?  They would be



                                                               177


               1  warehoused --

               2          A.   No.  They're on a different EMR

               3  system than the Toledo Clinic.

               4          Q.   Fair enough.  You were asked some

               5  general questions about sharing of accounts

               6  receivables between Mercy and Toledo Clinic.

               7             First, the general -- general

               8  statement is is that, correct, there was no

               9  sharing of accounts receivable between Toledo

              10  Clinic and Mercy, correct?

              11          A.   Correct.

              12          Q.   However, with regard to

              13  Dr. Holland's billing, Mercy did the billing

              14  and did the collections for it; is that right?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   So even though the departments

              17  didn't overlap, the receivable, the account

              18  receivable, was over with Mercy, that was for

              19  them to deal with?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Now, in terms of Toledo Clinic,

              22  am I right that the only surgeon that Toledo

              23  Clinic had ever had, prior to Dr. Holland, was

              24  Dr. O'Grady, and he only performed lungs?

              25          A.   That goes back a long way, but



                                                               178


               1  yes.

               2          Q.   Okay.  So they hadn't -- prior to

               3  Dr. Holland, there had never been a cardiac

               4  surgeon with Toledo Clinic, correct?

               5          A.   Again, it's before my knowledge

               6  base, but I don't -- I don't believe so.

               7          Q.   And again, I just --

               8          A.   Sure.

               9          Q.   -- limit it to your knowledge.

              10             Did you know a gentleman named Buzz

              11  Herman?

              12          A.   I did.

              13          Q.   And were you ever present in any

              14  meetings with he and Dr. Holland?

              15          A.   You know, I don't recall that I

              16  was.  I just --

              17          Q.   Did you ever have any discussions

              18  with Buzz Herman about what Buzz Herman had

              19  told Dr. Holland was the reason that they were

              20  looking for someone at Mercy --

              21          A.   No.

              22          Q.   -- to do cardiothoracic?

              23             In terms of a term -- you had not

              24  anticipated, and in fact, Doctor -- strike

              25  that.



                                                               179


               1             You had not anticipated the service

               2  agreement, by which Dr. Holland performed

               3  procedures, would be terminated early.  You've

               4  already indicated that.  And you've also

               5  indicated it did not occur during the time

               6  period that you were there.

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form.

               8          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) With that in

               9  mind, just generally, you had indicated that

              10  -- that Mercy stopped making payments --

              11  strike that.

              12             Did you have an understanding as to

              13  what would happen if Mercy stopped making the

              14  payments early, what then would happen with

              15  Toledo Clinic?

              16             MS. SILVERS:  Objection to form.

              17  You may answer.

              18          A.   That's -- that's --

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              20          A.   -- I can't answer that, because

              21  it didn't happen --

              22          Q.   While you were there?

              23          A.   -- on my shift.  Yeah.

              24          Q.   Did you ever learn that after

              25  Mercy stopped making payments, that Toledo



                                                               180


               1  Clinic informed Dr. Holland that because of

               2  that, there were no payments going to be made

               3  under his contract?

               4          A.   Once I left, the iron curtain

               5  fell.  I had no knowledge base coming out of

               6  the Toledo Clinic.

               7          Q.   Fair enough.  Now, you had

               8  indicated earlier, I want to cover one topic

               9  about a physician's -- strike that.

              10             A surgeon's salary and when it can

              11  draw the attention of Medicare.  Do you recall

              12  saying something about --

              13          A.   I do.

              14          Q.   -- that?

              15             Now, isn't it true that -- strike

              16  that.

              17             Am I right that the -- strike that.

              18             Am I correct that Medicare, or

              19  strike that.

              20             Am I correct that there is a

              21  concern, or a greater concern, that is raised

              22  with the physician's contract and

              23  incentivizing potential Medicare fraud, when

              24  wRVUs, or RVUs, or output of the physician is

              25  the basis for the payment?



                                                               181


               1             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               3  speculation.

               4             MS. SILVERS:  Form and foundation.

               5          A.   You know, if you're in this

               6  business, you got to get it right.  Okay?  And

               7  it's -- Mercy was very -- they've got their

               8  own laws they have to follow, because they're

               9  not for profit.  And we, as a for profit, we

              10  get almost as much scrutiny as they do.  I

              11  don't think the payment model makes any

              12  different.  It just has to be within a range

              13  of things, because if you bill too much, like

              14  2 million in testosterone, you're going to get

              15  looked at.

              16          Q.   Well, Dr. Holland didn't have a

              17  -- a quantity contract?  He didn't have to

              18  perform a certain --

              19          A.   Right.

              20          Q.   -- number of procedures, correct?

              21          A.   To my knowledge, yes.

              22          Q.   And one of the things that he was

              23  going to do as part of his work was to set up

              24  the Mercy-St. Anne program; is that correct?

              25          A.   Again, I was on the periphery of



                                                               182


               1  that.

               2          Q.   But you know he did that?

               3          A.   I knew he did that.

               4          Q.   Okay.  And so you believe that

               5  there is limitations to a surgeon's contract

               6  in terms of the amount they can be paid, when

               7  it's not wRVU or RVU based?

               8             MS. SILVERS:  Objection.

               9          A.   You know, I've kind of been out

              10  of that field for a while.  I can't answer it

              11  accurately.

              12          Q.   Okay.

              13          A.   I'd be guessing.

              14          Q.   And that's what I was just trying

              15  to understand, because you had made some

              16  comments about it.  Fair enough.

              17             Give me one second.

              18             So you had indicated before that by

              19  the time that Dr. Holland had gotten to Toledo

              20  Clinic, that it -- that he had essentially

              21  passed all of Mercy's tests.  What did you

              22  have an understanding as to what that would

              23  include?

              24          A.   Again, it's -- it's speculation

              25  on my part.  Okay?  I mean, they -- I -- they



                                                               183


               1  have the same criteria any healthcare company

               2  has.  You look at the credentialing, you look

               3  at the malpractice history.  That -- that gets

               4  you through the first couple of doors.  And

               5  then you set up a meeting with a physician to

               6  see if you guys can work together.  Okay?  And

               7  he passed all that stuff.

               8          Q.   And there were interviews with

               9  Mercy employees?

              10          A.   I believe so.

              11          Q.   In addition to just you?

              12          A.   I was not present with those.

              13          Q.   Fair enough.  Do you know whether

              14  or not Dr. Holland also interviewed with

              15  Dr. Kabour?

              16          A.   I don't know that.

              17          Q.   Do you know what Dr. Kabour's

              18  role was at the hospital, if any, at Mercy?

              19          A.   I know he's a cardiologist.

              20          Q.   Do you know whether he had any

              21  positions with Mercy itself?  I don't want you

              22  to speculate --

              23          A.   I don't know that.

              24          Q.   -- or guess.  Okay.

              25             That's all I have.  Thank you for



                                                               184


               1  your time.

               2          A.   Thank you.

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  I have nothing

               4  further.  You can, counsel, can direct him.

               5             MS. SILVERS:  We'll read.

           1                  P R O C E E D I N G S:

           2        Madelyn S. Davidson, having been first

           3     satisfactorily identified by production of her

           4     Massachusetts Driver's License, was duly sworn

           5                and testified as follows:

           6                  MR. BUCKLEY:  Usual stipulations?

           7                  MR. PESKIN:  Yep.

           8                  MR. BUCKLEY:  All objections except

           9          to form and all motions to strike are

          10          reserved until time of trial.

          11                  MR. PESKIN:  Waive the notary.

          12                  MR. BUCKLEY:  Are you representing

          13          Miss Davidson for the purposes of the

          14          deposition?

          15                  MR. PESKIN:  Yes.  An interesting

          16          question, and I hadn't really thought about

          17          it until just now.

          18                  Yeah, I guess I will.

          19                  MR. BUCKLEY:  Okay.  So you will

          20          provide Miss Davidson with a copy of the

          21          transcript.  Thirty days to read and sign?

          22                  MR. PESKIN:  If she wants to read and

          23          sign.

          24                  Do you want to read and sign?

           1                  Let me explain to you what that is.

           2                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           3                  MR. PESKIN:  "Read and sign" means

           4          that when the transcript comes, I send it to

           5          you, you look at it, or you come to my office

           6          and read it, and you actually have a chance

           7          to change some of your answers if you want

           8          to.  It requires more work on your part, but

           9          it also ends up with a more accurate

          10          transcript.

          11                  Do you want to do that?

          12                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

          13                  MR. PESKIN:  Okay.

          14                  MR. BUCKLEY:  Thirty days read and

          15          sign?

          16                  MR. PESKIN:  Sure.

          17                  MR. BUCKLEY:  Otherwise time is

          18          waived.  Excellent.

          19   EXAMINATION BY MR. BUCKLEY:

          20         Q.  Good morning.

          21         A.  Good morning.

          22         Q.  Could you please state your full name.

          23         A.  Madelyn Suzanne Davidson.

          24         Q.  Miss Davidson, my name is Dan Buckley, and

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

                                                                      6


           1   I represent a company called OSJ of North Adams,

           2   LLC, which is essentially Ocean State Job Lot,

           3   regarding a lawsuit which was filed by both Ted and

           4   Susan Davidson regarding an incident of May of 2015.

           5         A.  Mm-hmm.

           6         Q.  Have you ever been to a deposition before?

           7         A.  No.

           8         Q.  Okay.  Attorney Peskin may have explained

           9   it to you, but essentially I'm going to be asking

          10   you some questions this morning.  Hopefully you will

          11   be answering to the best of your ability.

          12                  "I don't know" is a perfectly

          13   acceptable answer.  If you don't know something,

          14   just let me know.  I don't want you to guess or

          15   anything like that because it may be wrong, and

          16   we're just here for truthful, factual information.

          17                  I don't expect to be too long, but if

          18   you do want to take a break, stretch your legs, use

          19   the restroom, speak with Attorney Peskin, please let

          20   me know.  Okay?

          21         A.  Okay.

          22         Q.  All right.  To my right and your left is a

          23   court reporter which is taking down everything we

          24   all say.  It's a difficult job, so we try to not

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC
                                     (508)478-9795

                                                                      7


           1   step on each other's questions or answers.  And I

           2   know in everyday conversation, we all talk over one

           3   another, but I would ask that you wait till I finish

           4   my question before you start answering, and I will

           5   try to do the same thing.  Fair enough?

           6         A.  Mm-hmm.

           7         Q.  Okay.  And I know you're doing it right

           8   now, just nodding and saying "mm-hmm" to mean, "I

           9   understand what you're saying," but when I ask

          10   questions, you're going to have to say "yes" or "no"

          11   because the court reporter can't take down an

          12   "mm-hmm."  So I may just follow up with is that a

          13   "yes" or is that a "no," so we have an accurate

          14   transcript.  Fair enough?

          15         A.  Yes.

          16         Q.  What is your current address?

          17         A.  1750 Northampton Street in Holyoke.

          18         Q.  Okay.  And how long have you lived there?

          19         A.  For about a year and a half.

          20         Q.  And who do you live there with?

          21         A.  I live there with my mom, Susan Davidson,

          22   and my dad, Ted Davidson.

          23         Q.  Okay.  And how long have you lived

          24   there -- excuse me, how long have you lived with

           6         A.  Mm-hmm.

           7         Q.  So does that make you 23?

           8         A.  Yes, almost.

           9         Q.  Okay.  And where did you live before the

          10   Holyoke address?

          11         A.  I lived in Goshen.

          12         Q.  With your parents?

          13         A.  Yep.

          14         Q.  Can you give me a brief description of

          15   your education?

          16         A.  I have my high school education, and I

          17   also -- while I was in high school -- have a trade

          18   education.

          19         Q.  So did you go to a technical school?

          20         A.  Yes.

          21         Q.  Okay.  Which technical school?

          22         A.  Smith Vocational.

          23         Q.  All right.  Did you take certain classes

          24   on a certain trade or vocation?

           9   Sunday -- or Saturday, 10:00 to 6:00 -- or, I'm

          20         Q.  Would your father ever drive you?

          22   mom -- so I would -- on like a regular weekday, I

          23   would go to school, and then I would walk to work,

          24   and then my mom would pick me up when she got out of

          17         Q.  And you had no further information of what

          18   had happened?

          19         A.  No.

          20         Q.  At any point after that weekend was it

          21   explained to you what, if anything, had happened?

          22         A.  Yes.

          23         Q.  Okay.  When?

          24         A.  I can't say for certain exactly when it

           1   was told to me, but I do know it was told within the

           2   first couple of days.

           3         Q.  And that's your best approximation?

           4         A.  Yes.

           5         Q.  All right.  So it wasn't the Saturday.  It

           6   wasn't the Sunday.  So it may have been maybe the

           7   following couple of days?

           8         A.  Yes.

           9         Q.  And who explained what happened?

          10         A.  My mom.

          11         Q.  And what did she say?

          12         A.  She said that the -- there was an incident

          13   at work with the gate and that the lever had fallen

          14   off and hit him in the head.

          15         Q.  Did she explain anything else?

          16         A.  Nope.  She said he went to the hospital,

          17   and that he would be out of work for a while.

          18         Q.  Now, when she said there was an incident

          19   with "the gate," did you know what she was talking

          20   about?

          21         A.  Yes.

          22         Q.  How did you know what she was talking

          23   about?

          24         A.  Because I have seen it before.

           1         Q.  Okay.  And when did you -- you're

           2   referring to "it," the gate?

           3         A.  Yes.

           4         Q.  When did you see it?

           5         A.  I had seen it -- I've been to the store

           6   multiple times.

           7         Q.  To shop or visit your father or both?

           8         A.  A little bit of both.

           9         Q.  And when you mean "to shop," shop at

          10   Tractor Supply or Ocean State or both?

          11         A.  Shop at Tractor Supply.

          12         Q.  Okay.  What do you buy at Tractor Supply?

          13         A.  Stuff for animals, pets.  They have books,

          14   garden decorations.

          15         Q.  Do you have pets?

          16         A.  Yes.

          17         Q.  What do you have?

          18         A.  Right now we have two dogs and a cat.  At

          19   the time we had -- we had two dogs and a cat as

          20   well.  Different dogs though.

          21         Q.  And you had mentioned prior to your mom

          22   informing you of what happened, you had seen the

          23   gate, correct?

          24         A.  Yes.

           1         Q.  And how would you happen to see the gate?

           2         A.  Just from driving by or walking.  I

           3   hadn't, like, examined it or anything.  I know what

           4   it looks like.

           5         Q.  Sure.  And where is the gate located, to

           6   your memory?

           7         A.  I believe it's -- like, if you're in the

           8   parking lot, to the right.  But I don't know if

           9   that's certain.

          10         Q.  Okay.  All right.  So you are referring to

          11   Tractor Supply, correct?

          12         A.  Mm-hmm.

          13         Q.  Yes?

          14         A.  Yes.

          15         Q.  So if you're standing in the parking lot

          16   looking at Tractor Supply --

          17         A.  Yes.

          18         Q.  -- do you have a memory of where the gate

          19   was?

          20         A.  I can't say for certain, but to the best

          21   of my memory, it was to -- it was to the right

          22   facing Tractor Supply.

          23         Q.  Sure.  So if you're in the parking lot,

          24   you're looking at Tractor Supply, your memory is the

           1   gate is to the right?

           2         A.  Right.  Yes.

           3         Q.  Is it in front of the store, to the side

           4   of the store, the back of the store?

           5         A.  I believe it's to -- it's in the front of

           6   the store.

           7         Q.  So when your mom said there was an

           8   incident with the gate, that's the gate you were

           9   thinking of in your head?

          10         A.  Yes.

          11         Q.  To the right of the store?

          12         A.  I believe so.

          20   BY MR. BUCKLEY:

          21         Q.  So when your mom referenced "the gate,"

          22   that's the gate you had in mind, what you're

          23   describing, correct?

          24         A.  Yes.

           1         Q.  Is there any reason why you have a memory

           2   of that gate at all, of seeing it?

           3         A.  No, not necessarily.

           4         Q.  Okay.  It's just you had been there

           5   before?

           6         A.  Yes.

           7         Q.  And when your mom referenced a "gate,"

           8   that's what you thought of?

           9         A.  That's what I thought of, yes.

          10         Q.  Fair enough.

          11                  Prior to -- well, your mom described

          12   it as a lever had hit him in the head.  Is that

          13   correct?

          14         A.  Yes.

          15         Q.  Was it explained where that lever came

          16   from?

          17         A.  Yes.

          18         Q.  Okay.

          19         A.  Because I wasn't positive what she was

          20   referring to.

          21         Q.  Okay.  Did she further explain?

          22         A.  Yeah.

          23         Q.  And what did she say?

          24         A.  I believe she said that the thing that

           1   holds the two pieces of the gate together, to make

           2   it move, fell off and hit him.

           3         Q.  And your mom didn't witness this incident,

           4   correct?

           5         A.  What was that?

           6         Q.  Your mother didn't witness this, correct?

           7         A.  No.

           8         Q.  So is this information that she got from

           9   your dad?

          10         A.  I'm not sure.

          11         Q.  Okay.

          12         A.  I think so.  That, or maybe she talked to

          13   the assistant manager.  I'm not sure.

          14         Q.  Okay.  But your dad didn't give you the

          15   explanation, your mom did?

          16         A.  My mom did, yeah.

          17         Q.  Okay.  And did she give you any other

          18   information of the mechanics of the incident, of

          19   what else happened?

          20         A.  No.

          21         Q.  Now, this is -- the incident happened on a

          22   Saturday.  And it wasn't a Sunday.  You believe it

          23   could have been a couple of days after.  So this is

          24   three or four days after the accident.  Is that

           1   fair?

           2         A.  Yes.

           7   speaking with your dad after the incident?

           8         A.  I can't remember.

           9         Q.  Do you have a memory -- well, do you have

          10   a memory of ever speaking with your father after the

          11   incident?

          12         A.  Eventually.  I'm trying to remember.

          13                  That was in May.  Yeah, I'm sure I

          14   must have talked to him at some point, but not that

          15   I can remember.

          16         Q.  Well, I'm not just talking about the

          17   incident itself.  Just generally seeing and speaking

          18   with your father after the incident?

          19         A.  Yes.

          20         Q.  Do you have a memory of seeing or

          21   interacting with him in the weeks following the

          22   accident?

          23         A.  Yes.

          24         Q.  Can you describe for me those

           1   interactions?

           2         A.  We were fighting a lot.

           3         Q.  What was the reason?

           4         A.  All kinds of stuff.  We would fight about

           5   everything from -- we had -- both of our dogs were

           6   old, and they were both sick, and so they would get

           7   sick around the house.  He would freak out about

           8   that.

           9                  I remember fighting with him about

          10   the outside, because he wouldn't, like, mow the

          11   grass or do the lawn like he usually did.

          12                  He was just sort of in a fighting

          13   mood most of the time.

          14         Q.  And are you describing these observations

          15   as that they were different before the incident?

          16         A.  Yes.

          17         Q.  Meaning, would you fight about the dogs

          18   getting sick before the incident?

          19         A.  No.

          20         Q.  So when I asked you about interactions you

          21   had with your father in the weeks following, are you

          22   explaining the interactions, the observations you

          23   made of how he was different?

          24         A.  Yes.

           1         Q.  Okay.  All right.

           2                  In those weeks following the

           3   incident, and you made these observations, did you

           4   have an opportunity to speak with him at all?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  Okay.  Did he ever explain what happened?

           7         A.  Not that I can remember.

           8         Q.  Okay.  Is it fair to say to this day your

           9   dad has never explained to you specifically what had

          10   happened involving his incident?

          11         A.  Not that I can remember.

          12         Q.  Meaning, you don't have a memory of him

          13   ever telling you exactly what had happened involving

          14   his incident?

          15         A.  Yes.

          16         Q.  The only explanation you got is what your

          17   mother told you, correct?

          18         A.  Yes.

          19         Q.  Prior to this incident had you ever heard

          20   of your father talking about this gate at Tractor

          21   Supply?

          22         A.  I had not heard him talk about it, but I

          23   had heard another Tractor Supply worker from a

          24   different Tractor Supply talk about it.

           3   She worked at the Tractor Supply in Southhampton.

           4         Q.  What's Briana's last name?

           5         A.  Inman.

           6         Q.  And she had worked at a Tractor Supply in

           7   Southhampton?

           8         A.  Yes.

           9         Q.  And how do you know Briana?

          10         A.  We're family friends.

          11         Q.  When you mean "family friends"?

          12         A.  My mom and her mom are friends.

          13         Q.  And had she ever worked at the Tractor

          14   Supply in North Adams?

          15         A.  No.

          16         Q.  And does she still work for the Tractor

          17   Supply in Southhampton?

          18         A.  No.

          19         Q.  Does she still work for Tractor Supply?

          20         A.  No.

          21         Q.  Do you know what her address is?

          24         A.  No, not anymore.

           1         Q.  Do you still stay in touch with her at

           2   all?

           3         A.  No.

           4         Q.  Either through social media or --

           5         A.  No.

           6         Q.  Meaning, if someone tasks you to find her

           7   in the next 25 minutes, would you have any idea how

           8   to do that?

           9         A.  No.

          10         Q.  Okay.  So you had mentioned that

          11   Miss Inman had mentioned a gate prior to your dad's

          12   incident.  Is that right?

          13         A.  Yes.

          14         Q.  Can you explain that?

          15         A.  She said that one of the workers from that

          16   Tractor Supply in North Adams had gotten hurt.  She

          17   hurt her back while trying to move the gate -- or

          18   trying to open the gate, I'm sorry.

          19         Q.  Okay.  So Briana, prior to your dad's

          20   incident, had explained to you that one of her

          21   coworkers had hurt her back trying to open a gate in

          22   North Adams?

          23         A.  Yes.

          24         Q.  How did this conversation come up?

           1         A.  She -- I was doing her hair, and she would

           2   just talk to me about her work life, and so she said

           3   she was friends with that lady, and she told me what

           4   happened.

           5         Q.  What was -- I'm sorry.  What was Briana's

           6   coworker's name, if you know?

           7         A.  I don't remember her name.

           8         Q.  Did she ever tell you her name?

           9         A.  Yeah.  I think she referred to her first

          10   name.  I just don't remember what it is.

          11         Q.  Okay.  And could you approximate when this

          12   conversation occurred?

          13         A.  I don't remember.  I just remember it was

          14   before the accident.

          15         Q.  Sure.  And if we're using May of 2015 as

          16   when your dad's incident occurred, could you go back

          17   in time around when this conversation occurred?  Was

          18   it a year before, two years before, two months

          19   before?

          20         A.  I don't remember.

          21         Q.  Could you approximate?

          22         A.  I don't think so.  I don't quite remember

          23   when it was that I was at her house.

          24         Q.  You were doing her hair at her house?

           1         A.  Yes.

           2         Q.  And that was in which town?

           3         A.  Westhampton.

           4         Q.  And she had mentioned that a coworker had

           5   hurt herself while trying to open a gate at the

           6   Tractor Supply in North Adams?

           7         A.  Yes.

           8         Q.  How do you know it's the same gate

           9   involved with your father's incident?

          10         A.  I have no idea.  I just assumed it was the

          11   same gate.

          12         Q.  Is there more than one gate at Tractor

          13   Supply in North Adams?

          14         A.  I don't know.

          15         Q.  You just know your father's incident

          16   involved a gate, and your friend had mentioned a

          17   friend of hers or a coworker had been injured with a

          18   gate?

          19         A.  Yes.

          20         Q.  Do you have any other details beyond that?

          21         A.  No.

          22         Q.  Anyone else mention the gate at North

          23   Adams other than Briana Inman prior to your dad's

          24   incident?

           1         A.  I think I asked my dad about it right as

           2   soon as I got home.  I do remember asking him what

           3   happened with the lady at the gate.  He said that

           4   she just hurt her back trying to open it.

           5         Q.  Okay.  And I know this is just how a lot

           6   of people speak.  You said, "I think."

           7         A.  I remember, yeah.

           8         Q.  Thank you.

           9         A.  I have a memory of sitting in the living

          10   room asking.

          11         Q.  When you say "I think," it's not that

          12   you're not sure.  You have a memory of --

          13         A.  Yes.

          14         Q.  -- after that conversation, you spoke with

          15   your father?

          16         A.  Yes.

          17         Q.  And you were just inquiring into the

          18   details?

          19         A.  Yes.

          20         Q.  Is there any reason that you would go

          21   speak with your father about a conversation you had

          22   had with Briana Inman while doing her hair?

          23         A.  I was just curious.

          24         Q.  And what did you say to him?

           1         A.  I just asked him what happened with the

           2   lady at work with the gate, and I remember him

           3   saying that she was just trying to open it, and she

           4   hurt her back.

           5         Q.  Okay.  Anything else?

           6         A.  No.

           7         Q.  Any other conversations regarding the gate

           8   with anyone prior to the incident?

           9         A.  No.

          10         Q.  Did you ever hear your father or mother

          11   speaking about the gate before the incident?

          12         A.  No.

          13         Q.  Had you ever gone to -- I know you said

          14   you went to the Tractor Supply prior to the

          15   incident.  Did you ever go back after the incident?

          16         A.  No.

          17         Q.  You've never gone back to either Tractor

          18   Supply or the Ocean State since 2015?

          19         A.  No.

          20         Q.  Is there a reason?

          21         A.  It wasn't really close to our house.  We

          22   just never went back.

          23         Q.  Well, before that you would go there to

          24   buy animal supplies, pet supplies, correct?

           1         A.  Yes.

           2         Q.  Did you continue to need pet supplies and

           3   animal supplies after the incident?

           4         A.  Yes.  We would just go to a different

           5   store that was closer.

           6         Q.  Were you avoiding going back there after

           7   the incident or was it because your dad wasn't

           8   working there after the incident?

           9         A.  It's because my dad wasn't working there.

          10         Q.  So beforehand, you would just go because,

          11   one, you needed supplies, but also your dad worked

          12   there?

          13         A.  Yes.

          14         Q.  Okay.  So you have a memory at least on

          15   the Monday, Tuesday, around that time, after the

          16   incident, of having some observations of your

          17   father, correct?

          18         A.  No, I just -- my memory of him is seeing

          19   him sleeping.  And I'm sure eventually in that week

          20   we did talk, because I remember us fighting a lot

          21   right after it happened.

          22         Q.  Sure.  And you testified that you were

          23   fighting about the dogs making a mess in the house

          24   and him not mowing the lawn, stuff like that?

           1         A.  Yes.

           4         A.  Yes.

           5         Q.  Did you make any observations of your

           6   father, you know, any physical observations?

           7         A.  No.

           8         Q.  Do you know what I mean by that?  Any cuts

           9   and bruises, or anything like that?

          10         A.  No, not that I can remember.

          11         Q.  Did he ever explain to you if he had any

          12   cuts or bruises or anything from the incident?

          13         A.  The only thing I ever remember him saying

          14   is that his head hurt.

          15         Q.  And that was in the week following the

          16   incident?

          17         A.  Yes.

          18         Q.  Okay.  But he never pointed out or you

          19   never observed any cuts or bruises on his body?

          20         A.  No.

          21         Q.  So you're 23 now?

          22         A.  Yes.

           6   years leading up to May of 2015, what your father

           7   did?

           8         A.  Yes.  So he worked pretty much all the

           9   time.  He would work long days.  He usually had

          10   Wednesdays off, from even -- I can remember him

          11   always having Wednesdays off when I was a kid.  But

          12   he would work pretty much six days a week solid, and

          13   then he would come home, you know, later at night.

          14                  When he was home, he would do a lot

          15   of stuff outside, like with the cars or with the

          16   lawn or with the gardens.

          17                  He had a lot of hobbies.  He liked to

          18   listen to music.  He liked to read a lot, watch

          19   movies when he was home.

          20         Q.  Okay.  Were there any activities you would

          21   do with just him or with your family?

          22         A.  I mean, we liked to go out for drives, and

          23   we would go out to dinner, and just kind of stuff

          24   like that.  Nothing too -- we wouldn't like go on

           1   vacations or anything.

           2                  We would occasionally go to Rochester

           3   sometimes, but most of the time it was at home.

           4         Q.  And so you had mentioned, at least at the

           5   time of the incident, you weren't driving?

           6         A.  Correct.

           7         Q.  You didn't have a license?

           8         A.  Correct.

           9         Q.  And your father would drive you places?

          10         A.  Yes, him and my mom.

          11         Q.  Let's say in the year leading up to May of

          12   2015, when your dad's incident occurred, at what

          13   frequency would your dad drive you places?

          14         A.  Not very frequent.  I think he -- or he

          15   did sometimes go with my mom to drop me off at work,

          16   but maybe just a handful of times, not very often at

          17   all.

          18         Q.  Okay.

          19         A.  He was usually working.

          20         Q.  Now, is there anything else that you would

          21   like to explain about your dad prior to the incident

          22   that he would do?

          23         A.  No, I mean, he just had -- he had a lot of

          24   energy.  He could do a lot of stuff.  Like, he could

           1   work from really early in the morning till, you

           2   know, six o'clock at night and then come home and

           3   mow the lawn and change the brakes.

           4         Q.  And have you had observations of those

           5   type of activities that your dad would do change at

           6   all after the incident?

           7         A.  Yes.

           8         Q.  How so?

           9         A.  He has a really -- especially right after

          10   the accident, with our old house, he had a terrible

          11   time keeping up with the yard.  He stopped doing any

          12   type of gardening, landscaping at all.  I would very

          13   rarely seeing him working on the cars.  He stopped

          14   reading.  He barely listens to music anymore.  It

          15   gives him a headache.

          16                  He doesn't really like to do much.

          17   He mostly just sleeps.

          18         Q.  So when you say especially closer to the

          19   accident, has he started to do more of these

          20   activities at a more frequent rate?

          21         A.  No, he just had a harder time with -- I

          22   can remember, because we fought a lot about it --

          23   keeping up with our yard at our old house.  He has a

          24   hard time with the new house, but our old house,

           1   especially, he had a really hard time with.

           2         Q.  If I recall, that was like an old

           3   farmhouse?

           4         A.  Yes.

           5         Q.  With a large yard?

           6         A.  Yes.

           7         Q.  And your dad, prior to the incident, would

           8   do the gardening and landscaping and mowing?

           9         A.  Yes.

          10         Q.  Did he continue to do that after the

          11   accident?

          12         A.  I believe he stopped.  I can't remember

          13   for certain because -- but I do remember the person

          14   who was, like, the caretaker, he was part of the

          15   trustees, he at one point had to come over and start

          16   doing the mowing because my dad couldn't do it

          17   anymore.

          18         Q.  So did he try to do it after the accident

          19   and then couldn't?

          20         A.  I believe so.

          21         Q.  But at some point the caretaker of the

          22   estate started mowing your lawn?

          23         A.  Yeah.

          24         Q.  And what about the landscaping?

           1         A.  He completely let all of that go.

           2         Q.  Would the caretaker do that?

           3         A.  No.

           4         Q.  All right.  Has your dad since started, in

           5   your new house, has he started mowing the lawn?

           6         A.  He does mow the lawn.

           7         Q.  And that's a much smaller lawn?

           8         A.  Yes.

           9         Q.  How about the landscaping?

          10         A.  He does not do the landscaping.  We have a

          11   family friend that comes and helps with that.

          12         Q.  Who is that family friend?

          13         A.  Her name is Miranda.

          14         Q.  Last name?

          15         A.  Avery, I think.

          16         Q.  And what type of landscaping does Miranda

          17   help out with?

          18         A.  Mostly just getting the weeds out of the

          19   garden, cutting the overgrown branches and stuff

          20   like that.  Just basic stuff.

          21         Q.  When did you move from your old home to

          22   your new home?

          23         A.  In last January.

          24         Q.  So about a year and a half ago?

           1         A.  Yes.

           2         Q.  So that means after the incident, you were

           3   at your old, larger home for about two and a half

           4   years.  Does that sound about right?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  So you had to go through two spring/summer

           7   seasons and two winter seasons?

           8         A.  Yes.

           9         Q.  How large of a driveway did you have at

          10   your old home?

          11         A.  It wasn't large at all.

          12         Q.  And prior to the incident, would your dad

          13   either shovel or snow blow the driveway?

          14         A.  He would try.  Usually the caretaker would

          15   come with his plow and plow the snow out of the way.

          16                  MR. PESKIN:  He said prior to the

          17          accident.

          18                  THE WITNESS:  Prior to the accident,

          19          yes.

          20                  MR. PESKIN:  Okay.

          21         A.  The caretaker would come.  He did do a lot

          22   of shoveling with, like, the walkways.

          23   BY MR. BUCKLEY:

          24         Q.  Yeah.  The caretaker was not doing the

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

           1   walkways, but prior to the incident, he would bring

           2   his snowplow and get that driveway out?

           3         A.  Yes.  We had a snowblower at one point,

           4   but I believe it broke.

           5         Q.  Was that prior to the incident?

           6         A.  Yes.

           7         Q.  So generally, prior to the accident, your

           8   dad wouldn't get a snowblower or plow or shovel,

           9   clear the driveway, correct?

          10         A.  He did until the snowblower broke.

          11         Q.  Okay.  How about after the accident, would

          12   your dad ever try to clear the driveway with snow?

          13         A.  He never tried to do the driveway.  He

          14   would try to do the little bit of walkway that we

          15   had.

          16         Q.  Is it fair to say he wouldn't do the

          17   driveway because the caretaker would come and plow?

          18         A.  Yes, but he usually -- he used to have to

          19   dig out the cars, because it would be a while before

          20   the guy would come down and plow us out.  But he

          21   couldn't do that after, so we would do it.

          22         Q.  Why couldn't he do it after?

          23         A.  He just -- he would get too tired.

          24         Q.  So you made no observations of your father

           1   either snow blowing or shoveling out the driveway

           2   after the incident?

           3         A.  No.

           4         Q.  Now, you mentioned your dad was a big

           5   reader before the incident?

           6         A.  Yes.

           7         Q.  Okay.  And that has decreased since the

           8   accident?

           9         A.  Yes.

          10         Q.  Does he read at all?  I've asked him these

          11   questions.  I'm just asking about what your

          12   observations have been.

          13         A.  No.  He will occasionally cut down some

          14   hedges, but he doesn't do any weeding or anything

          15   like that.

          16         Q.  I'm sorry.  I said "reading."

          17         A.  Oh, "reading."  I thought you said

          18   "weeding."

          19                  No, I have not seen him read in a

          20   very long time.

          21         Q.  At what frequency would he read prior to

          22   the incident?

          23         A.  Pretty much every night I would see him

          24   reading.

           1         Q.  And then since the accident, you don't see

           2   him reading at all?

           3         A.  No.

           4         Q.  How about watching television?

           5         A.  He used to love watching television.  He

           6   did that every night.  Now he maybe watches it for

           7   20 minutes at a time, and then he puts it on mute,

           8   doesn't watch it for a while, and then he goes back

           9   to watching it.

          10         Q.  Okay.  How about driving?  And I know you

          11   said your dad would drive you once in a while prior

          12   to the accident.  Did you make any observations if

          13   his driving habits changed afterwards?

          14         A.  Yes.

          15         Q.  And how so?

          16         A.  He gets intense road rage, as well as he

          17   loses track of where he is.  He gets really lost.

          18         Q.  What do you mean by "road rage"?

          19         A.  He gets angry.  He will literally park his

          20   car, get out of the car, and chase somebody.

          21         Q.  Have you made observations of this?

          22         A.  Yes.

          23         Q.  Can you describe it for me?

          24         A.  One time we were driving in the car, and

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

           1   then we saw a truck pulling out and he was texting

           2   on his phone, so my dad turned around and chased him

           3   until he was parked, till he got to where he was

           4   going to go, and he proceeded to get out of the car

           5   and yell at him.

           6         Q.  When you mean "chased," you mean he

           7   followed him in his car?

           8         A.  Yes, yep.

           9         Q.  And he went, followed him, and then yelled

          10   at him when he stopped?

          11         A.  Yes.

          12         Q.  Any other instances of road rage?

          13         A.  All the time.  One time we were just

          14   driving, and somebody cut in front of him a little

          15   bit too close.  And we were stopped.  It was on a

          16   really busy street.  He stopped and proceeded to get

          17   out of the car and screamed at the guy.

          18         Q.  Okay.  And when you mean, "all the time,"

          19   and we don't have to go through every detail, but

          20   could you approximate how many times you witnessed

          21   your dad go through some road rage, as you described

          22   it.

          23         A.  Pretty close to every time I've -- I drive

          24   with him.

           1         Q.  Okay.  And how many times did you drive

           2   with him a week after the accident?

           3         A.  Probably about three, three or four.

           4         Q.  And has that been consistent over the last

           5   four years?

           6         A.  No, after I got my license, I drive a

           7   little bit less with him now.

           8         Q.  When did you get your license?

           9         A.  In August of that year, 2015.

          10         Q.  So we would say from May up to August, you

          11   would drive with him three to four times a day?

          12         A.  Yes.

          13         Q.  And he would have instances of road rage

          14   almost every time?

          15         A.  Yes.

          16         Q.  Did any ever get physical?

          17         A.  No.

          18         Q.  Have there been any criminal charges taken

          19   out against your dad because of these?

          22   orders, if you know?

          23         A.  No.

           1   "road rage" occurred but not in a vehicle, meaning

           2   out in a restaurant or out in any other social

           3   setting?

           4         A.  Yes.

           5         Q.  Okay.  Could you describe those?

           6         A.  We were in line at Whole Foods, and this

           7   guy started giving this -- the woman who was

           8   checking us out, he started giving her a hard time

           9   because she wasn't going fast enough, and -- this

          10   was the guy in front of us, and my dad proceeded to

          11   get in an argument with him about being rude to the

          12   waitress -- or to the cashier.

          13         Q.  Would you consider that rage?

          14         A.  Yes.

          15         Q.  As opposed to just sticking up for

          16   someone?

          17         A.  Yes.

          18         Q.  These instances, whether they are in

          19   social settings or in the car, had you ever seen

          20   your dad act like that prior to the incident?

          21         A.  No.

          22         Q.  How about any other observations you've

          23   made that your dad appeared to be different from the

          24   point of after the accident -- excuse me, before the

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

                                                                      48


           1   accident to after the accident?  I'm going to ask

           2   that again.

           3                  You've described some of his

           4   activities that he used to do?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  That he either no longer does or does in a

           7   limited capacity, correct?

           8         A.  Yes.

           9         Q.  You've also described how he acts, either

          10   angry, getting road rage, in the car or in another

          11   social setting, correct?

          12         A.  Yes.

          13         Q.  Any other changes that you've noticed?

          14         A.  He has random explosions of being

          15   emotional.  Like he'll cry a lot, sometimes for no

          16   reason.

          17         Q.  Can you give me an example?

          18         A.  Well, for one, with a reason, any time a

          19   sad commercial comes on, a commercial with dogs or

          20   cats, he'll start crying.  Sometimes I'll just come

          21   in the living room, and he'll be crying.  Sometimes

          22   if he's outside and I come out to see him, he's

          23   crying.

          24         Q.  What frequency would you observe these

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

           1   crying?

           2         A.  Probably about twice a week.

           3         Q.  Has that been consistent in the last four

           4   years since the accident?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  Other than an instance where you may

           7   normally see your father cry before the incident, a

           8   traumatic event or something, would you ever see him

           9   crying for no reason before the incident?

          10         A.  No.

          11         Q.  So this is something, at least from your

          12   standpoint, was completely new, correct?

          13         A.  Yes.

          14         Q.  Any other observations?

          15         A.  Let's see.  We talked about him getting

          16   lost while driving.

          17         Q.  Sure.  And, again, let's stick with the

          18   three to four months that you would drive with him

          19   after the incident.  Because you had your license at

          20   that August, correct?

          21         A.  Yes.

          22         Q.  Okay.  And then in the three to four times

          23   a week, at what frequency would your father get lost

          24   driving?

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

           1         A.  Probably three times, at least.  Like if

           2   we were driving four times a week, he would probably

           3   get lost three times.

           4         Q.  So almost every time?

           5         A.  Almost every time.

           6         Q.  Can you give me an example?

           7         A.  He would get lost on the way home from

           8   just driving from -- if he would pick me up from

           9   work, on the way home, he would get lost.  If he had

          10   to drop me off at a friend's house, he would get

          11   lost, even if he had dropped me off at the friend's

          12   house before.  He would get lost on the way going to

          13   the doctor's office.  He would pretty much get lost

          14   anywhere.

          15         Q.  Would you go with your father to doctor's

          16   appointments?

          17         A.  To some of them, yes.

          18         Q.  Would you go into the room?

          19         A.  No.

          20         Q.  You would just go for the ride?

          21         A.  Yeah.

          22         Q.  And can you explain how you would learn

          23   that he was lost?  Would he be going in the

          24   direction that you knew wasn't the correct

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

           1   direction?  Or would he say, "Oh, my God, where am

           2   I"?

           3         A.  Yes, he would say he was lost.

           4         Q.  Was this concerning to you?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  Because at least three times a week he's

           7   realizing he doesn't know where he is?

           8         A.  Yes.

           9         Q.  Was it ever a concern of yours of his

          10   safety driving and getting lost so much?

          11         A.  Yes.

          12         Q.  Did you vocalize that concern?

          13         A.  Yes.

          14         Q.  To whom?

          15         A.  To my mom and my dad.

          16         Q.  What did they do, if anything, based on

          17   your concern?

          18         A.  They said that they knew; that they were

          19   also concerned.

          20         Q.  About his safety?

          21         A.  Yes.

          22         Q.  Okay.  So let's go with each of them.

          23                  So your mom expressed concern of his

          24   safety driving because of his frequency of getting

           1   lost?

           2         A.  Yes.

           3         Q.  And this is a conversation you had with

           4   her?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  Was anything done with that concern for

           7   his safety?

           8         A.  No.

           9         Q.  Okay.  Your dad would keep driving?

          10         A.  Yes.

          11         Q.  Okay.  Did our dad express concern of his

          12   safety driving or getting lost, to you?

          13         A.  Yes.

          14         Q.  Okay.  At least did you observe him do

          15   anything to remedy that concern?

          16         A.  Well, he has GPS on his phone.  He used to

          17   use it, but he gets even more lost trying to use it.

          18   He usually calls my mom or my sister when he gets

          19   lost.

          20         Q.  How tall's your dad?

          21         A.  He is, I believe, six feet.

          22         Q.  He's a big guy, right?

          23         A.  Yes.

          24         Q.  From your observations did you notice any

           1   weight changes after the accident?

           2         A.  He did gain quite a bit of weight right

           3   after the -- or in the months following the

           4   accident.

           5         Q.  Noticeable, at least to you?

           6         A.  Yes.

           7         Q.  Was that ever spoken about or was that

           8   just an observation you made?

           9         A.  We did talk about it, yes.

          10         Q.  Okay.  What did you say?

          11         A.  He just said that, yes, he has gained

          12   weight.

          13         Q.  Did anyone speculate as to what was the

          14   cause of the weight change, or weight gain?

          15         A.  No, just that he was home, and we just

          16   brought up the fact that he had gained weight, not

          17   why.

          18         Q.  Okay.  Do you know how much?

          19         A.  I don't know how much exactly.

          20         Q.  But just something that you made an

          21   observation of?

          22         A.  Yes.

          23         Q.  Okay.  Has that continued -- your dad's

          24   weight, continued to increase or decrease?

           1         A.  As of right now?

           2         Q.  As of now, yeah.

           3         A.  His weight has decreased.

           4         Q.  More activity?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  All right.  And what have those activities

           7   been?

           8         A.  He goes to the gym.

           9         Q.  Which gym?

          10         A.  It's in Easthampton, in Eastworks.  I

          11   don't know the name of it.

          12         Q.  And what frequency?

          13         A.  I think he tries to go once a day or once

          14   every other day.

          15         Q.  And those weight decreases have been

          16   noticeable?

          17         A.  Yes.

          18         Q.  Do you know how much?

          19         A.  I believe 75 pounds.

          20         Q.  Good.  And how long's he been going to the

          21   gym?

          22         A.  February.

          23         Q.  Of this year?

           1         Q.  So about six months?

           2         A.  Yes.

           3         Q.  Is there something that happened in

           4   February of '19 that triggered your dad to start

           5   going to the gym?

           6         A.  No, we had all talked to him, that we --

           7   and told him that we were really worried about him,

           8   about his weight.  And then one day, he just decided

           9   to sign up for this gym.  He had talked about it

          10   previously, but he didn't decide to actually make an

          11   appointment until February.

          12         Q.  When you mean an "appointment," like a gym

          13   appointment?

          14         A.  Yeah, to go meet with the guy and to talk

          15   to him.

          16         Q.  And when you're using the term "we" spoke

          17   about it, are you talking about you, your mom, and

          18   your dad, or just you and your dad?

          19         A.  Me, my mom and dad.

          20         Q.  Are you the only three that live together

          21   right now?

          22         A.  Yes.

          23         Q.  Okay.  And how long's that been the case?

          24         A.  I don't remember when Hannah moved out.

           1         Q.  Was Hannah living with you at the time of

           2   the accident?

           3         A.  I can't remember.

           4         Q.  And you have another sister as well?

           8         Q.  And when was the last time -- what's your

           9   other sister's name?

          10         A.  Grace.

          11         Q.  When was the last time that she lived in

          12   the family house?

          13         A.  Oh, gosh, right before she went to

          14   college.  I can't remember which year that was.  I

          15   was going to be a junior in high school, so a while

          16   ago.

          17         Q.  Okay.  But your dad's continuously going

          18   to the gym almost once a day?

          19         A.  Yes.

          20         Q.  To your knowledge, is your -- well, what

          21   is your understanding of your dad's injuries from

          22   the incident?

          23         A.  I know that he has permanent brain damage

          24   from the injury.

           1         Q.  And how did you learn that?

           2         A.  I've been told by my mom.

           3         Q.  And anyone else?

           4         A.  No.  I mean, I've talked about it, you

           5   know, with my dad a little bit, but I was told

           6   specifically from my mom.

           7         Q.  Are those the words she used, "permanent

           8   brain damage"?

           9         A.  Yes.

          10         Q.  When was this conversation, approximately?

          11         A.  Maybe six months after it happened.

          12         Q.  Okay.  So if the accident happened May of

          13   2015, maybe around November '15?

          14         A.  Yes.

          15         Q.  December '16?

          16         A.  Yes.

          17         Q.  And my understanding is if we're looking

          18   at over four years now, your dad hasn't gone back to

          19   work, correct?

          20         A.  Correct?

          21         Q.  And you've been living in the house in

          22   those four-plus years, correct?

          23         A.  Correct.

          24         Q.  And we discussed some of his activities

           1   that he no longer does, correct?

           2         A.  Correct.

           3         Q.  Any other activities that you want to tell

           4   me about that he no longer does or has difficulty

           5   with?

           6         A.  He used to be very handy with working on

           7   the house and working on stuff in the garage, like

           8   doing all kinds of things, and he no longer does

           9   that.

          10         Q.  Completely?

          11         A.  Completely, yeah.

          12         Q.  Did he have tools?

          13         A.  Yes.

          14         Q.  Does he use the tools at all?

          15         A.  No.

          16         Q.  Anything else?

          17         A.  He used to help with stuff around the

          18   house like laundry, dishes, just maintenance, and he

          19   doesn't do that anymore.

          20         Q.  At all?

          21         A.  At all.

          22         Q.  Anything else?

          23         A.  His hobbies that he used to have, he used

          24   to make -- like work with trains.  He doesn't do

                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

           1   that anymore.

           2         Q.  I'm kind of -- I keep saying "Anything

           3   else?"  Maybe I'll just give you the opportunity.

           4   When you say you're done, you can let me know.

           5         A.  Yeah, I think that's good.

           6         Q.  You feel that's enough, at least from your

           7   observations?

           8         A.  Yeah.

           9         Q.  And so you work full-time now?

          10         A.  Yes.

          11         Q.  So when do you leave in the morning?

          12         A.  I have a different schedule each day, so

          13   on Mondays I work 9:00 to 5:00, Tuesdays I work

          14   10:30 to 7:30, Wednesdays 10:00 to -- I'm sorry,

          15   9:00 to 3:00, Thursdays 10:30 to 7:30, Fridays I'm

          16   off, and then Saturday 9:00 to 5:00.

          17         Q.  And has that been the case for the last

          18   couple of years?

          19         A.  Give or take.

          20         Q.  I know some change, but in general?

          21         A.  Yeah, a full-time schedule.

          22         Q.  So when you're leaving either on a Monday

          23   or Tuesday between nine and ten o'clock, is your dad

          24   up yet?

           1         A.  He usually is up to take my mom to work.

           2         Q.  Okay.  He drives her to work, correct?

           3         A.  Right.

           4         Q.  And then comes home?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  If you know?

           7         A.  Or he goes to the gym, whichever --

           8   sometimes he goes later in the day, sometimes he

           9   comes back.

          10         Q.  All right.  And so what is he doing when

          11   you're -- if he's home, before going to the gym at

          12   that time, what would he be doing when you would

          13   leave for work?

          14         A.  He's in bed.

          15         Q.  Okay.  So he stays in bed?

          16         A.  Yes.

          17         Q.  And this is before his gym activities

          18   started in February?

          19         A.  Yes.

          20         Q.  Would you ever see him make himself

          21   breakfast?

          22         A.  No.

          23         Q.  Would you make him breakfast?

          24         A.  No.

           1         Q.  And then when you'd get home in the

           2   afternoon, would he be home, in general?

           3         A.  It depends on what time in the afternoon.

           4         Q.  Okay.

           5         A.  When I get home, like at 3:00, he's

           6   usually still sleeping.

           7         Q.  Okay.

           8         A.  But when I get home at like 7:30, he's

           9   usually out picking up my mom.

          10         Q.  Okay.  So when you get home at 3:00, when

          11   you say he's "usually still sleeping," is it your

          12   belief that he hasn't gotten up yet?

          13         A.  I'm not sure.

          14         Q.  When you get home at 3:00, your

          15   observation is he's laying in bed?

          16         A.  Yes.

          17         Q.  But if you come home at 6:00, then he's

          18   out getting your mother?

          19         A.  Yes.

          20         Q.  What observations -- other than sleeping

          21   and getting your mother, what observation have you

          22   made before he started the gym in February of what

          23   your dad would do throughout the day?

          24         A.  Mostly sleep.  If he was up, he would be

           1   in the living room sitting, sometimes with the TV on

           2   or muted, just sitting there.

           3         Q.  Has your dad increased any activities

           4   beyond the gym currently?

           5         A.  No.

           6         Q.  What does he do at the gym?

           7         A.  I'm not sure.

           8         Q.  Cardio?  Weights?

           9         A.  His exercises.  I think all kinds of

          10   stuff.

          11         Q.  When people lose weight, don't they like

          12   to tell people how they did it and what they did?

          13         A.  Usually, yes.

          14         Q.  Yeah.  Does he lift weights?  Does he use

          15   the machines?

          16         A.  I'm not sure.

          17         Q.  Okay.  Prior to the incident, how was, at

          18   least your observations, of your parents' marriage?

          19         A.  It was pretty good.

          20         Q.  Yeah?

          21         A.  Yeah.  They tend to get along.  You know,

          22   my mom was unemployed for a while, but when they

          23   were working, they were both working a lot.

          24         Q.  And had you made any observations of any

           1   change in their marriage since the accident?

           2         A.  Yes.

           3         Q.  And what were those changes?

           4         A.  They fight constantly.  And when I say

           5   that, I mean like every day at least a couple of

           6   fights.

           7         Q.  A couple fights a day?

           8         A.  Yes.

           9         Q.  Every day?

          10         A.  Yes.

          11         Q.  All right.  About what?

          12         A.  Everything.  Everything you could possibly

          13   think of.  Sometimes for nothing at all.  They just

          14   start yelling at each other for -- sometimes for no

          15   reason.

          16         Q.  Can you give me an example?

          17         A.  Like yesterday, they were just yelling at

          18   each other.  My dad doesn't like the way my mom's

          19   voice sounded when he talked to her.  My dad can't

          20   find his wallet.  He can't find his keys.  He starts

          21   yelling at her.  He doesn't want to bring her to

          22   work.  Or she was a couple of minutes late coming

          23   out when he was there to pick her up.

          24         Q.  And would you make observations of these

           1   type of things before the accident?

           2         A.  No.

           3         Q.  So regarding the observations of your

           4   father's difficulties or limitations since the

           5   accident, have you seen them get worse, get better,

           6   stay the same?

           7         A.  Could you ask that one more time?

           8         Q.  I'll ask it a different way.  Let's say --

           9   for example, you testified that your father would

          10   get lost driving three out of four times a week,

          11   correct?

          12         A.  Yes.

          13         Q.  And I know you don't drive with him as

          14   much anymore --

          15         A.  Yes.

          16         Q.  -- but has him getting lost decreased?

          17         A.  No.

          18         Q.  So he continues to get lost at the same

          19   amount of driving?

          20         A.  Yes.

          21         Q.  At least to your knowledge?

          22         A.  Yes.

          23         Q.  And then how about you mentioned he gets

          24   headaches?

           1         A.  Yes.

           2         Q.  Is that correct?  At what frequency does

           3   he get headaches, at least to your knowledge?

           4         A.  Pretty much every day.

           5         Q.  So that hasn't changed since the accident?

           6         A.  No.

           7         Q.  And you testified, or someone else

           8   testified, that he would lose things, correct?

           9         A.  Yes.

          10         Q.  All right.  Has his losing things gotten

          11   any better over the years?

          12         A.  No.

          13         Q.  Has it gotten worse in your opinion?

          14         A.  I mean, since the accident, it's pretty

          15   much been he just loses stuff all the time.

          16         Q.  You haven't seen it get any better?

          17         A.  No.

          18         Q.  What about reading?  Has he started

          19   reading anymore?

          20         A.  No.

          21         Q.  Has he completely gotten rid of his

          22   reading?

          23         A.  Yeah.  I haven't seen him read in years.

          24         Q.  And you had mentioned he no longer

           1   landscapes, correct?

           2         A.  Correct.  He will -- the only thing that

           3   he will do is he will clean up the bushes

           4   occasionally.

           5         Q.  With what, the manual clippers or the

           6   electric one?

           7         A.  A little bit of both.

           8         Q.  How about your parents?  Do they go out to

           9   dinner, go to movies?

          10         A.  They go out to dinner sometimes.

          11         Q.  And what frequency?

          12         A.  Maybe once or twice a week.

          13         Q.  And was that the same before the accident

          14   or was it more or less before the accident?

          15         A.  Probably about the same.

          16         Q.  And so the once or twice a week that they

          17   go out to dinner, has that been consistent the last

          18   four years?

          19         A.  Yes.

          20         Q.  To your knowledge is your dad receiving

          21   any medical treatment for what was described as

          22   permanent brain damage?

          23         A.  I believe so.

          24         Q.  Okay.

           1         A.  I'm not sure exactly what the treatment

           2   is, but I know that he always has doctor's

           3   appointments.

           4         Q.  Are they with his regular family doctor or

           5   are they with head doctors?

           6         A.  I'm not sure.

           7         Q.  You are probably not the person to ask.

           8   I'm just -- have they said, "Oh, I'm going to see

           9   this neurologist," or anything like that?

          10         A.  I have heard them say -- you know, there's

          11   different head doctors, is what he calls them.

          12         Q.  Okay.  And who is your primary care

          13   physician?

          14         A.  I see somebody in Dr. Kate's practice.

          15         Q.  Dr. Kate is who?

          16         A.  Dr. Kate Atkinson.

          17         Q.  That's your entire family's doctor, right?

          18         A.  Yeah.

          19         Q.  So other than what your mother described

          20   as a piece of the gate falling and hitting him, you

          21   have no more information about the actual incident?

          22         A.  Correct.

          23                  MR. BUCKLEY:  I have no other

          24          questions.

           1                  MS. BOUCHER:  I just have a few

           2          follow-ups.

           3   EXAMINATION BY MS. BOUCHER:

           4         Q.  What's the name of the gym your father

           5   attends?

           6         A.  I don't know.

           7         Q.  Do you know where it is located?

           8         A.  Yes, it's in Eastworks in Easthampton.

           9         Q.  And you say he started there in February?

          10         A.  Yes.

          11         Q.  And you don't know what type of exercise

          12   he's doing there currently?

          13         A.  No.

          14         Q.  Okay.  And what time of the day does he

          15   typically go to the gym?

          16         A.  It differs.  Sometimes in the morning

          17   after he drops off my mom.  Sometimes later before

          18   he picks up my mom.

          19         Q.  Is he working with a personal trainer

          20   there?

          21         A.  Kind of.  So I guess the way that they do

          22   it is they have a couple of people that, like, work

          23   with him, and they -- he goes through -- he went

          24   through like six weeks of them teaching him, like,

           1   how to do stuff, and then if he has questions, the

           2   people are always there.

           3         Q.  Has he also made changes to his diet as

           4   well?

           5         A.  Yes.

           6         Q.  And what type of changes?

           7         A.  He tried to cut out sugar as much as he

           8   can.

           9         Q.  And you said he's lost 75 pounds since he

          10   started?

          11         A.  Yes.

          12         Q.  And what year did you graduate from high

          13   school?

          14         A.  2015.

          15         Q.  And where is Smith Vocational located?

          16         A.  It's in Florence, Mass.

          17         Q.  And Ochoa Salon, where you currently work,

          18   can you spell that?

          20         Q.  And where's that located?

          21         A.  In South Hadley, Mass.

          22         Q.  And you've worked there for two and a half

          23   years?

          24         A.  Yes.

           6   the last place she lived that you can recall?

           7         A.  I don't know the address, but she used to

           8   live in Westhampton with her parents.

           9         Q.  And you haven't been in touch with her in

          10   several years?

          11         A.  Yes.

          12         Q.  And she worked at the Tractor Supply in

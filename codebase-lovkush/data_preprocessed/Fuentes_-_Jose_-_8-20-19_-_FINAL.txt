            2                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Today's date is

            3  August 20th, 2019.  The time is 1:42 p.m.  We are on the

            4  record beginning the deposition of Mr. Jose Fuentes.

            5                Will all counsel present please state their

            6  names for the record.

            7                MR. KETKAR:  Ajay Ketkar from Abraham

            8  Watkins for the plaintiff.

            9                MR. NEWTON:  Frank Newton for the

           11                        JOSE FUENTES,

           12  having been first duly sworn, testified through the duly

           13  sworn interpreter as follows:

           14                         EXAMINATION

           15  BY MR. NEWTON:

           16       Q.  Good afternoon, sir.

           17       A.  Good afternoon.

           18       Q.  My name is Frank Newton, and I represent the

           19  defendant, Kuraray, in this lawsuit that you have

           20  brought.  Do you understand who I am and who I

           21  represent?

           22       A.  Yes, sir.

           23       Q.  Could you state your complete name for the

           24  record, please?

           25       A.  Jose Mauricio Fuentes Acuna.

                                                                       5



            1       Q.  Could you spell your middle name, please.

            2       A.  M-A-U-R-I-C-I-O.

            3       Q.  And then the last name?

            4       A.  It's Acuna, so A-C-U-N-A.

            5       Q.  You go by Fuentes or Acuna?

            6       A.  Fuentes.

            7       Q.  Mr. Fuentes, how old are you?

            8       A.  31.

            9       Q.  We met just before the start of your

           10  deposition, correct?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  You understand I'm on the opposite side from

           13  you in this lawsuit?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  Have you ever given a deposition before?

           16       A.  No.

           17       Q.  Have you ever testified in court or tribunal or

           18  any kind of hearing?

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  Your attorney may have had a chance to visit

           21  with you before today to tell you about what to expect,

           22  but let me cover a few ground rules.  Okay?  It's

           23  important you understand you've been placed under oath.

           24  This is the same oath you'd be under if you were

           25  testifying in open court.

                                                                       6



            1                Do you understand that?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  And it carries with it the same pains and

            4  penalties for perjury as if you were testifying in open

            5  court.

            6                Do you understand that?

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  The purpose of the court reporter is to take

            9  down everything that you say during the deposition.  And

           10  to assist in that process, we have the benefit of an

           11  interpreter here who will translate your words from

           12  Spanish to English and your answers -- the answers -- my

           13  questions from English to Spanish and your answers from

           14  Spanish to English.  Okay?

           15       A.  Okay.

           16       Q.  Do you speak English at all?

           17       A.  Yes.  Some.

           18       Q.  Some.  But you would prefer speaking through

           19  the interpreter today, or can you do the deposition

           20  without it?

           21       A.  With interpreter.

           22       Q.  Good decision.  Because she's the one with the

           23  cookies, she leaves; they leave.

           24                MR. NEWTON:  He understands I think.

           25                THE INTERPRETER:  Uh-huh.

                                                                       7



            1       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  What we need to do during the

            2  deposition is not to speak over each other.  So if

            3  you'll wait till I complete my question before you start

            4  your answer, I'll return the courtesy and wait for you

            5  to complete your answer before I ask another question.

            6  Okay?

            7       A.  That's fine.

            8       Q.  I need to get audible responses from you, yes,

            9  no, I don't know, as opposed to uh-huh or uh-uh or

           10  shrugging of the shoulders or shaking of the head or

           11  nodding of the head, because, otherwise, we will not

           12  have your intended and clear testimony on the record.

           13  Okay?

           14       A.  That's fine.

           15       Q.  So if from time to time today I say, is that a

           16  "yes"?  Or is that a "no"?  I'm not being rude.  I'm

           17  just trying to make sure we have your intended testimony

           18  on the record.  Okay?

           19       A.  That's fine.

           20       Q.  If there are any questions I ask you that you

           21  don't understand or you would like to have repeated or

           22  rephrased, will you tell me, please?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  And since you have that opportunity, may we

           25  have this agreement that any question you answer today

                                                                       8



            1  you've understood.  Fair enough?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  And we'll go probably about an hour, take a

            4  break, and then go another hour until we're done.  But

            5  if for some reason you need to take a break to go down

            6  the hall or something like that, just let us know.

            7  We'll be happy to accommodate you.  Okay?

            8       A.  That's fine.

            9       Q.  What's your date of birth, sir?

           10       A.  It's 07/25/1988.

           11       Q.  Where were you born?

           12       A.  In Nuevo Leon, Mexico.

           13       Q.  When did you come to the United States?

           14       A.  I don't remember the exact date.

           15       Q.  Just generally.  Was it 10 years ago?  5 years

           16  ago?  What can you recall?

           17       A.  About 11 years.

           18       Q.  Are you a US citizen?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  When did you become a US citizen?

           21       A.  About four years ago.

           22       Q.  What countries have you lived in besides Mexico

           23  and the United States?

           24       A.  None other.

           25       Q.  What states have you lived in besides Texas?

                                                                       9



            1       A.  None other.

            2       Q.  Have you ever been arrested for a criminal

            3  offense?

            4       A.  No.

            5       Q.  Either in this country or in Mexico?

            6       A.  No.

            7       Q.  Do you have a driver's license?

            8       A.  Not right now.

            9       Q.  Why not?

           10       A.  Because it expired.

           11       Q.  Do you have it with you, your expired driver's

           12  license?

           13       A.  No.

           14       Q.  When did it expire?

           15       A.  I -- I don't remember exactly what year.  Like

           16  three, four years ago.

           17       Q.  How did you get here today?

           18       A.  Driving.

           19       Q.  So you drove here without a license; is that

           20  correct?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Why haven't you gotten your license renewed?

           23       A.  Because I just let it go.

           24       Q.  Okay.  But you know you need to have a driver's

           25  license to be able to legally drive on the streets here

                                                                      10

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  But you haven't tried to get your license

            4  renewed in three or four years?

           11       A.  No.

           12                (Exhibits 1022 and 1023 marked.)

           13                MR. NEWTON:  Glad I gave you back those

           14  tags.  This one says 1022.  Do we have -- did I get

           15  something mixed up?  Oh, here they are.  1023 is here.

           16  All right.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Fuentes, I'm going to show

           18  you a couple of maps that are marked 1022 and 1023 to

           19  your deposition.  These are exhibits.  Okay.  And will

           20  you take -- take a minute to look at those maps and kind

           21  of get oriented, and I'm going to ask you some

           22  questions.

           23       A.  Uh-huh.

           24       Q.  Okay.  Look at each one of them, please.  You

           25  recognize the work area at the Kuraray plant?

                                                                      31



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  Okay.  I want you to take the red pen there

            3  that's in front of you, and I want you to -- you can use

            4  either one of the maps.  It doesn't matter, whichever

            5  map is best for you to show where you were working at

            6  the time of the accident.  Okay?

            7                Now the first thing I want to get from you

            8  is where you were told to work that day, where were --

            9  you were assigned to work.  And can you identify that

           10  for us on one of the maps?

           11       A.  Yes.  Here.

           12       Q.  Okay.  And I want you to take the red pen and

           13  mark a W, a capital W where you were told to work that

           14  day.

           15                Okay.  And who told you to work there?

           16       A.  Octavio Santos.

           17       Q.  He was the foreman?

           18       A.  General foreman.

           19       Q.  General foreman with Force, right?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  Now the day of the accident, as soon as you got

           22  inside, you went over to the lunch tent for a safety

           23  meeting, right?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  And how long did that meeting last?

                                                                      32



            1       A.  Around 15, 20 minutes.

            2       Q.  Okay.  And do you recall what was discussed?

            3       A.  They talked about everybody's safety, that if

            4  you had questions for -- for plant people, you could ask

            5  them.

            6       Q.  Okay.

            7       A.  They talked about the heat; that we had to stay

            8  hydrated.

            9       Q.  Okay.  Anything else?

           10       A.  That we should be very careful; that you should

           11  take care of your brother's keeper.  That's how they

           12  call it.

           13       Q.  Right.  Your brother's keeper, right?  Look out

           14  for each other?

           15       A.  Yes.

           16       Q.  Okay.  It's the same kind of instructions that

           17  you'd received every day you go to work there, right?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  Okay.  Now what is that area that you've marked

           20  the W at?  What -- what is that part of the plant

           21  called?

           22       A.  Everybody called it the 1100.

           23       Q.  The 1100?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  And what were you told to do there?

                                                                      33



            1       A.  I was -- I had to go -- I would -- with the

            2  pipefitter and help him.

            3       Q.  Okay.  And did you do so that day?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  Okay.  Now I want you to take that red pen

            6  again and write the letter I where you were at that

            7  particular area -- show where you were exactly when the

            8  accident occurred.

            9       A.  With an I?

           10       Q.  Capital I.  Uh-huh.

           11       A.  I, right?

           12       Q.  Yes.  Draw it big enough so we can see it.

           13                Let me take a look.

           14                MR. NEWTON:  And the witness handed me

           15  Exhibit No. 1022, and he's marked a W and --

           16       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Can you put a cap on that --

           17  on that I?  It looks like a number 1.  It's a capital I.

           18  So if you can put a line across the top and a line

           19  across the bottom.  Okay.

           20                And between the two exhibits, 1022 and

           21  1023, this is the best one, this is the one you've

           22  chosen to show where you were working, right?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  Okay.  All right.  Now let's take a step back.

           25  You had worked at Kuraray for I think you said, what,

                                                                      34



            1  seven months, is that right, before the accident?

            2       A.  No.  About eight months.

            3       Q.  About eight months.  Okay.

            4                And what were your typical workdays when

            5  you would work there?  What days of the week?

            6       A.  Seven days.

            7       Q.  So for the entire eight months that you worked

            8  at Kuraray, you worked seven days a week?

            9       A.  No.

           10       Q.  Okay.  What was the typical days a week that

           11  you would work?

           12       A.  It was from Monday to Thursday and sometimes

           13  Friday.

           14       Q.  Is that a "yes"?

           15                THE WITNESS:  (In English) Yes.

           16       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  So Monday through

           17  Thursday and sometimes Friday?

           18       A.  (Via Interpreter) Yes.

           19       Q.  Would you sometimes work on Saturdays?

           20       A.  No.

           21       Q.  You never worked on Saturdays when you worked

           22  at Kuraray?

           23       A.  Yes.  We started working them when the shutdown

           24  started.

           25       Q.  Okay.  So sometimes you would work on

                                                                      35



            1  Saturdays?

            2       A.  Yes.  And Sundays.

            3       Q.  And when did the shutdown happen in

            4  relationship to when the accident occurred?

            5       A.  I didn't understand.  Sorry.

            6       Q.  Were you -- was the plant in shutdown at the

            7  time of the accident?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  Okay.  So when did the shutdown start before

           10  the accident occurred?  How long had it been shut down?

           11                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

           12                You still answer.

           13                THE WITNESS:  About -- I can't really

           14  remember.

           15       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Was it a week?  Was it a

           16  month?  What can you recall?

           17       A.  About a month.

           18       Q.  So your recollection is that the plant had shut

           19  down there at Kuraray for about a month before the time

           20  of the accident; is that right?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Okay.  So in the month leading up to the

           23  accident in May of -- of 2018, were you working

           24  Saturdays?

           25       A.  In May?

                                                                      36



            1       Q.  Yeah.  For that month period leading up to the

            2  day of the accident on May 19th, 2018, what days of the

            3  week were you working, in that month?

            4       A.  One week, seven days; one week, six days.

            5       Q.  Just depending on how much work they had to get

            6  done, right?

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  And how many hours a day would you typically

            9  work?

           10       A.  10.

           11       Q.  So you get paid overtime after 40 hours, right?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  What day of the week did the accident occur?

           14  Do you remember?

           15       A.  I don't remember exactly.

           16       Q.  The area where you were working that you've

           17  marked on the map, is that where you've been working for

           18  a while before the accident occurred?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  Were you always working as a helper for

           21  pipefitters or other workers?

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  How long had you been working 10 hours a day,

           24  six or seven days a week?

           25       A.  Not for very long.

                                                                      37



            1       Q.  For most of the time you worked at the Kuraray

            2  plant, what would be the days of the week that you would

            3  work?

            4       A.  One week, six days; one week, seven.

            5       Q.  Would you ever work on a Sunday?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  Did you have a regular day off, or did that

            8  just depend on what work they needed to have you do?

            9       A.  Because we can only work 13 days and then rest

           10  for one.  That's the rule.

           11       Q.  Okay.  That's a Force rule?

           12       A.  Yes.  Maybe.

           13       Q.  Okay.  Would you ever work more than 10 hours a

           14  day?

           15       A.  No.

           16       Q.  Okay.  So you're working as a pipefitter helper

           17  in the area where you've marked on the map on the day of

           18  the accident, right?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  What time of day did the accident occur?

           21       A.  I don't remember exactly.

           22       Q.  How long had you been working before the

           23  accident occurred?

           24       A.  Since I started working at the plant?

           25       Q.  That morning.  Yes.

                                                                      38



            1       A.  After the meeting, we went there, and we'd been

            2  working there.

            3       Q.  But how many hours after the safety meeting

            4  when you started work did the accident occur?  Was it

            5  30 minutes?  Was it five hours?  What do you remember?

            6       A.  I remember maybe three hours.

            7       Q.  Okay.  When was the first time you knew

            8  something was wrong?

            9       A.  When I saw the fire.

           10       Q.  Is that the first thing you saw was the fire?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  Did you hear anything before the fire?

           13       A.  No.

           14       Q.  Where was the fire in relationship to you?  How

           15  far away was it?  Was it a couple of blocks?  Was it a

           16  couple of football fields?  What would you say?

           17       A.  About 25 feet.

           18       Q.  About 25 feet from where you were?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  Was it on the same level where you were

           21  working?  Or was it above you, or was it below you?

           22       A.  A little bit higher.

           23       Q.  Were you working on the ground at the time of

           24  the fire, or were you working up on a scaffold?

           25       A.  I was working on the second floor of the unit.

                                                                      39



            1       Q.  Were you tied off?

            2       A.  No.

            3       Q.  Did you have to be tied off when you were

            4  working up on the second floor?

            5       A.  No.

            6       Q.  So what kind of surface were you standing on?

            7       A.  On the platform with grating.

            8       Q.  What kind of surface, though?  Was it -- was it

            9  wood?  Was it metal?  What -- how would you describe the

           10  surface you were standing on?

           11       A.  Metal.

           12       Q.  Okay.  So the first thing you realize is

           13  something is wrong is you see a fire; is that right?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  Okay.  Why don't you take that red pen again.

           16  And using the red pen, I want you to mark on this map

           17  about where it was that you saw the fire.  And I want

           18  you to use the letter F.  Capital F.

           19                Okay.  Let me see if I can read it.  You've

           20  drawn the letter F about where you said the fire was

           21  when you saw it, right?

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  Okay.  What did you do when you saw the fire?

           24  What's the next thing you did?

           25       A.  I went towards the stairs.

                                                                      40



            1       Q.  Okay.  Were you walking, or were you running?

            2       A.  I ran.

            3       Q.  Okay.  How far away was this -- were the stairs

            4  from where you were?

            6       Q.  Okay.  Then what did you do?

            7       A.  I went downstairs, and I went to the muster

            8  point.

            9       Q.  Did you walk or run to the muster point?

           10       A.  I walked.

           11       Q.  And I want you to use the red pen again and

           12  write capital M where the muster point was that you

           13  walked to on that same map, please.

           14                Take a look at it see if I can see it.  So

           15  you've marked with a letter M the muster point that you

           16  went to after the fire occurred; is that right?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  And will you confirm that you've made these

           19  marks on Exhibit 1022?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  And how did you know to go there?

           22       A.  Because they don't like -- like a repetition at

           23  the plant.  Rehearsal.

           24       Q.  Were these some drills or things like that?

                                                                      41



            1       Q.  These were like safety drills?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  So you would know what to do in the event of a

            4  real emergency, right?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  During the seven or eight months you worked at

            7  Kuraray, how many safety drills were there?

            8       A.  One.

            9       Q.  When you got to the muster point did you stay

           10  there?

           11                THE WITNESS:  (In Spanish) No.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Where did you go after that

           13  after you got to the muster point?

           14       A.  (Via Interpreter) No.

           15                We went to the street.  The plant was near

           16  the street.

           17       Q.  How long did you stay at the muster point?

           18       A.  About five, ten minutes.

           19       Q.  And then you left the muster point and went to

           20  the street or the parking lot?

           21       A.  We went to a space in between the two streets.

           22       Q.  And why did you go there?

           23       A.  Because the plant people took us out.

           24       Q.  Okay.  I want you to take the red pen, and with

           25  the letter capital E, write where you ended up.

                                                                      42

            4  when we got --

            5       Q.  Yes.  When you ended up -- wherever you ended

            6  up, I want you to take the pen and write a capital E to

            7  show where you ended up after you left the muster point.

            8       A.  With a -- with an E.

            9       Q.  Capital E.  Uh-huh.  So you -- you were told

           10  to -- after about five or ten minutes, you were told to

           11  go to the plant services building, which is where you've

           12  marked the letter E; is that correct?

           13       A.  No.  We were on the street for about one hour,

           14  and then they moved us to there.

           15       Q.  Oh, okay.  And how long did you stay at the

           16  plant services building?

           17       A.  About 45 minutes, an hour.

           18       Q.  Okay.  Did anybody come talk to you, tell you

           19  what happened?

           20       A.  No.

           21       Q.  Anybody with Force come talk to you?

           22       A.  No.

           23       Q.  Anybody come to you at Force and ask if you

            1       Q.  Did you tell anybody that you were hurt?

            2       A.  Not then.

            3       Q.  I'm talking about at the plant before you left

            4  that day.  Did you tell anybody that you were hurt?

            5       A.  No.

            6       Q.  Did you see anybody getting medical attention

            7  at the plant after you left where the fire occurred?

            8       A.  Two people.

            9       Q.  Tell me about those two people.  Where did you

           14       A.  Where they were?

           15       Q.  Yes.  Uh-huh.

           16       A.  Here.

           17       Q.  Okay.  I want you to write the word "people."

           18  Actually, put "2 people."  Write the number 2, and then

           19  put "people," P-E-O-P-L-E.

           20                Okay.  And tell me about these two people.

           25       A.  They were all red.

                                                                      44



            1       Q.  Were they wearing their clothes?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  They still had their clothes on?

            4       A.  They took it -- they took them away.

            5       Q.  Right.  But when you first saw them, they still

            6  had their clothes?

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  And who was taking care of them?  Were these

            9  medics, or were they plant safety people?  Or who was

           10  it?

           11       A.  First it was plant safety people.

           12       Q.  Anybody from Force help them?

           13       A.  I don't remember.

           14       Q.  Do you know who these two people were?

           15       A.  No.

           16       Q.  You don't know if they worked for Force or for

           17  somewhere else?

           18       A.  No.  I don't know.

           19       Q.  Okay.  How long did you stay there watching

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  Did you see them loaded on the helicopter?

                                                                      45



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  And then is it sometime after that that you

            3  went to the next location?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  Now when you were -- let's go back to where you

            6  were working.  When you saw the fire, did you feel

            7  anything?  Or did you just see the fire?  Did you feel

            8  any vibrations or shaking or anything?

            9       A.  A lot of vibration and a lot of noise,

           10  pressure.

           11       Q.  Describe the noise to us.

           12       A.  A sound like very (descriptive sound).

           13       Q.  Okay.  All right.  Did you feel any heat?

           14       A.  I don't remember.

           15       Q.  Did any debris, anything hit you from -- like

           16  anything fall on you or anything like that when you saw

           17  the fire, before you left the area?

           18       A.  I don't remember.  No.

           19       Q.  All right.  After you saw the fire and until

           20  you went to the muster point, did you fall down at all,

           21  or did you just walk to the muster point?

           22       A.  I fell like two, three times after I saw the

           23  fire and went to the stairs.

           24       Q.  So where you fell was up on the second floor?

           25       A.  Yes.

                                                                      46



            1       Q.  Why did you fall?

            2       A.  Because there was a pipe across the way.

            3       Q.  Okay.  So how did the pipe play a role in you

            4  falling?

            5       A.  Because I was turned the other way, and the

            6  pipe was behind me.

            7       Q.  Do you think if you walked to the staircase,

            8  you wouldn't have fallen?

            9                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

           10       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  You can answer.

           11       A.  In any case I would have fallen.

           12       Q.  How do you know?  Because you ran, right?

           13                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

           14                THE WITNESS:  Yes.  But I was turned

           15  towards the other side, and then when I turned around,

           16  the pipe was real close to me.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Had you ever fallen before

           18  that day up on that second level?

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  Had you ever fallen before at the plant during

           21  the eight months that you worked there before the day of

           22  the accident?

           23       A.  No.

           24       Q.  Now when you fell, did you fall forward?  Did

           25  you fall back?  Describe how you fell.

                                                                      47



            1       A.  To the -- to one side.

            2       Q.  Which side?

            3       A.  This side.

            4       Q.  Which side is that?

            5       A.  The right.

            6       Q.  Now when you say you fell, what made you fall?

            7  I'm trying to picture what happened that made you fall.

            8       A.  Well, sideways.

            9       Q.  What made you fall, though?

           10       A.  The pipe that was across the way.

           11       Q.  Okay.  Did you trip over it, or did you run

           12  into it with some part of your body?

           13       A.  With the feet.

           14       Q.  So you tripped over it?

           15       A.  Yes.

           16       Q.  But you've been working in that same area about

           17  three hours that day before the accident happened,

           18  right?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  And you'd never fallen before the accident

           21  occurred; is that right?

           22       A.  Right.

           23       Q.  Okay.  So when you fell, did a part of your

           24  body fall all the way to the ground, or did you just

           25  fall and catch yourself on the way?  And when I say "the

                                                                      48



            1  ground," I mean the metal platform that you were on top

            2  of when you were on the second floor.  You said it was

            3  metal.

            4                Did any part of your body, when you

            5  tripped, did it fall all the way to the metal flooring,

            6  or did you catch yourself somehow?

            7       A.  I fell on my hands and one side on the pipe.

            8       Q.  So you fell forward or to the side?

            9       A.  To the side.

           10       Q.  This the first time you fell?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  And what part of your body made contact with

           13  the metal you were standing on besides your feet?

           14       A.  My hands.

           15       Q.  Okay.  So you fell forward with your hands?

           16  Your hands -- you put your hands on the metal platform

           17  you were standing on?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  So your hands were down on the metal platform?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  Okay.  And then what happened?  What did you do

           22  then?

           23       A.  I stood up, and I kept running.  And I fell

           24  again.

           25       Q.  Okay.  What made you fall the second time?

                                                                      49



            1       A.  The fear.

            2       Q.  What do you mean "fear"?  Why did you fall the

            3  second time?

            4       A.  Fear of the fire.

            5       Q.  Okay.  But what made you fall?  That's what I'm

            6  trying to figure out.

            7                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

            8       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Did you trip over something,

            9  or did you -- what made you fall?

           10                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

           11                THE WITNESS:  May I answer?

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Yes.

           13                MR. KETKAR:  Yes.

           14       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  You can ignore what he says

           15  unless he says otherwise.

           16       A.  I tripped on the grating itself because it's

           17  kind of grip -- it grips.

           18       Q.  Okay.  And you tripped on the grating while you

           19  were running, right?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  And what part of your body made contact with

           22  the grating besides your feet?

           23       A.  My knees.

           24       Q.  Which -- which knee?

           25       A.  Both.

                                                                      50

           17       A.  No.

           18       Q.  So how did -- why -- why did you go back the

            3       Q.  Who was the first doctor you saw for any

           10                THE WITNESS:  Allied.  Allied Medical

           11  Center.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  And who did you see at Allied

           13  Medical Center?

           14       A.  A doctor.

           15       Q.  What was the doctor's name?

           16       A.  I don't remember.

           17       Q.  Do you remember the name of any doctor that you

           18  saw at Allied Medical Center at any time?

           19       A.  No.  I don't remember.

           20       Q.  Why did you go to Allied Medical Center?  Did

           21  somebody send you there?

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  Who sent you there?

           24       A.  My attorney.

           25       Q.  Now the records say that you first saw someone

                                                                      66



            1  at Allied Medical Center about one month after the

            2  accident.  Does that sound right to you?

            3       A.  I don't remember if it was a month.

            4       Q.  Okay.  The medical records actually say the

            5  first date you saw a doctor was June 29, 2018.  Do you

            6  have any reason to disagree with that date, or did that

            7  sound about right to you?

            8       A.  I couldn't tell you if it's right or not.

            9       Q.  Okay.  You don't dispute it, though?  You don't

           10  say it's wrong?  This isn't a trick question.  I promise

           11  you.

           12       A.  I don't remember really.

           13       Q.  Okay.

           14       A.  I don't --

           15       Q.  Okay.  If your records say that the first time

           16  you went to Allied was June 29th, 2018, does that sound

           17  about right to you, or does that sound wrong to you?

           18       A.  If the papers come from the clinic, maybe yes.

           19       Q.  Yes.  Okay.

           20                And that would be 40 days after the day of

           21  the accident, wouldn't it?

           22       A.  Uh-huh.  Yes.

           23       Q.  Okay.  Now why did you go to the doctor, other

           24  than you were told to go there by your lawyer?  What did

           25  you go there for besides being told to do that by your

                                                                      67

            4       A.  After the accident.

            5       Q.  Okay.  But the problems with your back didn't

            6  keep you from going back to work, right?

            7       A.  To -- to a certain point.

            8       Q.  Right.  You didn't lose any time from work

            9  because your back hurt, did you?

           10       A.  No.

           11       Q.  So you went to Allied.  You some doctor there

           12  whose name you don't remember.  And you told him about

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  And what'd they do for you?

           16       A.  They gave me some exercises, some medication.

           17  And then sometime later, I went to see another doctor.

           18       Q.  Okay.  Let's just talk about what you did for

           19  Allied -- or did at Allied.  What kind of medicines did

           20  they give you?

           21       A.  Some tablets.

           22       Q.  They actually gave you some tablets?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  Do you know what they were?

           11       A.  Once a day.  Twice a day.

           12       Q.  Did you take it as you needed it, or did you

           13  take it once or twice a day every day just because

           14  that's what you were told to do?

           15       A.  The prescription told me how I had to take

           16  them.

           17       Q.  And you followed the prescription?

           18       A.  Yes.

            1       Q.  But they didn't do any good for you?

            2       A.  No.

            3       Q.  Now after the accident -- well, strike that.

            4                Did you go to Allied for anything other

            5  than your back pain?

           21  told them about besides your leg pain and your back

           22  pain, low-back pain?

           23       A.  No.

           24       Q.  Now you said that you first recall having

            1  did you recall your legs starting to hurt?  When do you

            2  first remember that?

            3       A.  It was like a day before.

            4       Q.  So maybe four days after the accident?

            5       A.  Yes.

            8       A.  Apart from the back, no.

            9       Q.  Okay.  So when you went to Allied about 40 days

           10  after the accident, you told the doctors there

           11  everything that hurt, right?  And you do that because

           12  you know that they're there to treat you and they can't

           13  treat you if you don't tell them where it hurts, right?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  So they gave you some pills, and they had you

           16  do some exercises.  Did you go through what's called

           17  physical therapy?

           19       Q.  Did they give you exercises to do at home?

           20       A.  Yes.  They gave me a list.

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  Did you do them every day?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  Did that seem to help the pain in your back or

                                                                      75



            1  your legs?

            2       A.  No.

            3       Q.  How long did you have pain in your legs?

            4       A.  Like two weeks.

            5       Q.  How long did you have pain in your back, your

            6  low back?

            7       A.  To -- until this day.

            8       Q.  Okay.  So you've always had low-back pain since

            9  the day of the accident?  Is that what you're saying?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Has it ever gotten better or gotten worse, or

           12  has it stayed the same?

           13       A.  It got worse.

           14       Q.  Had it ever gotten better?

           15       A.  No.

           16       Q.  On a scale of 1 to 10, if 10 is the worst kind

           17  of pain, what would you rate your pain as, since the

           18  accident?

           19       A.  The worst pain I've had?

           20       Q.  If you're to rate your pain on a scale of 1 to

           21  10, where 10 is the worst pain, what level of pain would

           22  you say you were on on that scale?

            1       A.  Like an 8.

            2       Q.  Did it ever get better?  Did it ever go down

           17  feeling that?  Was it two weeks after the accident?  Was

           18  it three weeks?

           19       A.  Like two weeks -- three -- two weeks.

           20       Q.  Two weeks?  Okay.  Two weeks after the

           21  accident?

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  Had you done something to aggravate your back?

           24  Did you fall or bend over, pick up something really

           25  heavy or something?

                                                                      77



            1       A.  No.

            2       Q.  Now you were back at work by then, though,

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  Did you tell anybody that you worked for, any

            8       A.  No.

            9       Q.  Did you ask to see any of the medics or the

           10  medical -- or safety people there at work?

           11       A.  No.

           12       Q.  Now when you went to Allied for the first time

           13  on June 29, 2018, were you still working at Kuraray?

           14       A.  I don't remember.

           15       Q.  Okay.  You told me earlier that after the

           16  accident when you went back to work at Kuraray, you

           17  worked until July 26, 2018, when you were laid off.  You

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  So if you went to the Allied, the first doctor

           21  you saw on June 29, 2018, you'd still have been working

           22  at Kuraray, right?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  And you continued to work there after you saw

           25  the doctor at Allied until you were laid off on July 26,

                                                                      78

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  Eventually you said you had an injection in

            4  your back?

            6       Q.  Did they do it in your lower back?

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  When was that done?

            9       A.  I don't remember.

           10       Q.  Well, was it 2018 when the accident happened,

           11  or was it more recently than that?

           12       A.  It was more recently.

           13       Q.  How long ago was it?  Was it -- was it four

           14  months?  Five months?

           15       A.  I really don't remember when.

           16       Q.  Where did you have it done?

           17       A.  Where -- in which place?

           18       Q.  Yes.  What was the name of the place where you

           19  had your back injection done?

           20       A.  I don't remember the name.

           21       Q.  Where was it?

           22       A.  It's around Kirby and 610.  Something like

           23  that.

           24       Q.  Okay.  And how many times did you had an

           25  injection done in your back?

                                                                      79



            1       A.  Once.

            2       Q.  Did it help your pain at all?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  How much would you say it helped your pain?

            5       A.  Very little.

            6       Q.  Do you recall telling a doctor that your pain

            7  got better by 50 percent?

            8       A.  No.

            9       Q.  If it says that in your medical records that

           10  you told your doctor that your pain got 50 percent

           11  better after the injection, would that be wrong?

           12       A.  Maybe.

           13       Q.  Well, yes or no?  Do you recall ever saying to

           14  a doctor that the injections helped your pain about

           15  50 percent?  Or do you believe that you never said that

           16  and the medical records have to be wrong?

           17       A.  I don't remember.

           18       Q.  So you don't deny saying that, but you don't

           19  remember saying it either; is that right?

           20       A.  I don't remember.

           21       Q.  How long did your pain get better after you had

           22  your injection?  How long did it stay better?  How long

           23  was your pain less?  Put it that way.

           13       Q.  Now when you were receiving safety training, do

           14  you recall, Mr. Fuentes, being told that if you saw what

           15  you thought was a dangerous condition, you had the

           16  authority to stop the work to make sure people didn't

           17  get hurt?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  Have you ever used that authority to stop work

           24  a look.

           25                MR. NEWTON:  This is document attached --

                                                                      92



            1                MR. KETKAR:  It's -- it's what you already

            2  have.

            3                MR. NEWTON:  What I already have?  Okay.

            4                MR. KETKAR:  Yeah.  I just didn't -- I

            5  wasn't sure if you'd had a copy.

            6                MR. NEWTON:  Yeah.  I -- I got that.  This

            7  is the third supplemental?  Okay.  Okay.  So there's

            8  been the original answers, first supplemental, second

            9  supplemental, and now the third supplemental.

           10                MR. KETKAR:  I believe so.

           11                MR. NEWTON:  Does that sound right?

           12                MR. KETKAR:  Do you want me to go off the

           13  record for a second to --

           14                MR. NEWTON:  Yeah.  If you can, that would

           15  be great.  Because I'm trying to figure out what these

           16  are verified.

           17                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record at

           21  back on the record at 4:58.

           22                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  Counsel, you have

           23  handed me a verification signed by Mr. Fuentes,

           24  apparently on July 19, 2019, and you say it is intended

           25  to be verification of the third supplemental answers to

                                                                      93

           11       A.  Per day.

           12       Q.  So they would give you every week 90 to $95 a

           21       Q.  This document there -- where is it?  Yeah, it's

            1  they do all the work?

            2       A.  I helped with the answers.

            3       Q.  Which answers did you help with?  Do you

           13       Q.  Did you help when it asked how much you got

           16       Q.  Do you recall any others you helped with?

           21       A.  Right.

           23       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Fuentes, let me show you

           24  what's been marked as Exhibit No. 1026 to your

           25  deposition.  Can you identify this at the top as the

                                                                      98



            1  card you got from the Houston Area Safety Council?

            2  That's got your name and picture on it.  Can you confirm

            3  that?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  Get it back.  Thank you.

            6                And the next thing on this exhibit is your

            7  Texas identification card; is that right?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  Okay.  And when did you get that, sir?

           11       Q.  You know that's not a driver's license, right?

           12       A.  Right.

           13       Q.  You can leave it there.

           14                MR. NEWTON:  Now the verification, Ajay,

           15  that you said that he signed on July 19, 2019, you said

           16  was intended for the third supplemental answers.  Is

           17  that right?

           18                MR. KETKAR:  Correct.

           19                MR. NEWTON:  The reason I ask that is

           20  because the second supplemental answers to

           21  interrogatories are dated June 3, 2019.  So has he done

           22  a verification for that one, for the second

           23  supplemental?  Do you --

           24                MR. KETKAR:  I -- I do not know.

           25                MR. NEWTON:  And what about the first

                                                                      99



            1  supplemental?  Do you know if he's done a verification

            2  for that one?

            3                MR. KETKAR:  I do not know.

            4                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.

            5                (Exhibit 1027 marked.)

            6       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Let me show you, Mr. Fuentes,

            7  Exhibit No. 1027 to your deposition.  And I'll submit to

            8  you that these are the second supplemental answers to

            9  interrogatories that were served on -- I'm looking --

           10  June 3, 2019.  Do you see that?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  Okay.  Do you agree that that's what the date

           13  shows?  Says June 3, 2019, on this document?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  And this is Exhibit 1027 to your deposition,

           16  correct?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  And do you agree it says "plaintiff's second

           19  supplemental answers to master set of interrogatories"?

           20                Do you see that?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Now on that document it gives a driver's

           23  license number of 376444953 on page 3.  Do you know

           24  where they got this number?

           25       A.  From my ID.

                                                                     100



            1       Q.  Okay.  But that's not the same number as your

            2  Texas ID card.  Your Texas ID card is 39178376.  You see

            3  that?  It's a different number, isn't it?

            4       A.  Yes.  Correct.

            5       Q.  Okay.  Now the driver's license number that you

            6  gave before was your expired driver's license; is that

            7  right?

            8       A.  No.

            9       Q.  Well, you don't have a current driver's

           10  license, right?

           11       A.  Correct.

           12       Q.  And you haven't had a current driver's license

           13  for over three years, correct?

           14       A.  Correct.

           15       Q.  Okay.  Now it does say that the amended answer

           16  on this second supplemental is -- it does give your

           17  Texas ID number.  You see that on page 3?  Did you see

           18  on page 3, sir?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  It says "amended answer," and it gives your

           21  Texas ID number?  Right?

           22       A.  That I gave them -- I gave it modified?

           23       Q.  I'm sorry?  No, no.  It just says -- it does

           24  list your ID number, but it's different than the

           25  driver's license number that appears above, correct?

                                                                     101



            1       A.  Yes.  Yes.  It's different.

            2       Q.  It's a different number, isn't it?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  Okay.  One says it's a driver's license, but we

            5  know you haven't had a current license for over three

            6  years.  The other one is an ID card, right?  Right?

            7       A.  Yes.  But this is not my license number.

            8       Q.  The number that's on this -- your answer to

            9  interrogatories 376-44-4953 is not your driver's license

           10  number?

           11       A.  No.

           12       Q.  Do you know whose driver's license number that

           13  is?

           14       A.  I don't know.

           15       Q.  Do you know what your driver's license number

           16  is?

           17       A.  I don't remember.

           18       Q.  You just know it's not the one that's on

           19  this -- this second supplemental interrogatories; is

           20  that right?

           21       A.  Yes.  That's not this one.

           22       Q.  What's your Social Security number?

           23       A.  629-98-2202.

           24       Q.  And you see that on page 3, too, don't you,

           25  right above your driver's license number?

                                                                     102

          25           was examined and testified as follows:

                                                                  5




           1                   VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

           2    BY MS. HENKLE:

           3        Q.   Good morning, Doctor.  Would you please

           4    introduce yourself to the jury.

           5        A.   Sure.  So my name is Dr. Yesh Navalgund.

           6    I'm an interventional pain management physician here

           7    in the Greater Pittsburgh Area.

           8        Q.   And we're here today to take your testimony

           9    on behalf of your patient Tracy Johns regarding your

          10    evaluation and treatment of Miss Johns following a

          11    July 13, 2017, vehicle accident and any opinions you

          12    formed as a result of that treatment.

          13             Before we do that, I need to ask you some

          14    questions about your qualifications in order to

          15    qualify you as an expert witness.

          16        A.   Sure.

          17        Q.   What type of doctor are you?

          18        A.   As I mentioned, I'm an interventional pain

          19    management physician.  My training extends from a

          20    surgery internship at the University of Virginia,

          21    anesthesiology residency at the University of

          22    Pittsburgh, and a fellowship in interventional pain

          23    management at West Virginia University.

          24        Q.   Are you licensed to practice medicine in

          25    the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania?

                                                                  6




           1        A.   Yes, I certainly am.

           2        Q.   What is anesthesiology?

           3        A.   Anesthesiology is a subspecialty of

           4    medicine which basically encompasses all of the care

           5    for a patient before, during, and after surgery,

           6    including the management of their pain.

           7        Q.   And what is pain management?

           8        A.   Pain management is an additional

           9    subspecialty under anesthesiology, and in some

          10    instances under rehab medicine, neurology as well.

          11    And that subspecialty includes the treatment of

          12    patients with acute and chronic pain as a result of

          13    cancer and other medical conditions as well as

          14    injuries.

          15        Q.   And how is interventional pain management

          16    different than regular pain management?

          17        A.   So pain management has over the past decade

          18    sort of split into two different types of

          19    management.  One is traditional medical management,

          20    which is basically after all sources of pain have

          21    been exhausted and there are no other alternatives

          22    we now move into medical management.  As we all

          23    know, the United States has suffered a significant

          24    crisis with the opiate crisis as a result of

          25    ignoring other options for pain.  Interventional

                                                                  7




           1    pain management is a specialty of pain which we

           2    take, and I try to identify the actual source of

           3    injury and then treat it with minimally invasive

           4    surgical and injection therapies.

           5        Q.   And how long have you been a doctor?

           6        A.   I've been a doctor -- actually, now it's

           7    like 1999, so 20 years.

           8        Q.   Can you describe for the jury the process

           9    of how you became a doctor?

          10        A.   Sure.  So upon completing my undergraduate

          11    studies at the University of Pittsburgh Medical

          12    School and Saba University, went on to complete an

          13    internship in general surgery at the University of

          14    Virginia and then anesthesiology residency at the

          15    University of Pittsburgh and a fellowship in

          16    interventional pain management at West Virginia

          17    University.  Upon completion of each of the steps as

          18    I described, first, upon completion of

          19    anesthesiology residency I completed a board

          20    certification in anesthesia, which was twofold.  The

          21    first part is a written examination for testing

          22    knowledge base.  The second is an oral examination

          23    administered by experts in the field to determine

          24    competency in the field of anesthesiology.  Upon

          25    completing my fellowship training at West Virginia

                                                                  8




           1    University in interventional pain management, an

           2    additional board certification in pain management I

           3    obtained.  And I continue to maintain certification

           4    and maintenance of that certification in pain

           5    management.

           6        Q.   Have you ever been qualified to testify as

           7    an expert witness in Allegheny County?

           8        A.   Sure.  Yes.

           9                           * * *

          10      (Navalgund Deposition Exhibit 1 was marked for

          11                      identification.)

          12                          * * *

          13    BY MS. HENKLE:

          14        Q.   And, Doctor, I'm going to hand you what

          15    I've marked as Navalgund 1.  Can you please identify

          16    for the jury what that document is?

          17        A.   This is my resume, or CV, which outlines

          18    some of the accomplishments over the years.

          19    BY MS. HENKLE:

          20        Q.   And can you tell the jury about your

          21    academic appointments?

          22        A.   Sure.  So I currently hold a position as an

          23    assistant professor in the Department of

          24    Anesthesiology, Division of Pain at West Virginia

          25    University, as well as an adjunct professor position

                                                                  9




           1    at the University of Pittsburgh School of

           2    Anesthesia.

           3        Q.   And can you tell the jury about your

           4    leadership positions in any professional

           5    associations?

           6        A.   Sure.  A couple of highlights would be the

           7    American Society of Regional Anesthesia.  I am a

           8    founding member of the -- what they call the SIG,

           9    which is the specialty branch of the American

          10    Society of Regional Anesthesia, which focuses on

          11    minimally invasive pain management techniques.  I'm

          12    also an editor and reviewer for the Journal of

          13    Neuromodulation, which is a combined neurosurgical

          14    and pain management journal which is a peer-reviewed

          15    journal in neuromodulation.  I also am the medical

          16    director of National Bioskills Laboratories, which

          17    is a training center, one here in Pittsburgh,

          18    Dallas, Texas, as well as San Francisco, California,

          19    in which the facilities train surgeons on new

          20    techniques and both minimally invasive and invasive

          21    surgical procedures in neurosurgery, orthopedics,

          22    podiatry, as well as trauma.

          23        Q.   And let's talk a little bit about your

          24    current practice.  How long has DNA been in

          25    existence?

                                                                 10




           1        A.   So DNA, which is my current practice, has

           2    been in existence since 2004, which would be about

           3    15 years now.

           4        Q.   How many office locations do you have?

           5        A.   So offices, there are four locations plus

           6    two ambulatory surgical centers as well that are

           7    part of the practice.  In addition, our physicians

           8    are privileged at four hospitals in the area and

           9    perform more invasive procedures at the hospitals.

          10        Q.   And what do you do on a daily basis?

          11        A.   So my practice consists of some days clinic

          12    visits, evaluations to determine the sources of

          13    pain.  Other days I have procedural-based --

          14    procedural-based days as well as operating room days

          15    for more invasive procedures.  And then I have days

          16    allocated at West Virginia University as well for

          17    teaching residents in the fields of anesthesiology,

          18    physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology,

          19    neurosurgery and family medicine.

          20        Q.   And what are some types of things that you

          21    do in your interventional pain practice, such as

          22    procedures?

          23        A.   More common procedures that are performed

          24    are the injections which can be performed in the

          25    office where we have suites within the office that

                                                                 11




           1    allow us to perform these procedures.  The

           2    injections range from epidural injections to

           3    radiofrequency ablation procedures, as well as some

           4    of the devices that we surgically implant, such as

           5    cancer pain pumps and things like that where we do

           6    the refills as well in the office.

           7        Q.   And how often are you performing these

           8    procedures?

           9        A.   That's a good question.  At least four days

          10    a week.

          11        Q.   And as part of your practice do you treat

          12    people who have been injured in car accidents or

          13    other incidents?

          14        A.   Sure.

          15        Q.   And do you frequently treat people who have

          16    neck and back injuries?

          17        A.   Yes, I do.

          18        Q.   And as part of your practice, do you

          19    routinely review medical records?

          20        A.   Yes.

          21        Q.   What about diagnostic studies and imaging?

          22        A.   Sure.

          23        Q.   Does that include MRI studies?

          24        A.   Yes.

          25        Q.   Does that also include EMG studies?

                                                                 12




           1        A.   Yes.

           2        Q.   And does your practice include diagnosing

           3    patients and projecting future care and treatment?

           4        A.   Yes.

           5        Q.   Are you familiar with costs associated with

           6    different treatments?

           7        A.   Yes.

           8        Q.   How are you familiar with that?

           9        A.   So the way our practice is structured, I

          10    have my academic positions, which I'm on leadership

          11    roles within hospitals, including medical director

          12    positions, so I have an idea of costs related to

          13    hospital charges.  In the ambulatory surgical center

          14    I'm on the board for the ambulatory surgical center

          15    as well, where we routinely review costs of

          16    procedures as well as reimbursement associated with

          17    procedures.  And then, of course, in my private

          18    practice, just to stay afloat, we maintain records

          19    as well as analyze the costs of procedures and the

          20    reimbursement associated with them as well.

          21        Q.   My office had asked you to prepare a

          22    narrative report on behalf of Miss Johns regarding

          23    her treatment so that you could testify in that

          24    matter; is that correct?

          25        A.   Yes.

                                                                 13




           1        Q.   And you were paid to write the report; is

           2    that correct?

           3        A.   Of course, yes.

           4        Q.   And if you weren't here testifying today,

           5    what would be would you doing?

           6        A.   I would be in my office generating income

           7    in my office.

           8        Q.   And you would be getting paid for being in

           9    your office?

          10        A.   Yes, certainly more than here.

          11               MS. HENKLE:  Thank you, Doctor.  At this

          12    time I'm going to allow defense counsel to ask some

          13    questions about your qualifications.

          14               VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

          15    BY MR. FOLEY:

          16        Q.   Good morning, Dr. Navalgund.

          17        A.   Good morning.

          18        Q.   My name is Roger Foley.  I represent the

          19    Port Authority of Allegheny County.  I introduced

          20    myself to you earlier this morning for the first

          21    time, and I do have some brief questions regarding

          22    both your resume and your qualifications.

          23        A.   Sure.

          24        Q.   So according to your resume, and you just

          25    testified that you attended medical school at Saba

                                                                 14




           1    University School of Medicine?

           2        A.   That's correct.

           3        Q.   And where is Saba University located?

           4        A.   That is in the Caribbean; Netherlands

           5    Antilles is the country.

           6        Q.   So you attended the University of

           7    Pittsburgh for your bachelor's degree, and then you

           8    obtained your medical degree at a university in the

           9    Caribbean?

          10        A.   That's right.

          11        Q.   And you presently do some teaching, you

          12    indicated, at schools of anesthesia for the

          13    University of Pittsburgh as well as West Virginia

          14    University?

          15        A.   That's right.

          16        Q.   What type of students do you teach at those

          17    schools?  And by that I mean, are you teaching

          18    doctors, are you teaching nurses; who are you

          19    teaching at those schools?

          20        A.   At the University of Pittsburgh I'm

          21    teaching certified nurse anesthetists.  And at West

          22    Virginia University I'm teaching doctors, residents

          23    in neurology, anesthesiology, neurosurgery and

          24    family medicine.

          25        Q.   You also indicated that you're board

                                                                 15




           1    certified in anesthesiology with a pain medicine

           2    specialty; is that correct?

           3        A.   Yes.  I obtained my original board

           4    certification in anesthesiology in 2005, I believe,

           5    and then pain medicine in 2006.  And I currently

           6    maintain certification in pain medicine since 2016.

           7        Q.   You are not board certified in the fields

           8    of orthopedics or orthopedic surgery; are you?

           9        A.   No, certainly not.

          10        Q.   So you don't perform orthopedic surgeries

          11    as part of your practice?

          12        A.   No.

          13        Q.   As part of your certification or otherwise,

          14    have you ever learned about what is referred to as

          15    foraminal narrowing and foraminal encroachment?

          16        A.   Sure.

          17        Q.   What is meant by the term foraminal

          18    narrowing?

          19        A.   So foraminal narrowing is basically the

          20    opening where a nerve root extends out of the spinal

          21    canal.  When that narrows, or thickens, or due to

          22    trauma is displaced and it encroaches on the nerve,

          23    that's called foraminal narrowing or encroachment.

          24        Q.   Is foraminal narrowing different than

          25    foraminal encroachment?

                                                                 16




           1        A.   No.

           2        Q.   They're both basically the same?

           3        A.   That's right.

           4        Q.   Okay.  And as part of your certification or

           5    otherwise, have you learned about what is referred

           6    to as a disc protrusion?

           7        A.   Sure.

           8        Q.   What is meant by a disc protrusion?

           9        A.   So the discs themselves are basically -- be

          10    easier just to show you on the model.

          11        Q.   Sure.

          12        A.   So the discs themselves are basically the

          13    spongy substance between the bones.  They have a

          14    shape that's almost identical to the bones above and

          15    below.  When a protrusion occurs, in this model as

          16    shown in red here, when a protrusion occurs that

          17    expands outside of its normal original shape, and

          18    that's a radiographic description, meaning looking

          19    at pictures on MRI you can see a protrusion.

          20        Q.   Okay.  So your current practice is located

          21    at DNA Advanced Pain Treatment Center; is that

          22    correct?

          23        A.   That's correct, yes.

          24        Q.   What does the DNA in the name of your

          25    practice stand for?

                                                                 17




           1        A.   Dayo Navalgund Associates.  Dayo was my

           2    original partner who unfortunately passed away with

           3    a brain tumor in 2013.  And then my wife, Dr. Brenda

           4    Navalgund, as well as myself, form the N in DNA, and

           5    the remaining associates.

           6        Q.   Okay.  So you are one of the owners of the

           7    DNA Treatment Center?

           8        A.   Yes.

           9        Q.   And you said that's been in existence since

          10    about 2004?

          11        A.   That's right.

          12        Q.   What is the approximate number of current

          13    patients that obtain treatment at the DNA Treatment

          14    Center by its doctors and other practitioners?

          15        A.   So looking at it as a whole, clinical

          16    visits, procedure visits, we encounter approximately

          17    3,000 patient encounters a month.

          18        Q.   And by looking at your resume, it also

          19    appeared to me that your primary practice, and you

          20    testified to this, is related to managing pain

          21    control; would that be a fair statement?

          22        A.   Yes.

          23        Q.   And is it accurate that a regular part of

          24    your practice at DNA Treatment Center is spent

          25    providing various injections for pain relief to your

                                                                 18




           1    patients?

           2        A.   Sure.

           3        Q.   For example, you talked about epidural

           4    injections, correct?

           5        A.   That's right.

           6        Q.   And there's facet block injections?

           7        A.   Correct.

           8        Q.   You might have testified to this before,

           9    and if you did I apologize; what percentage of your

          10    practice at the DNA Treatment Center would you say

          11    is related to providing injections for pain relief

          12    to patients?

          13        A.   About half of the practice encounters.

          14        Q.   Now, when you perform various injections at

          15    the DNA Treatment Center, is there ever any plan or

          16    expectation that those injections will be able to

          17    resolve the pain being experienced by the patient?

          18        A.   That's always the hope.  But our practice

          19    is in the management of pain, so we look for answers

          20    that may resolve pain, but mostly look for quality

          21    of life in patients.

          22        Q.   And how about when you perform those

          23    injections, is there ever any plan or potential that

          24    that injection will resolve the pain such that the

          25    patient will not need to continue treatment at the

                                                                 19




           1    DNA Treatment Center any longer?

           2        A.   We certainly hope for that.

           3        Q.   And have you ever seen that?

           4        A.   In various conditions, yes.

           5        Q.   Okay.  And have you seen it where the

           6    injections have actually resolved a person's pain?

           7    You talked about hoping for it; have you actually

           8    seen it happen?

           9        A.   Yes, of course.

          10        Q.   Is the treatment that we've discussed thus

          11    far and that you perform as a regular part of your

          12    practice ever used for the treatment of generative

          13    disc disease?

          14        A.   From a management perspective, yes.

          15        Q.   And do some of the patients that you

          16    presently treat at the DNA Treatment Center actually

          17    have degenerative disc disease?

          18        A.   Sure.  It's a normal finding with age.

          19        Q.   And is degenerative disc disease a form of

          20    arthritis?

          21        A.   No.

          22        Q.   And what do you mean when you say that?

          23    Why is it not a form of arthritis?

          24        A.   Because a degenerative disc has nothing to

          25    do with bony malformation or arthritis.

                                                                 20




           1        Q.   But it is something you said that is common

           2    as people age?

           3        A.   Yes.  Of course.

           4        Q.   And would you agree with me that

           5    degenerative disc disease may affect different

           6    people at different rates but is still just a

           7    natural part of that process of aging?

           8        A.   Of course, yes.

           9        Q.   Are there times when degenerative disc

          10    disease becomes symptomatic requiring treatment?

          11        A.   Yes.

          12        Q.   And that is treatment that you provide at

          13    the DNA Treatment Center?

          14        A.   That's correct.

          15        Q.   Okay.  Doctor, this is not the first time

          16    you've ever been requested to provide testimony at

          17    the law firm of Simon & Simon; is it?

          18        A.   No.

          19        Q.   And Miss Johns is also not the first

          20    patient that you ever treated who also happens to be

          21    a client of the law firm of Simon & Simon, correct?

          22        A.   That's correct.

          23        Q.   What percentage of patients does your

           1    case, Simon & Simon?  Just an estimate.

           2        A.   If you can give me a second I can give you

           3    a percentage.

           4        Q.   Okay.

           5        A.   I'm just going to use the calculator.  I

           6    never analyzed that before.

           7        Q.   Do you have an actual number of patients

           8    that --

           9        A.   I'm going to say approximately ten patients

          10    every couple months.  So maybe five -- five to seven

          11    patients a month.  So on the higher side, let's say

          12    seven patients a month.  Divide by our patient

          13    encounters.  About .25, so a quarter of a percent.

          14        Q.   Now, you mentioned ten; was it -- I didn't

          15    understand where the ten came from earlier.

          16        A.   I said over a period of two months.

          17        Q.   Oh, okay.  So it's seven patients per

          18    month.

          19        A.   Yeah.  Plus or minus a few so. . .

          20        Q.   Okay.

          21        A.   So. . .

          22        Q.   So about 84 patients a year from Simon &

          23    Simon?

          24        A.   That sounds reasonable.  I don't have an

          25    exact number, but it's very close to something to

                                                                 22




           1    that effect.

           2        Q.   Do you know a chiropractor by the name of

           3    Dr. Ralph Petrarca from the Rehab Centre?

           4        A.   Not other than through our referral

           5    database system.  I don't personally know him.  I

           6    never spoke to him before.

           7        Q.   In this case the plaintiff, Miss Johns, has

           8    previously testified that she obtained the name of

           9    Dr. Petrarca from her attorney's office of Simon &

          10    Simon, and that Dr. Petrarca referred her to you for

          11    additional treatment.  My question is, do you recall

          12    Dr. Petrarca referring Miss Johns to you for medical

          13    treatment back in October of 2017?

          14        A.   Not specifically, but I have seen his name

          15    on various referrals in the past so I wouldn't be

          16    surprised if he referred a patient to us.

          17        Q.   Okay.  Isn't it true that many patients of

          18    Dr. Petrarca refers to the DNA Treatment Center are

          19    also clients of Miss Johns' attorney, Simon & Simon?

          20        A.   That wouldn't be the case.  I've seen a

          21    number in of patients -- more patients from him than

          22    I have seen Simon & Simon related.

          23        Q.   Okay.  The medical records also indicate

          24    that another one of Miss Johns' physicians was Dr.

          25    Michelle Holding.  Do you know Dr. Holding?

                                                                 23




           1        A.   No, I don't.

           2             I believe she's the -- either neurologist

           3    or a rehab physician that does EMGs.

           4        Q.   So you're not aware if Dr. Holding also

           5    refers various patients to you that are also clients

           6    of the law firm of Simon & Simon?  You have no

           7    knowledge of that as an owner of DNA?

           8        A.   I definitely know that some of her patients

           9    are clients of Simon & Simon, but I have no

          10    connection or know of her or talk to her so I don't

          11    know much else about her.

          12        Q.   Okay.  Because the only thing that you know

          13    of her is that she gives you cases, clients from

          14    Simon & Simon?

          15        A.   No, just that she's a referring physician

          16    on our list of referrers.

          17               MR. FOLEY:  Okay.  Those are all the

          18    questions I have at the present time.

          19               MS. HENKLE:  Okay.

          20               At this time I would offer Dr. Yeshvant

          21    Navalgund as an expert in the field of

          22    interventional pain management and anesthesiology.

           9    BY MS. HENKLE:

          10        Q.   Doctor, we're here today to take your

          11    testimony on behalf of your patient Tracy Johns

          12    related to treatment following her July 13, 2017,

          13    accident.  During the testimony I'm going to ask you

          14    some opinions, but I don't want you to give any

          15    opinions unless you can do so to a reasonable degree

          16    of medical certainty.  Is that fair?

          17        A.   Sure.

          18        Q.   And my office asked you to prepare a

          19    narrative report so you could testify here today; is

          20    that correct?

          21        A.   Yes.

           1    BY MS. HENKLE:

           2        Q.   I'm going to hand you what I've marked as

           3    Navalgund 2.  Can you explain for the jury what that

           4    document is?

           5        A.   This is a narrative report summarizing my

           6    encounters with Miss Johns describing some of the

           7    treatment and some of the treatment that I would

           8    expect her to have over the course of the next

           9    several years.

          10        Q.   I'm going to ask you to refer to your

          11    report as needed during the course of your testimony

          12    here today; is that fair?

          13        A.   Sure.

          14        Q.   And did you evaluate Miss Johns yourself?

          15        A.   I did.

          16        Q.   And when you saw Miss Johns, did you

          17    perform a physical examination?

          18        A.   I did.

          19        Q.   Did you also have an opportunity to review

          20    her treatment records and films regarding her care

          21    before she presented to your office?

          22        A.   Yes.

          23        Q.   In a moment I'm going to ask you to walk

          24    the jury through your evaluation of Miss Johns step

          25    by step, but before I do that I'd like to know the

                                                                 26




           1    answer to one very important question.  After

           2    examining Tracy Johns and reviewing all of her

           3    records, studies, images referenced in your report,

           4    do you find anything wrong with her?

           5        A.   Sure.  She had cervical radiculopathy as

           6    well as lumbar facet mediated pain.

           7        Q.   And did you review the results of any tests

           8    or studies in the course of evaluating Miss Johns?

           9        A.   Yeah, there was some records from Ohio

          10    Valley Hospital, looked at the MRI imaging from

          11    9/20/17, and then EMG from 12/5/17, and then various

          12    rehab and chiropractic records as well.

          13        Q.   While discussing the MRI, would it be

          14    helpful to show a visual to the jury?

          15        A.   Sure.

          22    We're now back on the video record.

          23    BY MS. HENKLE:

          24        Q.   Doctor, is this the MRI of Tracy Johns you

          25    reviewed prior to your treatment of her?

                                                                 27




           1        A.   Tracy Johns, yes, correct.

           2        Q.   And can you tell the jury which part of

           3    Tracy Johns this MRI is depicting?

           4        A.   Sure.  So the easiest would be to describe

           5    it based on the model itself.  So when we look at

           6    anybody's spine, for that matter, there are three

           7    segments of the spine that we consider.  The lowest

           8    is the lumbar portion; there are five lumbar

           9    vertebrae.  The middle or thoracic region, there are

          10    12 thoracic vertebrae.  And then there are seven

          11    what we call cervical vertebrae.  Of those seven,

          12    what you're seeing in this model here are C1, C2,

          13    C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7.  What we're seeing on the

          14    MRI, if we look over to the right here, is exactly

          15    this view that you're looking at this way, and what

          16    you're seeing are the cervical vertebrae 1 through

          17    7.  If we turn the spine on its side you'll be able

          18    to see from the side, which also shows you the discs

          19    in between as well as the opening in the spinal

          20    canal itself.  And so the view that we're looking at

          21    on the left side, this darkened area right here, is

          22    the spinal cord itself.  The white around the spinal

          23    cord shows up as fluid around the spinal cord.  What

          24    we're seeing -- and I'll take a little bit better

          25    slice there -- is this is C1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as we

                                                                 28




           1    work our way down.  When we get to 1, 2, 3, 4,

           2    between 4 and 5, we start to see a little

           3    indentation here, which is the protrusion.  We

           4    discussed earlier about what a protrusion was.  And

           5    you can actually see that it's pushing back and

           6    placing an indentation against the spinal cord by

           7    pushing on the fluid.  When you get to 5 and 6, you

           8    see an additional one, slightly worse than the one

           9    above it.  So in these views here we're able to

          10    clearly identify discs that are putting pressure

          11    against the canal.

          12             The problem is, is not all discs end up

          13    protruding perfectly in one direction or another and

          14    they can be disrupted, particularly when involved in

          15    trauma or an accident.  So as we look at some of the

          16    other views -- as we look at some of the other

          17    views, you can see the various slices that show

          18    different areas and different degrees of indentation

          19    along the cord itself.

          20             So in her case, in addition to all of this,

          21    she has disruption of the facet joints at the levels

          22    above.  So the combination of the disruption of the

          23    facet joints as well as indenting against the canal

          24    produces the symptoms that she's describing, which

          25    are the radicular symptoms as well as the pain.

                                                                 29




           1        Q.   And you're able to determine all of this

           2    from viewing this MRI?

           3        A.   Well, from viewing the MRI and correlating

           4    it to the complaints that she has; the two go hand

           5    in hand.

           6        Q.   Are you able to fake an MRI?

           7        A.   No.  Certainly not.

           8               MS. HENKLE:  All right.  We can cut and

           9    go off.

          17    BY MS. HENKLE:

          18        Q.   Doctor, did you also review an EMG in this

          19    case?

          20        A.   Yes, I did.

          21        Q.   And what is an EMG?

          22        A.   So EMG falls into two categories.  So

          23    there's the EMG component of it, or

          24    electromyelography, and then there's the nerve

          25    conduction velocity testing as well.  So by placing

                                                                 30




           1    small electrodes along the pathway of various nerves

           2    you can determine if the nerves themselves are

           3    functioning appropriately, if there's a blockage

           4    that prevents nerve signals from traveling across

           5    those nerves, or if there's weakness associated with

           6    various muscles groups that those needles are

           7    testing.

           8        Q.   And did you review the EMG in this case?

           9        A.   I did.

          10        Q.   And what did Miss Johns' EMG show?

          11        A.   It did show cervical radiculopathy, and I

          12    have her impression listed here showing abnormal

          13    electrodiagnostic evidence at bilateral C5-C6,

          14    meaning as I showed you on that MRI, that level of

          15    C5-C6 was compressing, with evidence of denervation

          16    with subsequent reinnervation.  So what that

          17    basically means is, is that whenever there's damage

          18    to a particular nerve, that nerve has the ability to

          19    regenerate, doesn't always regenerate to its

          20    original state, but you can make that out based on

          21    the way nerve fibers conduct electricity.

          22             She also shows bilateral deltoid innervated

          23    by the axillary nerve at C5-C6 along that same

          24    distribution, and then the corresponding paraspinal

          25    muscles at 5-6 as well.  She shows some mild

                                                                 31




           1    bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome affecting the

           2    sensory of the first digit.  And it seems that she

           3    wrote a prescription for pain management consult to

           4    evaluate and treat with a diagnosis of cervical

           5    radiculopathy.

           6        Q.   You mentioned a diagnosis of cervical

           7    radiculopathy.  Can you explain what radiculopathy

           8    is?

           9        A.   So anytime a nerve fiber has compression

          10    applied to it, two things happen.  The first level

          11    of compression results in what we call sensory

          12    deficit, meaning the outer layer of the nerve is

          13    responsible for the sensations that can be felt.

          14    Radiculopathy is that sensation of pain associated

          15    with that compression of the nerve itself.  Further

          16    compression will lead to what we call motor deficit,

          17    meaning that there will be loss of function so

          18    somebody can't pick up a glass or grip something.

          19    That's excessive compression of the nerve root.  But

          20    radiculopathy is particularly along the sensation

          21    that you have what we call burning or other

          22    neuropathic symptoms such as tingling or the medical

          23    term being paresthesias.

          24        Q.   Is radiculopathy a painful condition?

          25        A.   Certainly is, yes.

                                                                 32




           1        Q.   And how does it typically affect people?

           2        A.   Several ways.  One, it creates a pain that

           3    -- so, for instance, you sprain your ankle, you can

           4    bandage your ankle, you can raise your ankle, you

           5    can take some Advil, you could put some ice on it;

           6    there are things that you can do to help create a

           7    sensory change that might help distract from the

           8    pain.  Unfortunately, with radiculopathy being

           9    neuropathic in nature, there's very little that can

          10    be done for that type of pain in the way of the TLC

          11    type of things that we see with other types of

          12    sprains and injuries.

          13        Q.   And did you also conduct a physical

          14    examination along with reviewing her diagnostic

          15    studies?

          16        A.   Sure.

          17        Q.   And what did your examination reveal?

          18        A.   So, functionally, examined the lower and

          19    upper extremity, but it seems like the cervical

          20    spine is where a lot of her range of motion resulted

          21    in -- in symptoms of facet mediated pain as well as

          22    radiating pain that resulted from the radiculopathy.

          23             As I go through I can give you the specific

          24    findings.  Inspection, exquisitely tender, radicular

          25    symptoms of the upper extremity.  No swelling or

                                                                 33




           1    spasticity, which is good.  Did the foraminal

           2    compression or Spurling's test, which is basically

           3    turning the head and applying pressure.  Patients

           4    themselves don't know what we're looking for, so we

           5    just simply apply pressure and then mark the

           6    complaints, which usually mimic the radicular

           7    symptoms, especially when you turn your head and

           8    apply pressure.  And then the extension and rotation

           9    pain as a result of the facet-related injury.

          10        Q.   And I notice in your records you mentioned

          11    that there was a facet loading that came back

          12    positive.

          13        A.   Yeah.

          14        Q.   Can you explain what means?

          15        A.   So basically, the easiest way to describe

          16    it is each bone of the cervical spine rests on the

          17    bone below it.  There's supposed to be a nice smooth

          18    padding between the two.  And as long as there's

          19    symmetry, much like Lego blocks, you place one on

          20    top of the other, if they're symmetric, it's no

          21    problem, but if you displace them from trauma or

          22    tumor or anything that displaces them, what you end

          23    up with is difficulty with rotation and extension.

          24    So by applying loading force, meaning pressure, and

          25    asking the patient to extend their neck, flex their

                                                                 34




           1    neck, turn their neck left and right, you can elicit

           2    their response and correlate it with the findings on

           3    the MRI.

           4        Q.   And did your exam match her objective

           5    testing?

           6        A.   Sure.

           7        Q.   And when you first examined Miss Johns on

           8    October 18, 2017, did you take a history from her?

           9        A.   I did.

          10        Q.   And what did she mention was the onset of

          11    the pain?

          12        A.   Motor vehicle accident 7/13/2017.

          13        Q.   And when you saw her, was she still having

          14    pain from that accident?

          15        A.   Yes.

          16        Q.   And your visit with her was about three

          17    months after the accident?

          18        A.   That's correct.

          19        Q.   What did she tell you about her pain?

          20        A.   So she presented with symptoms, neck

          21    stiffness, muscle spasm, crepitus, meaning sort of

          22    this creaking sensation with range of motion.  She

          23    also complained of some shoulder pain across the

          24    right, but that's often mistaken as shoulder pain

          25    when it's actually referred pain from facet mediated

                                                                 35




           1    discomfort.  It says it's along the back of her

           2    neck, the right sides of her neck, radiates to the

           3    trapezius, right shoulder and right upper arm.

           4    Complains that it's aching and burning and the onset

           5    immediately after MVA 7/13/2017.

           6        Q.   And did her history and complaints match

           7    your physical examination?

           8        A.   Sure.

           9        Q.   And did it match her objective testing and

          10    imaging?

          11        A.   Yes.

          12        Q.   And what did you decide to do

          13    treatment-wise at that point?

          14        A.   I wanted to address the -- especially

          15    because of the radiation that she was complaining

          16    into the shoulder, I wanted to address the facet

          17    mediated pain first, and then certainly consider the

          18    radicular pain to be managed afterwards.  And so I

          19    ended up performing a C4-5, 5-6 and 6-7 facet

          20    injection for her.  And I believe I managed the left

          21    side, which was the worst.

          22        Q.   And can you explain for the jury what a

          23    facet block injection is?

          24        A.   Yeah, sure.  So very straight forward, as

          25    we described before, and I can show you on the model

                                                                 36




           1    here, it's a lot easier.  Each of the bones of the

           2    cervical spine touch the bones below at a point here

           3    called the facet joint.  So a facet injection is an

           4    injection in which I take a spinal needle and I

           5    place it alongside the actual facet itself and bathe

           6    that facet with some local anesthetic and some

           7    steroids.  It's primarily a diagnostic test because,

           8    as I described before, once a facet joint has been

           9    disrupted, creates a condition called accelerated

          10    arthrosis.  So basically what would take decades to

          11    degenerate over time, when an injury takes place on

          12    a facet joint, that process is accelerated.  And the

          13    purpose of using the steroids is to help slow it

          14    down by reducing inflammation and swelling around

          15    the joint.

          16        Q.   And you mentioned with facet joint injuries

          17    the arthrosis accelerates?

          18        A.   That's correct.

          19        Q.   Does this injury ever go away?

          20        A.   No.  So the injury takes place, the

          21    arthrosis is accelerated.  The best we can do is

          22    over time try our best to, lack of better terms,

          23    callous the surrounding nerves to where the patient

          24    doesn't feel the problem.  The problem itself never

          25    goes away.

                                                                 37




           1        Q.   And in addition to your own records, did

           2    you review other treatment records while forming

           3    your opinions and diagnosis?

           4        A.   Yes.  There were a number of records,

           5    including some very old chiropractic records as well

           6    that I reviewed, but most of them just focused

           7    around Ohio Valley Hospital, some rehab after the

           8    accident, as well as the EMG and MRI reports.

           9        Q.   And did you also have a chance to review

          10    the medical bills associated with Miss Johns'

          11    treatment and care for the accident that occurred on

          12    July 13, 2017?

          13        A.   Yes, I did.

          14                           * * *

          15      (Navalgund Deposition Exhibit 3 was marked for

          16                      identification.)

          17                           * * *

          18    BY MS. HINKLE:

          19        Q.   I'm going to hand you what I've marked as

          20    Navalgund 3.  Can you tell me if those are the

          21    medical bills that you reviewed for this case?

          22        A.   (Witness reviewing.)  Yes.

          23        Q.   And is it your understanding the total

          24    amount of those medical bills are $2,917.06?

          25        A.   Yeah.  There were some things deducted and

                                                                 38




           1    there's balances remaining, but it's approximately

           2    that amount.  I didn't get the exact figure.

           3        Q.   And you would agree with me that the

           4    Advantage Medical & Rehabilitation bill's

           5    outstanding $750?

           6        A.   Yes, I see that.

           7        Q.   And the Rehab Center has an outstanding

           8    bill of $737.06?

           9        A.   Right.

          10        Q.   And the Ohio Valley Hospital bill is $330?

          11        A.   That's right.

          12        Q.   And the Monroeville Imaging bill is $1,100?

          13        A.   Yes.

          14        Q.   And do those bills reflect the medical

          15    services provided, the usual and customary charges

          16    for the services?

          17        A.   Sure.  Actually, the MRI is pretty

          18    reasonable.  UPMC and Allegheny charge three times

          19    that amount.

          20        Q.   And in reviewing all of the documents in

          21    your treatment with Miss Johns, what were your

          22    conclusions in your November 19, 2018, report?

          23        A.   The conclusions were clearly she had

          24    facet-related injuries that would require some

          25    additional blocks.  The diagnostic blocks

                                                                 39




           1    specifically to address the right side as well; I

           2    believe the left side I had already established that

           3    there was facet mediated pain there.  Confirm the

           4    right side, and then certainly look at

           5    radiofrequency ablation as a long-term treatment

           6    protocol for her.  In addition, cervical epidurals

           7    are always beneficial for maintenance and management

           8    of pain, specifically radicular pain.  So -- and

           9    then the normal and routine follow-up visits that go

          10    along with it.

          11        Q.   And these are recommendations for future

          12    medical treatment for Miss Johns?

          13        A.   Yes.

          14        Q.   We are going to take them one at a time.

          15    You mentioned the rhizotomy?

          16        A.   Right.

          17        Q.   Can you explain what a rhizotomy is?

          18        A.   Sure.  So those facet joints that I just

          19    described earlier, they're supplied by small

          20    branches of the spinal cord called the medial branch

          21    nerves.  Those medial branch nerves are sensory

          22    only, so by burning them we don't cause or force

          23    anyone to have loss of function or movement.  And

          24    what we do is we typically will burn those nerves.

          25    And burning means using microwave energy, very

                                                                 40




           1    similar to the microwave where you can heat food but

           2    not the bowl or dish around it, use microwave energy

           3    to generate heat to almost boiling.  And boiling

           4    being 100 degrees Centigrade, we heat to about 80

           5    degrees Centigrade.  That causes enough disruption

           6    of the flow of those nerves.  As we've seen in the

           7    EMG as well, nerves will have a regenerative process

           8    and very often they will regenerate.  The good thing

           9    is, is they regenerate a little bit slower than

          10    other areas of the body, particularly the nervous

          11    system regenerates slower, so that usually buys us 9

          12    to 12 months of time before we have to repeat the

          13    procedure again.

          14               MR. FOLEY:  And I don't mean to

          15    interrupt, but I'm just trying to follow along.

          16    Which is the procedure in his report that he was

          17    just discussing?

          18               MS. HENKLE:  The rhizotomy.

          19               THE WITNESS:  That would be cervical

          20    ablation.

          21               MR. FOLEY:  Okay.  Thank you, Doctor.

          22               THE WITNESS:  No problem.

          23    BY MS. HENKLE:

          24        Q.   And why do you recommend this particular

          25    procedure for Miss Johns?

                                                                 41




           1        A.   So the specific diagnosis facet injury,

           2    facet injury generates pain across the medial branch

           3    nerves.  And in order to manage those medial branch

           4    nerve-related pain, you have to burn those nerves.

           5        Q.   In your practice do you frequently

           6    recommend this procedure to your patients?

           7        A.   So I'm going to take that as do I do the

           8    procedure a lot in my practice.  Yes.  I don't

           9    frequently recommend it arbitrarily.  For patients

          10    who have facet-mediated pain, the answer is yes.

          11    And we do have a large percentage of patients that I

          12    do this particular procedure for.

          13        Q.   And you do this procedure personally?

          14        A.   Yes.

          15        Q.   And you mentioned they last about 9 to 12

          16    months.

          17        A.   Right.

          18        Q.   Is that about how often Miss Johns would

          19    need a rhizotomy repeated?

          20        A.   Yes.

          21        Q.   And what is the typical cost for this

          22    procedure?

          23        A.   The procedure costs about $400 per level on

          24    average in an office setting and about $600 per

          25    level; in this case there are three levels.  $600

                                                                 42




           1    per level in a hospital or ambulatory surgery center

           2    setting.  So in this case there's three levels, and

           3    there's three levels on each side.  So that cost can

           4    vary depending on which side is hurting at what

           5    time.  So I came up with a sort of median average of

           6    about 1,000 to 1,500 for all the levels.

           7        Q.   And you also mentioned that she would need

           8    the facet blocks on the right side.

           9        A.   That's right.

          10        Q.   And -- go ahead.

          11        A.   So the purpose of that is that would be a

          12    single injection, again, as a diagnostic procedure

          13    to just confirm that we can actually achieve the

          14    results we're looking for with the ablation.

          15    Although, at Johns Hopkins, Stephen Cohen, who is

          16    the director of the fellowship training program and

          17    the director of pain medicine in Johns Hopkins, has

          18    recently looked at the value of the diagnostic

          19    injection.  And many insurance companies now demand

          20    two diagnostic injections, but he's been able to

          21    debunk that.  And we follow basically the same

          22    guidelines he does, and that is, is we do a single

          23    diagnostic injection.  So I did not recommend that

          24    she have two of them performed, just one.

          25        Q.   And is this a procedure that you typically

                                                                 43




           1    recommend for facet injuries?

           2        A.   Yes.

           3        Q.   And how often would Miss Johns need this?

           4    Would she need it repeated?

           5        A.   The injection, no.

           6        Q.   And what is the cost of this procedure for

           7    a one-time?

           8        A.   Depending on whether it's in an ambulatory

           9    surgery hospital setting or whether it's in the

          10    office, they range from 500 to $1,000 for the

          11    injection.

          12        Q.   And you also recommended some epidural

          13    steroid injections.

          14        A.   Yes.

          15        Q.   And what is that?

          16        A.   Epidural steroid injection is basically an

          17    injection into the fat layer around the spinal cord

          18    and the exiting nerve root.  The epidural space, no

          19    different than when a pregnant woman, for instance,

          20    gets an epidural for delivery; those are a little

          21    different in that a catheter is placed and lots of

          22    numbing medicine is used.  In this case it's the

          23    same entry type of entry, but instead of the low

          24    back, it's in the neck.  And the injection bathes

          25    the fat and surrounding tissue and the nerve roots

                                                                 44




           1    with steroids to help reduce inflammation around

           2    nerve roots and to control the radicular pain.

           3        Q.   And in your practice is this a procedure

           4    that you commonly perform?

           5        A.   Sure.

           6        Q.   How often do you perform epidural steroid

           7    injections?

           8        A.   That's a -- it's so numerous that I

           9    couldn't give you an answer, but I would say a

          10    cervical epidural particularly, probably 25 times a

          11    week.

          12        Q.   And how often would Miss Johns need these

          13    injections?

          14        A.   Typically we do them in series of threes.

          15    So a series a couple times a year.  Again, most of

          16    it's going to depend on the response to the initial

          17    injection and then the decisions are made beyond

          18    that.

          19        Q.   And what are the costs associated with

          20    epidural steroids?

          21        A.   Again, they range from 800 to $1,000 per

          22    injection.

          23        Q.   And you also mentioned she would need some

          24    follow-ups with providers; why would she need to

          25    follow up with her providers?

                                                                 45




           1        A.   So there are a lot of things to we have to

           2    look at, especially after injections.  Particularly

           3    after rhizotomies as well.  We want to make sure

           4    that there wasn't anything injection related that's

           5    causing side effects or problems for the patient.

           6    We also do the follow up to see the progress, to

           7    make a decision on whether or not the next procedure

           8    ends up being the facet procedure or the procedure

           9    for radicular pain and that no new symptoms have

          10    arised since then.

          11        Q.   What is the typical cost of a follow-up

          12    appointment with a provider?

          13        A.   Anywhere from 75 to $150.

          14        Q.   So for all the treatment and cost

          15    projections that you just testified to, would you

          16    agree that the economic total for the future medical

          17    care Miss Johns will undergo is approximately

          18    $47,500?

          19        A.   Yeah.  I was going to say somewhere shy of

          20    50,000.

          21        Q.   And are your opinions about future medical

          22    treatment held to a reasonable degree of medical

          23    probability?

          24        A.   Yes.

          25        Q.   And are those cost projections based on

                                                                 46




           1    your experience in the clinical outpatient and

           2    surgical setting?

           3        A.   Of course.

           4        Q.   And does the fact that she hasn't treated

           5    with you since October of 2017 change your opinion

           6    about this future medical treatment that you're

           7    recommending?

           8        A.   No.  I don't chase patients down.

           9    Certainly, if they want to go other places for

          10    treatment, it's their decision.

          11        Q.   And do you have any opinions about the

          12    causation of the injuries that we've discussed here

          13    today?

          14        A.   Yes.  Certainly it was a result of the

          15    motor vehicle accident that took place in July of

          16    2017.

          17        Q.   And how can injuries such as this occur in

          18    a motor vehicle collision?

          19        A.   So a lot has to do with the type of

          20    accident.  If you have a front head-on collision,

          21    for instance, you end up with a lot more thoracic

          22    and cervical combined symptoms.  Sudden deceleration

          23    injuries cause a lot of lumbar-related symptoms and

          24    also can cause blood vessels to tear.  Rear end

          25    collisions we typically see a lot of whiplash type

                                                                 47




           1    injuries; we see a lot of neck-related injuries.  I,

           2    personally, just myself, a year and a half ago

           3    experienced a rear-end type collision and I still

           4    have persistent radicular pain in my right arm as we

           5    speak.  And these are things that happen from

           6    rear-end collisions.  So it's common.

           7        Q.   Does Miss Johns' age, being 51 years old,

           8    affect your opinions in any way?

           9        A.   Yeah, it does.  I mean, when you look at

          10    the degenerative changes, certainly there are some

          11    degenerative disc changes and things that are going

          12    on, but degenerative disc changes do not necessarily

          13    relate to disc bulges or protrusions or things like

          14    that.  So the fact that they've protruded and prior

          15    to that she was asymptomatic does lend me to believe

          16    that specifically the injury that took place on 7/13

          17    was the reason why she's having these symptoms.

          18        Q.   And, Doctor, do you have an opinion as to

          19    the reasonableness and necessity of all the

          20    treatment that Miss Johns has had to date?

          21        A.   I think they have all been reasonable and

          22    necessary.

          23        Q.   One last question, Doctor.  Have you given

          24    all of your opinions today to a reasonable degree of

          25    medical certainty?

                                                                 48




           1        A.   Sure.

           2               MS. HENKLE:  All right.  Your witness,

           3    counsel.

           4               MR. FOLEY:  Okay.

           5               THE WITNESS:  Can we pause for a second?

           6               MR. FOLEY:  Sure.

           7               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 8:54 a.m.

          15                        EXAMINATION

          16    BY MR. FOLEY:

          17        Q.   Good morning again, Doctor.  Roger Foley

          18    again for the Port Authority.

          19             I want you to take a look at your report

          20    that you prepared.  Now, this report that you

          21    prepared for the law firm of Simon & Simon regarding

          22    Miss Johns begins, "I had the opportunity to

          23    evaluate and treat Miss Johns starting on

          24    October 18, 2017."

          25             Do you see that?

                                                                 49




           1        A.   Yes.

           2        Q.   Okay.  When have you ever evaluated or

           3    treated Miss Johns on any day other than

           4    October 18th of 2017?

           5        A.   November 19, 2018.  So maybe a month later.

           6        Q.   Well, this report is 2017.

           7        A.   Oh, I'm sorry.  Maybe a year later.  Sorry.

           8    Yes.  I apologize.

           9               MR. FOLEY:  Could we go off the record?

          10               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 8:57 a.m.

          11    We are going off the video record.

          12               MR. FOLEY:  I never received anything on

          13    this.  Nothing.  So that's going to be a major

          14    problem here, because I'm going to need every single

          15    document that he did regarding her treatment.  So I

          16    don't know what you want to do.  Do you have a

          17    medical record concerning that treatment?

          18               THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

          19               MR. FOLEY:  I mean, we're doing a

          20    deposition of a Doctor and you haven't given me all

          21    the medical records for the Doctor.

          22               MS. HENKLE:  I don't -- we gave you

          23    everything that we have.

          24               MR. FOLEY:  Well --

          25               MS. HENKLE:  Did you ever subpoena their

                                                                 50




           1    records?

           2               MR. FOLEY:  I wish I had it with me,

           3    too, but -- and I can get it.  I specifically asked

           4    -- I don't know if you have it and want to grab your

           5    file, do you have her responses to supplemental

           6    discovery in this case?

           7               MS. HENKLE:  Probably on my computer.

           8               MR. FOLEY:  Because I specifically asked

           9    whether or not she received any treatment after a

          10    specific date.

          11               THE WITNESS:  I don't believe any

          12    treatment was made on that date.  It was just an

          13    evaluation.

          14               MR. FOLEY:  That's considered treatment.

          15               THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I don't know that.

          16               MR. FOLEY:  And the answer was no.

          17               MS. HENKLE:  She didn't -- I mean, she

          18    didn't receive any treatment but --

          19               MR. FOLEY:  Get the answer to

          20    supplemental reports, if you could for me, please.

          21               MS. HENKLE:  All right.

          22               MR. FOLEY:  Off the record.

          23                           * * *

          24               (Whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)

          25                           * * *

                                                                 51




           1               MR. FOLEY:  Go on.

           2               THE WITNESS:  I just realized that what

           3    this was is the update.  This was an erroneous

           4    encounter, see 11/19/2018, it's blocked off as an

           5    erroneous encounter.  So there was some errors in

           6    the original notes.  So I actually did not have this

           7    encounter in person with the patient.  This was just

           8    an adjustment to an existing record.

           9               MR. FOLEY:  Okay.

          10               THE WITNESS:  So you're correct, I did

          11    not have an encounter other than the 2017 encounter.

          12               MR. FOLEY:  Okay.

          13               THE WITNESS:  Even though on the

          14    computer it's listed as an encounter, I didn't see

          15    the note here.  It's an erroneous encounter.

          16               MR. FOLEY:  Okay.  So we got to clear

          17    that up on the video.

          18               MS. HENKLE:  That's fine.

          19               MR. FOLEY:  What I will do, just so

          20    everybody's on the same page and maybe the way I

          21    will do it is I will say we had a discussion off the

          22    record regarding this November 19, 2018, treatment

          23    date, and it's my understanding that that wasn't a

          24    date that actually -- what should I say?

          25               MS. HENKLE:  I would say if you want to

                                                                 52




           1    -- the last thing that he said was that was a year

           2    later.  If you say, like, if you ask if you saw her

           3    in person, he can just clear it up that way and say.

           4    . .

           5               MR. FOLEY:  I think I have a way to do

           6    that.

           7               THE WITNESS:  I apologize.  I didn't see

           8    that.

           9               MR. FOLEY:  We can go back on the video.

          10               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 9:12 a.m.

          11    We are back on the video record.

          12               MR. FOLEY:  Thank you, Doctor, I really

          13    appreciate you taking the time to have us sort out

          14    treatment dates.

          15    BY MR. FOLEY:

          16        Q.   My understanding is -- and then I'm going

          17    to have you explain it --

          18        A.   Sure.

          19        Q.   -- we were talking about a treatment date

          20    on December 18, 2017, which is referenced in your

          21    report, and then you had another medical record from

          22    November 19, 2018.  It's my understanding that that

          23    actually wasn't a date of treatment, correct?

          24        A.   That is correct.

          25        Q.   Can you explain to the jury what happened

                                                                 53




           1    or why you have a record from November 19th of 2018?

           2        A.   So it looks like my medical assistant had

           3    picked up a computer concern on the 10/18/2017

           4    visit, which would have had some problems with the

           5    documentation from the computer itself and went

           6    ahead and took that information and put the

           7    addendum.  So it was listed as an erroneous

           8    encounter on 11/19/2018, meaning that information

           9    was in reference to the original date 10/18/2017.

          10    There was no physical encounter with the patient on

          11    11/19, just a computer encounter.

          12        Q.   Right.  So just to be clear --

          13        A.   Yes.

          14        Q.   -- if you look at your expert report --

          15        A.   Right.

          16        Q.   -- would you agree with me that you really

          17    evaluated Miss Johns only on October 18, 2017, as

          18    opposed to starting on October 18, 2017?

          19        A.   Yes.  Correct.

          20        Q.   Okay.  So that treatment of Miss Johns or

          21    when you saw her on October 18, 2017, I believe you

          22    indicated was three months after the bus accident

          23    itself in July of 2017, right?

          24        A.   That's right.

          25        Q.   Okay.  Thank you very much.

                                                                 54




           1        A.   No problem.

           2        Q.   Now, the report itself that I'm looking at

           3    you prepared on November 19th of 2018, correct?

           4        A.   Yes.

           5        Q.   That's the date on the report?

           6        A.   That's right.

           7        Q.   Okay.  So there was at least an entire year

           8    between the time that you actually saw Miss Johns in

           9    October of 2017 and the time that you prepared your

          10    report in November of 2018, correct?

          11        A.   Yes.

          12        Q.   And then we have another three-quarters of

          13    a year between the time that you prepared this

          14    report in November of 2018 and today's deposition,

          15    correct?

          16        A.   That's right, yes.

          17        Q.   And the symptoms that you reference in your

          18    report, those are symptoms that you observed of Miss

          19    Johns back in October of 2017, right?

          20        A.   Yes, correct.

          21        Q.   So those are symptoms that Miss Johns told

          22    you about almost two years prior to today's

          23    deposition, correct?

          24        A.   Yes, correct.

          25        Q.   And the symptoms of Miss Johns that you

                                                                 55




           1    reference in your report were also symptoms that

           2    Miss Johns described to you prior to you performing

           3    any facet joint injections, correct?

           4        A.   Yes.

           5        Q.   Have you ever communicated with Miss Johns

           6    after she received the facet joint injections from

           7    you in October of 2017 in order to determine the

           8    result of those injections?

           9        A.   Directly with me, no.  There may have been

          10    office encounter from front desk staff, things like

          11    that, that were phone discussions, but nothing where

          12    she had come in and had the discussion with me.

          13        Q.   And by you, I'm speaking of you,

          14    personally.

          15        A.   Yes.

          16        Q.   So have you, person testifying today, ever

          17    communicated with Miss Johns after she completed her

          18    chiropractic treatment in November of 2017 in order

          19    to determine the results of that treatment?

          20        A.   No.

          21        Q.   And have you ever had any communication

          22    whatsoever with Miss Johns between the date that you

          23    evaluated and treated her in October of 2017 and

          24    today?

          25        A.   No.

                                                                 56




           1        Q.   Now, just like you're having your

           2    deposition taken today, Miss Johns had her

           3    deposition taken regarding this lawsuit back on

           4    October 3rd of 2018.

           5        A.   Okay.

           6        Q.   Prior to you preparing your report in this

           7    case in November of 2018, did you ever review Miss

           8    Johns' deposition testimony from October of 2018 in

           9    order to get updated on her condition an entire year

          10    since you last saw her?

          11        A.   No, I did not.

          12        Q.   At any time between when you prepared your

          13    report on November 18th of 2018 and today, have you

          14    ever reviewed Miss Johns' deposition testimony in

          15    order to get updated on her condition?

          16        A.   No.

          17        Q.   Has Miss Johns' law firm, Simon & Simon,

          18    ever provided you with a transcript of her

          19    deposition testimony --

          20        A.   No.

          21        Q.   -- from October of 2018 so that you could

          22    take the time to review it prior to testifying now

          23    prior to trial?

          24        A.   No.

          25        Q.   Would you agree with me that in the report

                                                                 57




           1    you prepared for Simon & Simon regarding Miss Johns

           2    you referenced that you reviewed a medical record

           3    from March 9th of 2015 --

           4        A.   Yes.

           5        Q.   -- which references some complaints that

           6    Miss Johns had at that time, which were prior to the

           7    bus accident, about back and neck pain?

           8        A.   Yes.

           9        Q.   Now, I do understand, as you testified,

          10    that you reviewed some medical records regarding

          11    neck injuries that Miss Johns had prior to the bus

          12    accident.

          13        A.   Sure.

          14        Q.   But did you ever personally speak to Miss

          15    Johns about those prior neck injuries, associated

          16    symptoms, and associated treatment?

          17        A.   No.

          18        Q.   I am now going to show you a copy of that

          19    medical record from March 9, 2015, that you

          20    reference in your report regarding Miss Johns.

          21             Now, if you look at the second page of that

          22    document, under the section problems, one of Miss

          23    Johns' problems at that time is referenced as

          24    "cervical radiculopathy."  Do you see that?

          25        A.   I do, yes.

                                                                 58




           1        Q.   And in your report regarding Miss Johns for

           2    this litigation, you agree that prior to the bus

           3    accident Miss Johns was diagnosed with cervical

           4    radiculopathy, correct?

           5        A.   Yes.

           6        Q.   And you discussed previously what cervical

           7    radiculopathy is.  If you could remind the jury what

           8    Miss Johns was experiencing at that time prior to

           9    the bus accident; what's that all about again?

          10        A.   So that would be pain associated with nerve

          11    compression that results in shooting pain in the

          12    arms.

          13        Q.   Okay.  I am now going to show you a medical

          14    record which is dated February 16th of 2015, which

          15    once again was from prior to the bus accident and is

          16    regarding chiropractic treatment received by Miss

          17    Johns at that time.  Did you ever review this

          18    document prior to preparing your report regarding

          19    Miss Johns in November of 2018?

          20        A.   The Shady Hill records do appear familiar.

          21    Let me see; just to confirm.  Yes.

          22        Q.   So the medical record that I just provided

          23    you references that Miss Johns experienced neck,

          24    right arm, and mid back pain in February of 2015.

          25             Do you see that?

                                                                 59




           1        A.   Yes.

           2        Q.   And that medical record also references

           3    that in February of 2015 Miss Johns experienced

           4    radiation into her right lateral forearm.

           5             Do you see that?

           6        A.   Yes.

           7        Q.   Is the radiating pain for which Miss Johns

           8    sought chiropractic treatment in February of 2015

           9    the same as the cervical radiculopathy that we just

          10    spoke about previously?

          11        A.   It is similar.  And it is cervical

          12    radiculopathy.  And what they're describing is

          13    cervical radiculopathy.

          14        Q.   Now, you indicated in your report that you

          15    prepared that in October of 2017 when you evaluated

          16    Miss Johns after the bus accident, she again had

          17    pain that radiated into her right arm and right

          18    forearm; is that correct?

          19        A.   Yes.

          20        Q.   So Miss Johns experienced cervical

          21    radiculopathy once again after the bus accident,

          22    right?

          23        A.   Yes.

          24        Q.   The medical record I just handed to you

          25    also references that Miss Johns related to her

                                                                 60




           1    chiropractor in February of 2015 that her symptoms

           2    flared up gradually over the last two months without

           3    trauma, specific incident, or known cause.

           4             Do you see that?

           5        A.   Um -- oh.  Yes.  Okay.

           6        Q.   Do you see that?

           7        A.   Yes.

           8        Q.   So can neck pain, including cervical

           9    radiculopathy, ever flare up without any trauma or

          10    specific incident?  Can that happen?

          11        A.   Sure.  Anything's possible.

          12        Q.   And does your office treat any patients who

          13    have neck pain, including pain that radiates down

          14    their arms that was not caused by an auto accident

          15    or any other known traumatic event?

          16        A.   Sure.

          17        Q.   And do you treat those patients with the

          18    same type of treatment that you administered to Miss

          19    Johns in October of 2017?

          20        A.   Yes.

          21        Q.   The February 2015 medical record that I

          22    handed to you also references that an orthopedic

          23    examination of Miss Johns' cervical spine at that

          24    time was indicative of foraminal encroachment?

          25        A.   Yes.

                                                                 61




           1        Q.   Do you see that?

           2        A.   Yes.

           3        Q.   And is that the same foraminal encroachment

           4    that you described to me earlier --

           5        A.   Yes.

           6        Q.   -- where it's pinching up against nerves?

           7        A.   That's right.

           8        Q.   And Miss Johns had that condition, that

           9    foraminal encroachment back in February of 2015?

          10        A.   Sure.

          11        Q.   The orthopedic examination of Miss Johns'

          12    cervical spine in February of 2015 prior to the bus

          13    accident also reveals adhesions of the nerve root,

          14    dural sleeve, or facet joint capsule.

          15             Do you see that?

          16        A.   Sure.

          17        Q.   What does that mean?

          18        A.   I have no idea.  This depressor test seems

          19    to be a chiropractic type test that really doesn't

          20    show anything that makes any sense at all.  I would

          21    imagine that you would need an MRI to visualize

          22    adhesions of a nerve root.  There's no way to

          23    examine a patient for adhesions of a nerve root.

          24        Q.   Now, your written report, I'm going to

          25    refer to that once again, regarding Miss Johns for

                                                                 62




           1    this litigation.  After referring to that March 2015

           2    diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, it indicates:

           3    "However, her pain was significantly improved and

           4    there were no further complaints."

           5             Do you see that?

           6        A.   Yes.

           7        Q.   At what point in time after March of 2015

           8    did Miss Johns have no further complaints about neck

           9    pain?

          10        A.   If I quoted it, it would have been out of a

          11    note, but doesn't appear to have the date.

          12        Q.   Let me ask you this --

          13        A.   Yes.

          14        Q.   -- were you ever made aware that Miss Johns

          15    had to seek additional treatment for neck pain and

          16    cervical radiculopathy after that point in time?

          17        A.   No.

          18        Q.   More specifically in August of 2015; do you

          19    have any knowledge of that?

          20        A.   No.

          21        Q.   Okay.  Prior to preparing your report for

          22    this litigation in November of 2018, did you ever

          23    review any medical records from the UPMC Centers for

          24    Rehab Services regarding physical therapy that Miss

          25    Johns received in August of 2015 for new neck pain?

                                                                 63




           1        A.   Let me just verify the UPMC records that I

           2    have.

           3        Q.   I will submit to you that when I look at

           4    your report under records review --

           5        A.   Yes.

           6        Q.   -- I do not see anything listed for UPMC

           7    Centers for Rehab Services.

           8        A.   Then I would not have, yeah.

           9        Q.   Okay.  Now, did Miss Johns' law firm, Simon

          10    & Simon, ever provide you with any medical records

          11    from physical therapy that Miss Johns received in

          12    August 2015 to treat for that new neck pain for you

          13    to review prior to testifying here at trial?

          14        A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.

          15        Q.   I now want to speak to you about x-rays

          16    taken of Miss Johns' cervical spine prior to the bus

          17    accident.

          18             Now, the report from the x-rays of Miss

          19    Johns' cervical spine in February of 2015 indicates:

          20    "Degenerative disc disease is mild at C5-C6.  There

          21    is bilateral mild to moderate neuroforaminal

          22    narrowing at C5-C6."

          23             Do you see that on the x-ray report?

          24        A.   Yes.  Certainly.

          25        Q.   And did you review this medical record

                                                                 64




           1    prior to preparing your report regarding this

           2    litigation in November of the 2018?

           3        A.   Yes.  This is the Metro Community Health

           4    information.

           5        Q.   And is the neural foraminal narrowing that

           6    is referenced in Miss Johns' February 2015 x-ray the

           7    same as the foraminal narrowing that you described

           8    to me earlier?

           9        A.   No.  Because the foraminal narrowing I

          10    showed you on the MRI was not mild to moderate.  It

          11    was moderate to severe.

          12        Q.   Okay.  And I'm talking about the idea of

          13    neural foraminal narrowing, what that is.

          14        A.   Sure.  Yeah.

          15        Q.   It's the same thing, right?

          16        A.   Yeah.

          17        Q.   And is the degenerative disc disease that

          18    is referenced in Miss Johns' February 2015 x-ray

          19    progressive in nature?

          20        A.   Of course it is.

          21        Q.   So that's to say that a person's

          22    degenerative disc disease can get more severe simply

          23    as a result of the passage of time, correct?

          24        A.   Right.  But it won't protrude like it did

          25    on the MRI as I showed you.

                                                                 65




           1        Q.   So a person's discs in their neck can

           2    degenerate over time without the need for a specific

           3    traumatic event or incident, correct?

           4        A.   Yes, of course.

           5        Q.   And can a person's -- I think you were

           6    talking about this earlier -- can a person's

           7    degenerative disc disease result in a disc being

           8    protruded?

           9        A.   Can a degenerative. . .

          10        Q.   Can a person's degenerative disc disease

          11    ultimately result in a disc protrusion?  And by way

          12    of example, you testified regarding yourself.  I

          13    have also had back surgery and I have disc

          14    protrusions.  I've never any traumatic events or car

          15    accidents or anything.  I have a disc protrusion.

          16        A.   Sure.  But that isn't the result of

          17    degeneration.  Disc degeneration leads to

          18    dehydration, and it's the opposite of protrusion; it

          19    would actually contract.  So a protrusion -- two

          20    things can happen that result in a protrusion.  A

          21    trauma or accident results in a protrusion.  And

          22    then a normal or healthy disc with poor spine

          23    alignment can result in a protrusion.  But

          24    degeneration in and of itself doesn't cause

          25    protrusion.

                                                                 66




           1        Q.   So we just discussed Miss Johns' x-rays

           2    taken of her cervical spine in February of 2015,

           3    which was before the accident, correct?

           4        A.   Yes.

           5        Q.   And then she had an MRI taken of her

           6    cervical spine over two years later in September

           7    of 2017 after the bus accident, correct?

           8        A.   Yes.

           9        Q.   And then she also had a CAT scan, CT scan

          10    of her cervical spine taken the same day as the bus

          11    accident, which was negative for any acute

          12    fractures, correct?

          13        A.   Yes.

          14        Q.   Are you aware of or did you otherwise

          15    review any reports from any other x-rays, MRIs or

          16    other diagnostic tests of Miss Johns' cervical spine

          17    taken during that two and a half-year time period

          18    between February of 2015 and September of 2017?

          19        A.   No.

          20        Q.   Would you agree that there is no way that

          21    you can determine the age of Miss Johns' cervical

          22    condition that is referenced and you talked about in

          23    detail in her September 2017 MRI report?

          24        A.   That's correct.

          25        Q.   Okay.  And likewise would you agree that

                                                                 67




           1    any disc protrusion that may have been noted in Miss

           2    Johns' MRI from September of 2017 may have existed

           3    prior to the bus accident ever taking place?

           4        A.   Of course.

           5        Q.   And would you also agree that a person can

           6    have the cervical condition that is referenced in

           7    Miss Johns' September 2017 MRI and still be pain

           8    free?

           9        A.   Yes.

          10        Q.   So even though Miss Johns may have been

          11    pain free in July of 2017 at the time of the bus

          12    accident, that doesn't mean that Miss Johns was also

          13    free of any degenerative disc disease; does it?

          14        A.   No.  Of course not.

          15        Q.   In fact, the degenerative disc disease that

          16    Miss Johns had, at least as of February 2015, is not

          17    something that just goes away; is it?

          18        A.   No.

          19        Q.   Additionally, even though Miss Johns may

          20    have been pain free in July of 2017 at the time of

          21    the bus accident, that also doesn't necessarily mean

          22    that Miss Johns was also free of any disc

          23    protrusion, right?

          24        A.   Of course.

          25        Q.   So once again, you evaluated Miss Johns on

                                                                 68




           1    October 18th of 2017, which is the same day that you

           2    gave her the facet injections, correct?

           3        A.   That's right.

           4        Q.   Based upon your review of the medical

           5    records provided by Miss Johns' attorneys to your

           6    office, do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns

           7    receiving any additional facet injections since that

           8    day in October of 2017?

           9        A.   No.

          10        Q.   Do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns

          11    receiving any chiropractic treatment or physical

          12    therapy regarding her neck since November of 2017?

          13        A.   No.

          14        Q.   Do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns

          15    receiving any treatment or studies whatsoever

          16    regarding her neck since December of 2017?

          17        A.   No.

          18        Q.   So in December of this year, 2019, to the

          19    best of your knowledge Miss Johns is coming up on

          20    two entire years of no treatment for her neck

          21    injuries, correct?  To the best of your knowledge.

          22        A.   The information I'm given, I have no idea

          23    where or what treatment she's had.

          24        Q.   But according to your report that you

          25    prepared for Miss Johns' attorneys as part of this

                                                                 69




           1    litigation, you believe that Miss Johns now needs to

           2    receive three cervical epidural injections every six

           3    months for no less than ten years, right?

           4        A.   Correct.

           5        Q.   So would you agree that comes to an alleged

           6    need of 60 epidural injections over the next ten

           7    years for Miss Johns?

           8        A.   Potentially, yes.

           9        Q.   And you also believe that in addition to

          10    those epidural injections Miss Johns needs another

          11    facet block as well as the cervical ablation

          12    procedures every 12 months for no less than ten

          13    years?

          14        A.   Right.

          15        Q.   So according to your report, although you

          16    have no knowledge of Miss Johns receiving any

          17    treatment for her neck injury since December

          18    of 2017, over the next ten years you believe that

          19    Miss Johns will need 60 epidural injections, another

          20    facet block, and 12 cervical ablations, correct?

          21        A.   Ten -- that would be ten ablations.

          22        Q.   Ten ablations?  Okay.  Correct?

          23        A.   That is correct.

          24        Q.   Okay.  And you testified earlier this

          25    morning when I was asking you about that type of

                                                                 70




           1    treatment provided by your office, such treatment

           2    can actually or has potential to resolve a patient's

           3    symptoms, correct?

           4        A.   Sure.

           5        Q.   That's the reason why you give that type of

           6    treatment, right?

           7        A.   That's right.

           8        Q.   Now, we've discussed previously the date of

           9    your report, once again, is November 19th of 2018.

          10        A.   Right.

          11        Q.   Did you provide a copy of your report to

          12    Miss Johns' attorneys back in November 2018 so they

          13    could share your opinions with Miss Johns?

          14        A.   I have no idea what they do with the

          15    reports.

          16        Q.   What I'm asking is did your office or you

          17    provide this report, your report dated November 19,

          18    2018, to Miss Johns' attorneys?

          19        A.   Yes, of course.

          20        Q.   Okay.  At that time?

          21        A.   Yes.

          22        Q.   Okay.  Do you have --

          23        A.   I'm sorry.  It was written on 11/19, but

          24    I'm not sure when it was sent.  Shortly thereafter.

          25        Q.   Shortly thereafter it would have been sent.

                                                                 71




           1        A.   Yes.

           2        Q.   Do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns

           3    ever scheduling or receiving any epidural injections

           4    since you provided your report around November

           5    of 2018?

           6        A.   No.

           7        Q.   Do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns

           8    ever scheduling or receiving any facet blocks since

           9    you provided your report in November of 2018?

          10        A.   No.

          11        Q.   Do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns

          12    ever scheduling or receiving any cervical ablations

          13    or rhizotomies since you provided your report in

          14    November of 2018?

          15        A.   No.

          16        Q.   Do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns

          18    primary care physician regarding neck pain since

          19    November of 2018?

          20        A.   No.

          21        Q.   Dr. Navalgund, does your DNA Treatment

          22    Center perform the type of epidural injections that

          23    you believe are needed in the future by Miss Johns?

          24        A.   Yes, we certainly do.

          25        Q.   And does the DNA Treatment Center also

                                                                 72




           1    perform the type of facet blocks that you believe

           2    are needed in the future by Miss Johns?

           3        A.   Yes.

           4        Q.   And does your DNA Treatment Center also

          12        A.   Sure.

          13        Q.   -- which she can go anywhere, but to the

          14    extent she goes there where she has gone previously,

          15    the money paid for that treatment will be money

          16    that's received by the DNA Treatment Center,

          17    correct?

          18        A.   Yes, obviously.

          20    course, of which you are an owner, correct?

          22               MR. FOLEY:  I do not have any further

          23    questions at this time.

          24               MS. HENKLE:  Just a few questions,

          25    Doctor.

           1               THE WITNESS:  Sure.  Yeah.

           3                    FURTHER EXAMINATION

           4    BY MS. HENKLE:

           5        Q.   In your practice do you typically see

           6    cervical facet injuries?

           7        A.   Yeah, of course.

           8        Q.   And when treating the cervical facet

           9    injury, are things like cervical ablations or

          10    rhizotomies and epidural steroid injections things

          11    that those patients get frequently in the future?

          12        A.   Yes.

          13               MR. FOLEY:  I'm going to just object.

          14    You're now outside of the scope of the report in

          15    terms of how frequency treatment is or not.  So I'm

          16    going to object to any questioning regarding

          17    anything that's outside the scope of the report.

          18               MS. HENKLE:  My response is just that it

          19    is in the report about how often patients are --

          20    should be getting these future treatments that he

          21    has recommended.  He says not only for just Miss

          22    Johns, he says patients typically get these about --

          23    for the injections in excess of three and the

          24    ablations every 12 months, I believe it was.

          25               MR. FOLEY:  Yeah.  I don't see that.  If

                                                                 74




           1    you can point it out to me.

           2               MS. HENKLE:  For how often the

           3    treatments are repeated?

           4               MR. FOLEY:  Yeah, how -- generally just

           5    how often treatments are needed.  I see as related

           6    to Miss Johns.  I'm just talking generally.

           7               MS. HENKLE:  Well, he testified that in

           8    his cross -- or direct that the epidural steroid

           9    injections are typically in sets of three and they

          10    can range from being needed every six months to

          11    every year.  That was testimony that he had already

          12    given.

          13               MR. FOLEY:  Okay.  Then that stands for

          14    -- if you we go outside the scope of the report, I'm

          15    going to object to it.  I'm just making you aware of

          16    that.  And I think now you're getting into topics

          17    outside of the scope of the report.  You may

          18    continue to question, but I'm honing in on whether

          19    or not he's reported that.

          20               MS. HENKLE:  Okay.  I'm going to

          21    continue to question.

          22               MR. FOLEY:  Okay.

          23    BY MS. HENKLE:

          24        Q.   When you treat the cervical facet injuries

          25    that you've discussed thoroughly in your report and

                                                                 75




           1    here today, is this something that requires these

           2    future treatments?

           3        A.   Sure.  That's a standard of care for that

           4    particular diagnosis.

           5        Q.   And your testimony earlier was that this is

           6    a permanent injury; is that correct?

           7        A.   That's correct.

           8        Q.   And seeing that it's a permanent injury, is

           9    it likely that Miss Johns will need these in the

          10    future even though she hasn't treated in two years

          11    with you?

          12        A.   Yes, of course.

          13               MS. HENKLE:  Okay.  No further

          14    questions.

          15               MR. FOLEY:  I don't have anything

          16    further.

          17               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right.  The time

          18    is 9:39 a.m.  This concludes this video deposition.

          19               COURT REPORTER:  How do you want your

          20    copy?

          21               MR. FOLEY:  I'll take a regular full

          22    size paper.

          23               COURT REPORTER:  How do you want yours?

          24               MS. HENKLE:  Just electronic is fine.

              3                    DIRECT EXAMINATION

              4   BY MR. BENEVIDES:

              5       Q.  Mr. MacInnis, my name is Adam Benevides.  I

              6   represent Chappell Engineering in a matter called

              7   Dexter Avenue Realty Trust versus Chappell

              8   Engineering, et al.

              9               Have you ever had your deposition taken

             10   before?

             11       A.  I have not.

             12       Q.  You have not.  So I'm going to go over a

             13   few ground rules to make things easier.

             14       A.  Sure.

             15       Q.  So this is essentially a question-and-

             16   answer-session.  We're going to talk about most of

             17   the documents that you reviewed in your subpoena and

             18   whatnot.  So to make things easier, when I ask

             19   questions and when you respond, we want to try to

             20   not talk over each other, let each other answer.

             21               It's also important that you give verbal

             22   responses rather than shaking your head or saying

             23   "uh-huh," things of that nature.

             24               If at any time you don't understand my














                                                               7

              1   question or you need clarification, please ask me.

              2   If you answer a question, I'm going to assume that

              3   you understood it.  So if there's something that you

              4   need clarified, just make sure that you let us know.

              5   Okay?

              6       A.  Okay.

              7       Q.  Are you represented here at all today?

              8       A.  I'm not.

              9       Q.  Okay.  If at any time you need a break or

             10   you just feel as though you need to use the

             11   bathroom, anything like that, just let me know and

             12   we'll pause the deposition.  Okay?

             13       A.  Okay.

             14               MR. RAMSDELL:  Adam, since he's not

             15   represented, do you want to explain to him he has a

             16   right to review the transcript?

             17       Q.  So at the end of the deposition, the court

             18   reporter is going to produce a transcript.

             19       A.  Okay.

             20       Q.  And then you will have the opportunity to

             21   review that transcript and take a look at your

             22   testimony and ensure that it's accurately recorded,

             23   and if it's not, there's going to be a sheet where

             24   you can write down where there may be errors, and














                                                               8

              1   then we will have the transcript altered

              2   accordingly.

              3       A.  Okay.

              4               MR. BENEVIDES:  On that note, 30 days

              5   for signing, we'll waive notary; does everybody

              6   agree with that?

              7               (All counsel agreed.)

              8               MR. BENEVIDES:  And the usual

              9   stipulations?  Objections other than the form of the

             10   question will be reserved till trial, motions to

             11   strike as well.

             12               (All counsel agreed.)

             13   BY MR. BENEVIDES:

             14       Q.  Mr. MacInnis, I understand that you are

             15   employed by Hennessey & MacInnis?

             16       A.  Correct.

             17       Q.  And that is a title examination firm,

             18   correct?

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  And you performed a title examination on

             21   property on Dexter Avenue?

             22       A.  I did.

             23       Q.  Okay.

             24               MR. BENEVIDES:  Can we mark this as the














                                                               9

              2               (Marked, Exhibit 1, Subpoena issued to

              3   Hennessey & MacInnis and attached documents.)

              4       Q.  I've put in front of you what has been

              5   labeled Exhibit 1.  Do you recognize this as a

              6   subpoena that was served upon you?

              7       A.  (Witness reviews document.) Yes.

              8       Q.  Okay.  If we turn to the, I believe it's

              9   the fourth page of that document, you see there's a

             10   Schedule A, correct?

             11       A.  (Witness reviews document.) Yes.

             12       Q.  And then there are documents requested of

             13   you?

             14       A.  Yeah.

             15       Q.  Could you quickly review, or actually, take

             16   however long it takes you to review the items in

             17   that document request and then let me know when

             18   you've finished.

             19       A.  (Witness reviews document.) Okay, I've

             20   furnished.

             21       Q.  Have you produced everything in your

             22   possession with respect to the documents requested

             23   in this subpoena?

             24       A.  I have.  Let me amend that.  I think I














                                                               10

              1   have.  I did check through my records.  If -- you

              2   know, if Attorney Miller gave you some other stuff,

              3   then he may have, I don't know.  I think I did.  I

              4   gave you what I had in my computer as far as the

              5   search goes.  You know?  I don't want to, you know,

              6   say I gave you everything and I didn't.

              7               MR. BENEVIDES:  So I'm going to mark

              8   this as Exhibit 2, please.

              9               (Marked, Exhibit 2, Email exchange

             10   between Attorney Benevides and the witness with

             11   attached documents witness produced.)

             12       Q.  So turning to Exhibit 2, this is an email

             13   between you and me, correct?

             14       A.  (Witness reviews document.) Yes.

             15       Q.  And attached to this email are the

             16   documents that you produced to me recently, correct?

             17       A.  Correct.

             18       Q.  And these are all the documents that you

             19   had in your possession?

             20       A.  Yes, my possession, yes, in my computer.

             21       Q.  Now, you just mentioned that you might have

             22   other documents that you received from Attorney

             23   Miller?

             24       A.  I don't think so.  I may have done -- I














                                                               11

              1   don't know if I sent him some notes on some stuff

              2   when it kind of all blew up; he had me do some other

              3   stuff, but I didn't really send him anything.  I

              4   just told him that it was -- it got kind of

              5   confusing -- not confusing, but -- when it all kind

              6   of went down, he wanted me to do some more look --

              7   kind of poke around see if I could find some other

              8   stuff, and I really didn't.  I just did some

              9   sketches on a piece of paper that I never sent to

             10   him.  I just said, "I'm not coming up with anything,

             11   Bruce," you know, type thing.

             12       Q.  Did you produce those sketches, and did you

             13   look for those?

             14       A.  Yeah, I did.  I didn't have them.  I

             15   checked my emails, things like that.  It wasn't --

             16   he essentially wanted me to figure out --

             17       Q.  Can I stop you there?  I'm sorry.

             18       A.  Am I talking too much?

             19       Q.  No, not at all.  I just wanted to clarify

             20   who Attorney Miller was?

             21       A.  Okay.  Bruce Miller, Pierce Atwood.  He's

             22   the one that contacted me about the search.

             23       Q.  Okay.  And who is he in relation to this

             24   matter?














                                                               12

              1       A.  He is the real estate -- he represented I

              2   think Natale in the real estate -- I believe real

              3   estate transactions.  I believe he's a client of

              4   his, I would say.  I mean, I wouldn't -- actually,

              5   that's not really my end of it.  He just told me,

              6   you know.

              7       Q.  Do you have a longstanding relationship

              8   with Mr. Miller?

              9       A.  I do.

             10       Q.  Does he frequently refer you business?

             11       A.  Oh, absolutely, yeah.

             12       Q.  Okay.  And you were saying that Mr. Miller

             13   had asked you to do some additional research?

             14       A.  Yes.  It ended up being like two properties

             15   involved, and he wanted to see where I think -- this

             16   is a few years ago -- where they actually built it

             17   on the wrong lot, from what I understand.  He wanted

             18   to see -- he wanted -- could I see who owned that

             19   and the title there.

             20               So I did some poking around.  It was

             21   virtually impossible to figure out.  It was like the

             22   land time forgot.  It was really different.  And

             23   they hired a bigger firm that does -- specializes in

             24   that, so...  I don't have anything.  I just told














                                                               13

              1   him -- I said, "I looked around.  It was back in the

              2   1700s."  And it was just a big disaster, so I said,

              3   "I can't do it, that's not really my specialty."

              4   They hired a big firm that did it.  I know the

              5   people that did it, so...

              6       Q.  Was this in relation to Dexter Avenue?

              7       A.  Yes.

              8       Q.  Okay.  Did you have an understanding of the

              9   addresses of the properties that he was speaking of?

             10       A.  I did not.

             11       Q.  Just as a -- going back a little bit here,

             12   what is your method of keeping your records?

             13       A.  We write a report, we email it to the

             14   attorney, and it's stored in there.  We've done that

             15   since 2008.  So when I went back to look -- we do it

             16   by town, city and address, so I would go to Woburn,

             17   Dexter, and that's what I had, that's what I sent to

             18   you.

             19       Q.  And how do you keep these records?  Are

             20   they in a paper file or are they --

             21       A.  No, they're on the computer.

             22       Q.  And do you scan everything in?

             23       A.  Yeah.

             24       Q.  Okay.  So all of your notes and --














                                                               14

              1       A.  No.

              2       Q.  -- anything else would be scanned in?

              3       A.  No, no.

              4       Q.  No?

              5       A.  No, I wouldn't bother, because I just told

              6   him -- I did it -- I told him verbally.

              7       Q.  I'm speaking in general now.

              8       A.  Oh, in general.

              9       Q.  Yes, in general.

             10       A.  No, I would only scan in finished product

             11   that would be sent to an attorney.  I wouldn't scan

             12   notes.  There wouldn't be a reason for me to do

             13   that.

             14       Q.  So what would you do with any notes or

             15   things of that nature?  Does it go in a paper file?

             16       A.  No, it goes in the trash.

             17       Q.  Okay.

             18       A.  If I deemed them nonimportant and not

             19   relevant to anything or anything I would need in the

             20   future, I just -- you know, there's no use saving

             21   scraps of paper, things like that, or scan it if I

             22   didn't think I needed it.

             23       Q.  How many years has Hennessey & MacInnis

             24   been in business?














                                                               15

              1       A.  Probably 35, 40 years.

              2       Q.  And who runs the company?

              3       A.  Myself and my brother do.

              4       Q.  And who is your brother?

              5       A.  Greg, Gregory.

              6       Q.  So he's also MacInnis?

              7       A.  He is.

              8       Q.  And where does the name Hennessey derive

              9   from?

             10       A.  Hennessey is my grandfather's name.  He

             11   started the business in the '40s.  And that was my

             12   mother's name.  She's been in the business until

             13   just recently.  That was her married name, so myself

             14   and my brother have this part of the company.  We

             15   have brothers in other parts of the state, too.

             16   It's kind of a family thing.

             17       Q.  Uh-huh.  And what's your highest level of

             18   education, Mr. MacInnis?

             19       A.  Community college.

             20       Q.  Do you have any specialized training in

             21   examining titles?

             22       A.  I do not.

             23       Q.  Did you learn on the job?

             24       A.  Yeah, yes.














                                                               16

              1       Q.  Sort of family business?

              2       A.  Exactly.

              3       Q.  And how long have you specifically been

              4   examining titles?

              5       A.  Thirty-five years.

              6       Q.  How many years have you been doing business

              7   with Bruce Miller?

              8       A.  At least 25.

              9       Q.  And how did you meet Mr. Miller?

             10       A.  I don't know, to be honest with you.  I

             11   would say my grandfather might have had -- done some

             12   work back in the '70s for him.  He just evolved into

             13   a client.  He was at a different firm for a long

             14   time, and now he's been with this firm for a while,

             15   too.  So I've known Attorney Miller for quite a

             16   while.

             17       Q.  So it was Attorney Miller who requested you

             18   to perform services with regard to this matter?

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  Okay.  And were you paid through

             21   Mr. Miller's firm?

             22       A.  Yes.

             23       Q.  Okay.  Do you have any idea who

             24   Mr. Miller's client was on this?














                                                               17

              1       A.  Yeah, it was Natale.

              2       Q.  Okay.  Do you have any understanding as to

              3   whether there was a title insurer involved?

              4       A.  I don't.

              5       Q.  Okay.  I'm going to look at Exhibit 2 here

              6   in the documents that you provided me.  The first

              7   document that I have here says "Hennessey &

              8   MacInnis" on the top here?

              9       A.  Yes.

             10       Q.  What exactly is this?

             11       A.  This is just a bill.

             12       Q.  It's a bill?

             13       A.  Yes.

             14       Q.  I notice the date says July 7, 2009.  Is

             15   that an accurate date?

             16       A.  Yes.

             17       Q.  So when was it that you performed title

             18   examination services?

             19       A.  Right about then.  I see the examining date

             20   is June 6.  I usually back it off a day or so.  I

             21   don't want to put down the 7th because if something

             22   afterwards were to come in, I would be -- it would

             23   show I was the whole day, so I just go back a day on

             24   it.














                                                               18

              1       Q.  Okay.  Did you have an understanding as to

              2   when -- well, strike that.

              3               What was your understanding as to the

              4   property that you were examining?  And what I mean

              5   by that is, what was the reason for you doing this

              6   title search?

              7       A.  It was a verbal request from him.  He --

              8       Q.  From Bruce?

              9       A.  Bruce Miller.  He called me, he said, "My

             10   client Natale, we've done some stuff in the past."

             11   I said, "Yeah."  "He's looking to develop some

             12   property in Woburn.  It's on Dexter Ave.  It's one

             13   of these Royal Order of the Eagles things.  They

             14   bought it the late '60s, around '70.  Can you do a

             15   title?"  "Yes."

             16               So I went and grantee'd, looking for the

             17   owner, and that's all I found.  The Eagles got it in

             18   1970 and got no other property on that street, so I

             19   said, "Well, this is it."

             20       Q.  Well, was this -- this was at or around the

             21   time of July 2009?

             22       A.  Approximately.  I don't know how busy it

             23   was, if I got to it right away.  I'm not sure.  When

             24   the -- it wouldn't -- unless he told me, you know,














                                                               19

              1   "This needs to go right away, can you do it right

              2   away" -- I'm not sure when he actually called me.

              3   It wouldn't have been -- it would have been within a

              4   month or so.

              5       Q.  Did you have an understanding as to whether

              6   the property was under an agreement or even for sale

              7   at that point?

              8       A.  No.  I mean, he wouldn't have me do a title

              9   if it wasn't something that was going forward on

             10   something.  Maybe I don't understand the question.

             11   He, you know -- obviously, something was going to be

             12   done with the property, so he wanted a title search.

             13       Q.  Did he indicate to you one way or the other

             14   whether the property was being sold to Mr. Natale?

             15       A.  Yes.

             16       Q.  So he had -- you had known that the

             17   property was under agreement, or was this just a

             18   prospective purchase?

             19       A.  From my best recollection he said, "You

             20   know Natale.  We've done stuff for him in the past."

             21   I said, "Yeah."  He said, "He's looking to do some

             22   developing on this piece of property."  That was

             23   kind of the general gist of the conversation, as I

             24   recall.














                                                               20

              1       Q.  Do you know Mr. Natale?

              2       A.  I do not.

              3       Q.  Okay.  Did you have an understanding where

              4   he lived?

              5       A.  I don't -- no, I did not know where he

              6   lived.

              7       Q.  Okay.  Did you have an understanding at all

              8   as to where this property was located in Woburn?

              9       A.  No, I've never been to Woburn, to be honest

             10   with you.

             11       Q.  You had just --

             12       A.  Whereabouts -- where the actual -- to do

             13   the search, where the property was on the street?

             14       Q.  Yes.

             15       A.  No, I wouldn't have -- I would have no way

             16   of knowing.

             17       Q.  Had you done -- well, let me ask you this:

             18   How many times did you do any research or

             19   investigation with respect to property on Dexter

             20   Avenue that was related to Mr. Natale?

             21       A.  On this particular -- I think just this.  I

             22   may have done more that's not in my computer, but

             23   other than, you know, doing some other stuff on

             24   there, once it kind of -- the thing got blown up,














                                                               21

              1   for lack of a better word for it, I -- maybe I sent

              2   him another addendum search.  I know he wanted me to

              3   go back on the tax-taking stuff on this

              4   (indicating).

              5       Q.  Well, we'll get into that.

              6       A.  Okay.

              7       Q.  I'm just trying to get an idea as to

              8   whether this was something that you researched

              9   before there was a transaction and then as a result

             10   of a transaction.

             11       A.  No.  I think -- no, I shouldn't -- I'm not

             12   sure.  It was a while ago.  I mean, I knew -- I

             13   think he bought the property, papers might have been

             14   recorded.  I'm doing "might have beens" here.

             15       Q.  Yeah.

             16       A.  I talked to -- I happened to talk to

             17   another examiner.  He said somebody was buying a

             18   condo and the description was screwed up and it was,

             19   you know.

             20       Q.  Who told you that?

             21       A.  Let's see.  I forget his name.  He works at

             22   Blue Sky Title.  He was representing an attorney who

             23   I don't know.  The attorney was representing a buyer

             24   of one of the condos.  And he said there was some














                                                               22

              1   sort of -- he told me there was some sort of -- that

              2   a land surveyor did something with the condo and

              3   realized it was the wrong lot.

              4       Q.  Exhibit 1, could you please turn to it

              5   again quickly.  You'll notice attached to Exhibit 1

              6   is the real estate agreement, standard purchase and

              7   sale.  Have you ever seen this document before the

              8   subpoena?

              9       A.  (Witness reviews document.) This purchase

             10   and sale?

             11       Q.  Yes.

             12       A.  No.

             13       Q.  And that's dated 2012, correct?

             14       A.  Yes.

             15       Q.  Okay.  So it's your testimony that the

             16   title search that you performed was in 2009 for the

             17   property?

             18       A.  Yes.

             19       Q.  Did you do a title search at all related to

             20   the actual -- related to the closing or was it --

             21       A.  That would have been for the closing

             22   (indicating).

             23       Q.  This was back in 2009?

             24       A.  Yes.  I don't know when the closing took














                                                               23

              1   place or anything.  I wouldn't be privy to that.  I

              2   would -- the way it works, I would do a title.  They

              3   would produce the closing, and more often than not,

              4   unless they e-filed, I would get the package to

              5   record.  But I don't -- they come in when they come

              6   in.  I don't know -- you know, they would have a

              7   long update from then.  Whether I recorded, I'm not

              8   sure, I don't remember that part.  I wouldn't have a

              9   record of me recording the transaction.

             10       Q.  I know we're all attorneys here, but

             11   pretend that we know nothing.  What do you mean by

             12   the "recording"?

             13       A.  Actually sending the papers to the Registry

             14   of Deeds, and they put them on record for, you know,

             15   the public.

             16       Q.  Okay.

             17       A.  So that's essentially one of my functions,

             18   it's what I do, my job.  I do title searches, and

             19   then we record the documents.  If somebody buys a

             20   house, we put the papers on record.

             21       Q.  So the sale transaction documents?

             22       A.  Right, exactly.

             23       Q.  Okay.  So the second document in Exhibit 2

             24   that you produced appears to be a title report?














                                                               24

              1       A.  Yes.

              2       Q.  And it looks like you've got here -- are

              3   these your --

              4       A.  Yeah, that's my handwriting.

              5       Q.  Okay.  And what does the -- is that a DA in

              6   the corner?  What is that?

              7       A.  That's a PA, Pierce Atwood.  It's just the

              8   initials of the firm I did it for.

              9       Q.  All right.  So this title report, is this

             10   the typical form that you use when you're running

             11   down a title?

             12       A.  I do until recently, we switched to, you

             13   know, typed forms, but this is the one we used for

             14   30 years.

             15       Q.  Okay.  And the date on this, is that

             16   accurate at the bottom?

             17       A.  Yes, that would have been when I did it.

             18       Q.  And it says here -- and correct me if I'm

             19   wrong -- "Bruce, is this what you need?  Back title

             20   big tax-taking mess, please advise"?

             21       A.  Yes.

             22       Q.  What exactly were you trying to convey to

             23   Mr. Miller?

             24       A.  Did you want me to go behind the tax-taking














                                                               25

              1   stuff, go prior to that.

              2       Q.  And what was his answer to that?

              3       A.  I think he said no at the time.  It's --

              4   that stuff gets -- can be very -- I didn't know how

              5   much he wanted me to do, so I didn't want to spend

              6   his money and waste time if he was okay with going

              7   from 1970.  Typically, a search is 50 years with a

              8   good start date; tax takings, you know, this one had

              9   all little pieces to it, so it would have been

             10   pretty involved.  So, you know, it was basically,

             11   "Do you want me to go behind it?"

             12               MR. BENEVIDES:  Could you mark this as

             13   Exhibit 3, please.

             14               (Marked, Exhibit 3, Title report dated

             15   12/13/13 with "67" handwritten at the top.)

             16               MR. BENEVIDES:  I'm going to mark this

             17   as Exhibit 4.

             18               (Marked, Exhibit 4, Title report dated

             19   12/13/13.)

             20               MR. BENEVIDES:  While we're at it, let's

             21   mark this 5.

             22               (Marked, Exhibit 5, Title report dated

             23   10/9/15.)

             24       Q.  Okay.  I'm showing you Exhibit 3 and 4














                                                               26

              1   first because it looks like they're identical except

              2   for a marking at the top of Exhibit 3, with the

              3   marking of a 6 and a 7 at the top, "67"?

              4       A.  (Witness reviews document.) Yes.

              5       Q.  Is that your handwriting?

              6       A.  No.

              7       Q.  Do you know what that means, this "67"?

              8       A.  I do not.

              9       Q.  Do you know whose handwriting that is?

             10       A.  I have no idea.

             11       Q.  Okay.  So Exhibits 3 and 4 appear to be the

             12   same document as Exhibit -- that was contained in

             13   Exhibit 2 --

             14       A.  Yes.

             15       Q.  -- correct?

             16       A.  Yes.

             17       Q.  Except there seems to be more writing on

             18   it?

             19       A.  Right.

             20       Q.  Is all the handwriting on Exhibits 3 and 4

             21   with the exception of "67" on 3, is that your

             22   handwriting?

             23       A.  No.

             24       Q.  Okay.  Do you know whose handwriting --














                                                               27

              1       A.  That's Pauline O'Connor's.  That's my

              2   mother.

              3       Q.  So which of this is your handwriting and

              4   which is not?

              5       A.  Where it's "1" and "2," that's her

              6   handwriting, and where the date was changed, that's

              7   her handwriting.

              8       Q.  Okay.  And you'll notice it looks like

              9   there's a 1 and 2 underneath "big title" or "back

             10   title"?

             11       A.  Yeah, right.

             12       Q.  Is that also your mother's?

             13       A.  Yes.

             14       Q.  Do you know what this writing is supposed

             15   to signify?

             16       A.  "Tax taking," "Mass. Tax liens."  She would

             17   have added that on to this title.  She would have

             18   faxed and thrown it out, discarded it, so we -- I

             19   would not have -- I wouldn't have got an actual

             20   title to scan.

             21               She was more or less in the office and

             22   doing a lot of stuff online.  So run down -- running

             23   titles forward for a short period of time or like

             24   rundowns if you're refi-ing.  She would do those in














                                                               28

              1   the office, on the computer, she's faxed them over

              2   and discard them, so I wouldn't have this scanned

              3   into my system.

              4       Q.  And you'll notice the date here appears to

              5   be December 13, 2013.

              6       A.  Yes.

              7       Q.  That's four years after it looks like your

              8   initial --

              9       A.  Right.

             10       Q.  -- examination.

             11               Do you know why there was a -- the date

             12   is almost, you know, than four years later?

             13       A.  I have no idea.  He would have asked us,

             14   Bruce Miller, to run it forward, run it up,

             15   essentially.

             16       Q.  Do you have any knowledge as to what was

             17   asked by Mr. Miller of your firm?

             18       A.  No.  I can surmise he was asking, "Can you

             19   run that Dexter Avenue in Woburn, can you run that

             20   forward?"

             21       Q.  Did you speak to Mr. Miller at all about

             22   this request?

             23       A.  I'm not sure.  I don't know if he -- he

             24   probably called me.  I mean, I don't want to --














                                                               29

              1   well, I'm kind of guessing here.

              2       Q.  I don't want you to guess, but --

              3       A.  Yeah, you know, I don't recall.  Let's put

              4   it this way.  I can -- by evidence of this, you

              5   know, somebody got in contact with us and said, "Can

              6   you run it up?"

              7       Q.  Do you keep records in your office as to

              8   phone calls or requests for --

              9       A.  We do not.  We're a very small firm, kind

             10   of a mom-and-pop shop.

             11       Q.  Okay.  Do you recall any conversations with

             12   anyone in your office about Mr. Miller's request at

             13   this time?

             14       A.  No.

             15       Q.  No?  So if you had to surmise what this was

             16   about based on the writing here, what was your

             17   inclination?

             18               MS. SCALISI:  Objection.

             19       Q.  You can answer.

             20               THE WITNESS:  Did you say "objection"?

             21               MS. SCALISI:  Yes.  You can answer.

             22       A.  Oh, I would say he called somebody in my

             23   firm, maybe me, and said, "Dave, can you run up

             24   Dexter Road in Woburn."














                                                               30

              1       Q.  Okay.

              2       A.  And I would have probably let my mother

              3   know because she was -- because, you know, we're

              4   busy usually doing full titles, and she was handling

              5   that stuff online.  I said, "Here's the sheet.  Can

              6   you run this up and fax it over to him?"  She

              7   said -- I'm sure she said, "Okay," and that's what

              8   she did.

              9       Q.  Now, Exhibit 5 --

             10       A.  Yes.

             11       Q.  -- could you please take a look at this.

             12   Is this your handwriting on this document?

             13       A.  No.

             14       Q.  Do you know whose handwriting it is?

             15       A.  It's Pauline O'Connor's.

             16       Q.  Okay.  And who is Pauline O'Connor?

             17       A.  Pauline is my mother.

             18       Q.  Okay.

             19               MS. CLOUTIER:  I'm sorry.  Is it

             20   O'Connor or O'Connell?

             21               THE WITNESS:  O'Connor.

             22       Q.  If you look down the -- about almost

             23   halfway down the page, is that not your signature

             24   there?














                                                               31

              1       A.  That is her signing my name for insurance

              2   purposes -- actually, I shouldn't say that.  She --

              3   I don't know why she signs my name.  Because it's

              4   Middlesex.  She actually was on -- she's on the

              5   insurance, too.

              6       Q.  Okay.

              7       A.  She just -- that's force of habit.  She

              8   signs -- she puts my brother Greg's name because

              9   he's over at Suffolk.

             10       Q.  Okay.  Having read this title report, could

             11   you tell us what this entailed?

             12       A.  Also another rundown.  That's why she would

             13   have done it.  I'm sure -- there was probably a

             14   pol -- I see policy as directed, so there was a

             15   title insurance policy that she picked it up from,

             16   and she ran the title forward and would have again

             17   faxed it over.

             18       Q.  So you're looking at the bottom there where

             19   it says, "2014 -- policy as directed"?

             20       A.  Yeah.

             21       Q.  Okay.  And what do you mean, that she would

             22   have -- can you explain that?  What do you mean by

             23   that?

             24       A.  Sure.  There would have been a policy from














                                                               32

              1   a title insurance company like, you know, First

              2   American or Republic, one of those type places.

              3   They would have insurance on a certain -- up to a

              4   date.  Bruce Miller, it appears, would have had

              5   access to that, and he would have said, "Hey, can

              6   you run it for this policy forward?  Everything --

              7   we have everything behind it, go forward from

              8   there."  And we said, "Okay."

              9       Q.  Okay.  Now, why would you typically have a

             10   title insurance policy involved that would require a

             11   request for an examination?

             12       A.  It's just easier for us.  It's --

             13   somebody -- they don't want to reinvent the wheel if

             14   they already have a policy, back policy on

             15   something.  What's the point of going and doing the

             16   same thing, so we would just go forward.

             17       Q.  Do you have any personal knowledge about

             18   this particular search?

             19       A.  I do not.

             20       Q.  You do not.  Do you know who performed it?

             21       A.  Pauline O'Connor.

             22       Q.  Okay.  And did you ever have any

             23   involvement in any type of research or investigation

             24   with respect to any title insurance issues in regard














                                                               33

              1   to this property?

              2       A.  I'm not sure what you mean by -- I would

              3   have gone back...

              4       Q.  Well, was there anything that was directed

              5   in relation to the policy from either Bruce Miller

              6   or others --

              7       A.  I don't believe so.

              8       Q.  -- that you did?  No?

              9       A.  No, I don't...

             10       Q.  Did you ever view the title insurance

             11   policy?

             12       A.  I did not.

             13       Q.  And there's a second page to this document.

             14       A.  Yes.  That's probably -- that's, quote, the

             15   run sheet.

             16       Q.  Okay.  And again, is this your handwriting?

             17       A.  No.

             18       Q.  So this would have been Pauline O'Connor's,

             19   correct?

             20       A.  Correct.

             21       Q.  Is there any reason why she is signing your

             22   name as opposed to her own?

             23       A.  She just always did.  She worked in the

             24   office.  If it was Middlesex, she'd sign my name.














                                                               34

              1   If it was Suffolk, she'd sign Greg's name.  I don't

              2   know.  It's just what she did.  Because I run

              3   Middlesex, Greg runs Suffolk.

              4       Q.  Okay.  I'm going to direct your attention

              5   again to Exhibit 2, the portion of the title report

              6   that I believe you prepared.

              7       A.  Okay.

              8       Q.  There's a second sheet to that as well.

              9       A.  Yes (indicating).

             10       Q.  Is that your handwriting?

             11       A.  It is.

             12       Q.  Okay.  And what exactly are these notes

             13   that are here?

             14       A.  So this is when I ran the title, went into

             15   the grantor indexes.  "Deed in," that's the book.

             16   "Taking" would have been either street taking, tax

             17   taking.  I determined that it was non locus.  That's

             18   what "NL" means.  So it -- the way the books are set

             19   up, it's '70 to '73.  Then you run the computer 1974

             20   to whatever date you're going through.

             21               There was a tax taking that I got a

             22   photo of.  Then there was a Mass. tax lien that was

             23   released; so that's what my terrible handwriting --

             24   I don't know if you can read it.  So that's pretty














                                                               35

              1   much it.  There wasn't much to this title, let's put

              2   it this way.  That was the whole thing.  This --

              3   they didn't do much over the years, the Eagles.

              4       Q.  What I think I'd like you to do now is I'd

              5   like you to tell me exactly what you did in order to

              6   perform your title search.  Start from the very

              7   beginning.  And before we do that, I'd like to know

              8   exactly what information you were given about the

              9   property.

             10       A.  Okay.  So I got a call from Bruce Miller.

             11   He said, "Dave, can you do a title for me?  My guy,

             12   Natale, you've done some stuff for him before.  He's

             13   a developer.  He's looking to put some condos on a

             14   piece of property."

             15               I said, "Okay.  Where is it?"  He goes,

             16   "Dexter, Dexter Street or Ave. in Woburn."  I said,

             17   "All right.  Who owns it?"  He said, "One of these

             18   Elk-type places.  It's the Fraternal Order of the

             19   Eagles.  They got it around the late '60s, 1970."

             20       Q.  So Bruce Miller informed you that it was

             21   owned by the Fraternal Order of Eagles?

             22       A.  Yes.

             23       Q.  Okay.

             24       A.  So I went through the grantee indexes,














                                                               36

              1   which is the owners index, essentially, in the

              2   Registry, got in the '60s through early '70s, and

              3   this was the only entry for them on Dexter Avenue,

              4   this Eagles.  So that was it as far as I was

              5   concerned.  He said it was around 1970.  I forwarded

              6   the deed -- ran it forward, shipped it out to him

              7   and that was it.

              8               MS. CLOUTIER:  Can we confirm that this

              9   was in or around of July of 2009 --

             10               THE WITNESS:  Absolutely.

             11               MS. CLOUTIER:  -- that you just

             12   testified to?

             13               THE WITNESS:  It would have been around

             14   then, June, July.  I mean...

             15               MS. CLOUTIER:  But it was 2009?

             16               THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, yes.

             17               MS. CLOUTIER:  Thank you.

             18       Q.  Did Mr. Miller tell you how he got

             19   interested in the property?

             20       A.  No.

             21       Q.  So there was no discussion about what he

             22   was going to do with it?

             23       A.  He said he was going to put some condos on

             24   it.














                                                               37

              1       Q.  Okay.

              2       A.  Which is really -- it doesn't really make

              3   any difference to me what they do with it, to be

              4   honest with you.  It doesn't -- he just happened to

              5   mention it.  I've known Bruce.  We have a casual

              6   kind of, you know.

              7       Q.  At that time -- I just want to clarify.  I

              8   think you might have already testified to this, but

              9   at that time, as far as you were aware, he had not

             10   purchased the property or was not -- at the time you

             11   initially started your title?

             12       A.  No, he did not purchase it, because I would

             13   have -- it would have been reflected on my search.

             14   I would have seen the Eagles selling to him.  So...

             15       Q.  Well, what I'm asking is whether or not he

             16   had already made arrangements to purchase it.

             17       A.  I can only assume he would.  There wouldn't

             18   be any reason to do a title if somebody wasn't

             19   buying something or doing something with the

             20   property.

             21       Q.  Okay.

             22       A.  But that's on their end.  I don't know.

             23       Q.  In Exhibit 1 -- no, 2.  In Exhibit 2, if

             24   you look there's a deed as well that was -- that you














                                                               38

              1   provided.

              2       A.  Yes.

              3       Q.  And the book number is 11805, page 687,

              4   correct?

              5       A.  Correct.

              6               MS. CLOUTIER:  Can you also just

              7   identify that we're looking at Plaintiffs' 790.  Is

              8   that the document that we're looking at?

              9               MR. BENEVIDES:  I'm using the one right

             10   now that he provided to me --

             11               MS. CLOUTIER:  Oh, sorry.

             12               MR. BENEVIDES:  -- which is identical, I

             13   believe, to what you're talking about.  We have

             14   multiple copies of this.

             15               MS. CLOUTIER:  No, it's not identical.

             16   Thank you for clarifying.  I wasn't sure if we were

             17   in Exhibit 1 or 2.

             18               MR. BENEVIDES:  We're in 2, I believe.

             19       Q.  So looking at this deed --

             20               MS. CLOUTIER:  Just to clarify for the

             21   record, we're looking at Exhibit 2, correct?

             22               MR. BENEVIDES:  Exhibit 2.

             23               MR. RAMSDELL:  Thank you.

             24       Q.  So this deed, Book 11805, page 687, is this














                                                               39

              1   the deed that you reviewed in your search in the

              2   grantee index?

              3       A.  Yes.

              4       Q.  So getting back to the process by which you

              5   investigated the title, can you walk me through

              6   exactly what you did?

              7       A.  So I went to the computers, which they have

              8   grantee and grantor in there.  I put in the name of

              9   The Fraternal Order of Eagles in the computer and

             10   this was the only thing that came up, this deed --

             11   well, this is the only deed that came up, this deed

             12   in 1970.  There were no other deeds that were in

             13   there for the computer search.

             14               So I said, well, this must be it.  It's

             15   1970.  He told me it was around then.  You know?

             16   Here we go.  Let's do the search.  And that was kind

             17   of -- that was the process.

             18       Q.  Okay.

             19       A.  So I would write my little sheet down there

             20   and just record everything that was against them, if

             21   there was any mortgages, liens, easements, you know,

             22   all that kind of stuff.

             23       Q.  So what is, in your view, the role of your

             24   title examination?














                                                               40

              1       A.  My view is to establish a search and show

              2   anything, any liens or et cetera against this piece

              3   of property --

              4       Q.  Okay.

              5       A.  -- per the Registry indices.  I mean, you

              6   know.

              7       Q.  Okay.

              8       A.  That's how I do the search.

              9       Q.  And you'll note that this deed references a

             10   19 -- excuse me -- a December 10, 1888 plan.  Did

             11   you review that plan?

             12       A.  Yes, I did, yeah.  59, 2, yeah.

             13               MR. BENEVIDES:  Can you mark that,

             14   please.

             15       A.  Did I not put a copy in there?  I don't

             16   know why.  I usually put plans in there.

             17               (Marked, Exhibit 6, Property plan.)

             18       Q.  So Exhibit 6, is this an accurate depiction

             19   of the plan referenced?

             20       A.  Yes, it is.

             21       Q.  Okay.  I'm going to represent to you that I

             22   received this in plaintiffs' document production.

             23   You'll note at the very bottom corner it says

             24   "Plaintiffs 001491."














                                                               41

              1       A.  (Witness reviews document.) Okay.

              2       Q.  Is this a document that originally came

              3   from your file?

              4       A.  I don't know.  It should have.  I usually

              5   include plans.  Any plans I would have access to, I

              6   do include them.  I don't know.

              7       Q.  Okay.

              8       A.  Let's put it this way.  I would...

              9       Q.  Do you provide paper copies to your clients

             10   that you might not necessarily scan into your

             11   system?

             12       A.  No, I would have -- when was this?

             13   (Witness reviews document.) 2009.  I would have

             14   emailed this to Bruce.  So the plan should have been

             15   in there.  I don't know if it was or not.  I

             16   would -- I'm not sure.

             17       Q.  Okay.

             18       A.  I don't know why I wouldn't have gotten it.

             19   That's part of what I do.

             20       Q.  Do you know, by any chance, how Mr. Miller

             21   knew the Eagles owned the property that Mr. Natale

             22   was interested in?

             23       A.  I do not.

             24       Q.  Okay.  So turning back to Exhibit 6, did














                                                               42

              1   you investigate each and every one of the deeds

              2   referenced below in -- where it says, "For title

              3   references to lots in Block 30"?

              4       A.  I did that at a later date.

              5       Q.  So what did you do on the initial title

              6   exam?

              7       A.  I just did it from 1970.  I said, "Is this

              8   good enough?  Do you want me to go back and deal

              9   with the tax taking?"  It would have been, you know,

             10   quite a bit more work.  I think he said no.  Then at

             11   a later date, when it all kind of, you know, then I

             12   did go back and do some stuff on that.

             13       Q.  Okay.  Do you recall when you went back and

             14   revisited the 1888 plan and the deeds referenced

             15   below?

             16       A.  It would have been after I was told that

             17   the project was on -- was built on the wrong lot.

             18   It would have been after that.  I wouldn't have had

             19   any reason to go do it beforehand.  You know?  So...

             20       Q.  Okay.  So at the time that you initially

             21   investigated this, you identified that there was a

             22   tax taking, and that was what you reported to

             23   Mr. Miller?

             24       A.  It was.  There was -- well, it was coming














                                                               43

              1   out of tax taking -- out of the city pursuant of

              2   them taking it for taxes, so the tax takings

              3   wouldn't have been -- they wouldn't have been

              4   outstanding.  They would have been, you know, taken

              5   care of, which I think they were.  I do see this

              6   treasurer's deed.  I don't know if it was landable

              7   value or they got decrees forever -- forever fore --

              8   preventing foreclosing of the tax takings from the

              9   person that they took it from way back went.

             10   There's decrees, there's different ways you can

             11   clear that up.

             12       Q.  So did you render an opinion to Mr. Miller

             13   about the status of the property?

             14       A.  Which property?

             15       Q.  The property you were investigating on

             16   Dexter Ave.

             17       A.  No -- it would have been -- that's what my

             18   report is, my report sheet.

             19       Q.  So essentially the title report is --

             20       A.  My opinion.

             21       Q.  Okay.  And you essentially left it to

             22   Mr. Miller what to do with it?

             23       A.  Correct.

             24       Q.  Did you -- you didn't investigate any of














                                                               44

              1   the legalities as to whether the property had

              2   cleared -- whether title could be granted, a

              3   marketable title?

              4       A.  No, that wouldn't be my end.  I just

              5   present what I find.  That's more the other end.

              6       Q.  Okay.

              7       A.  I'm more of a researcher than any -- than

              8   giving opinions on whether a title is clear or not.

              9   I point out maybe stuff that's, I think, you know,

             10   not clear.  I don't know if that makes sense.

             11       Q.  Were you aware that there were two Dexter

             12   Avenues in Woburn?

             13       A.  I was not.

             14       Q.  Was that something you later found out or

             15   found out through your research?

             16       A.  I later found out that the other property

             17   in question was up the street.

             18       Q.  But during your research you didn't

             19   identify that there was another avenue, Dexter

             20   Avenue?

             21       A.  No, I wouldn't -- it wouldn't come up,

             22   because I'm just running that entity, so I wouldn't

             23   have any idea there were two Dexter Streets, 'cause

             24   there's nothing -- I'm not running it by street; I'm














                                                               45

              1   running it by the person that owns it, which was the

              2   Eagles.  So it said "Dexter Street," so that was --

              3   you know, I wouldn't -- no.  Let's put it that way.

              4       Q.  And that was based on the information that

              5   was provided to you by Mr. Miller?

              6       A.  Yes.

              7       Q.  Okay.  Did you look at any assessors maps?

              8       A.  No.

              9       Q.  No.  And why not?

             10       A.  'Cause I had a plan.  Assessors maps aren't

             11   as accurate as plans that are recorded.  In a title

             12   search I never look at assessors.  There's no need

             13   to.  In my business, if I have a plan, that's -- if

             14   there's no plan, you might get an assessors or an

             15   atlas, but the assessors aren't really -- they're

             16   not so much to look at, that I would look at.  It

             17   wouldn't be -- they're not as accurate as somebody

             18   doing a plan.  Let's put it that way.

             19       Q.  Okay.  You wouldn't look at it just as a

             20   backup?

             21       A.  There wouldn't be any purpose in doing

             22   that.  You know, I have a plan, I have an owner, a

             23   recorded deed.

             24       Q.  You mentioned atlases.  Did you look at any














                                                               46

              1   atlases?

              2       A.  Not on the initial search.  I may have done

              3   some more research when it (gesturing).  Atlases

              4   are -- they're hit and miss, very much so over

              5   there.  Some towns have them, some don't.  Some go

              6   back, some don't.  They're -- you know, they can

              7   help sometimes, but they're not reliable.

              8       Q.  Are you familiar with the term "title

              9   abstract"?

             10       A.  Yes.

             11       Q.  Do you prepare those as well?

             12       A.  That's what that is (indicating).

             13       Q.  So those are interchangeable?

             14       A.  Yes.

             15               MR. BENEVIDES:  I don't have much more,

             16   so if you'll give me just a few minutes.

             17               (Discussion off the record and recess.)

             18   BY MR. BENEVIDES:

             19       Q.  Just a few more questions for you.  Have

             20   you ever done any work for the law firm of Mawn &

             21   Mawn with respect to a property on Dexter Avenue?

             22       A.  I don't know.  We might have done a few

             23   things for them years ago.  I know the name.  I

             24   don't recall.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I've done














                                                               47

              1   thousands and thousands and thousands of titles

              2   everywhere in Middlesex County.  I'm not sure.

              3       Q.  Okay.  Anything specific to this property

              4   that you were hired by Mawn & Mawn or an attorney

              5   named Sharon Russell?

              6       A.  That's not a familiar name to me.

              7       Q.  Okay.  You mentioned you had done work for

              8   Mr. Natale before.  Do you know --

              9       A.  Yeah.

             10       Q.  Do you recall what it entailed?

             11       A.  I think some developing.

             12       Q.  Where was that?

             13       A.  It was Abt, A-b-t, Ave., I think -- I'm not

             14   even sure.  It might have been Woburn, maybe, or

             15   Wakefield, maybe, years ago.  I recognized the name

             16   when he said, Bruce Miller said "Natale."  I said,

             17   "Okay, yeah, I remember him.  We did some stuff over

             18   there."  He goes, "Yeah, same guy."

             19       Q.  Any other properties you did for Bruce

             20   Miller for Mr. Natale?

             21       A.  Not that I recall.

             22       Q.  Okay.  You had mentioned earlier that you

             23   met somebody from Blue Sky Title that conveyed to

             24   you that there was some screw-up in the location of














                                                               48

              1   the property?

              2       A.  Yes.

              3       Q.  Just tell me everything that you recall

              4   from that conversation, please.

              5       A.  I sort of know him a little bit.  He had

              6   come up to me, and he said he was -- he had a title

              7   search for one of the condos.  He did a title

              8   search, and somebody -- I don't know what -- I'm not

              9   sure what firm he did it for.  He said there was a

             10   mess-up, they went out to look at the property and

             11   it was incorrect, it's the wrong property.  I said,

             12   "Oh, boy."  Basically, that was the whole

             13   conversation.  And then I heard I think from Bruce

             14   about it.  So that was kind of the general gist of

             15   the conversation.

             16       Q.  Do you recall the time at which this -- you

             17   know, the time period in which this happened?

             18       A.  I don't, to be honest with you.  I don't

             19   recall.  If I had to guess -- well, I shouldn't be

             20   guessing.  Typically, if he was doing a title

             21   search, then the condos would have been -- either

             22   been in the process of being built or built.  So

             23   somebody would want to buy it, so they would, you

             24   know -- a title search would be performed on it.














                                                               49

              1       Q.  Throughout 2014; does that sound like

              2   somewhere around the time?

              3       A.  It's not unreasonable.  Maybe.  Yeah,

              4   probably.

              5       Q.  In response to my subpoena, we had a couple

              6   of phone conversations, right?

              7       A.  Yeah.

              8       Q.  At one point you had mentioned to me that

              9   you thought the issue was a problem that originated

             10   with the town, correct?

             11       A.  Yes.

             12       Q.  Could you explain that to me?

             13       A.  Well, it looks like the wrong description

             14   was provided by the town.

             15       Q.  What's your understanding of what happened?

             16       A.  My understanding is that they put the wrong

             17   description for the Eagles originally, and so that

             18   was incorrect.

             19       Q.  Put it where?

             20       A.  On the deed.  They gave -- well, where --

             21   my understanding, where they built it and where the

             22   deed itself represents the description, they seem

             23   different, from what I understand.  That's what I've

             24   heard.  And I don't -- I think that's when it














                                                               50

              1   initially started.  Then my -- I had a conversation

              2   with the -- we had a party conversation, three-way

              3   conversation, with Bruce Miller and the surveyor.  I

              4   was in on that.

              5       Q.  Okay.  Could you tell me about that

              6   conversation?

              7       A.  I think we were trying to hash it out, and

              8   I think at one point I asked, "Did you do a survey

              9   on it, and why is it different?"  I am not an expert

             10   on surveying at all.  And he -- and I heard the

             11   gentleman -- I don't know who it was -- he said it

             12   was very complicated.

             13       Q.  Do you know what firm that was, the

             14   surveyor?

             15       A.  No.  I think it was Chapin.  I shouldn't

             16   say that.  I don't know, I don't know.  I shouldn't

             17   guess at stuff like that.  Bruce had put me on a

             18   three-way call, Bruce Miller, and I didn't -- you

             19   know, I don't -- again, I'm not a surveyor, and I

             20   wouldn't pretend to be one, but I said, "Did you do

             21   -- did you go to the property and do a survey?"  And

             22   he was kind of hemming and hawing, and it was very

             23   complicated, and that was about it.  I don't really

             24   have a dog in the fight, so I didn't really care too














                                                               51

              1   much -- not care, but not -- concerned, but not --

              2   you know, I don't know.

              3       Q.  What was the reason that they involved you

              4   in a conversation about it?

              5       A.  I think just to ascertain what happened.

              6       Q.  Was there any resolve through that

              7   conversation as to what occurred and...

              8       A.  I think I mentioned to Bruce that "I think

              9   the description was wrong in the first place.  Then

             10   the surveyor screwed up and didn't do what he was

             11   supposed to do," very off-the-cuff comments, because

             12   again, I'm not a surveyor, and I don't -- I wouldn't

             13   know what they do, but I thought they'd go to the

             14   property and look at it and if it's, you know,

             15   Arrowhead and it's not written -- I mean, I don't

             16   know, so (demonstrating)...

             17       Q.  Getting back to what you were speaking

             18   about, the town, when you said that they put the

             19   wrong -- that the property was wrong to do with the

             20   deed.  Can you explain what you mean by what the

             21   city might have done?

             22       A.  Well, the city put down -- maybe they were

             23   selling to the Eagles that property, and the Eagles

             24   thought it was a different one and they built their














                                                               52

              1   building on the wrong piece of property, and I think

              2   that's what happened, maybe.

              3       Q.  You don't know that there's a building that

              4   the Eagles built on the property, do you?

              5       A.  I suppose I don't.  No.  You're right.  I

              6   don't know that.

              7       Q.  So you just --

              8       A.  That's an assumption on my part, because

              9   they had a club and they probably put a building up.

             10   But you're right, I do not know that.

             11       Q.  So do you have any other understanding of

             12   what you think the town could have not done

             13   properly?

             14       A.  I don't.  I don't -- you know, 1970, I

             15   think something got messed up.

             16               MR. BENEVIDES:  I don't have any further

             17   questions at this time.  I'll turn it over.

             18               MS. SCALISI:  Nothing right now.

             19               MS. MURPHY:  Nothing.

             20               MS. CLOUTIER:  I do.  I'm sorry, just

             21   give me one minute, please.

             22               THE WITNESS:  Of course.

                                                               53

              1                    CROSS-EXAMINATION

              2   BY MS. CLOUTIER:

              3       Q.  So I'm going to just -- this is going to

              4   seem a little bit kind of crazy because I'm just

              5   going to go in the order of the way he deposed you,

              6   so my questions are going to go from that time

              7   forward.

              8               Going back to counsel's inquiry about

              9   your recordkeeping and the documents that you have

             10   on this matter, have you produced -- did you search

             11   your emails for any email correspondence you might

             12   have had with Mr. Miller?

             13       A.  I did not.

             14       Q.  Okay.  Did you search your emails for any

             15   email correspondence you may have had related to

             16   Dexter Avenue?

             17       A.  No, just for title search purposes.

             18       Q.  Would you have potentially emails going

             19   back to 2009 and running forward?

             20       A.  I don't think so.  I think I probably

             21   erased a lot of them, I mean, like anything, you

             22   know, there would be tens of thousands of them,

             23   there would probably a lot of emails, thousands.

             24       Q.  What is your email retention policy?














                                                               54

              1       A.  Every now and then I get rid of them, if

              2   they get -- start clogging it, so there's no really

              3   policy.  Like I said, it's a small firm.  So I'll

              4   just delete if I think it's slowing down my

              5   computer.

              6       Q.  Do you keep hard files of the title

              7   searches that you do?

              8       A.  I do not.

              9       Q.  So everything is electronic?

             10       A.  Correct.

             11       Q.  Okay.  Are you able to run searches on your

             12   email system through your emails?  Like could you

             13   put Bruce Miller's name in and run a search through

             14   your emails to see what comes up?

             15       A.  Yeah, probably.

             16       Q.  Or Natale?

             17       A.  Yeah, maybe.

             18       Q.  Or Dexter Avenue?

             19       A.  I suppose I could.

             20       Q.  Okay.

             21       A.  I don't know -- yeah, yes.

             22       Q.  I think that counsel may have asked you

             23   this, but do you know what -- in what time frame, as

             24   you put it, things blew up?














                                                               55

              1       A.  I don't.  Yeah...

              2       Q.  Was it something that happened in the last

              3   five years?

              4       A.  I believe so.  Yeah, I would say.

              5   Actually, I -- this is 2019.  I'm not sure.  That

              6   sounds about right, yeah.

              7       Q.  Okay.  When Mr. Miller contacted you or

              8   when you learned -- let me back up.  Let me

              9   rephrase.

             10               Who informed you that things had blown

             11   up as it related to this Dexter Avenue property?

             12       A.  It was either the kid that was doing the

             13   stuff with Blue Sky -- I can't recall his name -- or

             14   Bruce.  One of the two said things were, you know --

             15   mistakes were made, or something to that effect,

             16   like they put the building on the wrong piece of

             17   property, the condos.

             18       Q.  And other than this three-way conversation

             19   that you discussed earlier, did you do any further

             20   investigation into the blow-up related to the Dexter

             21   Avenue property?

             22       A.  I did.  I researched where the building was

             23   on, built on there.  It was -- he said, "Well, can

             24   you do it -- can you take a look at this and see














                                                               56

              1   what's going on with this piece of property?"  And

              2   it was very -- like I said, it was kind of the land

              3   time forgot.  There was -- there was nothing on it,

              4   really.

              5               So I went back and just scribbled some

              6   notes and tried to get a handle on it, and I got

              7   back to like the 1700s, 1800s, and it was just --

              8   nothing made sense.  It was just land, which is very

              9   rare.

             10       Q.  This other piece of property, was this

             11   other -- this other piece of property was not owned

             12   by the Eagles based upon your research?

             13       A.  Correct.  They would have -- the Eagles

             14   would have owned that (indicating), but I think that

             15   -- but it showed that they -- I think they were in a

             16   different location.  I guess that's what happened.

             17   So we tried to determine who actually owned it, and

             18   it was a little beyond my scope of things I do.  I

             19   can't get bogged down with something that's going to

             20   take three or four weeks.  I just -- we do houses

             21   and refi's and, you know, pop them out, do small

             22   commercial stuff.

             23               So they retained another firm to do the

             24   research who -- I know who did that, and I spoke to














                                                               57

              1   him, and it took them quite a while from my

              2   understanding.  There was a big report.  I don't

              3   know if you guys have it or not, but they found --

              4       Q.  What -- I'm sorry, go ahead.

              5       A.  Oh, Marsh Moriarty.

              6       Q.  I'm sorry?

              7       A.  Marsh Moriarty is the firm that was asked

              8   to do it.  That's kind of what they do.

              9       Q.  When Mr. Miller asked you to take a look at

             10   this other piece of property, what information did

             11   he give you related to this piece of property that

             12   let you do your title search?

             13       A.  You know?  I don't know.  I think he -- let

             14   me think about this.  How would I know who owned it

             15   or what to do on it...  You know, I'm not sure, to

             16   be honest with you, I'm not sure how we -- I got to

             17   the right -- where the buildings were built on.  I

             18   don't recall, to be honest with you.

             19       Q.  I mean, would he have given you an address?

             20       A.  Maybe, maybe, but I don't know --

             21       Q.  Or a deed?

             22       A.  That was the problem.  There wasn't really

             23   any deeds to the -- where the property was built on.

             24   The deed -- there were -- you know, there was a














                                                               58

              1   family -- I think the name was Fletcher.  They owned

              2   half of Woburn in the 1700s, 1800s.  And then

              3   through probates and all that stuff, I know that's

              4   how the other firm did it, but I don't recall how I

              5   would have -- you know?  I may have gone to an atlas

              6   at that point, maybe found an old atlas to try to

              7   determine --

              8       Q.  Well, were you given a tax assessor's

              9   number?

             10       A.  I might have been.  I'm little -- not sure

             11   how I ended up with him contacting me how to do a --

             12   some research on this particular piece of property.

             13       Q.  When Mr. Miller contacted you to do the

             14   research on this other piece of property, was the

             15   information that he provided to you verbal, over the

             16   phone or --

             17       A.  Yeah, yeah.

             18       Q.  So he would not have sent you a follow-up

             19   email saying, "I'd like for you to do a title search

             20   on" --

             21       A.  No, he would have called me -- and we have

             22   a casual -- not a casual relationship -- the day

             23   this all went -- the sky blew up:  "Do me a favor.

             24   Can you get on this property, see who actually does














                                                               59

              1   own it?"

              2               So I spent a couple days trying to

              3   figure it out, and it was not something that could

              4   be done within two days.  And it was very -- the

              5   scope of it was something I don't do.  You know what

              6   I'm saying?  So they hired -- so I know Bruce hired

              7   a firm that kind of does this stuff.  They do --

              8   they'll do -- they do this building, as a matter of

              9   fact, and they do things like this, that firm.

             10       Q.  The couple of days that you spent looking

             11   at this other piece of property, what documents were

             12   you looking at?

             13       A.  I was looking at old deeds, trying to chase

             14   down names, any names that are listed on that

             15   street, trying to piece stuff together with atlases

             16   and things like that.  I would have been just, you

             17   know, going through the indices, the old indices,

             18   which are handwritten.  They're very difficult to

             19   read, and the descriptions are, you know.

             20       Q.  Do you do that in person at the Registry?

             21       A.  I do, yes.  Those particular records are

             22   not on record -- or not online, the old-old stuff.

             23       Q.  Over the years in your work with

             24   Mr. Miller, have you ever had a title issue like














                                                               60

              1   this come up before?

              2       A.  Not that I recall.

              3       Q.  Can you describe more fully exactly what a

              4   title exam firm does?

              5       A.  Sure.  So somebody buys a house, they go to

              6   the bank, they get a mortgage.  The bank or the

              7   mortgage company would assign an attorney to

              8   represent them at closing for them to purchase the

              9   house, so a title search would be done.  It's

             10   usually through the lawyer.  Some lawyers do their

             11   own, most of them don't.  They would hire a firm

             12   like myself to do a 50-year search with a good start

             13   date, going forward.  And you would determine what's

             14   on the title -- liens, easements, you know, that

             15   kind of thing.

             16       Q.  And what information are you using,

             17   generally speaking, to --

             18       A.  The indices --

             19       Q.  -- run a title -- sorry.

             20       A.  Sorry.

             21       Q.  Before you go through the indices, what

             22   information are you using to determine how to do

             23   your title search?  Like are you receiving an

             24   address?  Are you receiving a deed to the piece of














                                                               61

              1   property?

              2       A.  I would normally receive the owner's name

              3   of the property, an address sometimes if they have

              4   it or, you know, general address.  Most law firms

              5   use different forms that would say, "Full title;

              6   John and Steve -- John and Linda Smith, owners; book

              7   and page; address."

              8       Q.  And do you remember what information -- so

              9   this is going back to 2009 and when you were first

             10   asked to look at property owned by the Eagles on

             11   Dexter Avenue.  Do you remember what information

             12   Mr. Miller gave you?

             13       A.  It was -- yes, it was just, "Eagles.  It's

             14   like an Elks thing.  It's like Eagles.  They own

             15   some property on Dexter in Woburn.  Can you do a

             16   title search?  I think they got it around 1970."  It

             17   was just -- it was a phone conversation.

             18       Q.  So --

             19       A.  He sometimes -- he's pretty, you know -- he

             20   orders by phone sometimes.  He sometimes will put --

             21   his secretary will email me a formal one, but he --

             22   he did not do it this time.  He may have been in a

             23   hurry or, you know.  We have a different -- you

             24   know, I've just known him for so long, he'd say,














                                                               62

              1   "Dave, hey, can you do a title?  Eagles, Dexter,

              2   they bought around 1970."  I said, "Sure."

              3       Q.  And so he didn't send you a deed to the

              4   piece of property that he was interested in or his

              5   client was interested in?

              6       A.  He did not.  He did -- no.

              7       Q.  And he didn't send you any sort of plot

              8   plan or anything like that related to the piece of

              9   property?

             10       A.  He did not.

             11       Q.  And your testimony was that you did not

             12   know how he had come to conclude that the Eagles

             13   owned the piece of property that his client was

             14   interested in; is that correct?

             15       A.  Yeah, he -- I think he got it from Natale.

             16   In fact, he said, "Natale's buying the Eagles.  He

             17   wants to put some condos on the property, this Royal

             18   Order of the Eagles," or whatever -- I think I'm

             19   saying it wrong -- "owns it.  Can you do a title on

             20   it?"  It was pretty -- you know, it wasn't anything

             21   out of the ordinary.

             22       Q.  Do you typically do title searches three

             23   years before there's a purchase and sale agreement?

             24       A.  I don't think so.  I don't know.  That's














                                                               63

              1   not really my end.  I know there's some projects,

              2   some big developments, you know, that we do titles

              3   for, and they take a while to get going, but, you

              4   know, I don't -- that would just be a kind of

              5   opinion on my side.  It's not really on my --

              6   purchase and sales, I don't see purchase and sales,

              7   or they really have nothing to do with me.  You

              8   know?  Every now and then, somebody will send me a

              9   purchase and sale just for a reference, but most of

             10   the time it's a form.  So I wouldn't be aware of

             11   when the property's selling or not.

             12       Q.  Okay.  So what was conveyed to you in

             13   June/July of '09 was, "Natale is interested, my

             14   client is interested in purchasing this piece of

             15   property to develop"?

             16       A.  Correct.

             17       Q.  You mentioned that you perhaps would have

             18   needed to have gone behind some of the work that you

             19   had done --

             20       A.  Yes.

             21       Q.  -- in order to get more complete

             22   information?

             23       A.  Well --

             24       Q.  Can you elaborate on that, please?














                                                               64

              1       A.  Sure.  So typically on a sale, we typically

              2   do a 50-year search.  So this was 1970, so it was

              3   kind of close to 50.  I said to Bruce -- I said, "Do

              4   you want me to go back and do -- this is a big tax

              5   taking.  They're all little lots.  So you have to go

              6   find the owner of the lot.  They got taken by taxes,

              7   and it goes through a whole series of stuff."  And

              8   this was multiple.  It was just -- it would have

              9   been just a lot more work, a lot more expense.  I

             10   said, "Do you want me to go back and do it?"  He

             11   said, "No, you're fine, '70's, good enough."

             12       Q.  What would the purpose have been in terms

             13   of going further back?  What would that have shown?

             14       A.  Just a 50-year search, standard -- a

             15   50-year search is standard for a sale.  I don't

             16   think it's written in stone, but it's -- originally,

             17   50 years was -- from my understanding, was -- a

             18   mortgage could be 50 years, but they're really only

             19   30, so that was kind of the idea of people doing

             20   50-year searches.  So like I do 50- -- if I get a

             21   sale, I always do a 50-year search unless it's

             22   something like this where there's a big mess behind

             23   it.  I think I ended up doing the work anyways after

             24   the whole thing kind of...














                                                               65

              1       Q.  After it blew up?

              2       A.  Yes.

              3       Q.  You did the work in terms of going further

              4   back on the original piece on Dexter Avenue that you

              5   had?

              6       A.  (Indicating) Yes.

              7       Q.  So this 1888 plan, was that something that

              8   you pulled in 2009 or after things blew up?

              9       A.  I would have pulled it then.  I would have

             10   presented the plan.  If I don't know -- for some

             11   reason it doesn't look like I sent it.  I don't know

             12   why I wouldn't.  I always include plans.  There's no

             13   reason not to.  You know?

             14       Q.  "Then" being in 2009?

             15       A.  Correct.  That plan is in the Registry.

             16   It's just the fourth floor.

             17       Q.  When you send things to Mr. Miller, are you

             18   sending them by email or by --

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  And so given what you saw when you did your

             21   title search in 2009 and the fact that it was, as

             22   you say, kind of a mess and complicated --

             23       A.  Well, the tax taking was complicated.  The

             24   description of lots on there was not complicated.














                                                               66

              1   Sometimes -- especially out by 495, you do titles

              2   that are like old farms, you know, Farmer Joe buys

              3   parcels here and there.  Then it becomes a big -- it

              4   becomes a very large title.  That's what I consider

              5   a title that's, you know, complicated and could be

              6   messy.

              7               This was just a perfunctory tax taking,

              8   going through the process, finding which lots, who

              9   owned it.  They took it, the town would take the

             10   property through tax taking, put a petition to

             11   foreclose.  Then they either withdraw it or they put

             12   a decree on barring rights forever, for redemption;

             13   in other words, your tax-taking person can come back

             14   and redeem those taxes -- they pay the taxes, they

             15   get the land back.

             16               So -- but towns particularly put a

             17   petition on saying, "We're going to forever

             18   foreclose on you," so the people are out.  So

             19   that's -- so it gets a lot of, you know.  And this

             20   one was kind of pieced together, because it was two

             21   and three lots together, and not everybody was the

             22   same owner that they took it from.

             23               So it was just -- it would have been a

             24   lot more work, a lot more expense.  "Did you want me














                                                               67

              1   to do that?"  He said, "No, we're good from here."

              2   That's what -- I don't know.  Do you know what I

              3   mean?

              4       Q.  Yes, I understand what you're saying.

              5       A.  Yeah.

              6       Q.  Do you think it would have been prudent to

              7   have gone back further in light of what you saw?

              8       A.  It wouldn't have made any difference.  The

              9   description wouldn't have changed if I went back on

             10   the tax-taking stuff, it would have been still the

             11   same description.

             12       Q.  In your research of the original piece of

             13   property that you were asked to look at in 2009, did

             14   the name Brussard ever come up?

             15       A.  I don't recall that name, unless they were

             16   one of the trustees of the Eagles.  I think I -- my

             17   report shows that I would run those folks also.  I'm

             18   not sure on which exhibit it shows it.  That's not a

             19   name I'm familiar with.

             20       Q.  I think you also mentioned that some

             21   things -- like NL refers to non locus?

             22       A.  Non locus, yes.

             23       Q.  What does non locus means?

             24       A.  It means sometimes if I run "Adam














                                                               68

              1   Benevides" and there's more than one and there's

              2   maybe a lien or a mortgage, and it's a different

              3   piece of property, so it's NL, non locus, it's not

              4   what is privy (sic) to the search we're doing.

              5       Q.  In your search in 2009, did you find

              6   anything that concerned you at all --

              7       A.  No.

              8       Q.  -- that was off?

              9       A.  No.  I mean, there was a tax taking I think

             10   I reported.  You know, tax takings are not --

             11       Q.  But nothing particularly unusual about this

             12   search?

             13       A.  No, there was just -- no.  I don't think

             14   the whole thing probably took me an hour.

             15       Q.  So when you finished your search in 2009,

             16   what else, other than this 1888 plan, would you have

             17   sent to Mr. Miller?

             18       A.  Nothing, nothing other than the report, the

             19   Exhibit 2, I think.  (Witness reviews documents.)

             20   Yeah, that's what I would have sent to him.  I

             21   wouldn't have sent him anything else.

             22       Q.  And just to be clear, it's the report --

             23       A.  That one, yeah.  I would have sent the

             24   report and copies, any copies I made, deed.














                                                               69

              1   Typically the -- on a title there's a lot more to

              2   it, but there wasn't --

              3       Q.  So it's the last six pages of Exhibit 2?

              4       A.  Yes.

              5       Q.  Plus it should have included the 1888 plan?

              6       A.  Yeah, I don't know why that did not.

              7       Q.  When Mr. Miller asked you in 2009 to do

              8   this title search, did he indicate that there was

              9   any confusion or any issues related to the title or

             10   the location of the property?

             11       A.  He did not.

             12       Q.  You said that it's your understanding that

             13   the deed for the Eagles piece of property was

             14   incorrectly drafted by the town; is that correct, or

             15   by the city?

             16       A.  That's what it seems like.  Well, either

             17   they put the wrong description or the Eagles thought

             18   they owned property somewhere else, so...  I think

             19   it's obvious it's -- something's messed up

             20   (gesturing).

             21       Q.  Did you look at any other city records

             22   after you learned --

             23       A.  No.

             24       Q.  -- that there were issues related to the














                                                               70

              1   property --

              2       A.  No.

              3       Q.  -- the location of the property?

              4       A.  I wouldn't have access to city records

              5   unless they have them there.  I'm just in the

              6   Registry, so I wouldn't, like, go to the town hall

              7   or any of that kind of stuff.

              8       Q.  How often have you -- or strike that.

              9               In the past ten years approximately how

             10   many times have you performed title searches in the

             11   city of Woburn?

             12       A.  A couple hundred, maybe.

             13       Q.  Have you come across similar issues where

             14   the city has incorrectly recorded information --

             15       A.  No.

             16       Q.  -- in the deeds?

             17       A.  I have not.

             18       Q.  Or in other city records related to pieces

             19   of property?

             20       A.  No, I've never come across this.

             21               MS. CLOUTIER:  I don't think I have any

             22   further questions.

             23               MR. RAMSDELL:  I have a couple.  Can we

             24   change seats so he's speaking to the stenographer?














                                                               71

              1               MS. CLOUTIER:  Sure.

              2                    CROSS-EXAMINATION

              3   BY MR. RAMSDELL:

              4       Q.  Good afternoon, Mr. MacInnis.

              5       A.  Good afternoon.

              6       Q.  My name is Barry Ramsdell.  I'm an

              7   attorney, and I represent the interests of The Grand

              8   Aerie of the Fraternal Order of Eagles in this case.

              9       A.  Okay.

             10       Q.  I too have a couple questions, follow-up

             11   questions, on what Adam asked you.  And the first

             12   question I guess is, just to confirm from my notes,

             13   when you say you give a report to the attorney or

             14   client that hires you, do they all look like what we

             15   have marked here in Exhibit 2?  Is it the same form?

             16       A.  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

             17       Q.  Okay.  And what we have marked here in

             18   Exhibit 2 is your report to Bruce Miller?

             19       A.  Yes.

             20       Q.  And there were no other reports to Bruce

             21   Miller on this property?

             22       A.  I think there were reports to Bruce Miller

             23   from my mother, who faxed them over.  I think

             24   there's some exhibits related to that.














                                                               72

              1       Q.  Okay, but I'm speaking again --

              2       A.  Oh, in that time frame?

              3       Q.  Yes, yes, in 2009.

              4       A.  No, that was it.

              5       Q.  This would have been it, okay.  And I

              6   understand from your testimony that you got involved

              7   in this case with respect to the title search from a

              8   telephone call with Bruce Miller?

              9       A.  Correct.

             10       Q.  Can you tell me how many telephone calls

             11   you had with Bruce Miller about this property prior

             12   to you learning that it had, quote-unquote, blown

             13   up?

             14       A.  Just the one.

             15       Q.  Just one?

             16       A.  Just when he ordered the title.

             17       Q.  All right.  Then let me ask you this:

             18   Aside from Bruce Miller, did you have conversations

             19   with anyone else at Pierce Atwood with respect to

             20   this property?

             21       A.  No, I would not.

             22       Q.  Okay.  And did Bruce Miller send you any

             23   correspondence with respect to his request for a

             24   title search on the involved property?














                                                               73

              1       A.  Not on this one, no.

              2       Q.  Does he usually send you a written request?

              3       A.  Sometimes.  He's casual.  Sometimes he

              4   does, sometimes, if he needs something in a hurry or

              5   if he's, you know.

              6       Q.  Do you have any knowledge as to why he

              7   would not have sent you a written communication on

              8   this property?

              9       A.  I do not.

             10       Q.  Okay.  And Mr. Miller told you that he

             11   represented Mr. Natale in this case?

             12       A.  He did mention that, yeah.

             13       Q.  And he, Mr. Miller, Attorney Miller, told

             14   you that this involved property on Dexter Ave.?

             15       A.  Yes.

             16       Q.  And how many pieces of property on Dexter

             17   Avenue did you believe the Grand Aerie owned?

             18       A.  One.

             19       Q.  And how did you know that?

             20       A.  I grantee'd -- did a grantee search running

             21   their name.

             22       Q.  How far back?

             23       A.  Probably in the '60s, I would say.

             24       Q.  Okay.  So if they had acquired property on














                                                               74

              1   Dexter Ave. prior to the '60s, you wouldn't have

              2   known about it?

              3       A.  Correct.

              4       Q.  Shouldn't you have known about it when he

              5   just said they owned property on Dexter Ave.?

              6       A.  He told me the time frame, so that's what I

              7   went with.

              8       Q.  Okay.  How did you know whether or not that

              9   was accurate?

             10       A.  I do not know if it was accurate or not.  I

             11   went with his word.

             12       Q.  Okay.  And you relied upon the

             13   representation of Attorney Miller that the property

             14   would have been acquired by the Grand Aerie in 1970

             15   or thereafter?

             16       A.  He said, if I can recall, late '60s, around

             17   '70.  That's what he said, yes.

             18       Q.  Okay.

             19       A.  I relied on him.

             20       Q.  And you knew he represented Mr. Natale at

             21   that time?

             22       A.  I did.

             23       Q.  Would I be correct that Attorney Miller did

             24   not send you a copy of a deed into the --














                                                               75

              1       A.  Correct.

              2       Q.  Don't you usually get a deed into the

              3   grantee when you do your search?

              4       A.  Never.

              5       Q.  Never?

              6       A.  I shouldn't say never, almost never.

              7       Q.  Almost never.  At some point when you do

              8   your search, do you find the deed?

              9       A.  I have book and page references.  90

             10   percent of the time it's given to me.  As long as it

             11   matches the address, then I'm fine.  So somebody

             12   would order a title.  They would have the name,

             13   address, book and page, and when the deed...

             14       Q.  Do you --

             15       A.  Some people don't, but most people do.

             16   They usually get it off of, I think, from what I

             17   understand -- I didn't mean to talk over you.  From

             18   what I understand, I think they get it from the P&S.

             19       Q.  Okay.  Do you know whether Mr. Natale had a

             20   P&S in 2009 when you did --

             21       A.  I would have no idea.

             22       Q.  Okay.

             23       A.  That's not really my end.

             24       Q.  Okay.  Did Attorney Miller give you a book














                                                               76

              1   and page?

              2       A.  He did not.

              3       Q.  Okay.  So you went to the grantee index and

              4   looked for a deed into the Woburn area?

              5       A.  Yeah, the Eagles, yeah, correct.

              6       Q.  Okay.  And did you print that deed?

              7       A.  Yes (indicating).

              8       Q.  Okay.  And I think your earlier testimony

              9   was you sent a copy of that deed to Attorney Miller?

             10   I think you said you emailed it; is that --

             11       A.  I emailed the whole report, including the

             12   deed.

             13       Q.  Including the deed that --

             14       A.  There would have been a report, run sheet,

             15   deed, anything I find.

             16       Q.  Okay.  But let me just finish my question.

             17       A.  Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.

             18       Q.  That's okay.  So let's back up a little

             19   bit.  You found the deed, you printed it?

             20       A.  (Nodding.)

             21       Q.  You found a copy of the plan and you

             22   printed it?

             23       A.  I think I did.  It doesn't seem to indicate

             24   that I sent it over at the time, if it's not on














                                                               77

              1   that.  I don't know why I didn't.

              2       Q.  Okay.  I thought your earlier testimony was

              3   that you did email him -- your earlier testimony was

              4   that you reviewed the '88 plan and you emailed it to

              5   Attorney Miller in '09; is that accurate or --

              6       A.  I don't think I said that.

              7       Q.  Okay, all right.  So as you sit here today,

              8   you believe that you did not send to Attorney Miller

              9   a copy of the plan?

             10       A.  At '09 -- at the time --

             11       Q.  Yes.

             12       A.  -- that report was sent over, if it's not

             13   attached to that exhibit, I would say I did not send

             14   it at that particular time.  Did I send it to him

             15   later or a day later or two days later?  I don't

             16   know.

             17       Q.  When you say "attached to the exhibit,"

             18   what do you --

             19       A.  Yeah, to the report, so it's --

             20       Q.  Your report?

             21       A.  It would have been Exhibit 2.  So typically

             22   what I do is, there's a bill, the report, run sheet,

             23   everything I find, and I usually put the plan on the

             24   end.














                                                               78

              1       Q.  Were those all stapled together in your

              2   office?

              3       A.  It was electronically.

              4       Q.  Okay.  Was a copy of the plan on your

              5   computer?

              6       A.  I'm not sure.

              7       Q.  It might have been?

              8       A.  It may have been.  I don't know.

              9       Q.  And if it was, wouldn't that --

             10       A.  This plan was sent to him at some point

             11   because I can see my writing on the plan

             12   (indicating), where I outlined kind of the rough

             13   outline of the lots that I was -- went back and

             14   researched for the tax-taking purposes, so...

             15       Q.  Okay.  And if it was on your computer, that

             16   would not indicate whether or not you sent it to

             17   Attorney Miller?

             18       A.  No, I would have to look at my

             19   correspondence with Bruce to see if I had sent it a

             20   day later, ten days later, ten years later.

             21       Q.  Would that correspondence be paper or

             22   email?

             23       A.  Email.  I would have gotten a copy of it,

             24   scanned it and emailed it.














                                                               79

              1       Q.  Okay.  And did you check your email to see

              2   whether you did that?

              3       A.  I did not.

              4       Q.  So you may -- without checking, you may

              5   have a copy of an email from you to Attorney Miller

              6   in '09 sending him a copy of the '88 plan; is that

              7   correct?

              8       A.  It's possible.

              9       Q.  Okay.  And if so, Attorney Miller would

             10   have known in 2009 that you were doing a title

             11   rundown on the Section A property, correct?

             12       A.  Yes, he would have gathered that from my

             13   deed, the deed description.

             14       Q.  *Exactly.  So he knew that you -- as far

             15   back as 2009, you were not doing a title rundown on

             16   what has been referred to as 13 West Dexter Ave.,

             17   correct?

             18       A.  Is that where the properties --

             19       Q.  The properties are built.

             20       A.  Yeah, from what I understand.  That was --

             21       Q.  So your answer is yes to my question?

             22       A.  Repeat the question, if you don't mind.

             23       Q.  Sure.

             24               MR. BENEVIDES:  Can you read that back














                                                               80

              1   to him.

              2               *(Question read.)

              3               MS. SCALISI:  Objection.

              4       A.  I couldn't speak for him.  I don't know

              5   what he knew or what he was --

              6       Q.  No --

              7       A.  Oh.

              8       Q.  -- I'm just asking you to speak to what you

              9   sent to him.

             10       A.  Well,  I sent this (indicating).  When I

             11   say "this," I mean the report, and as far as a

             12   description on the deed, we would refer to that

             13   plan.

             14       Q.  Correct.

             15       A.  So -- yeah, so that's what I sent him.

             16       Q.  You sent him and he had that --

             17       A.  He did.

             18       Q.  -- in 2009?

             19       A.  Correct.

             20       Q.  And you knew that he was representing the

             21   plaintiff in this case, correct?

             22       A.  I did know that, yes.

             23       Q.  All right.  After you did your title

             24   rundown in 2009, did you have any further














                                                               81

              1   conversation with Attorney Miller about this

              2   property?

              3       A.  Not till years later when things were

              4   messed up, there were problems.

              5       Q.  But at that time, it was your belief that

              6   the title run down by you was requested because

              7   Mr. Natale intended to purchase it, correct?

              8       A.  Correct.

              9       Q.  Okay.  Why do you believe that the city may

             10   have placed an incorrect description on the deed

             11   that you sent to Attorney Miller?

             12       A.  I believe that because that's not where the

             13   Eagles ended up being located.  I think they --

             14       Q.  Where did the Eagles end up being located?

             15       A.  I think it was down the street or up the

             16   street.

             17       Q.  At 13 West Dexter?

             18       A.  I believe so.

             19       Q.  What's the basis for your belief that the

             20   Eagles owned that property if you could never find

             21   the deed into the Eagles at 13 West Dexter Ave.?

             22       A.  Because I was told that's where they were.

             23       Q.  Who told you that?

             24       A.  I think -- I don't know.  I mean, I














                                                               82

              1   don't -- I think I'm getting confused here.

              2       Q.  I think you are.  Did --

              3       A.  The Eagles, as far as I know, owned the

              4   land that I did the report for.

              5       Q.  Correct.

              6       A.  And then I was told years later that

              7   they -- that the property that -- that the condos

              8   were built on was a different piece of property,

              9   that the -- that somebody thought the Eagles owned

             10   that property, and they put the condos on there.

             11   That's how -- that's what my understanding was.

             12               And so Bruce said, "Can you see who owns

             13   the property that the -- where the condos ended up

             14   on?"  And I said, "I'll look around, see what I can

             15   do."  And so I wouldn't know -- I wouldn't have -- I

             16   don't go to the site, so I wouldn't know where

             17   anything is.  As far as I know, Dexter was just a

             18   general, you know.

             19       Q.  Well, you didn't go to the site, but you

             20   had a plan for where the property was that you were

             21   doing the title research on, right?

             22       A.  Correct.

             23       Q.  Okay.  So you knew where the property was;

             24   you just had not physically gone out to view it?














                                                               83

              1       A.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  That's not something I

              2   would do.

              3       Q.  All right.  So why -- to get back to the

              4   original question, why did you believe that the

              5   Eagles owned the property that the condo was -- or

              6   condos were built on?

              7       A.  Because --

              8       Q.  Somebody told you that?  Is that why you

              9   believed that?

             10       A.  I believed it because that's what happened,

             11   because they bought the land off of them, and they

             12   built condos on it, so...

             13       Q.  Which land did Natale buy from the Eagles?

             14       A.  He bought the one I did the report on,

             15   from what I understand.

             16       Q.  Exactly.

             17       A.  Yeah.

             18       Q.  So he didn't buy 13 West Dexter Ave. from

             19   the Eagles, did he?

             20       A.  It doesn't seem like it.

             21       Q.  Okay.  Do you recall who told you that the

             22   Eagles owned the property at 13 West Dexter Ave.?

             23       A.  I don't, no.

             24       Q.  Okay.  But you did a title rundown for the














                                                               84

              1   Eagles, and you never found any deed into the Eagles

              2   for 13 West Dexter Ave.; isn't that true?

              3       A.  I don't know the address of the one I did

              4   it for.  I would assume -- if that's not -- if this

              5   isn't 13 Dexter Ave. (indicating) --

              6       Q.  It is not.

              7       A.  Okay.  Then that's a fair assessment.

              8       Q.  So the answer to my question would be, yes,

              9   you never found the deed into the Eagles at 13 West

             10   Dexter Ave., correct?

             11       A.  Correct.  I was never given a number for

             12   the street, so...

             13       Q.  Okay, all right.

             14       A.  Yeah.

             15       Q.  If you were doing the title rundown in 2009

             16   with a belief that Mr. Natale intended to purchase

             17   the property, do you know why that purchase did not

             18   go through?

             19       A.  I have no idea.

             20       Q.  Okay.  Did Attorney Miller at any time

             21   indicate to you from whom Natale intended to

             22   purchase the property in 2009?

             23       A.  Yes.

             24       Q.  And who was that?














                                                               85

              1       A.  The Eagles.

              2       Q.  But you found no deed into the Eagles for

              3   13 West Dexter Ave., right?

              4       A.  Right now, that appears to be the case.

              5       Q.  And it would have been the case in 2009?

              6       A.  Yeah, certainly.

              7       Q.  Did Attorney Miller tell you about any

              8   conversations he had with Mr. Natale with respect to

              9   the subject property?

             10               MS. SCALISI:  Objection.  You can

             11   answer.

             12       A.  He just mentioned he was going to put

             13   condos on the property.

             14       Q.  That's all he said?

             15       A.  Yeah, that's it.  It was a 30-second

             16   conversation.

             17       Q.  All right.  Did you have any conversations

             18   with Mr. Natale about the subject property?

             19       A.  No.

             20       Q.  Did you have any communications with anyone

             21   at the Woburn Aerie about any of the property on

             22   Dexter Ave.?

             23       A.  No.

             24       Q.  Did you have any conversations or any














                                                               86

              1   communications with anyone from the Grand Aerie with

              2   respect to the property on Dexter Ave.?

              3       A.  No.

              4               MR. RAMSDELL:  Okay, thank you.

              5               THE WITNESS:  Awesome.  Thank you.

              6               MS. SCALISI:  I just have three quick

              7   follow-up questions, and I'm going to move really

              8   quickly.

              9                    CROSS-EXAMINATION

             10   BY MS. SCALISI:

             11       Q.  So we're just talking about two properties.

             12   We're talking about the one appearing in the 1888

             13   plan, and we're talking about the one where the

             14   condos were built?

             15       A.  Correct.

             16       Q.  So you never physically visited either of

             17   those properties, right?

             18       A.  I did not.

             19       Q.  And as far as you know, Bruce never visited

             20   either of those properties?

             21       A.  As far as I know, no.

             22       Q.  And then just to clarify, you don't know

             23   one way or another whether you actually sent this

             24   1888 plan to Bruce, right?  You're just saying that














                                                               87

              1   you would have, but it doesn't appear that you did?

              2       A.  Yeah.

              3               MR. RAMSDELL:  I object, but you can

              4   answer.

              5       A.  I don't know if I did at the time.  I'm

              6   sure I would have since everything kind of -- I

              7   don't know.

              8       Q.  Okay.

              9       A.  I mean, I would have to really figure out

             10   my email records, and I don't know, I don't even

             11   know if I could find it.

             12               MS. SCALISI:  Okay.  That's all I have.

             13               MS. CLOUTIER:  I have a few.

             14               MR. BENEVIDES:  I'll follow you

             15   afterwards.

             16               MS. CLOUTIER:  Okay.

             18   BY MS. CLOUTIER:

             19       Q.  Do you keep billing records?

             20       A.  No.

             21       Q.  Did you ever speak to anyone who

             22   represented themselves as counsel for the Eagles?

             23       A.  No.

             24       Q.  Did you ever speak to an individual by the














                                                               88

              1   name of Steve Braese?

              2       A.  No.

              3       Q.  Did you ever speak to --

              4       A.  Oh, oh, let me rephrase that.  That

              5   conversation I had with Bruce Miller and somebody,

              6   some surveyor, I don't recall his name.  So I don't

              7   want to -- if it was him, then -- you know what I'm

              8   saying?

              9       Q.  I'll represent to you that Steve Braese is

             10   not a surveyor.

             11       A.  Okay.  Then I did not.

             12       Q.  Okay.  Did you ever speak to anyone from

             13   the city of Woburn?

             14       A.  No.

             15       Q.  When you spoke to Mr. Miller in 2009,

             16   before you did the title search, do you know whether

             17   his understanding of the property being owned by the

             18   Eagles came from his own research or was that

             19   information provided to him by Natale?

             20       A.  I got the impression it was from Natale.

             21       Q.  Do you know how Natale came to

             22   understand --

             23       A.  I wouldn't have any idea.

             24       Q.  The report that you did, title report that














                                                               89

              1   you did produce for 2009, where did you find that in

              2   your records?

              3       A.  That was on my emails.  I have a file that

              4   has all my titles that I've scanned over the years,

              5   so I probably have 35,000 titles, and I put it in by

              6   the town and by the street name.

              7       Q.  Okay.

              8       A.  So I went to "Woburn," "Dexter," and there

              9   it was.

             10       Q.  Okay.  But you didn't search your emails

             11   for "Bruce Miller," for "Dexter Avenue," for

             12   "Natale"?

             13       A.  I wouldn't have saved those.  I would

             14   not -- I might have deleted those.  That's a

             15   different -- that's a separate Middlesex title file.

             16       Q.  Just to confirm, though, you didn't search

             17   your emails --

             18       A.  No, no.

             19       Q.  -- your in box or out box --

             20       A.  I'm sorry.  No, I did not.

             21       Q.  -- for any of those names?

             22       A.  No.

             23       Q.  And going back to Exhibits 3 and 4, where

             24   your mother was doing some work --














                                                               90

              1       A.  Yes.

              2       Q.  -- what -- so how did she end up doing that

              3   work that's represented in Exhibits 3 and 4?

              4       A.  I would imagine that Bruce probably

              5   contacted me and said, "Can you run these up?"  And

              6   I said -- and I would have wrote it down maybe on a

              7   piece of paper and handed it to her and said, "Can

              8   you run these up?  These are run-ups or rundowns for

              9   the policy."  That was kind of what she did, a lot

             10   of run-ups and rundowns, shorter versions of title

             11   searches.  That's kind of what -- they're easy to do

             12   online.  You want to do the full titles in the

             13   Registry, there's more resources.  So that was kind

             14   of her role at the time.

             15       Q.  Do you know why he was asking you to do

             16   that in, I believe it was the 2013 and '14 time

             17   frame, in those two exhibits?

             18       A.  I don't.  I could -- I don't, actually.

             19       Q.  Would you have sent him anything in

             20   response to what was done in Exhibits 3 and 4?

             21       A.  No.  What she usually does if she does

             22   those, she just ends up faxing them from the office.

             23   We have a small office in Easton.  So she would have

             24   just shot him a fax because I -- I mean, I would














                                                               91

              1   have -- if I sent him those, it would have been on

              2   my -- in the Middlesex folder as far as that, and I

              3   would have, you know, checked and sent them along.

              4       Q.  Do you keep a hard copy of faxes that you

              5   send along?

              6       A.  No.

              7       Q.  When Mr. Miller contacted you in 2009 or

              8   really at any point in time from 2009 forward, did

              9   you ever speak to anybody else other than Mr. Miller

             10   about either piece of property that was at issue on

             11   Dexter Avenue?

             12       A.  Just the --

             13       Q.  The surveyor?

             14       A.  The surveyor, a couple title examiners that

             15   got involved.

             16       Q.  Anybody else that you haven't mentioned

             17   yet?

             18       A.  No, no.  Nobody -- no title examiner would

             19   find this interesting.  You know what I mean?  It's

             20   all kind of boring.  So I just -- the guy, the kid

             21   that did -- was doing it for the mortgage company,

             22   and then the people Bruce hired from Marsh Moriarty,

             23   I spoke to that person a little bit about it because

             24   I was more -- I was interested in what was going on,














                                                               92

              1   what was the outcome and did they find anything.  I

              2   was more, you know.

              3               MS. CLOUTIER:  All right.  I don't have

              4   any further questions.  Thank you.

              5                   REDIRECT EXAMINATION

              6   BY MR. BENEVIDES:

              7       Q.  I just wanted to turn you to Exhibit 1,

              8   which is the subpoena.  I just want to point out

              9   that we did request all communications with Pierce

             10   Atwood.

             11       A.  Yes.

             12       Q.  And if you read it over, emails would be

             13   included in that.

             14       A.  Sure.

             15       Q.  So if you would be so kind, could you

             16   please run through your emails --

             17       A.  I certainly will.

             18       Q.  -- and produce us everything related to

             19   this search, related to this title --

             20       A.  I will.

             21       Q.  -- related to Pierce Atwood?

             22       A.  Yeah, that was my clumsiness,

             23   misunderstanding.  I just missed something.  I don't

             24   know why I thought just the title.  I don't know.














                                                               93

              1       Q.  That's fine.  Do you think you could do

              2   that within a week or so?

              3       A.  What's today's date?  Yeah, we're getting

              4   near the end of the month, so...

              5       Q.  How about by next Friday, maybe?

              6       A.  Yes.

              7       Q.  That would be great.  Thank you.

              8       A.  No promises, but I certainly will make

              9   every effort.

             10       Q.  I'll remind you.

             11       A.  Yeah, definitely, definitely.  As long as

             12   you don't get me near the end of the month, I'm

             13   good, because that's when it's mayhem.

             14       Q.  Just for clarification, when were you told

             15   the Eagles owned 13 West Dexter?

             16       A.  I don't know, probably -- I think there's a

             17   rundown we did, maybe.  I'm not sure.  Years later,

             18   after everything kind of went, you know, to hell

             19   there, you know, got blown up, blew up, or whatever.

             20       Q.  So in your initial title search you were

             21   not told at all --

             22       A.  I was not given a street number, but Bruce

             23   is casual.  That's how he does things.  I mean,

             24   "Dexter Street," "Eagles," that was it.  I said,














                                                               94

              1   "Okay."  Well, there we go.

              2       Q.  It wasn't unusual for him to give without a

              3   an address number?

              4       A.  Right.

              5       Q.  Why didn't you ask for one?

              6       A.  I didn't think I needed one.  If I found

              7   two or three different properties, deeds that they

              8   owned, then I would have said, "Hey, what's going on

              9   here?  What do they own?  What's the address?"  But

             10   where I just found the one deed, I didn't -- it was

             11   on Dexter Street, so it was, okay, here we go.

             12       Q.  You don't have any written correspondence

             13   that you sent out that's not through email, correct?

             14       A.  Correct.

             15       Q.  Okay.  Just for the record, in your search,

             16   if you do find any, we also would like that as well.

             17       A.  Okay.

             18               MR. BENEVIDES:  That's all I have right

             19   now.  Thank you very much.

             20               THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.

             21               MR. RAMSDELL:  Let me just ask one

             22   question.

             23               MR. BENEVIDES:  Sure.

             24














                                                               95

              1                   RECROSS-EXAMINATION

              2   BY MR. RAMSDELL:

              3       Q.  Just to clarify, just to make sure I didn't

              4   misunderstand, I thought he asked you about 13 West

              5   Dexter Road, and you said you did a title rundown on

              6   that and found that it was owned by the Eagles?

              7       A.  No.  There was -- I saw an exhibit in here

              8   that had the address as 13 --

              9       Q.  Yeah.

             10       A.  -- in one of these exhibits.

             11       Q.  Yeah.

             12       A.  It looks like it was done years later

             13   (indicating), 2014.

             14       Q.  And that shows that it was owned --

             15       A.  Oh, no.  You know what?  That was owned by

             16   Natale.

             17       Q.  Okay, I just wanted to clarify that.

             18       A.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.

             19       Q.  I just wanted to clarify that for the

             20   record.  I didn't want that --

             21       A.  Yeah, yeah.

             22       Q.  Okay, thank you.

             23       A.  That looks like -- yeah.

             24       Q.  Okay.  Thank you very much.














                                                               96

              1               FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

              2   BY MR. BENEVIDES:

              3       Q.  One more small question.  You mentioned

              4   that this document -- I think it was Exhibit 6.

              5   Could you clarify that?  I didn't write it down.

              6       A.  Yeah.

              7       Q.  You said this was your handwriting on this?

              8       A.  Those little lines there, yeah.

              9       Q.  Okay.

             10       A.  I just kind of outlined where the property

             11   was and correspondence to the lots.  I did all

             12   those -- they're little lots.  They're tax takings

             13   and they were just -- so it was just me trying

             14   figure out where property was.  It's very rough,

             15   sketchy.

             16       Q.  In looking at Exhibit 6, it would appear

             17   that two of the lots seem missing out of the

             18   continuous parcels?

             19       A.  Yes.  I think I -- I think they were not

             20   included in the -- let me think. (Witness reviews

             21   document.)

             22       Q.  Well, let me ask you this:  Is that

             23   something that you would ordinarily point to your

             24   client's attention in knowing that they were trying














                                                               97

              1   to develop a parcel?

              2       A.  I don't know if it was in here, is what I'm

              3   saying (indicating).  As a matter of fact, you could

              4   tell it was not.  It was excluded.  It's Lots 1 to

              5   7, then 10 to 25 inclusive, Block 30.  So it wasn't

              6   in this deed to begin with, I think.  Is this Block

              7   30?

              8               MS. SCALISI:  Mm-hm.

              9       Q.  And I believe you testified that you looked

             10   into the individual lots after an initial search,

             11   right?

             12       A.  Yeah, that were on here.

             13       Q.  And that was after things blew up, as you

             14   stated?

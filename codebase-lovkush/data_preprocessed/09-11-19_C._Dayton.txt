          2                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Good morning.  This is

          3   the start of the deposition of Corey Dayton.  We are now

          4   on record at 10:03 a.m. on September 11th, 2019.  This is

          5   for the case titled Douglas S. Chabot, et al. Vs.

          6   Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., et al., for the United

          7   States District Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania.

          8                  Will counsel please identify yourselves,

          9   state any agreements on the record, after which the court

         10   reporter will swear in the witness.

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  David Knotts, Robbins, Geller,

         12   Rudman & Dowd, for Mr. Dayton and Plaintiffs.

         13                  MS. ZALKA:  Caroline Zalka from Weil

         14   Gotshal for the Defendants.

         15                  MS. PROVEY:  Corinna Provey from Weil

         16   Gotshal for the Defendants.

         17                  THE WITNESS:  Corey Dayton, Plaintiff.

         18                        COREY M. DAYTON,

         19   having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:

         20                           EXAMINATION

         21   BY MS. ZALKA:

         22        Q.   Good morning, Mr. Dayton.  Obviously, we've

         23   introduced ourselves, but, for the record, I'm Caroline

         24   Zalka.  As you heard, I represent the defendants.

         25        A.   Yes.

                                                                        8



          1        Q.   Have you been deposed -- deposed before?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   No?

          4        A.   Have I been what?

          5        Q.   Have you been deposed before?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   Okay.  So I'll just go over a couple of the

          8   ground rules.

          9                  So first is, if you don't hear a question,

         10   just tell me and I'll repeat it.  If you're not clear

         11   about what a question means, tell me and I'll repeat it.

         12   We can take breaks when you want; I just ask that you

         13   answer any question that's concurrently pending before we

         14   take a break.  And I'll happy -- I'll be happy to find a

         15   convenient spot --

         16        A.   Okay.

         17        Q.   -- if you want a break, just let me know.

         18                  Just a reminder to not use gestures;

         19   they're hard for the court reporter to capture.  So just

         20   make sure you're answering all my questions verbally.

         21        A.   Okay.

         22        Q.   If you -- I'm not asking you for any privileged

         23   information.  So any information that's protected by

         24   attorney/client privilege or work product, so if you think

         25   that a question calls for that -- I'm sure your counsel

                                                                        9



          1   will interject, but you can always confer with your

          2   counsel in that regard.

          3        A.   Okay.

          4        Q.   Okay.  If you don't ask for clarification, I'll

          5   assume that you understood the question.  Okay?

          6        A.   Okay.

          7        Q.   And you understand that you're testifying under

          8   oath, correct?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   Final thing, which I will work on as well, we

         11   just both need to make sure like I finish my question

         12   completely and you finish your answer completely, and try

         13   not to talk over one another, because it makes it really

         14   hard for the court reporter to get what we're saying if we

         15   start talking over one another.

         16        A.   Okay.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So let's just talk a little bit first

         18   about, can you describe your professional background.

         19        A.   Yes.  I'm a principal compliance engineer.  I

         20   work for Fujitsu.  It's a Japanese company.  Been there

         21   for 22 years.  I handle all the regulatory compliance work

         22   for market strategy, market -- or of deployment into

         23   different regions of the world for our particular project.

         24   And I'm an expert in regulatory compliance testing, which

         25   I've been doing for 37 years.

                                                                       10



          1        Q.   And what is your title at Fujitsu?

          2        A.   Principal compliance engineer.

          3        Q.   And what -- what actually does that mean?  Like

          4   what is principal compliance engineer?

          5        A.   Okay.  So let's say you design this -- we design

          6   this computer, so various countries have

          7   regulatory -- they have regulations, that you have to meet

          8   certain criteria, such as electromagnetic interference,

          9   product safety.  For their tier one customers here in the

         10   U.S., for central offices, such as Verizon, AT&T,

         11   CenturyLink, they require approval to the NEBS standard --

         12   and NEB -- N-E-B-S standard -- and that particular

         13   standard, it costs about $100,000 to run all of the tests

         14   for that.  And it's everything from ESE to electrical

         15   magnetic compatibility, product safety, bonding,

         16   grounding, earthquake testing, fire testing, operational

         17   temperature and humidity testing, transportation vibration

         18   testing.  Like if you put the box in -- you know, you're

         19   shipping a box, you want to get it there without it being

         20   damaged.  Storage temperature testing.  It goes on and on.

         21   Hygroscopic dust, airborne contaminants.  So that's the

         22   testing that we do.

         23        Q.   Okay.

         24        A.   And -- and our customers require this approval

         25   before they purchase our product.

                                                                       11



          1        Q.   Got it.

          2        A.   And I also handle for not only the U.S., but for

          3   the worldwide compliance.

          4        Q.   Okay.  How many people do you have reporting to

          5   you?

          6        A.   So I am no longer a manager.  I used to be a

          7   senior manager for 17 years at Fujitsu.  And three years

          8   ago -- that was in Pearl River, New York.  And Fujitsu

          9   came in and closed down the R&D facility, laid over 100

         10   people off, gave five people the opportunity to relocate

         11   to Richardson area.  I was one of the five people.  I

         12   didn't want to be 58 years old looking for another job, so

         13   I decided to relocate and I bought a house here, and I

         14   settled in.

         15                  So I was the senior manager then, but the

         16   fact that they laid off my entire team, I had nobody to

         17   manage anymore, so I became an individual contributor.

         18        Q.   Got it.  And prior to your time with ju-

         19   -- jujitsu -- Fujitsu, where did you work?

         20        A.   I worked at a company called EIS, and I did the

         21   same thing, regulatory compliance.  There I was a senior

         22   compliance engineer.  Then prior to that, I worked at

         23   another company, Micrognosis, M-I-C-R-O-G-N-O-S-I-S, and I

         24   was a senior compliance engineer there.

         25                  I've pretty much been a compliance engineer

                                                                       12



          1   from the beginning.

          2        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever worked in any way in the

          3   financial services industry?

          4        A.   Only for Micrognosis, but it wasn't financial

          5   services.  They developed and built computerized trading

          6   systems.  So we would -- you know, we had many of the big

          7   accounts, the JPMorgans, and Prudential base, many

          8   accounts in Europe, Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo.

          9                  So -- and that was just a trading system

         10   to -- you know, the price of stocks, bonds, money markets,

         11   futures.  But I was in the engineering end of it, not

         12   the -- the procurement or managing stocks, bonds, money

         13   markets.

         14        Q.   So outside of kind of the engineer -- being

         15   responsible for some of the aspects of the engineering

         16   that related to a system that was being used by financial

         17   services companies, in your professional career, you

         18   haven't had any direct experience in financial services?

         19        A.   No.  Not -- just installing the equipment.

         20        Q.   Got it.

         21        A.   But I had no direct access to their financial

         22   servers that provided the information.

         23        Q.   Have you ever been an officer of a public

         24   company?

         25        A.   No, I have not.

                                                                       13



          1        Q.   Or a director of a public company?

          2        A.   No, I have not.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Are you a member of any professional

          4   organizations?

          5        A.   I'm a member of the IEEE.

          6        Q.   For those of us that aren't in the engineering

          7   space, what does that stand for?

          8        A.   It's Electrical Engineering Association -- yeah.

          9   It's I-E-E-E.  So -- and I'm in the electromagnetic

         10   compatibility section.  They have different sections under

         11   the IEEE, and I'm under the electromagnetic compatibility,

         12   which has to do with area of my line of work.

         13        Q.   Okay.  Any other professional organizations?

         14        A.   Well, I mean, I'm on various committees.  One is

         15   ATIS, A-T-I-S, and that is where we develop industry

         16   standards for telecommunications and communications

         17   equipment, as well as a tel- -- I'm on telcordia

         18   committees, which develop standards for the NEBS.

         19   N-E-B-S, that's the testing I explained to you earlier.

         20        Q.   Uh-huh.

         21        A.   And so I've been a member of those committees

         22   for several -- many, many years.

         23        Q.   And what about your educational background, can

         24   you just tell me where you got your degrees from, which

         25   degrees and when?

                                                                       14



          1        A.   Right.  Well, I went to a community college,

          2   Orange County Community College.  I got an associate's

          3   degree.  And I started going to the New York Institute of

          4   Technology.  But instead, I -- the company I had started

          5   working for earlier in the summer wanted me back so badly

          6   that I went directly to work for them, and I had -- I

          7   wanted to go to school at night to finish up, but it

          8   didn't transpire out that way, because I ended up

          9   traveling so much in this particular -- particular line of

         10   work.  There is a lot of traveling involved; typically, 40

         11   to 50 percent of the time is traveling.

         12                  And for that company, it was back in the

         13   days with the analogue telephone lines, and any -- anytime

         14   we sold a product into a particular country, I would have

         15   to go to that country and do the testing to get approval

         16   to hook into the telephone network.

         17                  And so I have been -- and I've been doing

         18   that ever since.  But now -- there's no analogue telephone

         19   lines now; everything is digital.  So they have

         20   memorandums of understanding between various countries

         21   that now we don't have to travel to that country to get

         22   approval to hook into the telephone line.  We can just go

         23   to an accredited laboratory, either local or, you know,

         24   somewhere in the U.S., and have the testing done.

         25        Q.   I know this can be hard sometimes, but I think

                                                                       15



          1   just if you -- my question was just kind of when -- when

          2   did you get which degrees.

          3        A.   Okay.  Associate's.  Okay.

          4        Q.   Okay.  So I think you said you got an

          5   associate's degree from Orange County Community College?

          6        A.   Yes.  And that's it.

          7        Q.   That's it?

          8        A.   Yeah.

          9        Q.   Have you ever taken any courses relating to

         10   investing or financial advice?

         11        A.   No, I haven't.

         12        Q.   Okay.  And I take it no kind of undergraduate --

         13        A.   No.

         14        Q.   Let me just finish my question.

         15        A.   Okay.

         16        Q.   I knew -- I know you know where I'm going.

         17                  So no undergraduate courses or anything

         18   like that, in terms of financial services or investing

         19   advice?

         20        A.   No, I have had no -- no courses in that area.

         21        Q.   Okay.  So in terms of depositions, you mentioned

         22   that you hadn't been deposed before, correct?

         23        A.   Deposed means?

         24        Q.   This, basically, where you sit in a room --

         25        A.   Never, never ever.

                                                                       16



          1        Q.   Okay.  You've led a charmed life then.

          2                  What about any other kind of testimony?

          3   Have you ever testified in court or in an arbitration?

          4        A.   No, no testimonies.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   You know, just juries and grand juries.

          7        Q.   In terms of any prior experience as like a party

          8   to a lawsuit, like either as a plaintiff or a defendant --

          9        A.   Never.

         10        Q.   Never.  This is your first time?

         11        A.   Yes.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever participated in any way

         13   before in a securities class action?

         14        A.   No.

         15        Q.   Is this your first time seeking to represent a

         16   class?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Are you receiving any compensation for seeking

         19   to represent a class?

         20        A.   No.

         21        Q.   Are you receiving any -- anything in exchange

         22   for seeking to represent a class?

         23        A.   No.

         24        Q.   Are you currently involved in any other judicial

         25   proceedings?

                                                                       17



          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   What about regulatory proceedings?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   And so historically have you ever been involved

          5   in any regulatory proceedings?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   Have you ever given any informal interviews to

          8   any regulators?

          9        A.   No, I have not.

         10        Q.   Okay.  I -- so throughout the day I'm going to

         11   be showing you documents; they'll have been premarked with

         12   an exhibit number.

         13                  So I'm showing you what's been premarked as

         14   Exhibit Number 1.

         15                  (Exhibit 1 marked.)

         16                  MR. KNOTTS:  Thank you.

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And just generally, you can

         18   take your time to look at the document, and just let me

         19   know when you're ready.

         20        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         21                  Okay.  This is about today's deposition.

         22   Okay.

         23        Q.   Have you seen this document before?

         24        A.   Have I seen this document before?  Yes, it looks

         25   familiar.

                                                                       18



          1        Q.   Okay.

          2        A.   Yes, I remember these two names on here as well.

          3   Yes, I've seen this.

          4        Q.   The two names you were just pointing to, just

          5   for the record, were?

          6        A.   Caroline -- well, actually, it's one name.  It's

          7   the same name twice -- Hickey.

          8        Q.   Yes.  That's me.

          9        A.   Yeah.

         10        Q.   Do you understand that you're testifying

         11   pursuant to this notice today?

         12        A.   Yes.

         13        Q.   Okay.  Prior to receiving this notice, when did

         14   you first understand that you were going to be deposed in

         15   this action?

         16        A.   Well, I can't give you a date.

         17        Q.   Sure.

         18        A.   It's been quite some time.

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll -- so just -- and you

         20   can answer when, but just if you're going to get into

         21   things that we've discussed, you know --

         22                  THE WITNESS:  No.

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- I'll ask you not to go

         24   there, but you can answer the time.

         25        A.   Well, I don't know the exact -- I mean, I was

                                                                       19



          1   well aware of this months ago, that this would be

          2   happening.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

          4        A.   Not necessary -- not the time or the date,

          5   because we just came up with that a couple of weeks ago.

          6        Q.   Okay.  So -- and again, I'm not asking for any

          7   communications that you had with your attorneys, that

          8   would reflect legal advice.

          9                  So is it your testimony that I think you

         10   first understood at least several months ago that you

         11   would be deposed in the action?

         12        A.   Yeah.  Yes.

         13        Q.   Okay.

         14        A.   And I agreed to it.

         15        Q.   What steps did you take to prepare for the

         16   deposition?

         17        A.   Well, I read several of the documents.  Went

         18   over the information on the stocks that I purchased.

         19   Various -- reviewed various e-mails that were produced by

         20   my attorney.  That's -- that's about it.

         21        Q.   Okay.  So let's take that in turn.

         22                  You said you read several documents.  Which

         23   documents?

         24        A.   Well, there was a motion to dismiss document.

         25   There were, I think, several work-in-progress documents, I

                                                                       20



          1   think it was called.

          2        Q.   Work-in-progress documents.

          3        A.   I -- maybe I'm using the wrong terminology.

          4                  There were -- there were a lot of

          5   documents.  If you produce the documents and I look at

          6   them, I can give you a better explanation if I've seen the

          7   document or not.

          8        Q.   Sure.  And I can ask you that, and I will today.

          9   I just want to first get what you remember.

         10                  When did you prepare?

         11        A.   Well, I mean, I've been reading the documents

         12   all along, okay, but prepared yesterday.

         13        Q.   Okay.  So when you previously just testified

         14   that you -- I asked what steps did you take to prepare;

         15   you said you read several documents.

         16                  Is it your testimony that you were

         17   referencing the documents that you read yesterday?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   Okay.  So -- and then with respect to the

         20   documents that you read yesterday, you said you recall

         21   reading a motion to dismiss; you recall reading several

         22   work-in-progress documents.

         23                  Are there any other documents that you

         24   recall reading yesterday?

         25        A.   E-mails and my various financial statements.

                                                                       21



          1   And that's about it.

          2        Q.   Okay.  So with respect to the documents you

          3   reviewed to prepare for the deposition, it was the motion

          4   to dismiss, the work-in-progress documents, e-mails and

          5   then financial statements?

          6        A.   Yes.

          7        Q.   Okay.  And nothing else that you can recall?

          8        A.   There may have been, but not that I can recall.

          9        Q.   Okay.  And with respect to the e-mails, how

         10   many, roughly?

         11        A.   Roughly?

         12        Q.   Sure.

         13        A.   There were at least 20 or 30.  And a lot of it

         14   was just communication back and forth throughout the time

         15   period, between my attorney and myself and also the other

         16   plaintiffs.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So then --

         18        A.   And also --

         19        Q.   Go ahead.

         20        A.   Also the -- the check that was done on my e-mail

         21   background, you know, it was done on my e-mail.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Let's take that in turn then.

         23                  So with respect to the e-mails that you

         24   reviewed yesterday to prepare for the deposition, it in --

         25   there was around 20 or 30.  A lot of it was communications

                                                                       22



          1   between and among your lawyers and yourself and the other

          2   named plaintiffs; is that correct?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   Did you have any e-mails with the other named

          5   plaintiffs that didn't have your lawyers on them, that you

          6   reviewed?

          7        A.   No.

          8        Q.   How did the e-mails that you reviewed help you

          9   prepare for this deposition?

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

         11                  Just I'll ask you not to reveal the content

         12   of any e-mails with counsel.  But as long as you're able

         13   to answer the question with that in mind, go ahead.

         14        A.   What's the question again?

         15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   How did your review of the

         16   e-mails yesterday help you prepare for this deposition?

         17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same --

         18        A.   Well --

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.  Keep that in

         20   mind --

         21        A.   Just --

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- to the extent that you can

         23   answer, go ahead.

         24        A.   It helped refresh my memory a bit.

         25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What did it help you refresh

                                                                       23



          1   your memory about?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.  Keep that in

          3   mind.  Go ahead.

          4        A.   The -- basically, the correspondence that we had

          5   throughout the several months, we tend to forget some of

          6   it, and it refreshed my memory.  And I said, oh, yeah, I

          7   remember that.  Matter of fact, I even remembered that I

          8   was in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time when I was reading

          9   it.

         10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What are you referring

         11   to when you say "it"?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  And again, I'll ask you not to

         13   divulge communications with attorneys.

         14                  THE WITNESS:  No, we don't need to.  Okay.

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  So if you can answer that

         16   without doing that, you can -- you can go ahead.

         17        A.   What was the question again?

         18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Sure.

         19                  You said -- basically, I had asked you how

         20   did it help -- what did it refresh your recollection, and

         21   you said that you reviewed the correspondence, and that

         22   over the past several months you kind of tend to --

         23        A.   Right, it --

         24        Q.   -- forget it.  And then you said, for example, I

         25   remembered that I was in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time

                                                                       24



          1   when I was reading it.  And I asked you what was it --

          2        A.   Yeah, it was a particular document that I had to

          3   read.  And I don't remember which document it was, as far

          4   as the title goes.  It was a document that I had to read

          5   and give approval to.

          6        Q.   Okay.  Is there anything else that you can tell

          7   me about --

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   -- that specifically refreshed your recollection

         10   based on your review yesterday?

         11        A.   No.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Now, you mentioned these work-in-progress

         13   documents; what were those?

         14        A.   It's --

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  And same objections about not

         16   revealing the contents of things and communications with

         17   us.

         18        A.   Right --

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  If you can answer that then --

         20        A.   You would have to produce the document so I can

         21   look at it.

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Well, why don't you explain to

         23   me what the document is?

         24        A.   So --

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same.

                                                                       25



          1        A.   That's why I need to see the document.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You reviewed the document

          3   yesterday, correct?

          4        A.   Yeah, but --

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   There were --

          7        Q.   Let me finish my question.

          8        A.   Okay.

          9        Q.   Sorry.  I don't want us to talk over one

         10   another.

         11        A.   Sure.

         12        Q.   So I think you reviewed the work-in-progress

         13   documents yesterday.  I'm just asking you, generally, can

         14   you tell me kind of what they were?

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.

         16        A.   So --

         17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.

         18        A.   Yeah.  I'd like to look at the document.  I'd

         19   like to -- there's many, many documents that I looked at,

         20   and it wasn't just yesterday; it was throughout several

         21   months.  There's many documents.  So this is not my

         22   particular line of expertise.  So it's -- I would have to

         23   actually see the document to -- what you're referring to.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What isn't your

         25   particular line of expertise?

                                                                       26



          1        A.   This right -- this right here is not my

          2   particular line of expertise, as far as depositions go.

          3        Q.   Yeah.  And the only thing -- you know, I'm

          4   just -- again, I'm just asking you questions.  Your job is

          5   to answer them truthfully.  If anything is unclear, you

          6   can, obviously, let me know.  So I don't -- that's the

          7   basic kind of ground rules.

          8                  And I think -- I'm just asking you -- so

          9   you've mentioned that you've reviewed these

         10   work-in-progress documents yesterday.  All I'm asking for

         11   is your recollection, even at a high level, of what those

         12   documents were?

         13                  MR. KNOTTS:  And he's asked this --

         14   answered this question multiple times, Counsel.

         15                  And to the extent that you can add anything

         16   to your previous answers, go ahead.  But I'll also ask you

         17   not to reveal any communications --

         18        A.   Well, I've asked to see the documents, and they

         19   haven't been produced.

         20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you say, They haven't been

         21   produced, what do you mean?

         22        A.   I'm asking to see the documents so I can get

         23   another refreshing look at it.  But I did review several

         24   documents.  I remember the title of those particular

         25   documents, okay, and it basically reviewed the case.

                                                                       27



          1        Q.   Okay.  Did the work-in-progress documents

          2   refresh your recollection?

          3        A.   Yeah, to -- somewhat it did, but there's a lot

          4   of legal terminology in there as well.

          5        Q.   And can you tell me how it helped -- how the

          6   work-in-progress documents helped refresh your

          7   recollection?

          8                  MR. KNOTTS:  You've asked this question two

          9   or three times now, Counsel.

         10                  To the extent you have anything else to

         11   add, go ahead.

         12        A.   No, I don't.  I have nothing else to add.

         13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I think you previously

         14   answered the question about how the e-mails helped refresh

         15   your recollection; now I'm asking you specifically about

         16   the work-in-progress document?

         17                  MR. KNOTTS:  You've already asked.

         18        A.   I've already answered the question.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So is your answer that it did

         20   help refresh your recollection, but you can't give any

         21   more explanation --

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   -- how it refreshed your recollection?

         24        A.   Yes.

         25        Q.   Okay.  But it would help to see the document?

                                                                       28



          1        A.   Yeah.  I can...

          2        Q.   So the other -- so that's the first two kind of

          3   categories of documents that you mentioned.

          4                  The third one, I think, was financial

          5   statements?

          6        A.   Yes.

          7        Q.   Okay.  What -- what were you referring to there?

          8        A.   My Ameritrade financial statements, in which

          9   I -- there's three accounts that I have had purchased Rite

         10   Aid stock under.

         11        Q.   Any other financial statements?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   And roughly how many of the Ameritrade

         14   statements did you review?

         15        A.   Several.  But there was a pile of them.  They

         16   all basically said the same thing.  It was just going

         17   through different waters.  But I hadn't sold any stock, so

         18   if there was 1,000 shares on one, it was 1,000 shares on

         19   the next and 1,000 shares on the next, because I hadn't

         20   sold anything.  But I -- there was -- reviewed my -- my

         21   main Ameritrade account, my Roth Ameritrade account, and

         22   my IRA Ameritrade account, all of which have Rite Aid

         23   stock in it.

         24        Q.   And so did you review the monthly statements for

         25   each of those three accounts?

                                                                       29



          1        A.   So I reviewed the monthly statements for one

          2   account, and I can't remember if it was all the accounts.

          3   I know for sure it was the main account, and then also the

          4   IRA.  I can't remember if it was the Roth as well.

          5        Q.   And what was the time frame of the statements

          6   that you reviewed, meaning for which months or years had

          7   they been issued?

          8        A.   They went over a very wide period, but

          9   primarily -- well, it was primarily from -- from October

         10   2016 to June 2017.

         11        Q.   Did you review any outside of that time period?

         12        A.   I don't remember reviewing any outside, not with

         13   my attorney.  I reviewed it on my own.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And based on your recollection of the

         15   documents you reviewed yesterday, you said there was no

         16   sales of -- you made no sales of Rite Aid stock?

         17        A.   No, I have not.

         18        Q.   Is that during just that period or --

         19        A.   Totally.

         20        Q.   Totally.  So you've never sold any Rite Aid

         21   stock?

         22        A.   To my knowledge, I have never sold any Rite Aid

         23   stock.

         24        Q.   And how many purchases did you make of Rite Aid

         25   stock based on what you reviewed yesterday?

                                                                       30



          1        A.   A lot.

          2        Q.   Okay.

          3        A.   I mean, how many times did I purchase Rite Aid

          4   stock; probably seven, eight times.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   I have a list of it, but I'm just guessing seven

          7   or eight times.  There's -- you have to realize, I

          8   have -- I own about 60 or 70 stocks, so sometimes it all

          9   blends in.

         10        Q.   When you say, Sometimes it all blends in, what

         11   do you mean?

         12        A.   Well, I mean, it's going back so far.  I think

         13   my first purchase might have been around 2013.  Okay.  And

         14   my last purchase, I believe, it was 2017.  So, over time

         15   you forget.  But, I mean, I have an Excel spreadsheet with

         16   the Rite Aid stock purchases and, to my recollection, it

         17   was seven or eight purchases.

         18        Q.   So when you earlier said, I have a list of it,

         19   were you referring to that Excel spreadsheet?

         20        A.   Yes, of the RAD stock.

         21        Q.   Okay.  When did you create that document?

         22        A.   I created that document a couple of years ago.

         23        Q.   Okay.  And did you update it over time if your

         24   transactions in RAD changed?

         25        A.   I didn't have to update it, because after 2017,

                                                                       31



          1   I never purchased any RAD stock again.

          2        Q.   Between the time period that you mentioned, 2013

          3   and 2017, was it something that you updated during that

          4   time frame, to the extent that you made additional

          5   transactions in Rite Aid stock?

          6        A.   Well, I have a -- no, I did not have to update

          7   anything, because I -- I go on my Ameritrade account and I

          8   look at the transactions.  Okay.  I was -- this was put

          9   together under the -- I was asked to by my attorney.

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  So then -- so given that this

         11   document was prepared at the request of attorneys, it

         12   sounds like in connection with litigation --

         13                  THE WITNESS:  It was.

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.  So with that in mind,

         15   go forward.

         16                  MS. ZALKA:  That's okay.

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  And let me just ask you:

         18   So when did you create it?

         19        A.   When did I create it?  I can't give you a date

         20   when I created it.  I would have to look at the e-mail

         21   exchanges, because I know I e-mailed it to the attorneys.

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  And then so now we're getting

         23   into communications with attorneys.  So, again, I'll ask

         24   you not to divulge communications with attorneys.

         25                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

                                                                       32



          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Yeah.  And I'm just asking you

          2   if you have -- you may not have a specific date

          3   recollection, but just, generally, when did you create it,

          4   like month or year?

          5        A.   I think it was like three years ago.  Maybe

          6   two-and-a-half years ago.  It was a while ago that I

          7   created that document.

          8        Q.   Okay.  And it was created at the request of your

          9   attorney?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   Okay.  You mentioned the three Ameritrade

         12   accounts.  Just to confirm, were they the only three

         13   accounts that you ever held or transacted in Rite Aid

         14   stock?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   Okay.  Do you have any other investment

         17   accounts, other than the three Ameritrade accounts you

         18   just identified?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   Okay.  How many others?

         21        A.   I have my 401(k).

         22        Q.   Beyond that?

         23        A.   Well, other than checking and various savings

         24   accounts.

         25        Q.   Yeah.  Anything that you hold securities in, put

                                                                       33



          1   it that way.

          2        A.   No, just my 401(k).  And that's through John

          3   Hancock.

          4        Q.   And you don't have trading discretion in your

          5   401(k) account; how is it structured?

          6        A.   I have brokerage capability.

          7        Q.   Okay.  Do you exercise that brokerage

          8   capability?

          9        A.   I do.

         10        Q.   Have you ever transacted in Rite Aid stock in

         11   your 401(k)?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   Have you ever transacted in Walgreens stock in

         14   your 401(k)?

         15        A.   No, no.

         16        Q.   Have you ever transacted in Fred's stock in your

         17   401(k)?

         18        A.   No.  Definitely not.

         19        Q.   Why do you say "definitely not" to that?

         20        A.   I read the papers and it had -- had a little

         21   misfortune yesterday or the day before.

         22        Q.   Okay.  So going back to your preparation for the

         23   deposition.  So in terms of the financial statements that

         24   you reviewed, it was just for the three Ameritrade

         25   accounts, correct?

                                                                       34



          1        A.   Yes.

          2        Q.   And did you review any public disclosures?

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  And again, objection to the

          4   extent it calls for work product on -- on things that we

          5   may have given him during preparation.

          6        A.   No.

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  But you can answer.

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   No?

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Did anyone other than your lawyers attend

         12   your prep session?

         13        A.   No.

         14        Q.   How long did that last?

         15        A.   Approximately two-and-a-half, three hours.

         16        Q.   Okay.  Outside of the meeting, did you do

         17   anything to prepare for the deposition, or review any

         18   other documents than what you've already identified?

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll, I guess, instruct

         20   you not to answer on documents that we selected or sent to

         21   you.

         22        A.   Over time I had -- I had gone back to some of my

         23   previous e-mails and looked at documents.  That's it.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Um --

         25        A.   Prior to yesterday's review.

                                                                       35



          1        Q.   What were the e-mails that you reviewed?

          2        A.   Those were e-mails where my attorney had an

          3   attachment and sent the document to me.  I didn't --

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  So then don't go beyond that.

          5                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  That's all I'm saying.

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  All right.

          7        A.   I'm not -- and -- yeah, that's basically it.

          8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

          9        A.   And I didn't look at all of them.  I just looked

         10   at a couple of them.

         11        Q.   But it was exclusively, it sounds like, I just

         12   want to confirm, e-mails to and among you and your

         13   attorneys?

         14        A.   Correct.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Have you discussed today's deposition

         16   with anyone, outside of your lawyers?

         17        A.   No.

         18        Q.   Have you discussed today's deposition with any

         19   of the other named plaintiffs?

         20        A.   No.

         21        Q.   When was the first time you met or spoke with,

         22   communicated with any of the named plaintiffs?

         23        A.   I don't know.  That would be about a year ago,

         24   when the documents started being sent out from the

         25   attorney.

                                                                       36



          1        Q.   So you have no prior relationship, outside of

          2   the context of this lawsuit, with any of the other named

          3   plaintiffs?

          4        A.   No, I do not.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever considered being a

          6   plaintiff in a lawsuit before, other than this one?

          7        A.   No.

          8        Q.   No?

          9                  Have you ever had any communications about

         10   potentially appearing as a plaintiff in a lawsuit?

         11        A.   Not to my knowledge.

         12        Q.   Outside of this lawsuit, have you ever

         13   had -- have you ever considered suing anybody or anybody

         14   -- any company?

         15        A.   Not outside of this.

         16        Q.   And by outside this lawsuit, I'm referring to

         17   the caption Chabot versus Walgreens.

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   You understood that?

         20        A.   Yes, I understood that.

         21        Q.   Okay.  Other than with your lawyers, have you

         22   had any communications with anybody concerning your claims

         23   in this lawsuit?

         24        A.   Well, I just -- I had one -- just one e-mail

         25   to my -- just to my mother.

                                                                       37



          1        Q.   Okay.  Outside of one e-mail to your mother,

          2   have you had any other communications with anybody

          3   concerning this lawsuit?

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Have you sent any other e-mails, other than the

          6   e-mail that you sent to your mother, concerning your

          7   claims in this lawsuit?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   What about the subject matter of the claims, so

         10   relating more generally -- let me put it this way:  Have

         11   you had any communications concerning the Walgreens and

         12   Rite Aid merger?

         13        A.   Not to my knowledge.

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  You mean other -- other than

         15   with attorneys?

         16                  MS. ZALKA:  Correct.

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm not asking you for --

         18   that's a fair clarification.

         19                  I'm not asking you about communications

         20   with your attorneys.  My questions are geared towards

         21   outside of communications with your lawyers --

         22        A.   No.

         23        Q.   -- have you ever had any communications with

         24   anybody concerning the subject matter of this lawsuit?

         25        A.   Not to my knowledge.

                                                                       38



          1        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever -- and just so the record

          2   is clear.  Have you had any communications, outside of

          3   communications with your attorneys, concerning the

          4   Walgreens and Rite Aid merger?

          5        A.   Not to my knowledge.  I just pretty much kept to

          6   myself on this.

          7        Q.   And what do you mean pretty much kept to

          8   yourself on this?

          9        A.   Well, there's no need to send any communications

         10   about that.

         11        Q.   Why not?

         12        A.   I don't -- I don't need to.  And, you know,

         13   people don't have to know my business either, as far as,

         14   you know, what I'm going through, how many stocks I own.

         15   So there's just no need for me to communicate with

         16   anybody.

         17        Q.   Okay.

         18        A.   I mean, I don't communicate with anybody on

         19   stocks hardly at all.  I mean, you know, my brother once

         20   in a while says, hey, you should buy this stock or you

         21   should buy that stock, and I just blow him off.

         22        Q.   People's families are complicated.  No, kidding.

         23                  In terms of -- do you have anybody that

         24   you've got any financial advice from?

         25        A.   No, I don't -- I take care of my own portfolios.

                                                                       39



          1        Q.   So even outside of kind of a formal engagement,

          2   like so outside of kind of formally retaining a financial

          3   advisor to help you manage your portfolio, is there

          4   anybody on an informal basis that you tend to consult with

          5   respect to financial advice?

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.  But go

          7   ahead.

          8        A.   I handle my own portfolio.  So the answer is no;

          9   no, I don't speak to anybody about what to buy or what

         10   to -- you know, never.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  I'm going to shift gears

         12   a little bit.  I want to talk about just generally

         13   document retention.

         14        A.   Uh-huh.

         15        Q.   Do you have a practice around retaining

         16   documents?

         17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

         18        A.   No.  As far as -- are you referring to the

         19   e-mails?

         20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So we can talk about it in

         21   general.  So let's start with e-mails.  Like, do you

         22   generally save all of your e-mails?

         23        A.   I hardly ever delete my e-mails; they just go on

         24   and on and on.

         25        Q.   I'm the same.

                                                                       40



          1                  Okay.  What about any other types of

          2   documents?

          3        A.   Yeah.  I don't save financial documents.  I

          4   don't save documents relating to stock.  All I do is if I

          5   go into my Ameritrade account and the various stocks that

          6   I own, I will read the news, what's going on with the

          7   company regarding the news.  Once in a blue moon, I might

          8   read a financial statement.  But if I do, I just open it

          9   up, but I don't save it.

         10        Q.   Beyond reading the news and once in a blue moon

         11   reading a financial statement, are there any other sources

         12   that you use in connection with deciding to transact in or

         13   hold stock?

         14        A.   No.  I -- I primarily use my Ameritrade account

         15   to do any research on -- on stocks and reading the various

         16   documents through Ameritrade.

         17                  Once in a while I may go to the Yahoo

         18   website, because if I click on something on Ameritrade,

         19   it'll take me to another website.  But that's it.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Can you explain to me how you access kind

         21   of research or information on your Ameritrade account?

         22   Kind of because you keep on saying I go into Ameritrade,

         23   but I don't know what that means.

         24                  So I'm trying to understand, essentially,

         25   what sources of information that you might have had --

                                                                       41



          1   that you did have access to through your Ameritrade

          2   accounts?

          3        A.   Well, like I mentioned, sometimes I will look at

          4   the financial statement.  But primarily I look at the

          5   news, okay, on a particular company.  If I own a stock and

          6   the stock is going up, I'm interested why is it going up,

          7   or if the stock is going down, I'm interested in why is it

          8   going down today?  Is there anything in the news about it?

          9   It's just a common sense thing to do.

         10                  And then, you know, I also look to see, you

         11   know, how many -- you know, is the stock a buy, is it a

         12   hold, is it a sell?  That information is also available on

         13   the Ameritrade.

         14        Q.   And in your Ameritrade account, it has kind of

         15   recommendations, buy/hold/sell, and a research report that

         16   goes along with it.

         17                  Is that what you're describing?

         18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.  But go

         19   ahead.

         20        A.   Yes, they have the research reports.  And I

         21   rarely look at them; I just don't have time.

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you recall reading any

         23   research reports regarding Walgreens?

         24        A.   No, all my Walgreens information came from news

         25   articles.

                                                                       42



          1        Q.   Okay.  Do you recall reading any research

          2   reports concerning Rite Aid?

          3        A.   Everything that I -- my knowledge was all from

          4   news articles.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Same question with respect to Fred's:  Do

          6   you recall reading any research reports regarding Fred's?

          7        A.   No.  Again, just reading the news articles.

          8        Q.   And the news articles that you read concerning

          9   Walgreens, are you Googling or are those like available

         10   through Ameritrade?

         11        A.   Those are available through Ameritrade.

         12        Q.   Is that a curated set of information?

         13        A.   What do you mean by that?

         14        Q.   Fair.

         15                  So what I mean is on -- sounds like on the

         16   Ameritrade platform, you log on -- you first log on --

         17   let's do it this way.

         18                  You log on to Ameritrade, correct?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   And then I assume you have account statements

         21   somewhere that are available?

         22        A.   Right.

         23        Q.   And then how do you get to the news information

         24   that you've been referring to in responding to my

         25   questions?

                                                                       43



          1        A.   Okay.  It's just there on the screen, as part of

          2   the desktop.  If I go into that particular account and I

          3   click on a particular symbol, stock symbol, okay, the news

          4   is right at the bottom.  And I can select to read whatever

          5   news I want to based on that particular stock.

          6        Q.   So to take Rite Aid as an example.  So let's say

          7   you have a holding in Rite Aid in your Ameritrade account,

          8   right, 1,000 shares.  You click on the RAD symbol, and

          9   then it comes up with information and news about Rite Aid?

         10        A.   Correct.

         11        Q.   Did you save that information?

         12        A.   Never.

         13        Q.   Never.  How frequently did you access that

         14   information concerning Rite Aid?

         15        A.   Well, I accessed it very frequently during the

         16   initial announcement that there would be a merger between

         17   Rite Aid and Walgreens at $9 a share, because it -- you

         18   know, I thought it was a halfway decent price.  So I was

         19   interested, and so I did read it, and frequently.

         20        Q.   When was the last time you accessed it?

         21        A.   Last time I accessed it?  Well, even on my phone

         22   here, you know, if you have an Apple phone, there's a

         23   stock thing that you can click on and, you know, RAD is --

         24   and Walgreens is programmed into my phone.

         25                  So, I mean, I go and I look at my stock

                                                                       44



          1   portfolio.  So all the stocks I own is programmed into the

          2   phone.  So I'll go there every day, and I'll go through

          3   and look.  And then if something interests me, then I'll

          4   click on it.  So, you know, I mean, I read -- that's --

          5   that's how I knew about Fred's, okay, I -- I was going

          6   through the app on my phone and I was looking at Rite Aid

          7   stock, because it actually started going up in the last

          8   week or so, and there was news on there that Fred is

          9   closing stores and filing for Chapter 11.

         10        Q.   In terms of when you say the app on your phone,

         11   are you referring to the Ameritrade app --

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   -- or something else?

         14        A.   Something else.

         15        Q.   Okay.  So let's first just stick with

         16   Ameritrade.

         17        A.   Okay.

         18        Q.   Let's take this methodically.

         19        A.   Sure.

         20        Q.   With respect to the information that you

         21   referenced in your Ameritrade account, you mentioned that

         22   you could click on a symbol and it would come up with, you

         23   know, information and news about that security or the

         24   company that issued it, correct?

         25        A.   Right.

                                                                       45



          1        Q.   Okay.  And when was the last time you accessed

          2   information concerning Rite Aid through --

          3        A.   Through Ameritrade?

          4        Q.   -- that mechanism?

          5        A.   Through Ameritrade?

          6        Q.   Yes.

          7        A.   Okay.  It's been a while, because I -- a month?

          8   I don't know.  A month.  Because it's more convenient for

          9   me to use this app on my phone.

         10        Q.   Okay.  And with respect to the Ameritrade

         11   account, have -- on average, between 2016 and last month,

         12   when you recall last accessing it, how frequently did you

         13   use the kind of -- the Ameritrade account to access

         14   information concerning Rite Aid?

         15        A.   2016?  Well, I mean, at the beginning of 2016, I

         16   was using it frequently.  And then after the merger didn't

         17   happen, it became less and less I was using the app.  I

         18   don't know how many times.

         19        Q.   Did you save any of the information that you

         20   accessed concerning Rite Aid on the Ameritrade app?

         21        A.   I never save the information.

         22        Q.   Okay.

         23        A.   Because if I needed it, I can always get it

         24   again, and it just clutters up my hard drive.

         25        Q.   If you needed to get it today, how would you do

                                                                       46



          1   it?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

          3                  To the extent that you can understand the

          4   question, you can answer.

          5        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Sure, I can -- did you

          6   understand my question?

          7        A.   Yeah.  I would just do a search online, either

          8   through my Ameritrade account or I'll Google it.

          9        Q.   And through your Ameritrade account, does it

         10   retain the information historically that you've accessed?

         11        A.   The -- if you're referring to the articles that

         12   I read --

         13        Q.   Yes.

         14        A.   -- yes, they go -- they're historically

         15   correlated.

         16        Q.   Okay.  And you can just go on your app and pull

         17   those?

         18        A.   I can go onto the app and I can pull them, but

         19   there is -- there is a cutoff date.  It doesn't go on

         20   forever.  You know, I might be able to go back for three

         21   months, but then after that, I can't get -- I can't get it

         22   anymore.  If I wanted a particular article, I'd have to

         23   Google it.

         24        Q.   What about your account statements on

         25   the -- your Ameritrade statements, can you access those

                                                                       47



          1   for every month since the beginning of the account?

          2        A.   I can, but I don't.

          3        Q.   But those -- your monthly account statements,

          4   both current and historical, are available to you through

          5   the Ameritrade kind of log-in?

          6        A.   Yes.  I -- I went to paperless, so everything is

          7   soft copy.

          8        Q.   Do you have a separate file or folder where you

          9   save all of your monthly statements?

         10        A.   No, I do not, because I know they're online and

         11   I can get them anytime.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Beyond e-mail, you said you generally

         13   don't -- you generally save all of your e-mail, correct?

         14        A.   Yeah.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Do you -- are there any other categories

         16   of documents, other than e-mail, that it's your practice

         17   to retain in the ordinary course?

         18        A.   No.

         19        Q.   Do you use text messages to communicate --

         20        A.   Yes.

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Period or about?

         22                  MS. ZALKA:  I was going to finish the

         23   sentence, but you answered.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Have you used text messages to

         25   communicate about Walgreens or Rite Aid?

                                                                       48



          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Okay.  About the lawsuit?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   Okay.  Do you have any hard copy documents or

          5   notes concerning Walgreens or Rite Aid?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   What steps have you taken to preserve documents

          8   for purposes of this litigation?

          9        A.   I haven't -- it's just my nature not to delete

         10   documents, so automatically I know they're preserved,

         11   because I'm not in the habit of deleting documents.

         12        Q.   What steps did you take to preserve the articles

         13   and information that you accessed through Ameritrade?

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

         15                  THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry; I didn't get your

         16   answer.

         17        A.   I don't save those.  I mentioned that several

         18   times.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So just to be -- you did not

         20   take any action to save or retain the information that you

         21   accessed concerning Walgreens or Rite Aid through the

         22   Ameritrade platform?

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Just objection to form, and to

         24   the extent it's even possible to retain those things.

         25        A.   So, no, I have not.

                                                                       49



          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   If you want to, can you print

          2   out from the Ameritrade platform?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   So, for example, if you had -- if you accessed

          5   one of the articles or the reports that you mentioned, you

          6   could -- through the Ameritrade platform, you could print

          7   that?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   At any point did you take any steps to print any

         10   of the information or reports that you accessed concerning

         11   Walgreens or Rite Aid?

         12        A.   No.  It would just clutter up -- I'm not a big

         13   person -- I'm not a big hard copy person.

         14        Q.   So I asked you what steps did you take to

         15   preserve documents for purposes of this litigation, and

         16   your response was it's just my nature not to delete

         17   documents, so automatically I know they're preserved,

         18   because I'm not in the habit of deleting documents.

         19                  Do you recall that?

         20        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   So, are there any steps that you took, other

         22   than relying on your general nature, to preserve documents

         23   for purposes of this litigation?

         24        A.   No, because I know that -- I know the

         25   information is obtainable if anybody needs to obtain it.

                                                                       50



          1        Q.   Now, you mentioned there was a cutoff date for

          2   three months for certain articles in Ameritrade; is that

          3   correct?

          4        A.   I'm just guessing, because there's been --

          5   there's been times, and it's not necessarily -- it's not

          6   necessarily Rite Aid or Walgreens, but it might be some

          7   other stock I'm interested in, and I wanted to go back and

          8   reread an article that I saw and that article wasn't there

          9   anymore.  And I couldn't get access to it, so I would have

         10   to Google -- if I remember the title of the document, I

         11   would have to Google it.

         12        Q.   Have you destroyed any documents concerning

         13   Walgreens or Rite Aid since 2016?

         14        A.   No.

         15        Q.   Have you destroyed any documents concerning your

         16   transactions in Walgreens or Rite Aid since 2016?

         17        A.   Regarding my transactions?

         18        Q.   Uh-huh.

         19        A.   I don't know; that's an odd question.  Destroy

         20   any documents regarding my transactions.  You know, I

         21   might have shredded one of my statements, which I'm

         22   allowed to do.

         23        Q.   Other than potentially shredding --

         24        A.   You know, because the --

         25        Q.   Go ahead.

                                                                       51



          1        A.   You know, obviously, you know, you don't want

          2   identity theft, so I shred all of my mail.  Again, if I --

          3   but -- but I never print the documents out to begin with,

          4   so -- now, I used to get -- before I went paperless, I

          5   used to get the documents mailed to me.  That -- I'm not

          6   sure if it was monthly or quarterly statements.  It got to

          7   the point where I had piles and piles and piles of it.

          8                  So before I went paperless, yes, I had

          9   destroyed my statements, because I put them through the

         10   shredder.

         11        Q.   When did you go paperless?

         12        A.   Quite a while ago.  A lot -- when did I go

         13   paperless?  Probably about five or six years ago.

         14        Q.   Okay.

         15        A.   Because I ended up having -- you know, I had a

         16   stack like this.  It was ridiculous.

         17        Q.   So sitting here today, just so we're clear,

         18   you're not aware of any documents that you destroyed since

         19   2016 concerning Walgreens or Rite Aid?

         20        A.   Yes, I'm not -- I'm not aware of that.

         21        Q.   Okay.

         22                  MS. ZALKA:  Let's mark the RFP.

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  And we've been going for about

         24   an hour --

         25                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure.

                                                                       52



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- whenever -- if we want to

          2   take a break now, if this is a good stopping point.

          3                  MS. ZALKA:  We could get through the

          4   RF -- I'm happy to take a break now if you'd like to take

          5   a break.

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  It's up to you.

          7                  THE WITNESS:  Let's go.

          8                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

          9                  MS. ZALKA:  We can take a break very

         10   shortly.

         11        A.   What's an RFP?

         12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   It's a -- it is a lawyer

         13   shorthand for request for production.  I'm about to show

         14   it to you.

         15        A.   In my area, it's a request for proposal.

         16        Q.   I know, yeah.

         17                  MR. KNOTTS:  I don't think she has any of

         18   those.

         19                  MS. ZALKA:  I do not.  I have many more

         20   RFPs that are for production.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I think I may have just

         22   given the game away.  But take a moment.  This has been

         23   marked as Exhibit 18.

         24                  (Exhibit 18 marked.)

         25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And you can just let me know

                                                                       53



          1   when you're ready.

          2        A.   Okay.

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  18 is in there?

          4                  MS. ZALKA:  I think we premarked all of

          5   them.

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

          7        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

          8                  Okay.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you recognize this document?

         10        A.   I think I recognize this document.

         11        Q.   What is it?

         12        A.   Basically, it has to do with the retention of

         13   documents relating to the -- the case.  And let's see.

         14                  Yeah.  And that's -- that's what a lot of

         15   it has to do with.

         16        Q.   And, again, I'm sure Mr. Knotts will jump in.

         17   I'm not asking you for any communications that you had

         18   with your lawyers concerning this document.  I just want

         19   to know what steps did you take to collect documents that

         20   were requested for production?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  You can -- I think you can

         22   answer that generally.

         23        A.   Okay.  I -- I had -- I collected my financial

         24   statements, okay, through Ameritrade.  And that was for

         25   the class action period, October 2016 to June 2017.  I

                                                                       54



          1   went online trying to gather the documents.  It started

          2   getting really difficult, because I happened to go back

          3   and do the searching such a long time ago, so I had

          4   requested Ameritrade for assistance with the search of the

          5   documents, and they sent me all -- several of the

          6   documents.  And -- except for one account, which I later

          7   obtained.

          8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I'll come back to that.

          9   First, so other than the effort you just described with

         10   respect to your Ameritrade financial statements, what

         11   steps did you take to collect the documents that are

         12   requested for production?

         13                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.  Asked and answered.  So

         14   again --

         15        A.   Well, I --

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is it anything other than the

         17   Ameritrade financial statements?

         18        A.   No.  That's it.

         19        Q.   Okay.

         20        A.   And -- and -- and leave my e-mail intact.

         21        Q.   When you say you leave your e-mail intact --

         22        A.   To leave my e-mail intact, and don't delete

         23   anything.

         24        Q.   I see.

         25        A.   I'm sort of familiar with that process, because

                                                                       55



          1   in my line of work it happens all the time with patents.

          2        Q.   So you've identified two other steps that you

          3   took in order to respond to the document request that's

          4   been marked as Exhibit 18.

          5                  The first is you collected financial

          6   statements through Ameritrade, and the second is that you

          7   left your e-mails intact.

          8        A.   Yes.  And that was -- and I was asked to do that

          9   by my attorney.

         10        Q.   Okay.  Other than those two items, did you do

         11   anything else to respond to the documents that are

         12   requested here?

         13        A.   Not to my knowledge.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Let's talk about the -- the Ameritrade

         15   financial statements collection.

         16                  You mentioned that the time period that you

         17   used was October 2016 through June 2017.  Is that

         18   accurate?

         19        A.   That was what the information that I gathered is

         20   over that period.

         21        Q.   Did you collect any financial statements between

         22   October 1, 2015, and October 1, 2016?

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  As best as you can recall.

         24   And you may have documents on this, Counsel.

         25        A.   I may have.

                                                                       56



          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

          2        A.   I can't -- I can't answer the -- 100 percent I

          3   can't answer it, but, you know, I may have gone over or

          4   under.

          5        Q.   Why don't we approach it this way then:  What

          6   was your understanding of the time period for which you

          7   should be collecting the requested Ameritrade financial

          8   statements?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

         10   calls for attorney/client privileged information.

         11                  So if you can answer, other than things

         12   that we have discussed, you can.  But if it involves

         13   things that we discussed, I'll instruct you not to answer.

         14        A.   Well, just that -- that's the time period of the

         15   suit.  And so that's all that I should be interested in.

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I want to understand

         17   whether -- so let me ask it this way.

         18                  When you requested the -- your monthly

         19   financial statements from Ameritrade, did you request them

         20   for a specific time period?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   What was that time period?

         23        A.   I believe it was the time period of October 2016

         24   to June 2017.

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  And -- so I -- I will -- and

                                                                       57



          1   we can clarify.  I think the witness may be

          2   misremembering --

          3        A.   No, no, actually, it may have gone back.  It may

          4   have gone back to -- to maybe the first time I purchased

          5   the Rite Aid stock, it might have gone back to, now that

          6   I'm thinking about it.  I'd have to see the e-mail I sent

          7   to Ameritrade.

          8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

          9        A.   There were a lot of files.  Yeah, there were so

         10   many files that it was probably beyond that period that I

         11   said.  It was probably -- it could have been gone back to

         12   the first time I purchased Rite Aid stock, now that I

         13   think about it.

         14        Q.   Is it possible that it could also have gone past

         15   June 2017?

         16        A.   It's possible.

         17        Q.   Okay.  And so you mentioned just now that given

         18   the -- essentially, the number of the documents, the

         19   volume of the documents, you think it might have been for

         20   a longer time period going back --

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   -- to the original Rite Aid transactions?

         23        A.   Yeah.  There were a lot of them.

         24        Q.   Ballpark, roughly how many, do you think?

         25        A.   Geez, 30.

                                                                       58



          1        Q.   For each account or total?

          2        A.   Total.

          3        Q.   Outside of your monthly statements, and outside

          4   of -- outside of the information or research or analysis

          5   that you get when you click on the CUSIP symbol, is there

          6   any other information that's available to you within the

          7   Ameritrade website or app, whatever you want to say, that

          8   you access concerning either Walgreens or Rite Aid?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  And objection to the extent it

         10   mischaracterizes his testimony about whether all of that

         11   information is available to him.

         12                  But you can answer.

         13        A.   Oh, I mean, there's -- there's -- there's

         14   different tabs you can click on, but I don't always -- I

         15   don't click on those a lot; where you can gather more

         16   information on the company and, you know, the -- including

         17   the financial statements of the company.  But I hardly

         18   ever click on it.

         19                  It also tells you who the various officers

         20   of the company.  You can -- there's a tab I think you can

         21   click on for that.  It doesn't give you, to my knowledge,

         22   any insider information.  I wish it did.

         23                  But, you know, there's an

         24   additional -- it's just like any other brokerage account,

         25   okay.  It gives you additional information on a particular

                                                                       59



          1   company.

          2                  I don't use it a lot, though.  I --

          3   I'm mainly -- I mainly read the news about the company.

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Between 2016 -- between October

          5   2015 and the end of 2017, do you recall ever clicking on

          6   any of the other tabs that you just mentioned, concerning

          7   the financial statements or the officers of the company --

          8        A.   I don't --

          9        Q.   -- with respect to Rite Aid or Walgreens?

         10        A.   I don't recall clicking on it.

         11        Q.   Putting aside the Ameritrade framework, do you

         12   ever recall reviewing the financial statements of

         13   Walgreens or Rite Aid in that time period?

         14        A.   I don't recall reviewing the financial

         15   statements.

         16        Q.   And do you recall reviewing any earnings calls

         17   by either Rite Aid or Walgreens in 2016 and 2017?

         18        A.   I only -- as far as that goes, I -- there's been

         19   -- there were various press releases that they talked

         20   about the earning -- earning things.

         21                  THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry; earning what?

         22                  THE WITNESS:  The earning calls; there were

         23   various press releases that talked about it from different

         24   financial agencies or news -- news casting.  Maybe

         25   Bloomberg or something like that.

          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you recall reviewing any

          2   press releases by -- issued by Rite Aid or Walgreens

          3   themselves?

          4        A.   Well, I -- one of the reasons that I held onto

          5   my stock was it gave -- yes, I do.  It gave the indication

          6   that the deal would go through and it would be smooth

          7   sailing through the Federal Trade Commission.

          8        Q.   So it's your testimony that you recall reviewing

          9   a press release issued by which company?

         10        A.   Walgreens.

         11        Q.   Okay.  So it's your testimony that you recall

         12   reviewing a press release issued by Walgreens that gave

         13   the implication that the deal would go through and that it

         14   would be smooth sailing through the Federal Trade

         15   Commission.

         16                  How many press releases?

         17        A.   There were more than one.  And, you know, the

         18   smooth sailing might have been on another press release.

         19   I do remember saying that they had inside information or

         20   they had a very -- you know, they -- they -- they've

         21   worked with the Federal Trade Commission in the past and

         22   they had inside contacts there, sort of.  I got that

         23   impression, that -- that was my interpretation.  And that

         24   they had a good relationship with the Federal Trade

         25   Commission.  And I thought that -- I interpreted several

                                                                       61



          1   of the press releases as if the deal would go through.

          2                  If I didn't, I would have sold my RAD

          3   stock.

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  And RAD is just capital R,

          5   capital A, capital D.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   How many press releases --

          7        A.   Oh, I --

          8        Q.   -- do you recall reviewing that were issued by

          9   Walgreens?

         10        A.   That's hard to say.  I can't give you that

         11   answer, how many press releases.  There was more than one.

         12        Q.   More than one and less than five?

         13        A.   Yeah.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Outside of those between one to five

         15   press releases, did you review any other disclosures

         16   by -- issued by Walgreens during 2016 and 2017?

         17        A.   No, not to -- not to that extent.  All I was

         18   doing was monitoring through the news releases how the

         19   acquisition was going.  And then come to find out that

         20   the -- I thought that they would have taken it all the way

         21   to the end, where the Federal Trade Commission would

         22   actually make a decision formally on whether or not the

         23   deal would go through; but, instead, they bailed out of it

         24   before there was even a formal decision made by the

         25   Federal Trade Commission.

                                                                       62



          1        Q.   Did you review any transcripts of earnings calls

          2   by Walgreens in 2016 and 2017?

          3        A.   I -- I read quotes in news articles based on

          4   those, but I don't remember reading anything, per se,

          5   directly from the earnings call.

          6        Q.   Okay.  Did you review any SEC filings by

          7   Walgreens in 2016 and 2017?

          8        A.   Not to my knowledge.

          9        Q.   Did you review any SEC filings by Rite Aid?

         10        A.   Not to my knowledge.

         11        Q.   Did you review any transcripts of earnings calls

         12   by Rite Aid in 2016 and 2017?

         13        A.   Not to my knowledge.

         14        Q.   So you reviewed Walgreens trans -- so you -- so

         15   sorry, correct?

         16                  Did you review news articles?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   As you -- let me strike that.

         19                  With respect to press releases, you've

         20   testified that you reviewed between one and potentially

         21   five press releases that were actually issued by Walgreens

         22   in 2016 and 2017, correct?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   Same question with respect to press releases

         25   issued by Rite Aid:  How many, if any, press releases

                                                                       63



          1   issued by Rite Aid in 2016 and 2017 did you review?

          2        A.   You know, I mean, as far as press releases, I

          3   don't know, maybe no more than five actual press releases.

          4        Q.   Okay.  Other than the press releases you just

          5   testified to that were issued by Rite Aid or Walgreens

          6   that you recall potentially reviewing in 2016 and 2017,

          7   and outside of the news articles generally that may have

          8   touched upon Walgreens and Rite Aid, are there any other

          9   sources of information or disclosures that you recall

         10   reviewing concerning Walgreens and Rite Aid in 2016 and

         11   2017?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   Did you save any of the press releases?

         14        A.   No.

         15        Q.   Would it be possible to determine which press

         16   releases you reviewed?

         17        A.   No, it's -- it would be difficult.  I mean,

         18   I -- I do remember press releases, you know, and like I

         19   said, stating that the -- they felt that the merger would

         20   go through and would be successful.

         21                  That's what I remember reading.  And if you

         22   ask me when -- what date it was, I have no idea what date

         23   it was.

         24        Q.   When you said that the press releases stated

         25   that they felt that the merger would go through and would

                                                                       64



          1   be successful, are you referring to the press release that

          2   was issued by Walgreens or a news article?

          3        A.   Walgreens.

          4        Q.   And same question with respect to Rite Aid, the

          5   between one and five press releases issued by Rite Aid

          6   that you recall reviewing, did they also state, similarly,

          7   that the merger would go through?

          8        A.   I don't remember reading anything that -- to

          9   that extent for Rite Aid, but later on I read where Rite

         10   Aid was saying that the merger may not go through.  Later

         11   on.

         12        Q.   When was that?

         13        A.   Later on in -- I don't know the date.  It was a

         14   couple of months be -- it was prior to -- I believe it was

         15   prior to when they ended up having to formulate another

         16   plan to divest the -- to go from, I think it was $9 a

         17   share to $7 a share or $6.50 a share.

         18                  It was -- they felt that they weren't going

         19   to get the approval by the Federal Trade Commission, so

         20   they lowered the expectations on -- prior to that, I

         21   thought they would get the approval.  And they were

         22   working towards getting the approval, from what I say,

         23   based on the -- Fred's was going to buy 380 of their

         24   stores, of Rite Aid stores.

         25                  So they were trying to sell some of the

                                                                       65



          1   assets, which made sense to me.  And then Fred's was also

          2   willing to take on more stores if the Federal Trade

          3   Commission came in and said, you have to sell more stores

          4   in order for this merger to go through.

          5                  And then it started looking like it wasn't

          6   going to -- may not happen, but it still gave, you

          7   know -- there was still hope and gave indication that it

          8   was still going to happen.  But I can't recall the time or

          9   the dates when I -- when I read those things.

         10        Q.   So I think you said that you recall reading

         11   where Rite Aid was saying that the merger may not go

         12   through.

         13                  Do you recall that testimony?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   Okay.  And then I think you said that that was,

         16   quote, you said, I think it was when the $9 to $7 a share,

         17   went to $6.50 a share, they didn't feel they were going to

         18   get approval by the Federal Trade Commission?

         19        A.   To my knowledge, that's when I think -- it was

         20   when I read that.

         21        Q.   Okay.

         22        A.   I could be wrong.

         23        Q.   When did you first start to think that

         24   they -- when did you first start to understand that they

         25   may not get FTC approval?

                                                                       66



          1        A.   When I read -- and don't quote me on the time or

          2   the date -- when I read a Bloomberg article.  But I

          3   was -- had hopes because Walgreens had a special

          4   relationship with the FTC, and if there was any issues,

          5   that they would formally announce that there was issues,

          6   and I don't remember seeing that.

          7        Q.   So you recall that after you read the Bloomberg

          8   article, you understood that they may not get FTC

          9   approval?

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, misstates the

         11   testimony.

         12                  Go ahead.

         13        A.   Well --

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You can answer to the extent

         15   you want to clarify.

         16        A.   Without giving up something, such as selling

         17   additional stores, things -- things of that sort, I

         18   thought -- I thought the merger was going to go through --

         19   all the way to the end.  I thought they were going to wait

         20   until there was an official announcement by the Federal

         21   Trade Commission, okay, and not formulate another plan,

         22   okay, which was Walgreens to buy, I don't know what

         23   percentage -- it was almost 50 percent of the Rite Aid

         24   stores, and thereby cutting the company in half, just

         25   about.  And I was very surprised about that.

                                                                       67



          1                  Then that's when I started really getting

          2   concerned about the stock.

          3        Q.   So you started to get really concerned about the

          4   stock when?

          5        A.   When they formulated the -- their last plan that

          6   they had, okay, which was to purchase -- I don't know the

          7   number of stores, but it was a significant amount, maybe

          8   even 50 per -- 40 or 50 percent of the Rite Aid stores.

          9   Thereby cutting Rite Aid in half, the company -- literally

         10   cutting it in half.  And then without shareholder

         11   approval.

         12                  And I'm not quite sure how that happened.

         13   It cut a company in half, but the shareholders don't have

         14   a chance to vote on it.

         15        Q.   What's your experience in connection with FTC's

         16   review of proposed mergers?

         17        A.   I have very little.  The only experience I have

         18   is listening to Bloomberg radio on XM Satellite.  I know

         19   enough to be dangerous.

         20        Q.   Okay.

         21                  MS. ZALKA:  We can take a break now if you

         22   want.

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Works for me.

         24                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  Do you want to just take

         25   10 minutes --

                                                                       68



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Sure.

          2                  MS. ZALKA:  -- is that good for you?

         10   loop on the document requests, which is Exhibit 18.

         11                  Other than Ameritrade, have you contacted

         12   any other third parties regarding responding to these

         13   document requests?

         14        A.   No.

         15        Q.   Okay.  And are you aware of any documents or

         16   information regarding your investments in Rite Aid or

         17   Walgreens that you didn't provide to your counsel in

         18   response to request for production?

         19        A.   No.

         20        Q.   Are you -- did you do any search of your

         21   computer to locate documents responsive to this request?

         22        A.   No.

         23        Q.   Did you provide a copy of your computer files to

         24   counsel?

         25        A.   I did not provide a copy of my computer files.

                                                                       69



          1        Q.   Are you aware sitting here today of any effort

          2   to search your electronic files, other than e-mail, for

          3   documents in connection with this request?

          4        A.   No, it's only my e-mails at this point.

          5        Q.   Okay.  I am going to hand you what has been

          6   marked as Exhibits 2 through 17.  You can take a minute to

          7   look through those.

          8                  MS. ZALKA:  I'll give a copy to counsel.

          9   They're in order.

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Thanks.

         11                  (Exhibits 2 through 17 marked.)

         12        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         13                  MS. ZALKA:  I think actually if I just list

         14   the dates that correspond to each exhibit for clarity for

         15   what we're going to go through?

         16                  MR. KNOTTS:  Sure.

         17                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  So I'm just going to

         18   read into the record.

         19                  So Exhibit 2 is the Ameritrade account

         20   statement for the account ending 3791 for January 2016.

         21                  Exhibit 3 is the Americade -- Ameritrade

         22   account statement for account number 3791 for October

         23   2016.

         24                  And Exhibit 4 is the Ameritrade account

         25   statement, 3791, for November 2016.

                                                                       70



          1                  Exhibit 5 is the Ameritrade account

          2   statement, account number 3791, for December '16.

          3                  Exhibit 6 is the account statement, same

          4   account, 3791, for January 2017.

          5                  And Exhibit 7 is the same monthly account

          6   statement for February 2017.

          7                  Exhibit 8 is the same monthly account

          8   statement for March 2017.

          9                  Exhibit 9 is the same monthly account

         10   statement for April 2017.

         11                  Exhibit 10 is the monthly account statement

         12   for May 2017.

         13                  Exhibit 11 is for June 2017.

         14                  Exhibit 12 is for July 2017.

         15                  Exhibit 13 is for August 2017.

         16                  Exhibit 14 is for September 2017.

         17                  Exhibits 2 through 14 reflect the account

         18   statements for 3791 -- the account number ending in 3791.

         19        A.   Okay.

         20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is Exhibit 2 through 14 copies

         21   of your monthly account statements for your Ameritrade

         22   account ending in 3791?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   Now, you also have an account ending 6684; is

         25   that correct?

                                                                       71



          1        A.   I do.

          2        Q.   What is the difference between the 6684 account

          3   and the 3791 account?

          4        A.   Okay.  I believe the 3791 account is my main

          5   Ameritrade account, completely taxable; and the account

          6   6684 is the Roth IRA account.

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  And now that we're getting

          8   into this sort of stuff, we'll mark the transcript

          9   confidential under the protective order.

         10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   The -- if you take a look at

         11   Exhibits 15 and 16 are account statements for your 6684

         12   account; is that correct?

         13        A.   6684 -- yes, 6684.

         14        Q.   And Exhibit 15 is for January 2016?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   And Exhibit 16 is for June 2017?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Why were your monthly account statements for

         19   6684 for all the other months not produced?

         20        A.   Okay.  I had put a request through Ameritrade to

         21   gather the information for me, and I had put down the

         22   period that I needed and I put down what accounts.

         23   Evidently what they did is they didn't provide all the

         24   information.

         25        Q.   Did you do anything to check whether or not you

                                                                       72



          1   were provided all of the information that had been

          2   requested?

          3        A.   I did a quick -- I did a quick search, and there

          4   was actually one account that they left out altogether, my

          5   IRA; not my Roth IRA, but my IRA.  And that was discovered

          6   later on.

          7        Q.   All right.  Let's first focus on the Roth IRA

          8   account, the 6684.

          9                  MS. ZALKA:  Counsel, we're going to call

         10   for production of the monthly account statements that are

         11   responsive to defendant's request for production for the

         12   account 6684 for the full time period.

         13                  MR. KNOTTS:  And he just said that he

         14   produced what TD Ameritrade sent to him, so he's produced

         15   everything that he has.

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You can access these accounts

         17   on your -- like on the website or the app, correct?

         18        A.   I -- I would have -- yeah, I guess I can.  I

         19   can, but they don't make it easy for you.

         20        Q.   Unfortunately, that's not a --

         21        A.   Right.

         22        Q.   -- a --

         23        A.   That's why I had requested it.

         24                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm going to call for

         25   production of responses that are within his custody and

                                                                       73



          1   control --

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  He just said it's not easy to

          3   access that material.  We've produced everything that TD

          4   Ameritrade has sent to him based on his multiple requests.

          5                  MS. ZALKA:  Are you refusing to produce

          6   them?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  I mean, we'll take your

          8   request under consideration.  But, again, he's asked for

          9   the documents, TD Ameritrade has sent him this material,

         10   and he's given it to you.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   The monthly account statements

         12   for 6684 would -- between October 20 -- between January

         13   2016 and September 2017, would reflect information

         14   concerning your holdings and Rite Aid stock, correct?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   Are your monthly account statements currently

         17   accessible to you if you go into your Ameritrade and just

         18   click on the month?

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  For what time period?

         20                  MS. ZALKA:  The time period I just

         21   mentioned in my question.

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  The previous question?

         23                  MS. ZALKA:  Yeah.

         24        A.   I can access my accounts online.

         25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Including your monthly account

                                                                       74



          1   statements?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   So am I correct that you could simply log on to

          4   your account, click on the account number and then click

          5   on the month, download the statement?

          6        A.   Well, it's a few more clicks.  But...

          7        Q.   A couple more clicks, but yes?

          8        A.   Yes, I can -- I can monotonously get to it,

          9   even -- one of the biggest problems that they have is you

         10   have to -- you have to change the name.  When you click on

         11   it, it always gives the same name.  So you actually have

         12   to go in and rename what you're saving.

         13                  But -- I'm just looking here.  Six, cash,

         14   stocks -- let's see --

         15                  (Witness reviews document.)

         16                  Okay.  Are all these -- are these monthly

         17   statements?  It looks to be monthly statements.  Yeah,

         18   okay.

         19        Q.   Is there another kind of statement that you

         20   receive or have access to, other than monthly?

         21        A.   I'm not sure if there's quarterly statements or

         22   not, but my -- I don't think -- I don't think there is.  I

         23   know there's annual -- there's an annual one for tax

         24   purposes that -- that gives you, you know, everything,

         25   including if there's any wash sales.

                                                                       75



          1        Q.   What did you mean by "wash sales"?

          2        A.   Basically, if you purchase a stock -- you

          3   can't -- you can't sell a stock for a loss and then

          4   repurchase it back within a 30-day period.  That's -- I

          5   think that's my understanding of it; otherwise, you can't

          6   use that for a tax deduction.

          7        Q.   Okay.  So other than monthly account statements

          8   and the annual kind of tax statement, is there any other

          9   type of statement that you have access to?

         10        A.   No, not that I am aware of.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Now, you mentioned there was a third

         12   account that you realized later on that hadn't been

         13   provided; is that correct?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   When did you realize that?

         16        A.   About a month ago, maybe.

         17        Q.   Okay.  And how did you come to realize that a

         18   month ago?

         19        A.   My attorney mentioned it, I believe.

         20        Q.   Was that --

         21        A.   What that --

         22        Q.   -- the account number 6700?

         23        A.   I don't know.  I don't --

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  I mean, divulges any

         25   communications -- you -- but --

                                                                       76



          1        A.   I may be mistaken.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What account number is the

          3   account you realized --

          4        A.   I don't know the number off the top of my head.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Why don't you take a look at Exhibit 17.

          6        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

          7                  Yeah.  That's my rollover IRA.  That's the

          8   one.  So maybe I did provide it.  I didn't go through --

          9        Q.   Do you also have access to the monthly

         10   statements for your rollover IRA account?

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

         12   mischaracterizes his earlier testimony about access.

         13                  But go ahead.

         14        A.   I have access to my statements.

         15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So am I correct that you

         16   then have access to the monthly account statements for the

         17   roll -- the rollover IRA account ending in 6700?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   Did you undertake an effort to collect those

         20   monthly account statements in connection with this

         21   litigation?

         22        A.   I did not look at every document that Ameritrade

         23   produced.  And I was under the assumption that all three

         24   accounts that were in there and that they had fulfilled my

         25   request.  But, evidently, they didn't.

                                                                       77



          1        Q.   When did you realize -- your realization with

          2   respect to the rollover IRA account that happened about a

          3   month ago --

          4        A.   Yeah.

          5        Q.   -- did you realize at any point before today

          6   that you had not been provided with or produced the full

          7   set of monthly account statements for reflecting your

          8   transactions in Rite Aid stock for your other two anthems?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.  And to the

         10   extent it misstates earlier testimony.

         11                  But go ahead.

         12        A.   Well, later on I realized there was a deficit in

         13   the number of documents that -- that I provided.

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

         15        A.   Which I can provide at any time.

         16        Q.   Okay.  So you realized there was a deficit in

         17   the number of documents that you provided and that you

         18   could provide those at any time.

         19                  When did you first realize there was a

         20   deficit in the number of documents that you provided?

         21        A.   Couple of months ago.

         22        Q.   And what was the nature of the deficit that you

         23   identified?

         24        A.   That there -- all the documents weren't there.

         25        Q.   When you say, All the documents weren't there,

                                                                       78



          1   are you referring to the monthly statements or something

          2   else?

          3        A.   I don't know, it must have -- it might have -- I

          4   don't know when it was.  I don't know what time it

          5   actually was.  What -- you know, a month ago or -- but I

          6   know that the majority of the statements that were

          7   provided, because I looked later on in my account, under

          8   the e-mail, and I noticed that the majority of the

          9   statements were out of my main account, and I later

         10   realized, looking at the e-mails, that not all of the

         11   information was there, as far as -- I didn't think I

         12   needed to produce all of the information because, over the

         13   period, if you look at the number of shares purchased over

         14   the period, you will see that the purchase -- if I, let's

         15   say, purchased 750 shares at the beginning, I still had

         16   750 shares at the end.  I didn't think I had to collect

         17   everything in between.

         18        Q.   So did you understand, in connection with

         19   responding to defendant's request for documents, that you

         20   did not have to produce unique documents that concerned

         21   your transactions in Rite Aid?

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

         23                  To the extent it calls for attorney/client

         24   privileged information, don't discuss anything that we've

         25   talked about.  But if you understand the question, you can

                                                                       79



          1   answer.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you say, I didn't think I

          3   had to collect everything in between, what did you mean?

          4        A.   I -- I came up to that conclusion myself.

          5        Q.   And what exactly was that conclusion?

          6        A.   Just of the redundant nature of having so many

          7   documents basically say the same thing.  The number of

          8   shares I purchased still remains the same, because I

          9   didn't sell any.

         10                  So I purchased shares.  I didn't sell

         11   anything; so the beginning and the end, the number of

         12   shares I own would still be the same.

         13        Q.   Roughly how many documents did you not provide

         14   because of that understanding?

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

         16        A.   I don't know.  I mean -- I don't know.  If

         17   that's the case, then I would have to go back and produce

         18   a monthly statement like what was produced for the main

         19   account, and that was not done on my half.

         20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Am I correct, though, that your

         21   monthly statements in your rollover IRA account ending in

         22   6700 and your Roth IRA account ending in 6684, for which

         23   you did not produce the monthly statements during the

         24   relevant time period, that those did actually reflect

         25   information concerning your transactions in Rite Aid every

                                                                       80



          1   month, correct?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well, objection to form.

          3   Misstates evidence.

          4        A.   There's no transaction; it's only the

          5   fluctuation of the stock price.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So let's ask this:  Did

          7   your monthly account statements for those two accounts

          8   reflect information concerning your holdings in Rite Aid

          9   stock?

         10        A.   They do reflect my holdings in Rite Aid stock --

         11        Q.   And that information would change --

         12        A.   -- which is constant.

         13        Q.   Would the market value be constant?

         14        A.   Of course not.

         15        Q.   Okay.  So, would the cost basis be constant?

         16        A.   No.

         17        Q.   Would the average cost be constant?

         18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

         19        A.   The av -- what do you mean by the "average

         20   cost"?  The -- I mean, the cost that I pay for them would

         21   be constant.

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you see -- so there would be

         23   unique information concerning your holdings in Rite Aid

         24   stock that appears on each of your monthly statements,

         25   correct?

                                                                       81



          1        A.   Yes, that information changes on a

          2   minute-to-minute basis.

          3                  MS. ZALKA:  Counsel, I call for production

          4   of monthly statements that Mr. Dayton has access to that

          5   reflects his holdings and transactions in Rite Aid stock,

          6   and each of the accounts at Ameritrade in which he held

          7   Rite Aid stock during the period for which you've agreed

          8   to produce responsive documents.

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  We'll take your request under

         10   -- under advisement.  And I'll note that you haven't

         11   raised an issue on this prior to the deposition today.

         12   You've had -- had his trading records.  But we'll take a

         13   look at it and see what he can access and is required to

         14   produce under the rules and the agreements.

         15                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  Well, with respect to

         16   the rollover IRA account, I would note that the first and

         17   only -- the one and only account statement for that

         18   account that you produced was produced last night.  And

         19   with respect to the Roth IRA account, which ends in 6684,

         20   you produced also an additional account statement last

         21   night, and otherwise only produced one.

         22                  So with -- in that regard, in any event,

         23   you can, obviously, let us know whether or not you're

         24   going to produce the documents that are clearly responsive

         25   to the request.

                                                                       82



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well, but, again, he's made

          2   multiple requests to TD Ameritrade.  He's sent you

          3   everything that they have sent to him.  You guys have

          4   everything that we have.  But, again, we'll -- we'll

          5   certainly consider your request.

          6                  MS. ZALKA:  We'll be keeping the deposition

          7   open until resolution of this request.

          8                  MR. KNOTTS:  And again, we can,

          9   obviously -- obviously object to that, but --

         10                  MS. ZALKA:  We can talk about it.

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  There's no additional

         12   information that you don't already have in those

         13   documents.

         14                  MS. ZALKA:  You haven't see -- have you

         15   seen the documents?

         16                  MR. KNOTTS:  No, but as the witness

         17   testified, he didn't have additional transactions and his

         18   holdings didn't --

         19                  MS. ZALKA:  I think now you're just

         20   testifying, Mr. Knotts.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Mr. Dayton, let's change

         22   gears a little bit.

         23                  How did you get involved in this action?

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  You can answer.  And just

         25   remember that -- not to discuss attorney/client

                                                                       83



          1   discussions.

          2        A.   I was reading, I think it was either the Rite

          3   Aid or Walgreens news, and I saw something in there

          4   basically about a possible class action lawsuit, and I was

          5   interested in participating because of my losses, and for

          6   an opportunity to try to recover some of my losses.

          7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When was that?

          8        A.   I -- I don't know.  I don't know what date that

          9   was.

         10        Q.   Kind of roughly, I guess, can you tell me the

         11   year?

         12        A.   It was a couple years ago.  I -- I don't know

         13   the exact date.

         14        Q.   Um --

         15        A.   It was -- obviously, it was after the deal fell

         16   apart, but it might not have been too far after.  And if

         17   you asked me the date that the deal fell apart, I can't

         18   give that to you either.

         19        Q.   Okay.  Before "the deal fell apart," in your

         20   words, did you contemplate suing Rite Aid or Walgreens

         21   concerning the deal?

         22        A.   Well, I was -- I was not happy about it, and so

         23   I was hoping that there would be a class action lawsuit.

         24   Not necessarily that I would be part of it, but that there

         25   would be one.

                                                                       84



          1        Q.   Why did you hope that there would be a class

          2   action lawsuit before the deal fell apart?

          3        A.   No, not before.

          4        Q.   So my question was --

          5        A.   No, after.

          6        Q.   So my question to you was:  Before the deal fell

          7   apart --

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   -- did you contemplate suing Rite Aid or

         10   Walgreens --

         11        A.   No.

         12        Q.   -- concerning any aspect of the deal?

         13        A.   No, not at all.  I was hopeful that merger was

         14   going to go through, which is why I retained my stock.

         15   Otherwise, I would have liquidated the account,

         16   the -- well, my stock holdings.

         17                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Can we take a quick

         18   break?  I need to fix -- I have a slight issue here.

         19                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure.

         20                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

         21   12:13 p.m.

         22                  (Recess in the proceedings from 12:13

         23                  to 12:14 p.m.)

         24                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

         25   12:14 p.m.

                                                                       85



          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So before, in your words, The

          2   deal fell apart, at any point did you contemplate bringing

          3   any claim against Rite Aid or Walgreens concerning any

          4   aspect of the merger?

          5        A.   No.  Not before.

          6        Q.   Okay.  When did you first talk to a lawyer in

          7   connection with claims against either Rite Aid or

          8   Walgreens related to the deal?

          9        A.   It was when I saw the article in the news, call

         10   this number, and I called the number.

         11        Q.   Do you recall roughly --

         12        A.   No, I don't know --

         13        Q.   -- when that was?

         14        A.   No, I don't.

         15        Q.   Even just by virtue of a year time frame; was it

         16   this year, last year, year before?

         17        A.   No, it wasn't -- it wasn't too long after the

         18   deal fell apart, and the announcement was made that Rite

         19   Aid would be selling several -- you know, half of the

         20   stores, or whatever the number was to Walgreens, you know,

         21   it could have been months after that, but I don't

         22   know -- I don't know the exact date when that happened.

         23                  It's -- it's not clear in my head the exact

         24   date.  All I can tell you is it was after things were in a

         25   very bad situation.

                                                                       86



          1        Q.   Was it a matter of months after the deal around

          2   the merger announcement?

          3        A.   It could have been.  It could have been.  It

          4   could have been.

          5        Q.   So I want your best recollection, not kind of a

          6   hypothetical.  So the question is --

          7        A.   I'm sorry; I --

          8        Q.   And I understand if you can't give specifics,

          9   but what I'm trying to understand is what is your best

         10   recollection and understanding of how many months after

         11   the deal fell apart, to use your words, did you first

         12   contemplate taking legal action?

         13        A.   I don't know; two or three months.  But, again,

         14   it's just a guess.  And you can't hold me to it, because

         15   it was just a guess.

         16        Q.   Could it have been a year?

         17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         18        A.   I don't -- I'm not sure.  I don't think it was

         19   that -- I don't think it was a year.  I think it was under

         20   a year.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why don't you think it was over

         22   a year?

         23        A.   Because it -- to me it seems like it -- I don't

         24   think I waited an entire year before contacting the

         25   telephone -- before calling that -- the number that was in

                                                                       87



          1   the news.  I don't think I waited a whole year.

          2        Q.   Why don't you think you waited an entire year?

          3        A.   Maybe I did, but I just -- I don't --

          4        Q.   Tell me why do you think that?

          5        A.   Because a whole year seems like a long time.

          6   But I seem to think that it came out -- the article came

          7   out prior to a year.

          8        Q.   When you say the article came out prior to the

          9   year, are you referring to the class action notice --

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   -- that you recall reviewing and calling the

         12   telephone number?

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   Okay.  When did you first believe that Walgreens

         15   had misled investors somehow?

         16        A.   Okay.  So when the -- when they didn't -- when

         17   they didn't wait for the formal announcement from the

         18   Federal Trade Commission and they decided to formulate

         19   their own deal.

         20                  I was hopeful that -- because I thought

         21   they had a special relationship, I thought that the deal

         22   would go through.

         23        Q.   Um --

         24        A.   And --

         25        Q.   Sorry; go ahead.

                                                                       88



          1        A.   If it didn't go through, that it would be a

          2   formal announcement from Walgreens.

          3        Q.   Why did you think that they had a special

          4   relationship?

          5        A.   Because I recall, to my knowledge,

          6   reading -- reading that Pessina, I believe, had mentioned

          7   that in one of the news releases.

          8        Q.   So it's your testimony --

          9        A.   So don't -- don't ask me when, because I don't

         10   have -- I don't know what the date was.

         11        Q.   So your recollection is that Mr. Pessina

         12   indicated in a press release that Walgreens had a special

         13   relationship with the FTC, which led to you believe that

         14   the deal would go through, and that when Walgreens decided

         15   they wouldn't -- that they -- in June, that the deal, the

         16   merger agreement was not going to go through, that's when

         17   you first thought that Walgreens had misled investors --

         18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, misstates

         19   testimony.  But go ahead.

         20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   -- does that accurately state

         21   your recollection and belief?

         22        A.   That's a fair statement.

         23        Q.   Thank you.  So with respect to the -- is there

         24   any other aspect, other than the special relationship

         25   statement that you mentioned, that led you to believe that

                                                                       89



          1   Walgreens had misled investors?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  And objection to the extent

          3   that it calls for attorney/client privileged information

          4   and discussions that we've had --

          5                  MS. ZALKA:  Yeah.  I'm not interested in

          6   anything your lawyer's told you.  I want to know what you

          7   believed.

          8                  MR. KNOTTS:  So again, I'll make my

          9   objection and my instruction about attorney/client

         10   privileged --

         11                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure.

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- information.

         13                  So just request that you don't divulge

         14   things that we've talked about in connection with this

         15   lawsuit, but to the extent that you had an understanding

         16   coming in, by all means.

         17        A.   Well, I had an understanding that -- at the

         18   beginning, based on Wal -- Walgreens' announcement that

         19   there was no reason why the acquisition wouldn't be

         20   successful.

         21                  And as I mentioned earlier on, although

         22   it's not quoted of them saying it I thought it was smooth

         23   sailing, which is why I held on to my stock.  I wouldn't

         24   have hold (sic) on to my stock if I thought it would not

         25   be successful.

                                                                       90



          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Other than this special

          2   relationship statement that you mentioned, are there any

          3   other statements that you believe -- strike that.

          4                  So I think you've testified that you first

          5   started to think that Walgreens had misled investors when

          6   they announced the alternative to the Merger Agreement?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   Is that correct?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   And you've testified that you've -- at that

         11   time, you believed that Walgreens had misled investors

         12   because Mr. Pessina had made a statement about having a

         13   special relationship with the FTC?

         14        A.   I do remember that.

         15        Q.   Is there anything -- so outside of things your

         16   lawyers may have told you, I'm asking you for your actual

         17   recollection of having a reaction to those events in '17,

         18   2017.

         19                  So when you heard the news in 2017 that the

         20   merger agreement wasn't going to go forward, is there any

         21   other statement or manner in which you believe that

         22   Walgreens had misled investors at that time, other than

         23   the special relationship statement that you mentioned?

         24        A.   I just remember that -- and I don't know in how

         25   many articles it was mentioned, but all along,

                                                                       91



          1   from -- from the articles that I was reading all along, it

          2   seemed like -- all the way to the end, it seemed like it

          3   would be a successful merger.

          4        Q.   And -- go ahead.

          5        A.   All the way to the end.  And in some cases, I

          6   can't recall if it was a quote from a Walgreens executive

          7   or being a quote from the news, but I know that

          8   even -- even to the end, they were saying that the merger

          9   was going to be successful.  To my knowledge, they were

         10   saying that.  It wasn't far after that that the deal

         11   started falling through.

         12        Q.   In June of 2017, Walgreens announced an

         13   alternative to the Merger Agreement; do you recall that?

         14   Is that when the deal fell apart, in your --

         15        A.   I remember more than one alternative -- more

         16   than one plan.  Which plan are you referring to?

         17        Q.   So do you recall that in June, Walgreens

         18   announced the termination of the Merger Agreement?

         19        A.   Okay.  And -- yes, I do remember that.

         20        Q.   So maybe that will just help orient.

         21                  So I'm asking you basically your reaction

         22   at the time -- I'm not interested in what your lawyers

         23   have told you afterwards, but when you -- did you actually

         24   read that announcement when it was made on that day?

         25        A.   Yes.

                                                                       92



          1        Q.   Okay.  And so based on that announcement, what

          2   did you understand Walgreens to have misled investors

          3   about and through which statements?

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

          5   a few times.  And I'll ask that you not talk about things

          6   that you've learned in the course of the litigation from

          7   counsel, but you can answer based on your perception at

          8   the time.

          9        A.   I felt that I was -- I was led on, all the way

         10   up to the point where it was -- the deal was canceled.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   But other than the special

         12   relationship with the FTC statement that you referenced

         13   earlier, are there any other statements by Walgreens in

         14   the press releases that you read that somehow led you --

         15        A.   Yeah, they --

         16        Q.   -- to --

         17        A.   Basically, they said that there wasn't -- it

         18   would be -- I mentioned this already, there will be no

         19   bumps in the road, in other words, to the merger.  And

         20   there was no mention of any Federal Trade Commission at

         21   the time.

         22        Q.   What do you mean, There was no mention of any

         23   Federal Trade Commission at the time?

         24        A.   Well, the -- the opposition or the -- the issue

         25   with the Federal Trade Commission coming in saying that

                                                                       93



          1   there was -- you know, there was going to be an issue, as

          2   far as a monopoly goes, that wasn't brought up until later

          3   on, in articles.  Basically, from, I think maybe the -- it

          4   might have been Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg and some

          5   of the other financial magazines, but they started

          6   bringing up scrutinization -- scrutiny of the Federal

          7   Trade Commission.

          8        Q.   What did you mean when you say "later on"?

          9        A.   At the beginning, when the -- I did not read

         10   anything at the beginning, when the merger was first

         11   announced, that there would be any issue with the -- the

         12   Federal Trade Commission wasn't mentioned.

         13        Q.   By who?

         14        A.   By the -- by the articles or the announcements

         15   made by Walgreens.

         16        Q.   When do you think that Walgreens first started

         17   to discuss the FTC review of the deal?

         18        A.   I don't know.  When I first -- I first saw it in

         19   the discussion with Rite Aid and not -- not Walgreens.  It

         20   started coming out with Rite Aid.  And when it was

         21   coming -- you know, closer to when the deal -- it was

         22   actually when they changed the deal, it went from $9 a

         23   share, then they were talking about $7 or $7.50 a share,

         24   they extended the time period.  And I didn't hear anything

         25   saying that there was -- I didn't hear anything from

                                                                       94



          1   Walgreens saying that there was any FTC issues.  I do

          2   remember it coming from -- from Rite Aid.

          3        Q.   So you were aware of -- as of what date that

          4   there were issues with the FTC review?

          5        A.   I can't give you any dates.  It was -- it was

          6   around the -- it could have been around the time that they

          7   announced the -- their second plan, which was to -- to

          8   lower the number of stores that they were going to

          9   purchase and to lower the stock price to the $7 or $7.50.

         10   And I thought they were doing that so they could obtain

         11   the FTC approval, because the number of stores that they

         12   were initially going to buy was too many and, thereby,

         13   perhaps forming a monopoly.

         14                  So when they decided to lower the number of

         15   shares, I thought that was -- excuse me -- a workaround

         16   plan to obtain FTC approval.

         17                  So even then I was hoping that the FTC

         18   would approve the merger.  And, quite frankly, like I

         19   said, I held onto the stock because I was hopeful.

         20        Q.   And what was your hope based on?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         22        A.   You have to be -- you have to elaborate on what

         23   it's based on.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I think when you said, you

         25   know, quite frankly, I held onto the stock because I was

                                                                       95



          1   hoping for FTC approval, correct?

          2        A.   Right.

          3        Q.   And I was asking you, what -- what was that hope

          4   based on?

          5        A.   The hope was based on that they were doing what

          6   they can to make adjustments to their plan to obtain the

          7   approval.

          8        Q.   Okay.  Now, you are seeking to be a class

          9   representative, correct?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   What's your understanding of what your

         12   obligations are?

         13        A.   Okay.  Well, talking to my -- interfacing,

         14   talking with my attorney on the class -- on the suit;

         15   answering any questions between my attorney and myself;

         16   and what we're doing here right now; hoping for

         17   a -- working on a settlement, favorable settlement, for

         18   myself and also for the stockholders for that time period;

         19   keeping abreast of the details of the suit; providing any

         20   documentation necessary, et cetera.

         21        Q.   Anything else?

         22        A.   No.  That's about it.

         23        Q.   Okay.  What's the class period in this case?

         24        A.   The class period?

         25        Q.   Uh-huh.

                                                                       96



          1        A.   Okay.  I believe it's, what, October 20th, 2016,

          2   to June 28th, 2017.

          3        Q.   And what's the significance of those two dates?

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.  And I'll

          5   ask you not to divulge communications with us and things

          6   that you've learned in the lawsuit.  But if you have an

          7   understanding coming in, you can -- you can go ahead and

          8   answer.  And it calls for a legal conclusion.

          9                  Go ahead.

         10        A.   Okay.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Let me ask you this:  Do you

         12   know why those dates are the beginning and the end of the

         13   class period?

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objections.  Don't

         15   divulge things that you've learned from us, but you can

         16   answer if you had an understanding coming in.

         17        A.   Well, I know the end date was when it -- I

         18   believe when it fell through, when the deal actually fell

         19   through.

         20                  The -- as far as the start date goes, I'm

         21   not quite sure what that was, as far as the start date,

         22   again.  I was hoping that it would actually go back much

         23   further than what it did, as far as the dates go.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why were you hoping that?

         25        A.   Well, I thought it would have gone back from the

                                                                       97



          1   time that the merger was announced.

          2        Q.   Why did you think that?

          3        A.   I just thought that that was logical.

          4        Q.   Uh-huh.

          5        A.   Because, you know, that's when -- that's when

          6   people might -- and institutions might -- that's when the

          7   trading volume would probably increase.  At that --

          8        Q.   And why would -- sorry; go ahead and finish.

          9        A.   Well, at that point when it's announced.

         10        Q.   Why would the trading volume probably increase

         11   when it was announced?

         12        A.   Because -- well, that's -- basically because the

         13   stock is traded on news.  Okay.  So it's -- people and

         14   companies would be buying into it.  That's what I

         15   initially thought.

         16        Q.   And why were you hoping that the class period

         17   would go back to when the deal was first announced?

         18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         19                  But you can go ahead.

         20        A.   Well, because I had additional shares,

         21   and -- you know, I had a total of almost -- you know, over

         22   32,000 shares.  So narrowing it down to that brief chunk

         23   of time, cut it down to, I think, 7,000 shares.  I was

         24   just -- I wanted to be and helped to be -- you know, to be

         25   made a -- whole, or at least try to be made -- I mean, I

                                                                       98



          1   know I'll never be made whole.  I mean, I know I'm going

          2   to incur losses.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And --

          4        A.   I'm just trying to recover anything I can, as

          5   well as for the stockholders.

          6        Q.   When you said you had over 32,000 shares, and

          7   this cut it down to 7,000 shares, are you talking about

          8   Rite Aid stock?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   Are you talking about purchases or overall

         11   holdings?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, but you can answer.

         13        A.   The shares that I owned at that time period.

         14   Shares that I purchased during that time period were

         15   7,000, I believe.

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

         17        A.   And if they went back further, I would have had

         18   more shares.

         19        Q.   More shares that you purchased?

         20        A.   Yeah.  I believe so.  I believe so.

         21        Q.   So did you purchase Rite Aid stock after the

         22   merger was announced?

         23        A.   I don't believe I did.

         24        Q.   When do you think your first purchase of Rite

         25   Aid stock was between October 2015 and the end --

                                                                       99



          1        A.   I would have to look at my portfolio to look --

          2   to verify that.  I can't answer that.

          3        Q.   Okay.  How many transactions -- how many

          4   purchases did you make at Rite Aid during October 2015

          5   through the end of 2017?

          6        A.   I don't have any -- yeah, I have to look at my

          7   data.  I'd have to look at my accounts.

          8        Q.   We'll do that.  I just want to know do you have

          9   a sense of roughly how much?

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   Are we talking dozens or are we talking like --

         12        A.   No, just let me -- let me -- no, I have no idea

         13   how many.  I mean, you know, I may -- I may have made, I

         14   don't know, like eight purchases altogether.  Maybe it was

         15   more; I don't know.

         16                  I mean, I started purchasing it way back.

         17   I'm not sure if it was 2012, 2013.  So --

         18        Q.   And I'm just specific in my question, just to be

         19   clear, was focused on after the merger was announced,

         20   purchases after the merger was announced.

         21        A.   Purchases after the merger was announced, maybe

         22   three or four times.

         23        Q.   Was there any specific piece of information or

         24   news that you relied on in connection with those

         25   purchases, to your recollection?

                                                                      100



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

          2                  Go ahead.

          3        A.   I was -- there was one point there that the

          4   stock started going down, so I decided to purchase -- I

          5   thought it was a good buy, so I decided to purchase when

          6   the price went down.

          7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   But any specific piece of news

          8   or information or disclosure or SEC filing that you

          9   reviewed and relied upon in connection with the decision

         10   to make those specific purchases?

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form.

         12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   To the best of your

         13   recollection.

         14        A.   No, just to the fact that I was hopeful that the

         15   merger would happen.

         16        Q.   And that hope was based on the statement,

         17   according to you, that Mr. Pessina made regarding the

         18   special relationship with the FTC?

         19        A.   Yeah, but it wasn't just that statement.  It was

         20   all statements where -- that the -- that the deal would go

         21   through.  This wasn't -- that wasn't even the same press

         22   release.  These are two separate press releases that I

         23   remember.  One was the deal would fall -- that the deal

         24   would go through, and another one was that they had a

         25   special -- I'm not sure if he even said, you know, inside

                                                                      101



          1   information with the FTC.  I thought that, you know, they

          2   have -- with other acquisitions in the past, that they had

          3   worked with FTC on multiple times, and perhaps even with

          4   the -- and I don't know if that has anything to do with

          5   the U.S., but the merger with Boots.

          6                  So I'm thinking that they may have worked

          7   with them then.  And I'm sure there were other mergers

          8   along the way that they worked with the -- so I believed

          9   it to be an honest statement.

         10        Q.   You believe what to be an honest statement?

         11        A.   That they had a special relationship with the

         12   FTC.  And that they would be the first ones to be notified

         13   if there was an issue, and that they would notify -- you

         14   know, they would make a press release or announcement or

         15   something during the -- even an earnings call.  I never

         16   heard anything.

         17        Q.   When you say that you never heard anything, what

         18   did you do to actually understand all of the disclosures

         19   that were being made by Walgreens and Rite Aid concerning

         20   the merger?

         21        A.   Well, I believed what they said was truthful.

         22        Q.   No.  What I am asking you is what did you do to

         23   understand all of the disclosures that were being made by

         24   Walgreens and Rite Aid about the merger?

         25        A.   I didn't do anything.  I stayed firm and kept

                                                                      102



          1   the stock.

          2        Q.   But -- you did not do anything to understand the

          3   full set of disclosures that were being made by the

          4   Walgreens and Rite Aid concerning the merger?

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

          6   a few times.  He's talked about what he did during this

          7   time period.

          8                  So you can --

          9        A.   No, I mean, I've answered it.  I've answered

         10   your question.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I think you've answered it

         12   different ways, so I'm just trying to understand what it

         13   is that you actually are testifying to having a specific

         14   recollection about doing during this time period.  So --

         15        A.   I mean, I don't know --

         16        Q.   Just let me finish my question.

         17        A.   Okay.  Uh-huh.

         18        Q.   It will make it easier.

         19        A.   Sure.

         20        Q.   My question is:  With respect to the time period

         21   we're talking about, October 2015 through 2017, you

         22   testified that you did not do anything to understand the

         23   full set of disclosures that were being made by Walgreens

         24   and Rite Aid about the merger; is that correct?

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  And objection to the extent it

                                                                      103



          1   leaves out other testimony on the subject.

          2        A.   When I said I didn't do anything, I meant I

          3   didn't exercise the selling of the stock.  That's what I

          4   meant when I didn't do anything.

          5        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What did you --

          6        A.   That's all I meant.

          7        Q.   Okay.  That's a helpful clarification.

          8                  What did you do to understand the full set

          9   of disclosures that were made by Walgreens and Rite Aid

         10   about the merger during the period between 2015 and June

         11   2017?

         12        A.   I don't remember doing anything other than

         13   absorbing the information.  I don't know what I can do;

         14   call up -- pick up the phone and call Pessina and say,

         15   hey, I don't like what you're doing.  I don't

         16   understand --

         17        Q.   Let me --

         18        A.   What can I do based on this?  I mean, you know,

         19   I read -- I read a lot of news articles.  Okay.  And it's

         20   hard to -- there are so many news articles that I read,

         21   okay.  I can't recall what was said in all of the news

         22   articles.  There are certain things that are said, though,

         23   that I can -- that I did remember, okay, and those things

         24   gave me hope, okay, that the -- that the deal would not

         25   fall through.  Hence, why I did not sell my shares.

                                                                      104



          1        Q.   Okay.  So I'm asking you specifically -- not

          2   with respect to what actions you took with your stock.

          3   I'm asking about what are the documents that you reviewed

          4   and the disclosures that you reviewed during this period.

          5                  So it sounds like what you said is you read

          6   a lot of news articles.  And I'm asking you:  What else

          7   did you do beyond reading news articles to understand what

          8   Walgreens and Rite Aid were disclosing to investors about

          9   the merger?

         10        A.   Oh, excuse me.

         11                  Nothing --

         12        Q.   Okay.

         13        A.   -- other than monitoring -- monitoring my

         14   stocks, the price of my stocks, the trading activity, the

         15   volume of trades, things of that sort.

         16        Q.   Who are the defendants in this lawsuit?

         17        A.   Stefano Pessina, who is the CEO.  And there is a

         18   George Fairweather, and he's the chief financial officer,

         19   I believe.  That's -- those are the only two that I

         20   remember.

         21        Q.   Are you suing just individuals?

         22        A.   No, I thought I was -- I thought I was also

         23   suing the company.

         24        Q.   And what claims are you asserting?

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll object to the extent

                                                                      105



          1   it calls for a legal conclusion, and to the extent it

          2   calls for information that you've learned from us.  But to

          3   the extent that you have an understanding separate from

          4   that, you can answer.

          5        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And that will always be true.

          6   I'm not asking you, again, for kind of communications with

          7   your lawyers.

          8                  I'm asking you what is your understanding

          9   of what are the claims you're suing those defendants

         10   about?

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  And same objection, same

         12   instruction.

         13                  But go ahead.

         14        A.   Well, I mean, I -- I don't think that

         15   the -- the -- some of the announcements were forthcoming

         16   and honest, especially when saying that there would be no

         17   objection or no opposition to the merger.

         18                  Also, like I mentioned, the fact that they

         19   had a special relationship with the Federal -- FTC.

         20   That's it.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So there's two -- you

         22   mentioned two items in response to my question, which was

         23   the announcements that there would be no objection or not

         24   opposition to the merger.  And the second thing you

         25   mention is the special relationship with the FTC; is that

                                                                      106



          1   correct?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   Are there any other categories of announcements

          4   that you take issue with?

          5        A.   No.

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, and objection to the

          7   extent that it calls for legal advice.  And I think you

          8   asked about the claims and then you said take issue with

          9   so those are two different -- two different things.

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   No?

         12        A.   No.  That's about the -- the extent of it.

         13        Q.   So with respect to your complaint against

         14   Walgreens and Mr. Fairweather and Mr. Pessina, it relates,

         15   to your recollection, that there were statements made by

         16   Walgreens or Mr. Pessina or Mr. Fairweather that, one,

         17   there would be no opposition to the merger by the FTC and,

         18   two, that Walgreens had a special relationship with the

         19   FTC.  Is that accurate?

         20        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   Did you pursue -- do you believe that Rite Aid

         22   misled investors?

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

         24                  Don't divulge attorney/client

         25   contributions, but you can answer.

                                                                      107



          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   To be clear, how about we do

          2   this.  So in June 2017, the merger agreement was

          3   terminated, as we discussed.

          4                  Upon that announcement, do you recall

          5   thinking that you were misled by Rite Aid?

          6        A.   The fact that they -- the fact that they agreed

          7   to sell half -- I don't know if it was half the stores,

          8   but just for the record I'm going to say half the stores,

          9   okay.

         10                  Yeah, I was misled that way, because I

         11   didn't realize that they were going to break the company

         12   in half.  And -- so there was no discussion about that

         13   nowhere.  That came up later on.

         14                  And then when they announced it, I said to

         15   myself, oh, well, they're going to have to get the

         16   shareholders to vote on that.  And then I was completely

         17   wrong; no shareholder vote on that.

         18                  How can you break a company in half without

         19   having a shareholder vote?  I'm still scratching my head

         20   over that one.  But, you know, I'm not a lawyer,

         21   especially in that particular area of expertise.  So...

         22                  So, yeah, I feel like that was part of why

         23   I felt misled.

         24        Q.   Any other aspects upon -- strike that.

         25                  Upon the announcement in June 2017 of the

                                                                      108



          1   termination of the Merger Agreement, is there any other

          2   way in which you believe you had been misled by either

          3   Walgreens or Rite Aid, other than what you've already

          4   identified?

          5        A.   Well, I didn't think that there would be a

          6   second plan where they were going to reduce the number of

          7   stores and, in doing so, reduce the price of the shares

          8   from $9 to $7 or $7.50.  But that was -- that was a blow

          9   to me.

         10                  But then I thought that maybe they were

         11   doing that as a prerequisite of obtaining FTC approval, so

         12   -- in order to reduce the number of shares.

         13        Q.   And --

         14        A.   I mean the number of stores.

         15        Q.   So I think you've identified four items.  The --

         16   with respect to Walgreens, you identified the statement

         17   that you recall Walgreens making that there would be no

         18   opposition by the FTC along with the special relationship

         19   comment.

         20        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   And with respect to Rite Aid, you've identified

         22   that you think that they would not have reduced the number

         23   of share -- the price of the shares in the deal from 9 to

         24   7, or 6.50 in January, and that they would not have agreed

         25   to sell stores; is that correct?

                                                                      109



          1        A.   Yeah.  Half their stores.

          2        Q.   Half the stores.

          3        A.   Right.

          4        Q.   Other than those four items, is there anything

          5   else?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   Okay.

          8                  MS. ZALKA:  Can I get a complaint?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  It's a long complaint.  Do we

         10   -- before we start getting into that, do we want to get

         11   lunch?

         12                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm open to whenever you guys

         13   want to do.

         14                  THE WITNESS:  Well, I guess we have a

         15   couple more hours?  Or...

         16                  MS. ZALKA:  Yes, I would -- I would suggest

         17   lunch.  It's not going to end in a couple of hours.  If

         18   you want --

         19                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

         20                  MS. ZALKA:  I think we'll be taking a lunch

         21   break.  It's really just a matter of when you would like

         22   to have it.

         23                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Well, we can have it

         24   now, I guess.  What time is it?

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  It's now 1:00.

                                                                      110



          1                  MS. ZALKA:  1:00.

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  So why don't we go off the

          3   record.

          4                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure.

          5                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

          6   12:56 p.m.

          7                  (Recess in the proceedings from 12:56

          8                  to 1:40 p.m.)

          9                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

         10   1:40 p.m.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Mr. Dayton --

         12        A.   Uh-huh.

         13        Q.   -- I'm handing you what's been marked as Exhibit

         14   19.

         15                  (Exhibit 19 marked.)

         16        A.   Okay.

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Let me know when you're ready.

         18        A.   Is this the one that's mainly referring to --

         19   some of it's the Hering case?  Yeah, okay.

         20                  (Witness reviews document.)

         21                  Okay.

         22        Q.   Are you ready?

         23        A.   Uh-huh.

         24        Q.   Do you recognize this document?

         25        A.   I believe so, but there were several documents

                                                                      111



          1   that -- a lot of -- some of them had similar content, but

          2   I think I remember this particular document.

          3        Q.   Okay.  What is it?

          4        A.   So it's the class action complaint for

          5   violations of Security Act of 1934.

          6        Q.   Uh-huh.

          7        A.   I think they refer to it as the -- in Section

          8   10-B, I've seen reference to that in the past.  And this

          9   is -- this is what this is in reference to, part of it,

         10   right.

         11        Q.   What do you mean?

         12        A.   The -- so this is basically what the complaint

         13   is.  This is -- covers the -- in detail what the complaint

         14   is.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Did you review a draft of this before it

         16   was filed?

         17        A.   I believe I did.

         18        Q.   Did you provide any comments on it?

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

         20   calls for privileged communications.

         21                  You can answer generally, yes or no.

         22        A.   I don't remember if I put any comments on it.

         23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And how long did you spend

         24   reviewing it?

         25        A.   I read through the document once; so an hour.

                                                                      112



          1        Q.   Okay.  Was there anything in it that surprised

          2   you?

          3        A.   No.  There was -- counted -- you know, some of

          4   the statements, I mean -- I guess, there was really -- no,

          5   nothing that surprised me in any way.  Some legal

          6   termination (sic) in there, but, no, I wasn't surprised at

          7   anything.

          8        Q.   Okay.  There -- do you believe that Walgreens

          9   made any material misstatements or misinformation during

         10   the proposed class period that aren't in this document?

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

         12   calls for a legal conclusion and calls for attorney/client

         13   privileged information.

         14                  Don't divulge anything that you've learned

         15   from us during litigation, but you can answer with that in

         16   mind.

         17        A.   All I can say is that there was more information

         18   in this document than I was aware of.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  And when you say there

         20   was more information in this -- in the complaint that you

         21   were aware of, do you mean prior to reading the complaint?

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   And in terms of information that you weren't

         24   previously aware of before reading the complaint, did that

         25   include the additional statements that were made by

                                                                      113



          1   Walgreens concerning the merger?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  I can correct that.

          4                  So in terms of information that you weren't

          5   previously aware of before reading the complaint, were

          6   there statements and disclosures by Walgreens or Rite Aid

          7   that are detailed in the complaint that you weren't

          8   previously aware of?

          9        A.   Yes, but I can't -- you know, if you ask me to

         10   recall any, I know that -- I don't know if it was written

         11   in this one, but there was -- I had read in one of the

         12   complaints that -- something to do with a plan B in one of

         13   the documents.  I'm not sure if this was it.

         14                  But there was -- there's a lot more

         15   information in here than I was aware of.  I was aware of

         16   primarily two items, and those are the two items I earlier

         17   disclosed.

         18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  And just to be clear

         19   then, so those two items are the special relationship

         20   statement --

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   -- that you recall and then no objection by the

         23   FTC statement that you recall?

         24        A.   Right.

         25        Q.   Okay.  Did you conduct any independent

                                                                      114



          1   investigation of the claims asserted in the complaint?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Again, outside of counsel?

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Outside of counsel.

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Other than the complaint, have

          7   you reviewed any of the filings in the action, this

          8   action?  And by filings I mean filings with the court.

          9        A.   I've read what my attorney provided me, and

         10   there were some filings.

         11        Q.   Do you know what those filings were?

         12        A.   I would have to see the document.  There

         13   was -- I've reviewed many, many documents.  So

         14   it's -- it's easier for me to see the document and read

         15   the title of the document so I can identify the document.

         16        Q.   Uh-huh.  Did you review any of the papers

         17   submitted to the courts in connection with any motion to

         18   certify the class that you seek to represent?

         19        A.   I believe so.

         20        Q.   Other than -- so I think we have the

         21   complaint -- you said previously that you reviewed the

         22   motion to dismiss in preparation for the deposition,

         23   correct?

         24        A.   Yes.

         25        Q.   Did you review the motion to dismiss filings

                                                                      115



          1   around the time that they were filed, or just in

          2   preparation for your deposition?

          3        A.   I don't know -- I don't know if -- if it's the

          4   time of the filing or -- I have no idea.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   I reviewed it, but I -- I don't know the time

          7   frame.

          8        Q.   Have you reviewed any reports by any experts

          9   that were submitted in connection with this action?

         10        A.   Just -- there was one report, but I didn't read

         11   the whole thing at the time.  I'm sure I can get another

         12   copy of the report submitted by Mr. Steinholdt, which was

         13   sort of like a forensic examination of the stock,

         14   regarding the history and day-to-day activity, purchase

         15   price.  So...

         16        Q.   And that wasn't one of the documents that you

         17   reviewed recently in connection with preparing for your

         18   deposition?

         19        A.   It was.

         20        Q.   Oh, it was.  Was that one of the documents that

         21   you reviewed yesterday?

         22                  I'm just going to say you can't look at

         23   your attorney.

         24        A.   Okay.

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  He can, especially when it

                                                                      116



          1   involves privileged information.

          2                  THE WITNESS:  No, I mean --

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  So you can answer yes or no

          4   and not beyond that.

          5        A.   Yeah, we looked at that.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is -- so previously I had asked

          7   you to identify the kind of -- in your list the documents

          8   that you reviewed yesterday in connection with preparing

          9   for your deposition, and you mentioned four categories.

         10   Are you now saying there's an additional, fifth?

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  He can testify about what --

         12   what refreshed his recollection.  He also said -- so

         13   you're misstating his testimony.  He said he doesn't

         14   remember exactly what he reviewed, but if you mention or

         15   show him documents, he can testify as to that.  So...

         16                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm going to object to the

         17   characterization of his testimony.  That's not what he

         18   said.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   But, in any event, so what

         20   refreshed your recollection now about reviewing this

         21   additional document?

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         23        A.   I thought it would eventually come up

         24   during -- I thought that that document would -- would come

         25   up.  But I didn't even think of -- because I've reviewed

                                                                      117



          1   multiple documents, so, quite frankly, I can't tell you in

          2   concession, you know, I reviewed this one, I reviewed that

          3   one.  It's very likely I'm liable to leave one or two out.

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  But I asked you earlier

          5   this morning for your best recollection --

          6        A.   That was my best --

          7        Q.   Okay.  You need to let me finish my question,

          8   Mr. Dayton.

          9        A.   Sure.

         10        Q.   Otherwise, it's much harder to get it down.

         11        A.   Sure.

         12        Q.   Okay.  So earlier this morning I asked you to

         13   list to the best of your recollection the set of documents

         14   that you reviewed just yesterday in connection with

         15   preparing for this deposition.  Do you recall that?

         16                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll object to the

         17   question in general, because he's -- because that's

         18   privileged information, and he can testify as to what

         19   refreshed his recollection.  And the questions are now

         20   bordering -- bordering on harassing, but go ahead.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   There's currently inconsistency

         22   in the testimony.  I'm offering you -- I'm offering you an

         23   opportunity to clarify.

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the

         25   characterization of -- there was no inconsistency.

                                                                      118



          1                  MS. ZALKA:  You need to keep your

          2   objections to speaking objections.  Okay?

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  But when you're

          4   mischaracterizing what he said, I've got to speak up.  But

          5   go ahead.

          6                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm not mischaracterizing what

          7   he said.  But, anyway, let's ask the witness.  That's what

          8   we're here for.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Mr. Dayton, I previously asked

         10   you to the best of your recollection to tell me about the

         11   documents that you reviewed yesterday in connection with

         12   preparing for the deposition.

         13                  Early this morning you answered that

         14   question, I assume it was to the best of your

         15   recollection, correct?

         16        A.   It was.

         17        Q.   So now you've identified after lunch an

         18   additional document that you reviewed yesterday, correct?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   That was the expert report of Mr. Steinholdt.

         21                  I'm simply asking you what refreshed your

         22   recollection about this additional document that you did

         23   not recall just this morning?

         24        A.   One of the questions that you -- one of the

         25   questions that you asked me.  I can't -- verbatim, you

                                                                      119



          1   know, I can't -- if you go back in our questioning, there

          2   was something that you said that sparked my memory.

          3        Q.   I see.  So when I asked the question about did

          4   you review any expert reports, that prompted, in your

          5   mind, oh, I actually forgot to mention that I did review

          6   that yesterday?

          7        A.   Well, there was the expert report that --

          8        Q.   I see.  Okay.  Thank you for clarifying.

          9        A.   Okay.

         10        Q.   Any other documents that you now recall in

         11   addition to reviewing yesterday?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Again, objection to

         13   attorney/client privileged information and work product,

         14   to the extent you're not asking what refreshed his

         15   recollection.

         16                  But you can -- you can answer.

         17        A.   As far as I know, that's the extent of the

         18   documents.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Do you have a retention

         20   agreement with your counsel?

         21        A.   I don't know.

         22        Q.   You don't know?

         23        A.   No.

         24        Q.   Do you know when you retained them?

         25        A.   Oh, that kind of agreement?  Well, I must have

                                                                      120



          1   one if I -- well, it was -- it was mentioned to me that my

          2   memory was -- was sort of fogged, and that I initially

          3   came to the -- the attorneys in 2015.

          4        Q.   When you say, It was mentioned to me that my

          5   memory was sort of fogged, what did you mean?

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  You can answer.

          7        A.   Right.  So the only thing that we had talked

          8   about, David and myself, during the lunch was that my

          9   recollection of the date of when I initially contacted

         10   them was incorrect.

         11                  I'm terrible with dates, I'm sorry.

         12   Sometimes I think the older you get, the worse you are

         13   with dates.  I'm -- I am absolutely terrible.  That's why

         14   when you ask me dates, I have a hard time with dates.  And

         15   the further back, it gets worse and worse.

         16                  MS. ZALKA:  Are you -- are you claiming

         17   privilege over that conversation?  Because if you are, I

         18   won't continue, but if you're not, then I will.

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  No, go ahead.

         20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So with respect to your memory

         21   being sort of fogged, did you raise this question to your

         22   attorney during the break?

         23        A.   So I don't remember where it came in.  I

         24   don't -- I don't think so.  I think the -- I don't

         25   remember raising it.

                                                                      121



          1        Q.   Okay.  So you don't remember raising this?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   So prior to the lunch break, did you think that

          4   you had anything incorrect in your testimony?

          5        A.   Well, I mean, there -- I wasn't sure about the

          6   date, and there's -- there's other dates that you asked me

          7   that I answered to the best of my ability of thinking what

          8   they are, but there could be some errors in -- in the

          9   dates.  I can't specifically name anything off the top of

         10   my head.  But that one was way off, as far as I thought it

         11   was after and it was actually before the -- the class

         12   action -- before the merger was broken off.

         13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What aspects --

         14        A.   Totally my -- my misunderstanding, my fault.

         15        Q.   Let's start here.

         16                  What aspects of your testimony from this

         17   morning do you want to correct?

         18        A.   That's -- I mean, to my recollection, that's it.

         19   But I'm not saying that something -- there might be

         20   another judgment in error -- you know, a judgment -- date

         21   judgment because, like I said, I'm terrible with the

         22   dates.

         23        Q.   What specifically are you correcting?

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  He just answered.

         25        A.   Nothing.  I'm not correcting anything other than

                                                                      122



          1   when I contacted the attorneys to pursue a case.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So when did you first

          3   contact attorneys to pursue a case?

          4        A.   It was sometime back in, I guess, 2015.

          5        Q.   Okay.  And what cases were you seeking to pursue

          6   at that time?  Again, I'm not asking for any --

          7        A.   This was --

          8        Q.   -- communications with your lawyers.  I'm asking

          9   you, you personally, what claim were you seeking to --

         10        A.   Right.

         11        Q.   -- pursue?

         12        A.   So I believe it was after the merger was

         13   announced, and I felt that $9 a share was too low.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Who did you contact?

         15        A.   The law firm that was in the news article.

         16        Q.   Okay.  And when you say that $9 a share was too

         17   low, you mean the $9 a share for the Rite Aid stock?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   Okay.  And that was in answer to the original

         20   merger agreement in October 2015?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   Did you -- were the claims that you were

         23   intending to pursue against Walgreens or Rite Aid or both?

         24        A.   At the time I -- I wanted Rite Aid -- I'm

         25   sorry -- I wanted Walgreens to pay more for the price of

                                                                      123



          1   the stock.  And actually, it goes both ways.

          2                  I didn't want Rite Aid to give in to

          3   Walgreens, because I felt the price was too low; and I

          4   wanted Walgreens to increase their price.  So it was

          5   actually two -- could go either way, twofold.  But I

          6   didn't think -- I would -- I would have thought it would

          7   have to be Rite Aid, because I'm the one that owns the

          8   Rite Aid stock, but I don't know.

          9        Q.   When you say you would have thought it would

         10   have to be Rite Aid --

         11        A.   That I would have to go after Rite Aid, because

         12   I own the stock, but I -- that might be an incorrect

         13   statement.

         14        Q.   Uh-huh.  And why would you think that you would

         15   have to go after Rite Aid, if it's Rite Aid stock?

         16        A.   Because I wanted them to hold out for more.  I

         17   didn't want them to give in to the $9 a share.  I felt

         18   that the stock was worth more than $9 a share.  And I got

         19   that information from reading news articles from various

         20   analysts that felt that -- that they could have paid more.

         21   There was room for increase.  I think it was saying like

         22   it was worth $11 or $12 a share, but -- something like

         23   that.

         24        Q.   So you were contemplating bringing claims

         25   against Rite Aid related to --

                                                                      124



          1        A.   Back then.

          2        Q.   -- the merger price consideration; is that

          3   correct?

          4        A.   Back then.

          5        Q.   Okay.  And were you -- and were you also

          6   contemplating bringing claims against Walgreens for that?

          7        A.   I don't think that came up.

          8        Q.   Were there any -- at this time in, I guess,

          9   after the merger was announced, in addition to wanting an

         10   increase in the merger consideration, were you

         11   contemplating bringing any claims related to disclosures

         12   that had been made concerning the deal?

         13                  MR. KNOTTS:  So this is before talking to

         14   attorneys.  So with that in mind, you can answer.

         15        A.   No, I was going by what I was reading in the

         16   news regarding what the analyst thought that the price of

         17   the stock should be.  Nothing that any of the insiders of

         18   the company was saying.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What happened with

         20   respect to the potential claims that you were considering?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  So don't divulge anything

         22   discussed with your attorneys.  If you can answer without

         23   doing that, go ahead, but if -- if it involves --

         24                  THE WITNESS:  All right.

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- discussions with attorneys,

                                                                      125



          1   I instruct you not to answer.

          2                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I would need an

          3   instruction and discussions with the attorney.

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  You said it would involve

          5   discussions --

          6                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- with attorneys?  Okay.

          8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   As a factual matter, did you --

          9   did you ultimately pursue these claims against Rite Aid?

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   Why not?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.  It calls

         13   for --

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   If you can answer outside of

         15   privileged communications --

         16                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, I think we just covered

         17   that, but --

         18        A.   I can't -- I can't answer --

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   That's fine.

         20                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

         21        A.   -- because -- yeah, I can't answer it.

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Did you have any

         23   conversations with anyone other than your attorneys

         24   concerning your contemplated claims back in, I guess, end

         25   of 2015?

                                                                      126



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.

          2        A.   I don't remember.  Not to my knowledge.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

          4        A.   Just a -- the only person I had talked to one

          5   time, and I had mentioned this earlier, was my mother.

          6        Q.   Okay.  Do you have an understanding of what your

          7   current -- current scope of your engagement is with

          8   counsel?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

         10   attorney/client privileged information.

         11                  To the extent you can answer without

         12   divulging conversations with us or the engagement

         13   agreement itself --

         14        A.   I don't know how -- I don't know how to answer.

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

         16                  (Exhibit 20 marked.)

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I am handing you what has been

         18   marked as Exhibit 20.

         19        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         20                  Okay.  I don't see where -- okay.  That's

         21   my -- my mother.

         22        Q.   Okay.  So that's my first question.  So

         23   jvecchia@webtv.net --

         24        A.   Yes.

         25        Q.   -- is that your mother's e-mail address?

                                                                      127



          1        A.   Yes.  She's -- that's her maiden name, Vecchia.

          2        Q.   And throbbs@aol.com, that's you?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   And --

          5        A.   And that was the only time I ever mentioned

          6   anything.

          7        Q.   What do you mean?

          8        A.   In regarding to suing Rite Aid.

          9        Q.   So this is the only communication that you had

         10   with anyone outside of your lawyers by e-mail?

         11        A.   To my knowledge, yes.

         12        Q.   Okay.  And I take it your mother is not a

         13   lawyer, so you weren't sending this to her for any legal

         14   advice?

         15        A.   No, no, not at all.

         16        Q.   Okay.

         17        A.   Not at all.  Yeah, she was -- just, you know,

         18   internal to the family.

         19        Q.   Do you know whether your mother discussed this

         20   with anybody else?

         21        A.   Oh, no.  She -- no.  She -- how long ago was

         22   this?  This was in 2015.  Yeah, she was in -- in her 90s

         23   there.  I don't even think she owns any stock.  So she

         24   really doesn't have any interest in stock.  No, she -- she

         25   didn't discuss this with anybody.

                                                                      128



          1        Q.   And do you know that for a fact or you're just

          2   surmising based on --

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well, objection, because it

          4   calls for speculation.

          5        A.   It is speculation.  I -- I mean, I would -- I

          6   would almost bet my life on it that she hasn't said

          7   anything to anybody.  I can't see where she -- where she

          8   would.  Because she didn't do much e-mails.  She didn't

          9   talk to anybody about it, as far as I know.  But it is

         10   speculation; I'm not there the entire time.  I'm not

         11   following her around.

         12                  But to do it -- there would be no

         13   interest -- she would have no interest in saying anything.

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why did you send her this

         15   e-mail?

         16        A.   Let's see.  Because I -- I was talking to her

         17   about it, and I said -- I was actually talking to her

         18   about it on the phone, and then later on I -- this is what

         19   I said.  And it's -- this is probably after I had -- yeah,

         20   this was after I had talked to the attorneys regarding a

         21   possible lawsuit.

         22        Q.   This is a yes or a no.  Did you discuss the

         23   content of your communications with your lawyers with your

         24   mother during that phone call?

         25        A.   No, not -- not during the phone call, no.

                                                                      129



          1        Q.   Okay.  So what did you discuss with your mother

          2   during the call about the fact that you were going to sue

          3   Rite Aid?

          4        A.   Nothing.  As far as I know, it was -- it was

          5   short and sweet.  It was basically -- I probably said to

          6   her, and I forget what -- something prompted me to say

          7   something to her why I was dissatisfied, and then this is

          8   what I came out with.

          9        Q.   Did you ever have any considerations with anyone

         10   else in your family concerning your communication with

         11   your lawyers?

         12        A.   Not to my knowledge.

         13                  MR. KNOTTS:  And -- just objection, because

         14   it mischaracterizes the prior testimony.  But, it's fine.

         15                  MS. ZALKA:  Fair.

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Did you have any communications

         17   with anyone in your family concerning your communications

         18   with your lawyers?

         19        A.   Communications, not to my knowledge.

         20        Q.   How frequently do you -- what's the -- strike

         21   that.

         22                  What steps do you take on an ongoing basis

         23   to monitor this litigation?  Again, not privileged

         24   communications, I'm just talking to you about what steps

         25   you take.

                                                                      130



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, so don't -- steps I

          2   think necessarily involves communications with counsel, so

          3   don't divulge the substance of our conversations, but you

          4   can answer, as long as you don't disclose the substance.

          5        A.   The only steps I take is when the counsel gets

          6   in contact with me directly.  You have to do this.  You

          7   have to read that.  Can you sign this?  And we're in

          8   direct contact.  But I don't -- I don't pursue anything

          9   regarding this.  I'm leaving this up to my attorney to

         10   handle all of that.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Do you recall filing a

         12   certification in this litigation?

         13        A.   I'm not sure what a certification is.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Do you recall having to file a statement

         15   concerning your prior experience as a plaintiff in a

         16   securities action, your transactions in Rite Aid stock?

         17        A.   I don't remember.

         18        Q.   Okay.

         19                  (Exhibit 21 marked.)

         20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm handing you what has been

         21   marked as Exhibit 21.

         22        A.   Oh, that.  Yeah, I remember that.

         23        Q.   Okay.  What is this document?

         24        A.   Certification of named plaintiff pursuant to

         25   federal security laws.  And, yes, I -- I remember this

                                                                      131



          1   document, yeah, and it had my number of shares.  Yeah.

          2   Oh, 8,000, and I said 7,000 before.

          3        Q.   What are you referencing?

          4        A.   In our early discussions I said I had 7,000

          5   shares during the period, but it was really 8,000.

          6        Q.   Oh, you're -- just for the record, you're

          7   referring to the securities transactions Schedule A that

          8   is on the second page?

          9        A.   Yes.  Yes.  I made a mistake; it was 8,000, not

         10   7,000.

         11        Q.   Does this accurately reflect the purchases of

         12   Rite Aid stock that you made during the proposed class

         13   period?

         14        A.   It does, except for one item here, this 24,650.

         15        Q.   Oh, I was actually referring to -- I was asking

         16   the transactions --

         17        A.   Oh, okay.

         18        Q.   -- on the Schedule A.

         19        A.   Yeah, this is -- this is correct.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Is there anything that's not correct in

         21   the certification?

         22        A.   Well, it -- it probably could have been worded a

         23   little differently.  So the number of shares that I own

         24   are -- if you look at the front, the item number 4, it

         25   says 24,650 shares.  That's actually not my total number

                                                                      132



          1   of shares.  It's 24,650 plus 8,000.

          2        Q.   So it's your testimony that, in fact, paragraph

          3   4 of your certification should read, Plaintiff holds

          4   32,650 shares?

          5        A.   You -- you could have worded it that way, yes.

          6        Q.   Well, I'm not asking --

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   I'm not trying to put words -- I'm asking you

          9   what --

         10        A.   That's how much I own.

         11        Q.   Okay.

         12        A.   So, yes.

         13                  So, basically, it's 24,650 in addition to

         14   what is listed in Schedule A.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever corrected that

         16   certification?

         17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

         18   needs correction.

         19                  But go ahead.

         20        A.   I didn't think it really needed -- I felt all

         21   the information was here, the number of shares, as well as

         22   the Schedule A; so, no, I never pursued to have it

         23   corrected.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Am I correct that you

         25   made no sales of Rite Aid stock during the class period?

                                                                      133



          1        A.   None.

          2        Q.   Have you made -- have you sold any Rite Aid

          3   stock since the end of June 2017?

          4        A.   No, because I would have a pretty major loss, so

          5   the answer is no.

          6        Q.   Let's talk about your transaction on June 20th,

          7   2017.

          8        A.   June 20th, okay.

          9        Q.   What information did you rely upon, consider, in

         10   connection with that specific decision to purchase 7,000

         11   shares of Rite Aid stock on June 20th?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, form, calls for a

         13   legal conclusion.

         14                  But you can answer.

         15        A.   The price had dropped to a point where I felt

         16   that it had gone low enough, and that the price would

         17   start increasing.  So you can see from January 2017, the

         18   price was $8.17, six -- six months later, it was $3.30.  I

         19   thought it was a good opportunity.

         20        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What analysis did you do to

         21   consider whether or not it was a good opportunity?

         22        A.   I -- I just look at the -- the -- I look at the

         23   chart -- the chart, the graph, okay, and, you know,

         24   just the -- the moving averages.  And mind you, I'm -- I'm

         25   no expert at this at all, and some of it's gut feeling.

                                                                      134



          1   And then, of course, you know, there's analysts.  I think

          2   I read a couple -- a couple news articles that they were

          3   saying that it was -- the price was low enough that it was

          4   considered a good buy.  So this is in the news.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Is there anything else that you

          6   considered, other than your gut feeling and a couple of

          7   news articles, along with the actual price of the stock,

          8   that you considered in deciding to make this purchase?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, and this has been

         10   asked and answered and covered throughout the day.

         11                  But you can answer.

         12        A.   Well, I mean, I thought the price was going to

         13   go up to -- you know, I thought the merger was still going

         14   to go through, so I thought the price was going to move

         15   higher.

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm asking you specifically

         17   with respect to what are the sources of information that

         18   you considered in connection with deciding to make this

         19   specific acquisition on June 20th.

         20                  So you've identified news articles, your

         21   gut feeling and the fact that the stock price was low.

         22                  Was there anything else --

         23        A.   No.

         24        Q.   -- that you recall --

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  And you just left out -- you

                                                                      135



          1   just left out what he testified to.

          2                  MS. ZALKA:  Let's -- don't object until the

          3   question and the answer has been done.

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So is there anything else that

          5   you considered in terms of a specific disclosure prior to

          6   the announcement by Walgreens or Rite Aid, that you

          7   considered in deciding to rely upon -- sorry; that you

          8   considered in deciding to purchase these 7,000 shares?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         10                  But you can answer.

         11        A.   No, I gave you all the -- no, I gave you all the

         12   information that I felt was correct.

         13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you say that I felt -- I

         14   gave you all the information that I felt was --

         15        A.   Yeah, those were the sources that I looked at to

         16   make my decision.

         17        Q.   Okay.  Can you list those sources again.

         18                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I just want to -- go ahead.

         20                  MR. KNOTTS:  I mean, you're asking him to

         21   repeat an answer that he already gave.  I mean, again, you

         22   can --

         23                  MS. ZALKA:  You know, David --

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- but you said could you list

         25   those sources again.  He listed them.

                                                                      136



          1                  But go ahead.

          2        A.   Okay.  Well, primarily news articles.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

          4        A.   Okay.  That is the primary source, okay.  And I

          5   also look at the stock chart, okay, and the volume of

          6   trades.  So those are primarily what I looked at.  A lot

          7   of it has to do with reading news articles and agreeing

          8   with some of the analysts' recommendations; this is why

          9   this is a good buy.

         10                  But I truly thought that the merger was

         11   going to go through, which is why I -- I guess, I

         12   purchased this stock, what, eight days before it was

         13   decided that the merger wouldn't go through.

         14                  So I must have really thought that it was

         15   going to go through.

         16        Q.   In connection with -- you mentioned there was

         17   some news articles and agreeing with some of the analysts'

         18   recommendations.

         19                  Do you recall, based on the news articles

         20   that you reviewed, there was a variety of different views

         21   by analysts?

         22        A.   There could have been.

         23        Q.   Which one did you agree with?

         24        A.   I don't know.  You're talking about quite a long

         25   time ago.  So something triggered my brain to go ahead and

                                                                      137



          1   purchase these stocks, okay, which I did.  And I can't

          2   recall exactly which article I was reading back in June

          3   20th, 2017.  I'm sorry; I just can't do that.

          4        Q.   Is there anything else that you can recall about

          5   what informed your decision to make this purchase on June

          6   20th, other than what you've already testified to?

          7        A.   No.  I gave you the full explanation.

          8        Q.   Okay.  And did you consult anybody --

          9        A.   No.

         10        Q.   -- in connection with the decision to purchase?

         11        A.   No.  No.

         12        Q.   Would you be able to identify or locate the

         13   press articles that you reviewed in connection with this

         14   decision to purchase?

         15        A.   I -- I'm not sure if -- if I did a search,

         16   and -- you know, I can't guarantee it's the correct

         17   article that I read three years ago.

         18                  You know, a lot -- some of these articles,

         19   it says the same thing over and over again.  I mean, I've

         20   even seen, you know, one -- one article -- you know, I've

         21   seen the same article with different headings on it.  So I

         22   can't point to an exact article.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Did you review any public statements by

         24   Walgreens in connection with your decision to make the

         25   purchase?

                                                                      138



          1        A.   I don't remember doing so.

          2        Q.   Okay.  Did you review any public statements by

          3   Rite Aid in connection with your decision to make this

          4   purchase?

          5        A.   No.  I just thought that the deal -- the merger

          6   was going to go through.  I was hopeful that the merger

          7   was going to go through.  That's the main reason why I

          8   purchased it.

          9        Q.   But ---

         10        A.   I was still -- I was still a believer that the

         11   merger would go through.

         12        Q.   What was that belief based on?

         13        A.   That Rite Aid and Walgreens would wait for the

         14   official decision from the FTC, instead of squashing the

         15   decision.  I was hoping for the official decision from the

         16   FTC, and there was never one that came through.  And there

         17   was some reports that they were -- FT -- that the Federal

         18   Trade Commission was shorthanded.  They only had a few

         19   people covering this, and they had a lot of other cases to

         20   cover.  So that's why I thought that there was a delay in

         21   the decision.  Okay.  And -- well, that's it.

         22        Q.   Was -- your belief, therefore, was not based on

         23   any public statements by Rite Aid or Walgreens that you

         24   can identify?

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

                                                                      139



          1        A.   Not -- not necessarily on that particular time

          2   that I did that purchase.  I felt that -- I felt that the

          3   stock had a lot of potential for movement upwards if the

          4   deal went through -- or I should say when the deal went

          5   through, not if.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why would you say -- why should

          7   you say when the deal went through rather than if the deal

          8   went through?

          9        A.   Because I purchased the stock thinking that the

         10   deal was going to go through.

         11        Q.   But you would recognize that it was a risk that

         12   the deal wouldn't go through, right?

         13        A.   With any stock purchase there's always a risk

         14   associated with it; so, yes, I realized there was a risk.

         15        Q.   Did you realize that one of the risks associated

         16   with your decision to purchase Rite Aid on June 20th was

         17   that the FTC would not approve the deal?

         18        A.   I thought that they would either approve the

         19   deal or come up with some other recommendation to divest

         20   some of their holdings in order to make the deal go

         21   through.

         22        Q.   Sure.  But my question was slightly different.

         23                  It was:  Did you understand when you

         24   purchased Rite Aid on June 20th, 2017, that one of the

         25   risks associated with that purchase would be that the FTC

                                                                      140



          1   did not approve the deal?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  You asked that question, but

          3   you can answer again -- or sorry; he answered that

          4   question.

          5                  Go ahead.

          6        A.   I -- I felt that it was a better chance of the

          7   deal going through than not going through.  Which --

          8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So by -- sorry; go ahead.

          9        A.   -- is why I purchased the stock on that date.  I

         10   would not have purchased the stock on the date if I didn't

         11   think the deal was going to go through.

         12        Q.   Sure.  But I think by you saying that you

         13   thought there was a better chance of the deal going

         14   through than not going through, obviously, you're

         15   recognizing that there's a risk that the deal was not

         16   going to go through?

         17        A.   Of course there was a risk.  I agree with that.

         18        Q.   Okay.

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   And did you understand all along that that was a

         21   risk, that the FTC might not approve the deal?

         22        A.   No, not all along.

         23        Q.   When did you first appreciate that there was a

         24   risk the deal would not go through -- be approved by the

         25   FTC?

                                                                      141



          1        A.   Heck, when I was -- way down the road, in -- in

          2   news articles.  It might have been one of the executives

          3   of Rite Aid also mentioning that the deal was in jeopardy.

          4   Then I started seeing more and more, as time went on, that

          5   they were talking more and more about the possible issues

          6   with the Federal Trade Commission.

          7                  They also said that they were shorthanded

          8   at the moment, which could be one of the reasons why

          9   the -- they did not come out with the official ruling.

         10        Q.   So --

         11        A.   I was waiting for the official ruling.

         12        Q.   In terms of when you first appreciated a risk of

         13   the deal not being approved by the FTC, you said that that

         14   was way down the road and it might have been mentioned by

         15   one of the executives of Rite Aid, and that you started to

         16   see more and more as time went on that they were talking

         17   more and more about possible issues with the FTC.

         18                  Who's the they who were talking more and

         19   more as time went on about possible issues with the FTC?

         20        A.   Various stock analysts.

         21        Q.   And what were the issues that they were

         22   mentioning?

         23        A.   Well, it was mentioned that there was a risk of

         24   going through, but it was also mentioned that there was a

         25   good possibility that the Federal Trade Commission would

                                                                      142



          1   come back and -- and require additional concessions.  And

          2   that's what I thought could possibly happen, if the -- if

          3   it -- you know, if the deal didn't go through, they say,

          4   well, you know, you have to -- you have to sell 1,000

          5   stores, and we'll let the deal go through or -- and -- but

          6   that didn't happen.

          7        Q.   And I know you're bad with dates, I understand

          8   that.

          9                  When, though -- do you have -- can you give

         10   me any insight to when you first started to appreciate the

         11   risk that the FTC would not approve the deal based on what

         12   you were observing kind of in the news articles?

         13        A.   I don't -- I don't remember the dates, to tell

         14   you the truth.  I'd be speculating.

         15        Q.   Okay.  So if we think about it maybe in terms

         16   of, right, the deal was announced October 2015; fast

         17   forward a year to October 2016.

         18                  Do you recall it being kind of before or

         19   after --

         20        A.   No.  I --

         21        Q.   -- October 2016?

         22        A.   It was after October 2016.

         23        Q.   Okay.  And do you think it was in the end of

         24   2016 or the beginning of 2017?

         25        A.   Well, no, closer towards the end of June 2017.

                                                                      143



          1   You know, I was reading some articles that there was

          2   a -- some possibility that it would not go through.  But,

          3   then again, I felt that it would go through.

          4        Q.   Uh-huh.  You testified that -- I asked you the

          5   question:  When did you first appreciate there was a risk

          6   that the deal would not be approved by the FTC?  And you

          7   answered:  Heck, way down the road, in news articles, it

          8   may have been one of the executives of Rite Aid mentioning

          9   that the deal was in jeopardy.  Then I started to see more

         10   and more as time went on, they were talking more and more

         11   about the possible issues with the FTC.

         12                  So are you suggesting that that was at the

         13   end of the -- in June 2017, or before that?

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, vague.  Uncertain,

         15   but go ahead.

         16        A.   More towards the end.

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So when?

         18        A.   I don't -- I can't give you that information.

         19        Q.   Do you think it was before or after the

         20   amendment to the Merger Agreement in January?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Of?

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   There was only one, but January

         23   of 2017?

         24        A.   I believe after.

         25        Q.   Okay.  Do you recall learning about the

                                                                      144



          1   amendment of the Merger Agreement in January 2017?

          2        A.   I remember reading about the agreement.  And if

          3   you're referring to the amendment to the agreement, is

          4   that where the price goes from the $7 to 6.50?

          5        Q.   Yes.

          6        A.   Yeah, I remember that.

          7        Q.   Okay.

          8        A.   I don't know when I read it, but I read it.

          9        Q.   Do you think that would have been -- do you

         10   think that that was something that you learned about

         11   relatively close to when it was publicly disclosed?

         12        A.   I don't -- I don't understand the question.

         13        Q.   Okay.  So you said you don't recall when you

         14   learned about it?

         15        A.   I do not recall when I learned about it, no.  I

         16   don't know the date.

         17        Q.   Okay.  And so my follow-up question was:  Well,

         18   if it was publicly disclosed in the end of January, do you

         19   think that you learned about it around the same time that

         20   it was publicly announced, or it could have been months

         21   later?

         22        A.   It would have been after.  I mean, it's -- I

         23   don't know.  I did read about the stock quite frequently,

         24   so -- but I don't know the -- I don't know the time

         25   period.

                                                                      145



          1        Q.   What was your reaction to learning about the

          2   amendment to the Merger Agreement?

          3        A.   Well, I thought they were doing that

          4   specifically to get approval from the FTC, because I

          5   assumed that they were talking to the FTC.  The FTC said

          6   we're not going to approve this unless you lower the

          7   number of stores, and low -- lower the price of the

          8   -- and -- so, I mean, I wasn't happy about it, because it

          9   went from $9 to 6.50 a share.  There's -- but I -- there

         10   wasn't much I could do about it.

         11        Q.   At that point in time, did the update to the

         12   amendment to the Merger Agreement give you any indication

         13   that there could possibly be issues with the FTC process?

         14        A.   Well, when they -- when they changed -- when

         15   they changed their plan, yeah, I thought there could have

         16   been issues with the process -- or the approval by the

         17   FTC.

         18        Q.   What were the issues that you thought existed at

         19   that time?

         20        A.   Well, I mean, basically that Rite Aid

         21   would -- no, I'm sorry -- Walgreens would have become the

         22   number one pharmacy, well ahead of CVS.  So I thought that

         23   they were just trying to level the playing field, per se,

         24   to lower the number of stores.  And since they were

         25   lowering the number of stores, it only -- it only shows

                                                                      146



          1   that you would have to lower -- probably lower the price,

          2   because they're not buying as many stores now.

          3                  So it's not as valuable to Rite Aid because

          4   the number of stores were lowered.

          5        Q.   I guess at the time of the -- you -- at the time

          6   you learned about the amendment to the Merger Agreement,

          7   did that change your view in any way about the risk that

          8   the FTC might not approve the deal?

          9        A.   I knew that there was a risk going into this.

         10   Okay.  And it's just like any merger, there's always a

         11   risk that it may not go through.

         12        Q.   Now, when you said you knew there was a risk

         13   going into this, do you mean in connection with your

         14   investment in Rite Aid?

         15        A.   With -- just in general, with any merger.  Okay.

         16   I know there's a risk with any merger.  And Rite Aid would

         17   be no different than -- than any merger.  But, again, the

         18   fact that I bought stock eight days prior to the deal

         19   being called off, I thought the deal was actually going to

         20   happen.

         21        Q.   But you appreciated the risk that it would not?

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         23        A.   I said yes.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

         25                  (Sotto voce discussion between Ms. Zalka

                                                                      147



          1                  and Ms. Provey.)

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Did you review any public

          3   statements by Fred's between 2015 and 2017?

          4        A.   Not -- not necessarily specifically only by

          5   Fred's executives.  A lot of it was just in news articles

          6   about Fred's.  You know, I thought it was a smart thing at

          7   the beginning, you know, when Fred's was going to buy the

          8   Rite Aid stores.  And even if they had to divest even more

          9   stores, that they were willing to buy up all the stores

         10   that Rite Aid had.

         11                  And I got some information about it, but I

         12   wasn't -- I wasn't following Fred's all the time.  The

         13   only time I would follow Fred's is if more than one

         14   company was mentioned in the news articles, it would come

         15   over to my e-mail.  So if somebody was writing an article

         16   about Fred's and they put RAD in there or they put

         17   Walgreens in there, it would come to my e-mail -- it would

         18   come to my Ameritrade trade account, because it's the same

         19   symbol.

         20        Q.   Did you have news alerts set up, whereby you

         21   would receive e-mails with like a summary of the --

         22        A.   No, I had no alerts set up my account.

         23        Q.   So when you said you would get an e-mail, what

         24   did you mean?

         25        A.   So -- so when there's an article, okay, if

                                                                      148



          1   someone's writing about Fred's, and F-R-E-D is the symbol,

          2   I believe, Fred's -- so if I own Fred's stock, I would --

          3   if I went into the Fred's -- if I clicked on Fred's, that

          4   e-mail would show up -- not e-mail -- that news release

          5   would show up, okay.

          6                  So if there was -- if there was an article

          7   that mentioned Fred's, mentioning Rite Aid, and/or

          8   mentioning Walgreens, okay, that would show up in my RAD

          9   folder for Ameritrade.

         10                  So many times I would get e-mails regarding

         11   Fred's because Rite Aid was men -- also mentioned in the

         12   same article.

         13        Q.   Did you -- did you get an e-mail alert -- strike

         14   that.

         15        A.   I don't get any alerts.

         16        Q.   I was going to say strike the word alerts.

         17                  I'm trying to understand, if there was an

         18   article that mentioning -- let's just take Rite Aid, an

         19   article mentioning Rite Aid, and you said that would show

         20   up in your RAD folder for Ameritrade, would you then get

         21   e-mails regarding --

         22        A.   No.

         23        Q.   -- that?

         24        A.   No e-mails.

         25        Q.   So your testimony was:  So many times I would

                                                                      149



          1   get e-mails regarding Fred's because Rite Aid was also

          2   mentioned in the same article?

          3        A.   Then I corrected myself.

          4        Q.   Okay.

          5        A.   And I said news.  It's news.  I --

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  I think he said -- he said

          7   e-mails and then he said news --

          8                  THE WITNESS:  Right.

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- and I think you used the

         10   word e-mails again.  So...

         11                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

         12                  MS. ZALKA:  Yeah.

         13        A.   So I never get any e-mails.  It's all news.

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

         15        A.   Okay.  It's all news.

         16        Q.   Okay.  So when you say news, this is what

         17   appears in your RAD folder?

         18        A.   In my -- in my account, yes.

         19        Q.   Okay.  In the RAD folder in your Ameritrade

         20   account, how long does it retain these articles?

         21        A.   Okay.  I've gone back to look for articles, you

         22   know, and it only goes -- it can only go back, like, two

         23   or three months at the most.  I'm not sure if it's

         24   time-related or the number of news releases that there

         25   are.  Like, perhaps, you know, if one particular company,

                                                                      150



          1   there's not much news, there may only be 20 over a period

          2   of a year.

          3                  So I think it's the number -- I don't

          4   necessarily know if it's the day or the number that's in

          5   your -- that's in your -- your RAD folder, as an example.

          6                  I don't know as far as differentiating

          7   between a date or the number of articles in your folder.

          8        Q.   When you asked Ameritrade to collect certain

          9   documents for purpose of this litigation, did you ask them

         10   to collect what had been in your RAD folder either

         11   currently or historically?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

         13                  But go ahead.

         14        A.   I only asked them for my statements.

         15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

         16                  MR. KNOTTS:  We've been going about an

         17   hour.  It looks like you're about to introduce a new

         18   document.  Is this a good time to take a break?

         19                  MS. ZALKA:  Sure, if you want to break.

         20                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah.

         21                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

         22   2:45 p.m.

         23                  (Recess in the proceedings from 2:45

         24                  to 2:59 p.m.)

         25                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on record at

                                                                      151



          1   2:59 p.m.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm handing you what has been

          3   marked as Exhibit 23.

          4                  (Exhibit 23 marked.)

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Thanks.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  This is Bates-stamped

          7   PLAINT0001974 to 1975.

          8        A.   Uh-huh.

          9        Q.   Do you recognize this e-mail?

         10        A.   Yeah, that's my brother.

         11        Q.   Let's start at the bottom of the chain, which is

         12   at 1975.

         13        A.   Uh-huh.

         14        Q.   So on Monday, June 26th, at 6:27 p.m., you write

         15   to your brother; is that correct?

         16        A.   Yeah, possibly.  Yes, uh-huh.

         17        Q.   That's your e-mail address, throbbs@aol.com,

         18   and that's your brother's e-mail address,

         19   cliffordherkin@aol.com?

         20        A.   Yeah.

         21        Q.   Okay.  And you write, My Rite Aid stock really

         22   went up a lot today?

         23        A.   Uh-huh.  Yeah.

         24        Q.   Why did you send this e-mail to your brother?

         25        A.   Because -- very well -- my brother thinks he

                                                                      152



          1   knows everything about investing in stocks, so I just want

          2   him -- I just wanted him just to get off my back.  I don't

          3   know; did it go up that day?  I would have to look.

          4        Q.   Was your brother on your back about your Rite

          5   Aid investment?

          6        A.   No, he -- he -- it's many, many different stocks

          7   that he -- that's all that he likes -- he likes to do a

          8   lot of trading.  He's retired and he does a lot of

          9   trading, okay.  But I never -- I never ask him for any

         10   trading advice, okay.

         11                  Because, you know, first of all, I don't

         12   think -- I don't take advice from other people, and I'm

         13   certainly not going to take advice from my brother.  And

         14   he -- and I -- and he's the one that -- even though it's

         15   not here, I think he's the one that initially sent the

         16   original e-mail for me to respond to.

         17        Q.   What do you mean?

         18        A.   I don't know -- I didn't just re -- I don't

         19   think I just responded to this out of the blue.  I think

         20   there's -- maybe there's something before this.

         21        Q.   You think there was another e-mail --

         22        A.   I don't know.

         23        Q.   Okay.

         24        A.   It was 2017, okay.  And I might have even told

         25   him just to get off -- just to not to have to hear from

                                                                      153



          1   him, you know, I might have even told him, hey, I sold my

          2   stock, just so I didn't have to hear his advice, because

          3   he always -- he thinks he's a mister know-it-all.

          4   There's -- there's really no love lost between my brother

          5   and me.  So I don't -- I don't take his advice.  I would

          6   never take his advice.  If he told me to purchase

          7   something, I would not -- I wouldn't purchase it just for

          8   the fact that he told me to purchase it.

          9                  So I'm not sure -- so I'm not sure -- I

         10   mean, the stock must have gone up, because it's -- I said

         11   it went up.

         12        Q.   And what did you understand from your brother's

         13   response?

         14        A.   I don't know what calls and puts are.

         15        Q.   Okay.

         16        A.   Okay.

         17        Q.   Do you know what the next sentence means?

         18        A.   This is his analysis, and, you know, if it -- if

         19   the paper was softer, I would use it for another purpose.

         20   So he -- I don't -- he does this for -- he does this in

         21   his spare time at home, and I don't -- he -- he's retired.

         22   I don't have time to monitor stocks in this way.

         23   Basically, you know what I do; I buy stock and I hope that

         24   the price goes up.  I don't do calls.  I don't do puts.

         25   I -- I know nothing about them, okay.

                                                                      154



          1                  You -- you have my trading documentation.

          2   You will never see any calls or puts.  It's just I'm

          3   either buying where I think that the stock is going to go

          4   up.  Once in a blue moon, I'll buy it short thinking the

          5   stock's going to go down.  But I don't do that anymore,

          6   because I lost my shirt on Netflix.

          7                  So this -- this right here, I can tell you

          8   that I didn't -- I probably didn't even read the whole

          9   e-mail.

         10        Q.   Okay.  Sitting here today --

         11        A.   Huh?

         12        Q.   Sitting here today, can you tell me what is your

         13   understanding of what your brother wrote?

         14        A.   No, because I don't understand the terminology.

         15        Q.   Okay.

         16        A.   I don't understand the terminology.  All right.

         17   Leave the gap between 350 and 400.  125,000 calls.  Well,

         18   I don't know what a call is.  To be honest, I don't, okay.

         19        Q.   Uh-huh.

         20        A.   And I certainly -- you know, I work all day.

         21   You know, a lot of times nine hours a day, ten hours a

         22   day, and I don't have time to be doing all this.  I'd

         23   probably get fired if I was online all day long trying to

         24   trade calls and puts.

         25                  So I just -- I'm a simple trader.  The

                                                                      155



          1   stock is going to go up or it's going to go down.

          2                  But I was -- you know, 99 percent of the

          3   time, all my stocks pretty much I'm buying with the

          4   expectation that I'm buying low and selling high.

          5        Q.   When you bought your Rite Aid stock during the

          6   class period, so that 8,000 shares purchased on January

          7   3rd, 1,000 shares and then June 20th, 7,000 shares, were

          8   you intending to hold them for the long-term?

          9        A.   Towards the -- at end or during the whole

         10   period?

         11        Q.   We can take it one by one.  I guess, you know,

         12   when you purchased 1,000 Rite Aid shares on January 3rd,

         13   2017 --

         14        A.   Right.

         15        Q.   -- were you intending to hold those shares for

         16   the long-term?

         17        A.   Well, they had already announced the merger, so,

         18   no, I was -- I was planning on -- when -- I was hoping

         19   when the news came through, okay, I would be bought out.

         20        Q.   Uh-huh.

         21        A.   I don't even -- it wasn't even a matter of a

         22   stock swap; it was a complete buy out.  So, no, I was -- I

         23   was not -- at this point, I was not planning on a

         24   long-term investment when I made those purchases.

         25        Q.   Okay.  Let's go back to the e-mail with your

                                                                      156



          1   brother.

          2        A.   Uh-huh.  Yeah.

          3        Q.   So you write on June 29th at 9:48 a.m.

          4                  Do you see that?

          5                  You write, I sold my positions yesterday

          6   near the high?

          7        A.   Yeah, just to get him off my -- my back.

          8        Q.   That was not an accurate statement?

          9        A.   That was an inaccurate statement --

         10        Q.   Okay.

         11        A.   -- just to get him off my back.  Okay.  So this

         12   way I don't have to hear from him anymore.

         13                  MR. KNOTTS:  Did it work?

         14                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Sorry.

         16                  THE WITNESS:  It did.

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And you did not sell any Rite

         18   Aid stock, correct?

         19        A.   I, honest to God, never sold any Rite Aid stock.

         20        Q.   Okay.

         21        A.   And my portfolio will show that.

         22        Q.   So do you write again at 10:59 a.m., they backed

         23   out of the merger because they were afraid of not getting

         24   approval by the FTC?

         25        A.   Yes.

                                                                      157



          1        Q.   Who's the they in that sentence?

          2        A.   Well, both Walgreens and Rite Aid.

          3        Q.   Okay.  What was this statement that you make

          4   here based on?

          5        A.   Well, wasn't this after it was announced that it

          6   wouldn't be approved?

          7        Q.   Do you think there was disclosure that it

          8   wouldn't get approved?

          9        A.   This is after the date, right?

         10        Q.   So June 29th, 2017, in terms of the termination

         11   of the merger agreement?

         12        A.   Right.

         13        Q.   Yes.

         14        A.   So that -- that's why I wrote it.

         15        Q.   But was there anything specific that led you to

         16   believe that they backed out because they were afraid of

         17   not getting approval by the FTC?

         18        A.   Yeah, there was news articles that day that

         19   that's the reason they backed out.

         20        Q.   Did you review either Rite Aid's or Walgreens'

         21   issued disclosures that day?

         22        A.   Not -- not the company disclosures --

         23        Q.   Yeah.

         24        A.   -- just the news articles.

         25        Q.   Okay.  Did you have any other communications

                                                                      158



          1   with your brother concerning Walgreens or Rite Aid, to the

          2   best of your recollection?

          3        A.   I'm almost sure that I didn't.  I don't remember

          4   for sure, but I think this -- I think this might have been

          5   the extent of it.  And then after I told him I liquidated,

          6   I don't think it came up anymore after that.  Then what he

          7   probably did, he probably sent me something about another

          8   stock; hey, you got to buy this stock.  It's like, okay,

          9   Gary.

         10        Q.   Did your brother hold Rite Aid stock?

         11        A.   Yeah, I think he did.  He did purchase Rite Aid

         12   stock.  Don't ask me how much or how many puts, or

         13   whatever, I have no idea.  He did it after -- to my

         14   knowledge, he -- I could have sworn he did his after.  Or

         15   but maybe not.  Does it say that he -- does it say that he

         16   -- he bought it here.

         17                  (Witness reviews document.)

         18                  No.  He's giving me advice on what I should

         19   do, but I don't think he bought any at this point in time.

         20   I think when he bought it, it was after the merger was

         21   called off.  And -- but -- but, yeah, I remember him

         22   telling me that he bought some, but I don't know what the

         23   date was.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Does your brother know that you're a

         25   named plaintiff in this lawsuit?

                                                                      159



          1        A.   Later on, but not -- as far as I know, not then.

          2   Later on.  I just mentioned it to him.  I didn't show him

          3   any documents or anything like that.  Whatever it was --

          4   any discussion I had, it was within my family.  And they

          5   weren't detailed discussions by any means.

          6        Q.   Have you had any discussions with your brother

          7   about kind of the substance of your complaints against

          8   Walgreens?

          9        A.   No.

         10        Q.   Do you know whether your brother's shares -- has

         11   your brother expressed any views to you about any

         12   statements made by Walgreens or Rite Aid about the deal?

         13        A.   No, not to my knowledge.

         14        Q.   Let's mark Exhibit 22.

         15                  (Exhibit 22 marked.)

         16        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         17                  Okay.

         18        Q.   Do you recognize this document?

         19        A.   I'm not sure if I did.  I didn't read it all,

         20   because it was way, way too much information here.  I

         21   don't remember.

         22        Q.   So let me clarify the question.  I'm not asking

         23   you for purposes of the litigation nor any communications

         24   you had with your lawyers about disclosures.

         25                  I'm asking kind of about the time in

                                                                      160



          1   October -- you know, between October 2015 and June 2017 --

          2        A.   So --

          3        Q.   Let me --

          4        A.   Uh-huh.

          5        Q.   -- start with that premise of when I'm asking

          6   you questions about have you reviewed something, it's in

          7   the context, you know, of that time period, October 2015

          8   through June 2017?

          9        A.   Right, okay.  So if you're referring to that I

         10   took it upon myself to look this particular document up --

         11        Q.   Yes.

         12        A.   -- and review it; no, I did not.

         13        Q.   Okay.  So if I can turn to -- turn to page 11.

         14        A.   (Witness complies.)

         15        Q.   Are you familiar with what the risk factors are

         16   that a public company discloses, generally?

         17        A.   Well, I know there's risk factors.  I assume

         18   they have that disclosed, what they are.

         19                  Page 11?

         20        Q.   Yes.  And you'll see at the top it says -- and

         21   just for the record, this is the Form 10-K for fiscal year

         22   ended August 31st, 2016, filed by Walgreens Boots

         23   Alliance, Inc.

         24                  You'll see at the top it says a -- it's in

         25   the risk factors section.  It says, We may not be able to

                                                                      161



          1   successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of

          2   Rite Aid.

          3                  Do you see that?

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Oh, I think you just need to (indicating).

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Which page?

          7                  MS. ZALKA:  Page 11.

          8                  MR. KNOTTS:  All right.

          9        A.   What paragraph?

         10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   The very top of the page.

         11        A.   Okay.  We may not be able to successfully and

         12   timely complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid.

         13                  Okay.  Yeah, that was -- I don't remember

         14   seeing that in this document.  But what's your question?

         15        Q.   Okay.  If you turn to the first paragraph.  It

         16   says, Risks and uncertainties related to our pending

         17   acquisition of Rite Aid, include, among others, the

         18   occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that

         19   could give rise to the termination of the merger

         20   agreement, including that regulatories or other approvals

         21   required for the transaction are not obtained.

         22                  Do you see that?

         23        A.   Uh-huh.

         24        Q.   Did you understand at the time that Walgreens

         25   had disclosed this risk that regulatory or other approvals

                                                                      162



          1   might not be obtained?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

          3                  Go ahead.

          4        A.   I did not read this particular document to see

          5   that.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You don't dispute, though, that

          7   that was a disclosure that Walgreens made, right?

          8        A.   I'm assuming that this filing is correct, so I

          9   would agree.

         10        Q.   Okay.

         11        A.   What's the date of this filing?

         12        Q.   This is for the fiscal year ending October 31st,

         13   2016.

         14        A.   Okay.

         15        Q.   And if you could just go on to the next

         16   paragraph.

         17        A.   Uh-huh.

         18        Q.   And you can take a minute to read it, and then

         19   I'll ask you questions.

         20        A.   The completion of the transaction; that one?

         21        Q.   Yep.

         22        A.   Okay.

         23                  (Witness reviews document.)

         24                  Okay.

         25        Q.   So Walgreens disclosed that in deciding whether

                                                                      163



          1   or not to object to the transaction, regulatory agencies

          2   have broad discretion in administrating the applicable

          3   government regulation --

          4                  Yes.  Sorry; when I'm reading, I go faster.

          5                  And it goes on to say that, We can provide

          6   no assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals

          7   on any particular time table, or at all, or that any such

          8   conditions that are imposed would not diminish the

          9   anticipated benefits of the transaction, or result in the

         10   termination of the transaction.

         11                  Do you see that?

         12        A.   Yeah.

         13        Q.   Did you understand that as a disclosed risk by

         14   Walgreens during the period?

         15        A.   Well, I mean, this -- a lot of this, to me,

         16   looks like a canned statement that you -- you would see in

         17   any 10-K form, some wording similar to that, because you

         18   have to disclose what the risks are.

         19        Q.   And in your view, is Walgreens disclosing what

         20   the risks are in that statement, as you sit here today?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for a legal

         22   conclusion, calls for speculation.

         23                  Go ahead.

         24        A.   Well, they're -- they're mentioning -- you know,

         25   it's just like forward-looking statements that you see --

                                                                      164



          1   they're -- this is what this is, basically, this is a

          2   forward-looking statement that I would expect any company

          3   to put out.

          4                  So, yes, I understand that they -- that

          5   they would have a statement like this.  I did not read

          6   this statement.

          7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And I'm asking -- I understand

          8   that you didn't read the statement at the time, but I'm

          9   asking, sitting here today, based on what you were

         10   reading, right, of the words that were disclosed, does

         11   this disclose the risk that Walgreens may not timely or

         12   successfully get regulatory approval for the Rite Aid

         13   deal?

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for a legal

         15   conclusion, calls for speculation.

         16                  You can answer.

         17        A.   Yes -- yeah, this is saying that there is risks.

         18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Risks of what?

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objections.

         20        A.   That the deal may not go through.  It's like

         21   any -- any merger there's always a risk that the deal is

         22   not going to go through.

         23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

         24        A.   And I just look at this as, you know, the

         25   forward-looking statement that would be in any legal

                                                                      165



          1   document.

          2        Q.   Do you not rely on forward-looking statements or

          3   consider them?

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

          5                  MS. ZALKA:  I'll object for -- I'll strike

          6   that.

          7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you consider the disclosures

          8   the companies make with respect to the risks --

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   -- that face them?

         11        A.   Yes.  I -- I -- I take -- might take it with a

         12   little grain of salt, but, yeah, I mean, I can appreciate

         13   the fact that they're putting this in here.

         14        Q.   What do you appreciate about it?

         15        A.   Well, there's some -- you know, they're --

         16   they're disclosing somewhat, but it's just -- again, it's

         17   a canned forward-looking statement that you would see in

         18   any document.  So...

         19        Q.   What do you mean when you say, Canned

         20   forward-looking statement?

         21        A.   Well, you can almost take Rite Aid out and put

         22   any other company's name in here, change the -- some of

         23   the dollar amounts and some of the percentages, and dates,

         24   and it could be any company.

         25        Q.   Well, this wasn't a disclosure about any

                                                                      166



          1   company, this was a disclosure by Walgreens about the

          2   pending acquisition of Rite Aid, correct?

          3        A.   Yes.  Now that you provided me with this

          4   document, I understand that.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   But this is the first time I've seen this

          7   statement.

          8        Q.   And I'm just asking you, and I understand you

          9   didn't read it at the time, but now kind of sitting here

         10   today, one of the risks that you think Walgreens didn't

         11   disclose with relation to the FTC approval on the

         12   acquisition of Rite Aid --

         13                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for a legal

         14   conclusion.  I'll instruct you not --

         15        A.   I don't know what the --

         16                  MS. ZALKA:  No, no.

         17                  MR. KNOTTS:  Hold on.  Hold on.  Just let

         18   me finish my objection.

         19                  I'll instruct you not to answer to the

         20   extent it involves things you learned from us during the

         21   lawsuit, but you can answer to the extent you have had an

         22   understanding coming in yourself.

         23        A.   I don't have an answer for you.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I'm not asking for anything

         25   that your lawyers told you.

                                                                      167



          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Right?  Just to be clear, I'm not trying to get

          3   at privileged information.  I'm actually more interested

          4   in what your understanding is of this disclosure.

          5                  And so having read it now, sitting here

          6   today, what do you think that Walgreens did not disclose

          7   in terms of the risks related to FTC approval of the Rite

          8   Aid transaction?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  And same objections.  You

         10   know, don't disclose anything you learned from us or in

         11   connection with this lawsuit, but you can answer based on

         12   your own independent understanding.

         13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Correct.

         14        A.   Well, they're documents what the risks are in

         15   this particular document.  And I would expect something

         16   like that in any legal document.  That's it.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So what were the risks -- having read

         18   this document now, what were the risks that you think

         19   Walgreens did not disclose concerning the possibility that

         20   the FTC would not approve the transaction?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  The question's been asked

         22   three times.  Same objection, don't disclose anything that

         23   you learned from your attorneys during the lawsuit, but

         24   you can answer to the extent you have anything to add to

         25   what you said previously.

                                                                      168



          1        A.   I thought they would have -- they would have had

          2   the press releases earlier on about the difficulties that

          3   they were having with the merger.  I didn't see that.

          4   Okay.

          5                  This says that it's possible it may not go

          6   through.  But there were -- evidently there were

          7   discussions and Rite Aid -- not Rite Aid -- Walgreens knew

          8   earlier on that this deal may not go through.  But

          9   I -- it's my interpretation, my understanding that they

         10   waited to announce the issue -- announce that the deal may

         11   not go through.

         12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   This --

         13        A.   Officially announce.

         14        Q.   What do you mean officially announce the deal

         15   would not go through?

         16        A.   Well, I think they knew the deal wouldn't go

         17   through earlier than it was formally announced.

         18        Q.   Okay.  How much earlier?

         19        A.   I don't know.

         20        Q.   Roughly?

         21        A.   I don't know.

         22        Q.   Are you talking a matter of months?

         23        A.   Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it could be.

         24        Q.   Weeks or months?

         25        A.   Well, I think it could be several weeks.

                                                                      169



          1        Q.   But not several months?

          2        A.   Right.

          3        Q.   Okay.  So you believe that Walgreens knew that

          4   the FTC wouldn't approve the deal several weeks before it

          5   was formally announced, but not several months before it

          6   was formally announced?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll ask you not to

          8   divulge things that we've talked about or you've learned

          9   from your attorneys.  She's just asking you about your

         10   understanding going into this case.  Right?

         11                  MS. ZALKA:  Uh-huh.

         12        A.   That was my understanding.

         13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Is that your

         14   understanding currently?

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.  She's not

         16   asking for things that we've talked about, or that you've

         17   learned from us.  But you can answer your own personal

         18   understanding coming into the case.

         19        A.   Yes, I think it could have been weeks and not

         20   months.  I certainly hope it wasn't months.  But I do know

         21   that there was the time extension.  And I think the

         22   duration of that time extension, they may have had a good

         23   idea, whatever the duration of that time extension is.

         24   And I don't remember what the duration of the time

         25   extension is.

                                                                      170



          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you say, The time

          2   extension, are you referring to the amendment of the

          3   Merger Agreement in January or something else?

          4        A.   The second one.  I think there was a -- there

          5   was a second plan.  This -- this wasn't the original

          6   agreement.  This was -- there was an extension on the

          7   agreement.  I don't know when the date of the extension

          8   was, but I was -- you know, I was waiting for the Federal

          9   Trade Commission report on this.  And then an article came

         10   out that said that there's been an extension.  And as far

         11   as I know, it was a several-month extension.

         12                  And I don't know that they -- if they knew

         13   then that the deal wouldn't go through, or if it was a few

         14   weeks before the deal wouldn't go through.  I don't know.

         15   I don't have access to that information.  I just don't

         16   know.

         17        Q.   Uh-huh.  Now, you mentioned that you recall --

         18   that the only thing you recall reviewing in terms of a

         19   disclosure by Walgreens during the 2016 and 2017 period

         20   was between one and five press releases.

         21                  Do you recall that from this morning?

         22        A.   Yeah.

         23        Q.   Okay.  I want to show you the press release to

         24   see if that helps refresh your recollection about which

         25   specific press releases you may have reviewed or you did,

                                                                      171



          1   in fact, review.  Okay?

          2        A.   Uh-huh.

          3                  (Exhibit 24 marked.)

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm handing you what has been

          5   marked as Exhibit 24.  And maybe this will help orient you

          6   to the document.  So this is the Form 8-K that was filed

          7   that attaches, you'll see, the press releases as an

          8   exhibit.

          9                  So for the record, this is the Form 8-K

         10   filed January 7, 2017 -- January 7th, 2016.

         11        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         12                  I don't remember reading this.

         13        Q.   You don't think this was one of the press

         14   releases that you reviewed?

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  You can answer.

         16        A.   No.  I -- I do not remember reading this.

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So I am handing you what

         18   has been marked as Exhibit 25.

         19                  (Exhibit 25 marked.)

         20                  MR. KNOTTS:  Thank you.

         21                  MS. ZALKA:  No worries.

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And this is a Form 8-K filed by

         23   Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., April 5, 2016.

         24                  This also has a press release attached as

         25   Exhibit 99.1.  And there is a discussion of the Rite Aid

                                                                      172



          1   acquisition on page 2 of the press release at the bottom.

          2        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

          3                  No, I don't remember this one.

          4        Q.   Okay.  So based on your recollection, you don't

          5   think you reviewed this press release at the time?

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, that's not what he

          7   said.

          8        A.   I don't remember.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You don't remember reviewing

         10   it?

         11        A.   It's not that I didn't; I just don't remember.

         12        Q.   Do you have any reason to believe you did?

         13        A.   I would be speculating.  I would be guessing,

         14   and I don't want to do that.

         15        Q.   Okay.  So -- you -- but this statement -- so

         16   just so the record is clear, Exhibit 25 doesn't contain

         17   either of the two statements that you mentioned as the

         18   statements that you took issue with by Walgreens.  So the

         19   no objection -- there will be no opposition by the FTC

         20   statement or the special relationship with the FTC

         21   statement.

         22        A.   All right.  What paragraph are we talking about

         23   specifically?

         24        Q.   You're welcome to read the whole thing.  The

         25   discussion on the press release is on the second paragraph

                                                                      173



          1   with respect to the Rite Aid deal -- I mean, the last --

          2   second page, the last paragraph.

          3        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

          4                  Oh, I didn't see that page.

          5                  (Witness reviews document.)

          6                  Okay, there are certain similarities to the

          7   statement here, but I can't say that this is the actual

          8   press release that -- that I read or if it was from a news

          9   article quoting one of the executives.

         10        Q.   When you said there were certain similarities to

         11   the statement here, what did you mean?

         12        A.   Saying that they're continuing the plan and

         13   continuing -- continues to expect the transaction to

         14   close.

         15        Q.   Is it your testimony that the statement that

         16   it's continuing integration planning and continues to

         17   expect the transaction to close in the second half of

         18   calendar year 2016, is this the statement that you

         19   referenced earlier with -- by Walgreens, which you said

         20   that Walgreens stated that there would be no opposition by

         21   the FTC?

         22        A.   I -- I don't know if this is the exact

         23   statement, but this is -- this is along the lines.

         24        Q.   How are those two things the same or along the

         25   same lines?

                                                                      174



          1        A.   Well, because it's saying that they expect the

          2   transaction to close.  And --

          3        Q.   Is that a guarantee that the FTC would approve

          4   it?

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, argumentative.

          6   That's not what he said.

          7        A.   No, it's not a guarantee.

          8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is it a statement that there

          9   would be no opposition or objection by the FTC?

         10        A.   Not right now, no.  It does not say that.

         11        Q.   It does not say that.

         12                  And you do not interpret it that way

         13   sitting here today?

         14        A.   I don't -- I just interpret it as they're very

         15   confident that the deal is going to close.

         16        Q.   You're interpreting this that way?

         17        A.   Which, in part, has to do with FTC approval.

         18        Q.   Why does the statement that they continue to

         19   expect the transaction to close in the second half of

         20   calendar 2016, why do you interpret that as an expression

         21   of very confident that the deal is going to close?

         22        A.   Because they mention it here.  So I --

         23        Q.   Do -- go ahead.

         24        A.   I believe them, but this is not the -- this may

         25   not be the exact statement that I read.

                                                                      175



          1        Q.   Okay.

          2        A.   Okay.  So my interpretation of the statement

          3   that I read was that the -- that the -- they were

          4   confident that the deal would go through.

          5        Q.   And you recall --

          6        A.   It may not be this exact statement.

          7        Q.   Yeah.  And I'm just trying to -- so from a

          8   record perspective, the reason why I'm showing you these

          9   press releases is I want to understand what specific

         10   statement it is that you were discussing when you say

         11   that.

         12        A.   Uh-huh.

         13        Q.   So do you think that this press release contains

         14   the statement you referenced before with respect to either

         15   the special relationship with the FTC statement or the --

         16        A.   This does not come out and say they have a

         17   special relationship with the FTC.  That is -- this only

         18   says that they're confident that the deal will go through.

         19        Q.   They say they're confident the deal will go

         20   through or that they expect the transaction to close?

         21        A.   Well --

         22        Q.   Are those two things synonymous to you?

         23        A.   To me it says the same thing.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Using different words?

         25        A.   I think, yeah.

                                                                      176



          1        Q.   Okay.  But this is not -- based on your best

          2   recollection, is this the press release that you recall

          3   reviewing at the time?

          4        A.   I don't believe so.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6                  (Exhibit 26 marked.)

          7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Exhibit 26.  So what has been

          8   marked as Exhibit 26 is the Form 8-K filed by Walgreens

          9   Boots Alliance July 6th, 2016.

         10                  And if you look on page 2, going over to

         11   the top of page 3.

         12        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         13                  It's like -- yes, it looks like a

         14   similar -- looks like a statement I may have read, but it

         15   may not necessarily have been in the form of an 8-K either

         16   that I read it.

         17        Q.   Uh-huh.

         18        A.   It may have been in the form of an analyst's

         19   quotation of a -- of the Form 8-K.

         20                  But, again, it does mention that they

         21   expect Rite Aid transaction to close in the second half.

         22                  But, again, it does mention that they

         23   expect Rite Aid transaction to close in the second half.

         24        Q.   Do you recall reading this press release at the

         25   time that it was issued?

                                                                      177



          1        A.   I -- I may -- I may have read this press

          2   release, but I -- I don't know for sure.  I -- I did read

          3   press releases, because the press release would come

          4   through as a -- as news.

          5        Q.   When you say come through as news, what do you

          6   mean?

          7        A.   It would -- it would come through if I clicked

          8   on -- on RAD, for instance, it would come through.  If --

          9   you would -- sometimes I -- I would get press releases

         10   regarding the company.  And I don't think I ever received

         11   these as -- directly as a result -- from the company as a

         12   result of being a shareholder.  I don't think I've

         13   ever -- I don't think they ever sent me these directly.

         14                  But I have seen press releases via news

         15   articles in my Ameritrade account.

         16        Q.   So do you believe that you reviewed a news

         17   article that may have quoted this press release or

         18   reviewed the press release itself?

         19        A.   I can't say.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Does this press release contain the

         21   statement that you take -- one of the two statements that

         22   take -- strike that.

         23                  Does this press release contain either of

         24   the two statements that you have complained about with

         25   respect to disclosures by Walgreens?

                                                                      178



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

          2   misstates prior testimony.

          3        A.   Well, it says that the transaction -- they

          4   expect the transaction to -- to continue.  So, yes, I -- I

          5   would interpret this as the -- right now things are smooth

          6   sailing is the way I would interpret that.

          7        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Uh-huh.  Is this telling you

          8   that -- did you interpret this to be some form of

          9   guarantee that it would always be smooth sailing?

         10        A.   No, there was -- there was never any expectation

         11   of a guarantee.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Did this imply in any way that it will be

         13   smooth sailing going forward?

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         15        A.   No, there's -- there's -- there's no -- there's

         16   no guarantee, but it -- this would come -- this would make

         17   me feel better -- when this comes directly from the

         18   company, it -- it would make me feel -- it makes me feel

         19   better reading it than -- than -- than saying that we --

         20   we don't expect this transaction is going -- going to go

         21   through.

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Uh-huh.

         23        A.   And I don't know if they knew one way or another

         24   when this was -- when this press release -- I know one way

         25   -- I don't know one way or another what -- what they knew,

                                                                      179



          1   if -- if this was going to go through or not.

          2        Q.   Uh-huh.

          3        A.   I don't know any bumps along the road.  I don't

          4   remember, at least at the beginning stages, hearing about

          5   any bumps in the road.

          6        Q.   Do you --

          7        A.   Only towards the end I started seeing -- hearing

          8   about bumps in the road.  And that -- and that was

          9   basically from news articles of analysts.

         10        Q.   Was the extension of the time to consummate the

         11   merger agreement a bump along the road?

         12        A.   I'm sorry.

         13        Q.   Was the extension of time --

         14        A.   Uh-huh.

         15        Q.   -- to close the merger, to consummate the Merger

         16   Agreement, was that a bump along the road?

         17        A.   Yeah, I felt that that was a bump along the

         18   road.

         19        Q.   So that would have been -- was that one of the

         20   first times that you recall being aware of, as you would

         21   say, bumps along the road or that it wasn't --

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   -- smooth sailing?

         24        A.   Yes.

         25        Q.   And that was based on the company's disclosure

                                                                      180



          1   that they were extending the time to consummate the

          2   merger?

          3        A.   Yes.  But then there was one analyst that said

          4   that the F -- FTC -- there was only like two people

          5   working at the FTC at the time, and they had a backlog.

          6   So I also thought that, well, you know, maybe it's -- you

          7   know, maybe it's taking so long right now because there --

          8   there's a backlog there.

          9        Q.   Did Walgreens ever make a statement that it was

         10   taking longer because there was a backlog at the FTC?

         11        A.   No, they did not.  This was through an analyst.

         12        Q.   Okay.  And if you turn to page 6 of the press

         13   release of Exhibit 26.

         14        A.   Yeah.

         15        Q.   And you'll see at the bottom of the long

         16   paragraph, the italicized paragraph that starts,

         17   Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.

         18                  Do you see that at the bottom of page 5 --

         19        A.   Uh-huh.

         20        Q.   -- continued on to page 6?

         21                  I will not -- for the sake of brevity, I

         22   will say that you are welcome to read the entire thing,

         23   but I'm going to be pointing you to -- it's at the --

         24   towards the end of the disclosure on page 6.

         25        A.   Okay.

                                                                      181



          1        Q.   And it says -- it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

          2   10, it's roughly 10 lines up from the bottom.

          3                  And there is a disclosure that all

          4   statements in the press release that are not historical,

          5   including that limitation, those regarding estimates and

          6   goals for future financial and operation performance, that

          7   those -- that there are risks associated with

          8   acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic

          9   investments, including those relating to our ability to

         10   satisfy the closing conditions and consummate the pending

         11   acquisitions of Rite Aid and related matters on a timely

         12   basis or at all.

         13                  You see that?

         14        A.   Yes, I see that.

         15        Q.   And did you read that -- do you recall reading

         16   that language at any time?

         17        A.   No, I don't recall reading it.  It's -- it's

         18   just forward-looking language that you see in any

         19   disclosure, especially one that's a company press release.

         20        Q.   Uh-huh.

         21        A.   This is a typical statement.

         22        Q.   And this -- so you're not disputing that at this

         23   -- in its press release, Walgreens referred readers to the

         24   potential risks associated, right, with the --

         25        A.   Well, I would --

                                                                      182



          1        Q.   -- completion of the Rite Aid deal?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, misstates

          3   testimony.  I'll ask you not to disclose any

          4   attorney/client communications, but you can answer.

          5        A.   I would be surprised if they didn't have

          6   something in -- like that in here, because it's -- it's --

          7   it's just standard language that you -- you will see in

          8   any press release.  It's like if I -- any press release

          9   that I read of a particular stock, and especially stock

         10   that I own, they always have statements, similar

         11   statements.

         12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you always not read the

         13   statements?

         14        A.   Well, it's -- I don't always read the

         15   statements.  It becomes old, because I -- I do know

         16   what -- and I -- I do know what -- what it's saying.

         17   Okay.  Yes, there -- there's certain risk involved, and,

         18   you know, current performance doesn't necessarily mean

         19   future performance.  And, yes, I -- I realize that there

         20   -- there's risk involved.

         21                  And I would be surprised if a statement

         22   like this wasn't -- wasn't in there.

         23        Q.   And did you understand, at the time that you

         24   made your investments, that Walgreens had disclosed the

         25   risks that the Rite Aid deal may not actually close?

                                                                      183



          1        A.   No, I didn't know that.

          2        Q.   Having read what is Exhibit 22, the form with

          3   the risk factors (indicating) --

          4        A.   20 -- oh.

          5        Q.   -- which is incorporated by -- I'll represent

          6   that this is incorporated by reference to the press

          7   release.

          8        A.   Uh-huh.

          9                  And?

         10        Q.   Having read that, do you think that Walgreens by

         11   making a statement that it expects the transaction to

         12   close in the second half of 2016 while at the same time

         13   disclosing that there are risks that the FTC may not

         14   approve the deal, that Walgreens was somehow implying that

         15   things would be smooth sailing going forward?

         16        A.   I interpreted it as it was smooth sailing going

         17   forward.

         18        Q.   Is it fair to say that's just your

         19   interpretation, it's not actually what Walgreens

         20   disclosed?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  You asked for his

         22   interpretation.

         23                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm asking -- I'm following up.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Go ahead.

         25        A.   Yes.  And -- and that was my interpretation,

                                                                      184



          1   that -- that the deal would close.  There was no

          2   opposition currently.  The -- that the deal would close.

          3   But I -- but I -- I understand that they're legally

          4   response -- they're legally -- they legally have to put a

          5   -- a statement like that in here stating the merger may

          6   not go through.  I -- I understand that.  But -- but that

          7   is not what was in one of the press releases that -- that

          8   I read or --

          9        Q.   Let's go -- keep going on the press releases

         10   then.  So just if we go back to Exhibit 26, which is the

         11   press release you just had before you.  We were looking at

         12   the cautionary note language.

         13        A.   Okay.  26, yeah.

         14        Q.   Uh-huh.

         15        A.   And what page?

         16        Q.   Page 6.

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Do you -- do you have an understanding as to how

         19   what is in Exhibit 22 relates to what is on the bottom of

         20   page 6?  And if you don't, you can answer yes or no.

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to the extent it

         22   calls for a legal conclusion.

         23                  You can just answer --

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Yeah.

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- based on your current

                                                                      185



          1   understanding.

          2        A.   I'm not sure what it means.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So the next press

          4   release.

          5                  I'm handing you what's been marked as

          6   Exhibit 27.

          7                  (Exhibit 27 marked.)

          8        Q.   This is the Form 8-K filed by Walgreens Boots

          9   Alliance on October 20th, 2016.

         10        A.   Uh-huh.

         11        Q.   Now, you can take your time, but if you look on

         12   page 3, there's a discussion about the Rite Aid

         13   acquisition in the press release that's attached as

         14   Exhibit 99.1.

         15        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         16                  Yes, I remember reading this, but I don't

         17   know again if it was this actual document or it was a

         18   quotation from a analyst.  But, yes, I -- I do remember

         19   the -- the center paragraph where it mentions divesting

         20   the -- the stores.

         21        Q.   Is this the press release, or the content of the

         22   press release that you testified to during your deposition

         23   today, with respect to a statement by Walgreens that there

         24   would be no opposition by the FTC?

         25        A.   This -- this is how I interpret that, again,

                                                                      186



          1   that -- that -- basically that -- that they will overcome

          2   any -- any bumps in the road.  There wouldn't be any

          3   problems.  That's -- that's how I -- how I interpret this.

          4   For the mere fact that they're diversing -- divesting, I

          5   should say, the number of stores between 500 and 1,000

          6   stores.  And I don't know -- I'm not sure if this is when

          7   Harry's came -- or Fred's came along.  I'm not sure if

          8   this is the time period.

          9        Q.   What about the statement is misleading?

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.  I'll instruct you

         11   not to divulge conversations with your attorneys in

         12   connection with this lawsuit.  But to the extent you have

         13   an independent understanding, you can answer.

         14        A.   Well --

         15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So I'm -- and again, I'm only

         16   asking, and I did say this at the beginning, but let me

         17   repeat it.

         18                  I'm asking for your recollection and

         19   interpretation of the statements between October 2015 and

         20   the end of the class period on June 2017.

         21                  So I'm asking for kind of what you actually

         22   recall thinking, reading, seeing during that period, not

         23   what you've discussed with counsel for purposes of this

         24   litigation.

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.  So not even after that

                                                                      187



          1   period, it's just if -- if you saw this statement, what

          2   did you think -- did you think it was misleading at the

          3   time you read it.

          4                  MS. ZALKA:  Correct.

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

          6                  MS. ZALKA:  And he's testified, I think,

          7   that there was two types of statements that he believed he

          8   understood as of June 2017 to have been previously

          9   misleading.

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  He's test -- so he's testified

         11   to more than that.  You focused on two, but he's testified

         12   to a whole host of statements.

         13                  MS. ZALKA:  That's not accurate.

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  He has, but that's fine.

         15                  MS. ZALKA:  I mean --

         16        A.   The -- this right here just -- I mean, basically

         17   it tells me that they're -- in order for the deal to go

         18   through, that they have to sell a certain number of

         19   stores, okay.

         20                  So they're doing what they can to make sure

         21   that the deal will go through.  That's my understanding.

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And I guess that references

         23   that all of this is actually pending FTC approval, right?

         24        A.   Yes.  Yes.  It's pending the FTC approval.

         25        Q.   So either when you read this at the time or when

                                                                      188



          1   the Merger Agreement was terminated in June 2017, or you

          2   read a news article quoting this.  Like, what about this

          3   is -- is misleading to you?

          4        A.   It may not be this particular paragraph that was

          5   misleading to me.  I -- you asked me if I read this

          6   paragraph.  And I believe I did read this paragraph.  And

          7   located in some -- somewhere.  I didn't say that I

          8   felt -- I don't believe I said that I felt that this was

          9   misleading.

         10                  I had all the confidence in the world that

         11   this merger was going to go through.  And to me, it looks

         12   like they're doing what they can to have the merger go

         13   through.  I don't -- I'm not saying that this particular

         14   statement is misleading.

         15        Q.   Okay.  And so in June 2017, when the merger

         16   agreement was terminated --

         17        A.   Uh-huh.

         18        Q.   -- do you -- at that point, did you think that

         19   there was something about this statement that simply

         20   because the Merger Agreement was terminated in June of

         21   2017, that would be nine months later, that the October

         22   2016 press release was miss -- became misleading somehow?

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Which -- you say this

         24   statement.

         25                  MS. ZALKA:  Yeah, the paragraph that we've

                                                                      189



          1   just been discussing, that Mr. Dayton just read.

          2        A.   No, I think they -- they were working on trying

          3   to close the deal.  I mean, that's --

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

          5        A.   But I don't know what -- what -- the background,

          6   you know, behind closed door discussions were with the

          7   FTC.

          8        Q.   Next press release, thank you.

          9                  (Exhibit 28 marked.)

         10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Exhibit 28.  Okay.  The Form

         11   8-K filed by Walgreens Boots on December 20th, 2016.  And

         12   if you look at Exhibit 99.1, there is a press release

         13   entitled Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid Reach

         14   Agreement to Sell 865 Rite Aid Stores to Fred's Pharmacy.

         15        A.   Yeah, I read that.

         16        Q.   So this is -- do you have a specific

         17   recollection of reading this press release?

         18        A.   Oh, yeah.

         19        Q.   Okay.  So is there any statement in here that

         20   you believe, sitting here today, was misleading?

         21        A.   I have to read it.

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  So objection.  I'll --

         23                  MS. ZALKA:  Outside of the conversations

         24   with counsel.

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, don't disclose

                                                                      190



          1   discussions with attorneys or things that you learned from

          2   us, but you can answer to your understanding independently

          3   just coming into the lawsuit.

          4        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

          5                  Okay.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So is this the press release

          7   that you mentioned earlier that contains a statement that

          8   you believe is misleading concerning the special FTC

          9   relationship or the no opposition by the FTC?

         10        A.   Well, this -- I don't know if it was this

         11   particular press release, but I did read about Fred's

         12   purchasing 865 -- or possibly purchasing 865 Rite Aid

         13   stores.  And this was ordered in order to be divested and

         14   able to obtain FTC approval.

         15        Q.   Did you understand, having read this press

         16   release that -- as it's reflected in the first sentence --

         17   the first sentence of the second paragraph, the agreement

         18   is being entered into to respond to concerns identified by

         19   the FTC in its review of the proposed acquisition of Rite

         20   Aid by Walgreens?

         21        A.   Yes, I -- yes, I agree with that.

         22        Q.   Did that indicate smooth sailing to you or bumps

         23   in the road?

         24        A.   Well, again, it's -- any -- pretty much any

         25   acquisition of two like companies where you -- it has to

                                                                      191



          1   go through FTC approval.  So, again, these are

          2   forward-looking statements that you would -- you would

          3   want to disclose in -- in any press release just to pretty

          4   much cover yourself.

          5        Q.   What about the sentence I just read is

          6   forward-looking?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for a legal

          8   conclusion.  Go ahead.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm not asking you as a lawyer.

         10   I'm just asking you as, like, how does a statement about

         11   the agreement is being entered into to respond to concerns

         12   identified by the FTC?

         13        A.   Well, that's -- okay.  That -- that is -- I

         14   mean, if that is that they're -- they're -- that they're

         15   actually responding to something that the F -- FTC asked

         16   for, then, obviously, that's not forward-looking.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So did you understand when you read this

         18   press release at the time --

         19        A.   Uh-huh.

         20        Q.   -- that concerns had actually been identified by

         21   the FTC?

         22        A.   Yes, I -- I knew that there were some concerns,

         23   but the -- what I was referring to was the -- the

         24   transaction is subject to FTC approval, that that -- that

         25   is pretty much a forward-looking statement.  And the

                                                                      192



          1   approval and completion of the pending acquisition of Rite

          2   Aid by Walgreens and other closing -- closing conditions,

          3   that's the forward-looking statement I was referring to.

          4                  The other statement is basically either

          5   Rite Aid and/or Walgreens responding to a concern that the

          6   FTC had.  And --

          7        Q.   I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

          8        A.   And I don't know if it's smooth sailing or not.

          9   All they're doing is -- basically all they're doing is

         10   responding to a concern, so...  Yeah.

         11                  And I thought that the diversing was

         12   the -- was them answering the F -- FTC concerns.

         13        Q.   How did your view of the risk that the deal

         14   might not be approved by the FTC change, if at all, as a

         15   result of the disclosure that the FTC had concerns?

         16        A.   Well, I still felt the deal was going to go

         17   through, especially when -- it's not in this release, I

         18   believe.  I'm not sure if it is.  But when Fred's agreed

         19   to buy even more than the 865 stores if they had to

         20   diverse even more stores in order to get the approval.

         21        Q.   Why did you short Fred's stock on the same day

         22   of this announcement?

         23        A.   I don't know.  Did I?  I don't remember if I did

         24   or not.  Huh, did I?

         25        Q.   Why did you take a short position in Fred's

                                                                      193



          1   stock on the day of this announcement?

          2        A.   Because if I did short it -- and I don't even

          3   remember shorting it, but if I did short it, it was

          4   because they probably couldn't afford to purchase -- I

          5   didn't think that they could afford to purchase 685 -- or

          6   865 stores even though that they -- they might get the

          7   approval.  I don't know, did I short the stock?

          8        Q.   Do you have any recollection of shorting the

          9   stock?

         10        A.   No, I don't remember, to tell you the truth.

         11        Q.   What's -- what do you hope to do when you short

         12   a stock, generally?  How does a short position work?

         13        A.   That the price is going to go down.  And it was

         14   probably something that I read in one the news articles.

         15   And I did short it; I decided to short it.

         16        Q.   So you didn't think they could purchase 865

         17   stores?

         18        A.   No.  I thought they could purchase the 865

         19   stores, but I thought that that would run the -- even

         20   though they can purchase it, it would still run the stock

         21   down.

         22        Q.   So what aspect of this announcement did you

         23   think would result in a lower stock price for Fred's?

         24        A.   Because this was a out of pocket.  Purchasing

         25   865 shares is a lot of money -- or 865 stores, sorry, is a

                                                                      194



          1   lot of money and that's a lot of out -- pocket expense.

          2   So at least I felt for the short term -- excuse me -- that

          3   the price would go down.  It's funny, though, I don't even

          4   remember shorting it.

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, So --

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Let's go to Exhibit 15.

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, if you don't

          8   remember --

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Oh, Exhibit --

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- and I think she's okay with

         11   this, if -- if -- you can testify as to what you

         12   remember --

         13                  THE WITNESS:  Right.

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- but don't speculate.  And I

         15   think she's okay with that instruction.

         16        A.   Right.  Yeah, I -- I don't remember purchasing

         17   it.  But if I did, I purchased it thinking that the price

         18   was going to go down, if I shorted it.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And if we can go to Exhibit 5,

         20   it's in front of you.

         21        A.   Is this 5 again, Exhibit 5?

         22        Q.   Exhibit 5.  It's one -- Exhibit 5.  It's one of

         23   your Ameritrade statements for your --

         24        A.   It's in here?

         25        Q.   Yeah, it will be in your pile.

                                                                      195



          1        A.   Oh.

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, so you just -- you'll

          3   have to find it in there.

          4                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

          5                  15?

          6                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

          7   4:14 p.m.

          8                  (Recess in the proceedings from 4:14

          9                  to 4:17 p.m.)

         10                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

         11   4:17 p.m.

         12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So we're looking at

         13   Exhibit 5.

         14                  Do you recognize this document, Mr. Dayton?

         15        A.   I recognize the symbol.  I don't remember this

         16   transaction.  But, obviously, it happened because it's in

         17   my statement.

         18        Q.   Okay.  And is this a monthly account statement

         19   for your Ameritrade account ending in 3791 for December

         20   2016?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   Okay.  And if we go to page 3.  It says --

         23        A.   Uh-huh.

         24        Q.   -- short stocks Fred?

         25        A.   Yes, I see it.

                                                                      196



          1        Q.   Okay.  Can you tell me anything about why you

          2   decided to short Fred's stock on December 20th, 2016, the

          3   date of the announcement of the Walgreens/Fred's deal?

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

          5   a couple times.

          6        A.   Yeah, I don't remember completely.  As I

          7   mentioned, my thought process was the price of the stock

          8   was going to go down based on the press release.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Did you ever -- I believe you

         10   testified that you did not make any transactions in

         11   Walgreens securities in 2016 --

         12        A.   I don't remember.

         13        Q.   -- and 2017.

         14        A.   I don't remember if I did or not.  I -- I may

         15   have, but I -- I don't remember.  I have -- I have a lot

         16   of stocks.  I don't remember completely -- look, I -- I

         17   didn't remember Fred's.  I don't even remember owning

         18   Fred's.  So -- so I guess I'm a little haphazard when it

         19   comes to some things.

         20                  But this is -- it's funny I -- it's funny.

         21   I -- I don't remember.  And what was the date on this?

         22   2016.  Okay.  I don't even remember purchase -- shorting

         23   Fred's, but -- but I did.  And I may have -- I may

         24   have -- I think I may have owned Walgreens stock.  At some

         25   point in my -- my life, I think I may have owned it.

                                                                      197



          1        Q.   It's more specifically focused on the period of

          2   2016 and 2017.

          3        A.   I may have.  If I can look at my statement

          4   during that time period.  I -- I may have purchased it.

          5        Q.   Is there a reason why you wouldn't have

          6   purchased Walgreens at the same time that you were

          7   purchasing Rite Aid?

          8        A.   I felt there was more up-side to Rite Aid.

          9        Q.   Sorry.  Go ahead.

         10        A.   And Walgreens would be putting out -- it would

         11   be a huge investment for -- for Walgreens, and any time

         12   there's a huge investment stocks, you know, can go -- can

         13   go down.  I thought there was just more upside to -- to

         14   Rite Aid.

         15        Q.   So you thought that the deal might, at least, in

         16   some -- for some time period have a downward pressure

         17   price -- downward pressure on Walgreens stock price?

         18        A.   It could have.  And -- and if I -- if I ever

         19   owned Walgreens, and, you know, perhaps -- I don't want to

         20   speculate, but, you know, perhaps I purchased it on a dip

         21   or something, but I don't -- again, just like with Fred's,

         22   I don't remember specifically.  I may have owned

         23   Walgreens.  I'm not going to say I did or I didn't.  I --

         24   I may have.

         25        Q.   Uh-huh, okay.

                                                                      198



          1                  As of the end of June of 2017, right, so

          2   when the termination of the Merger Agreement was

          3   announced.

          4        A.   June -- let me -- the termination, okay.

          5        Q.   Yeah.

          6        A.   Uh-huh.

          7        Q.   Why did you think that Walgreens misled

          8   investors?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         10   Revealing any discussions with your attorneys, you -- you

         11   can answer keeping in mind -- keeping in mind that you've

         12   been asked this question before.

         13        A.   Oh, yeah, I thought I've answered it several

         14   times.

         15                  I thought that -- I thought they were going

         16   to wait for the FTC approval, formal approval even if the

         17   time period came up -- or was -- was up.  But I believe

         18   the FTC had to make a decision before the time period was

         19   up, that was my understanding, maybe I'm wrong, so I

         20   thought that they would have -- FTC would make a decision

         21   before the time period was up, but they didn't wait for

         22   the decision.

         23                  And I don't know if they would have

         24   approved it or not.  I mean, maybe not.  They're the ones

         25   that were in discussion with the FTC.  But I was waiting

                                                                      199



          1   for the formal decision from the FTC.  And that's it.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So I asked -- and with

          3   respect to -- do you have any view or understanding as of,

          4   again, the termination of the Merger Agreement

          5   announcement --

          6        A.   Uh-huh.

          7        Q.   -- I don't want any conversations you had with

          8   counsel, but why do you think -- why do you think that

          9   Walgreens made those misleading statements, meaning -- let

         10   me clarify it a little bit, to -- what was the reason why

         11   they did it?  What was the benefit to Walgreens?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

         13   speculation.

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm just asking for your

         15   understanding --

         16        A.   I don't know.

         17        Q.   -- if you have any.

         18        A.   I don't know.  I haven't -- no.  I have no idea

         19   what -- what their thought process was for that.

         20        Q.   Uh-huh.

         21        A.   I -- I don't know.

         22        Q.   So there's no theory of kind of motive that came

         23   to your mind in June 2017?

         24        A.   I don't know.  I'm -- I'm not speculating.

         25        Q.   I'm just asking -- I'm not asking you to

                                                                      200



          1   speculate, I'm asking you specifically --

          2        A.   No, I --

          3        Q.   -- in June 2017, when the Merger Agreement

          4   was announced --

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll object.

          6        A.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   -- the termination of the

          7   Merger Agreement was announced.

          8                  MR. KNOTTS:  And I'll object, by

          9   definition, it calls for speculation.

         10                  Go ahead.

         11        A.   Yeah, I don't want to -- I don't want to

         12   speculate, so I can't answer that question.

         13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Why can't you answer the

         14   question?

         15        A.   Because I'll be speculating.

         16                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objection.

         17                  There you go.

         18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm not asking you to

         19   speculate.  I'm asking you yes or no, did you form any --

         20   did you form a view in June of 2017, when the Merger

         21   Agreement was terminated, as to a theory of motive --

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

         23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   -- by Walgreens?

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

         25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Just yes or no.  It's not

                                                                      201



          1   speculation.  You either did or you didn't have a view at

          2   that point in time.

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

          4   speculation.

          5                  MS. ZALKA:  It doesn't, but okay.  Go

          6   ahead.

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  You're asking about what's in

          8   others people -- other people's head.

          9                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm not, I'm asking --

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  A motive of someone else.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm asking you.  Mr. Dayton,

         12   let me just clarify.

         13                  MS. ZALKA:  And stop.  That's not what I'm

         14   asking.  Listen to my question.

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  I did.

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Mr. Dayton, I'm asking you,

         17   okay, whether in June 2017, when the termination of the

         18   Merger Agreement was announced, did you think about

         19   Walgreens' motive in any way, shape or form?  I'm not

         20   asking you to speculate about what that motive was.  I'm

         21   asking --

         22        A.   Okay.

         23        Q.   -- did you, yes or no?

         24        A.   I mean --

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

                                                                      202



          1   speculation.

          2                  MS. ZALKA:  It doesn't, but, okay.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Go ahead.  You can -- do you

          4   understand my question?

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Just ignore my objections and

          6   -- and he can answer.  It'll be much easier.

          7                  So objection, calls for speculation.  You

          8   can answer.

          9        A.   Okay.  Well, I -- I thought that -- that the --

         10   the last deal -- I thought they were in -- in the process

         11   of coming up with another deal.  And come to find out they

         12   were in the process of coming up with another deal.  And

         13   that deal was that they would buy, I'm not sure of the

         14   number, but almost half of Rite Aid stores.

         15                  So when -- when it was -- when it was

         16   immediately announced that the deal fell through, I don't

         17   know what I was thinking.  But after they decided to

         18   purchase half of the stores, I was thinking, could this

         19   have been planned?

         20                  That's what -- that was my -- my thinking.

         21   Was -- was it planned to -- to work out this way?  I don't

         22   know.

         23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Were they planning for the

         24   merger agreement not to be executed, is that what

         25   you're --

                                                                      203



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

          2   speculation.

          3                  MS. ZALKA:  Let -- let me just finish my

          4   question.

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay, sorry.

          6        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   When you said that I was

          7   thinking could this have been planned, is the "this" in

          8   that sentence that the Merger Agreement would not be

          9   actually consummated?

         10        A.   Only -- only towards the end, not at the

         11   beginning.

         12        Q.   Okay.

         13        A.   And not halfway through.  Just when -- the --

         14   and I'll use it again, when they start running into what I

         15   -- what I thought was significant bumps in the road.

         16        Q.   And were those significant bumps the extension

         17   of time to consummate and then --

         18        A.   Uh-huh.

         19        Q.   -- the amendment of the Merger Agreement?

         20        A.   Yes.  You know, that extension -- it went from

         21   bad to worse.

         22        Q.   And you understood that it was going from bad to

         23   worse in connection with those disclosures?

         24        A.   Well, I mean, it was $9 a share, then it went to

         25   6.50 a share, so that went bad to worse.  And then after

                                                                      204



          1   that, it went from 6.50 a share to nothing.  And half the

          2   company would -- would -- would be lost, the entire half

          3   of the company of -- of Rite Aid would be -- would be

          4   lost.  The company would -- would be cut in half.  I -- I

          5   wasn't happy about that at all.

          6        Q.   Was that the principal thing that you weren't

          7   happy with upon the announcement of the termination of the

          8   Merger Agreement?

          9        A.   There are a lot of things I wasn't happy with.

         10   There's not one over the other.  It's just an accumulation

         11   of unhappiness.

         12        Q.   Beyond them -- beyond the Asset Purchase

         13   Agreement that was announced on June 29th, and the not

         14   waiting for the formal decision by the FTC, those are two

         15   things you weren't happy with, correct?

         16        A.   Right.

         17        Q.   What else weren't you happy with, as of the date

         18   of the announcement of the termination?

         19        A.   Well, those -- those were primarily the items

         20   that you mentioned.

         21        Q.   Okay.  Anything else, as you sit here today,

         22   that you can recall?

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  As of -- as of that date,

         24   right?

         25                  MS. ZALKA:  Yep.

                                                                      205



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Uh-huh.  And when you -- you

          4   said that you thought that they may have been planning it,

          5   meaning the -- some Asset Purchase Agreement, is that

          6   being planned by Rite Aid or Walgreens or both?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

          8   speculation.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm asking about --

         10                  MS. ZALKA:  Fair.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm asking about your

         12   understanding of what you were talking about when you said

         13   I thought that this --

         14        A.   I don't know if it was one or the other or both

         15   in concert.

         16        Q.   Okay.  So after this press release in Exhibit 28

         17   -- so I think we've established that you do recall

         18   specifically reviewing the content of the press release

         19   that's in Exhibit 28, correct?

         20        A.   In -- in some manner.

         21        Q.   Yes.  Well, when you say in some manner, do you

         22   mean a news article quoting it or the press release itself

         23   just maybe not the form filed in an 8-K?

         24        A.   In -- in some manner, which could have been in a

         25   press release and -- or could have been in a -- it could

                                                                      206



          1   have been in a company press release or could have been in

          2   a news article as a -- a quotation.

          3        Q.   Okay.  And the piece of this that would have

          4   been quoted or was quoted, as you recall, was the content

          5   of the second paragraph or anything else?

          6        A.   No, primarily the second -- is this one about

          7   Fred's that we're talking about?

          8        Q.   Yeah.

          9        A.   Yeah, the -- how many stores -- yeah, it was

         10   that one.

         11        Q.   Okay.

         12                  (Exhibit 29 marked.)

         13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Exhibit 29.  I'm handing you

         14   what's been marked as the Form 8-K filed by Walgreens

         15   Boots Alliance on January 5th, 2017.

         16        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         17                  This is the 5th of January, 2017?

         18        Q.   Uh-huh.

         19        A.   Okay.

         20                  And in particular the -- where it says Rite

         21   Aid acquisition?

         22        Q.   Uh-huh.

         23        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         24                  Okay.

         25        Q.   Did you read this at the time?

                                                                      207



          1        A.   In some manner, I -- I may have -- have read

          2   this.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Do you have a memory of reading it?

          4        A.   In some manner, I -- I read it.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   I was -- I was aware that Walgreens and Rite Aid

          7   entered into agreement.  And I was aware that the

          8   agreement included Rite Aid selling to Fred's 865 stores.

          9   I was aware of that.

         10                  I was aware that the -- as -- as in any

         11   state -- you know, it's -- again, it's the same statement

         12   here, FTC approvals required, yeah, we -- we know that.

         13        Q.   As of July 2017, did you think that there was

         14   any aspect of this statement concerning the Rite Aid

         15   acquisition that was misleading?

         16        A.   No, I'm -- I'm not sure about that.  I'm not

         17   sure about this particular paragraph being misleading.

         18        Q.   When you say you're not sure about it, what did

         19   you mean?

         20        A.   I don't think it's -- I don't think it's totally

         21   misleading.  And just let me see here.

         22        Q.   Sure.

         23        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         24                  I mean, this is where they're basically

         25   stating that they expect the acquisition to be adjusted.

                                                                      208



          1   This is where I thought that the price of the Walgreens

          2   shares could -- could drop based on the -- the

          3   dilution -- diluting the net earning of the shares.

          4        Q.   So you thought that the likelihood that the deal

          5   would close could drive Walgreens stock lower?

          6        A.   Yeah, just for a brief period.

          7        Q.   Okay.  And so just to go back.  Is it your

          8   testimony that these statements as of -- again, this is

          9   July 2017, after the Merger Agreement was terminated, you

         10   don't -- you did not think that these statements were

         11   misleading in this press release?

         12        A.   No, I think they were accurate from -- from the

         13   -- at the time that it was printed.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And why do you think it was accurate at

         15   the time it was printed?

         16        A.   I was a believer.  I -- I really was.

         17        Q.   So -- but my question was:  As of July 2017,

         18   after the Merger Agreement was terminated?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   So at that time, did you think that these -- the

         21   statements in this press release were --

         22        A.   Not in this press release.

         23        Q.   -- were misleading?

         24        A.   No.

         25        Q.   Okay.

                                                                      209



          1                  (Exhibit 30 marked.)

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Next is Exhibit 30.  I'm

          3   handing you what's been marked as Exhibit 30.  I think

          4   that's the one.

          5        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

          6                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  So for the record, this

          7   is a Form 8-K filed by Walgreens Boots Alliance January

          8   26th, 2017.

          9        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         10                  Yes, I remember this.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Did you review this press

         12   release at the time?

         13        A.   In some form or another.

         14        Q.   So either news articles quoting the content of

         15   it or the actual press release itself?

         16        A.   Yes.

         17        Q.   Okay.  And you don't recall which?

         18        A.   I do not recall which.

         19        Q.   Okay.  Again, same question, as of July 2017,

         20   after the Merger Agreement had been terminated, what did

         21   you think about -- was misleading, if anything, about the

         22   content of these two paragraphs?  And just to be clear for

         23   the record, we're in Exhibit 99.1 to the 8-K.

         24        A.   All right.  Well, I -- I thought it could go

         25   -- I thought it could be one of two things.  One is that

                                                                      210



          1   they're -- they're planning on reducing based on not

          2   having to spend as much.  Going from $9 a share to 6.50 a

          3   share, that's a significant reduction.  It's approximately

          4   a one-third reduction.  So they wouldn't have had to lay

          5   out as much capital, which would be a benefit to them, as

          6   well as not causing the -- have less effect of the stock

          7   going down.

          8                  And then my second thought process on this

          9   was that they're reducing the number of stores to get FTC

         10   approval.

         11                  Is this before or after?  This is -- it's

         12   before, yeah.

         13        Q.   When you say reducing the number of stores to

         14   get FTC approval, what did you mean?

         15        A.   Well, they -- they wanted to buy more than 1200

         16   stores, correct, initially?  They were going --

         17        Q.   Who's the they in that sentence?

         18        A.   Okay.  Well, Walgreens was going to buy all of

         19   Rite Aid's stores.

         20        Q.   Uh-huh.

         21        A.   And now they reduced it to 1200.

         22        Q.   And that was your understanding at the time?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   Okay.  So what I had asked you, what aspects of

         25   this as of July 2017, after the Merger Agreement had been

                                                                      211



          1   terminated, what aspects of these paragraphs in this press

          2   release were -- did you think were misleading, if any?

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  So objection to the extent

          4   that it calls for privileged communications.  I think

          5   she's -- she's just asking what you thought back then.

          6                  MS. ZALKA:  To be clear, I'm asking as of

          7   July 2017, which was in the question, but I'm happy to

          8   rephrase.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   As of July 2017, right, when

         10   you knew the Merger Agreement had been terminated, I'm

         11   asking you what then did you think with respect to whether

         12   any of these statements were misleading?

         13                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You can you answer.

         15        A.   Okay.  Okay.  Well, I already told you --

         16   mentioned what I thought at the time of -- of the release,

         17   okay.  Now, what I thought after, you know, I -- I sort of

         18   thought, you know, the same thing, that -- that

         19   the -- even though they reduced it down to 1200 stores,

         20   that the FTC wasn't going to approve it, but I was still

         21   waiting for the formal approval, or the -- the formal

         22   announcement from the FTC.  The fact that they lowered the

         23   price again, is -- I had pretty much the same feeling

         24   during and after the -- the merger was called off.

         25        Q.   When you say the same feeling before and after

                                                                      212



          1   the Merger Agreement was terminated, what do you mean by

          2   that?

          3        A.   Well, I don't -- I don't know if -- I was

          4   thinking that, you know, Walgreens sort of felt that they

          5   initially were biting off more than they could chew.  So

          6   they ended up having to reduce the price.  It got to the

          7   point where they didn't want to pay $9 a share for the

          8   stores.  So they lowered the price and they lowered the

          9   number of stores that they would be purchasing.

         10                  And this could go one way or the other.

         11   This -- they could have been doing this because they

         12   wanted to get FTC approval or they could have been doing

         13   this because it was planned all along.

         14                  I don't know.  It's speculation.

         15        Q.   And I'm just asking you to specifically identify

         16   which statements in this release, if any, you believe were

         17   factually false or misleading as of July 2017, when the

         18   Merger Agreement had been terminated?

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         20   Don't reveal any attorney/client communications.

         21                  So I think she's just asking your thoughts

         22   at the date the merger was terminated.

         23        A.   Well, I mean, as far as the misleading, I don't

         24   see anything specifically misleading in -- in -- in the

         25   statement.  I see things that are being done that I don't

                                                                      213



          1   like, but, you know, again, it was my interpretation that

          2   this was being done to assist on the merger going through

          3   and that the merger would be a success.  And again, I was

          4   a believer that it would be.

          5        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Uh-huh.  But -- so there's

          6   nothing specifically or even generally misleading with

          7   respect to the specific statements that are in this press

          8   release in Exhibit 30?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         10        A.   In general, no.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Why don't we take a -- take a

         13   break, since we're going to a new document.  I think we've

         14   been going for over an hour.

         15                  MS. ZALKA:  I think I just have one more on

         16   this vein, so maybe we could just wrap this up, and then I

         17   could actually figure out how much I have left on the

         18   break.  Is that okay for you or do you want a break?  If

         19   you want a break, fine.

         20                  THE WITNESS:  Well, how -- how much longer

         21   do we have?

         22        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So what I was going to suggest

         23   is I just have -- to close the loop on the press release

         24   front --

         25        A.   Uh-huh.

                                                                      214



          1        Q.   -- I just was going to finish up that.  And then

          2   I was going to suggest that we take a break and I can see

          3   what I have left in terms of what to cover.

          4        A.   Okay.

          5        Q.   Or we can take a break now.  It's up to you.

          6                  THE WITNESS:  What do you want?  I'm -- I'm

          7   okay either way.  I do -- the coffee is sort of going

          8   through me.

          9                  MS. ZALKA:  Let's take a break.

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Let's just take a break, and

         11   then we can go to that document and figure it out.

         12                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

         13   4:46 p.m.

         14                  (Recess in the proceedings from 4:46

         15                  to 5:03 p.m.)

         16                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record at

         17   5:03 p.m.

         18                  (Exhibit 31 marked.)

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm handing you what I've

         20   marked as Exhibit 31, which is -- I think I screwed things

         21   up for that Corinna -- that Form 8-K filed by Walgreens

         22   Boots Alliance on April 5th, 2017.

         23                  And you'll see that there is a press

         24   release attached as Exhibit 99.1.  And there is a

         25   discussion of the Rite Aid acquisition on the end of page

                                                                      215



          1   2, going over to page 3.

          2        A.   Okay.  So this is primarily the last paragraph

          3   you're referring to?

          4        Q.   Well, you're welcome to read the whole thing.

          5   My question was --

          6        A.   Yeah, but I don't think I need to.

          7        Q.   Fair enough.

          8                  So my question is:  Is this one of the

          9   press releases that you testified about earlier having

         10   reviewed at the time it was issued?

         11        A.   I remember seeing this press release or some

         12   form of this statement --

         13        Q.   Okay.

         14        A.   -- that the merger would be extended and that

         15   they required more time.  And it was -- it was due to the

         16   discussions with the FTC.  I do remember that.

         17        Q.   Okay.  And as of July 2017, what aspects, if

         18   any, of the statements on the bottom of page 2 and page 3

         19   did you think were misleading, if any?

         20        A.   None.

         21        Q.   Okay.  I'm going to hand you what has been

         22   marked as Exhibit 32.

         23                  (Exhibit 32 marked.)

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Which is the Form 8-K filed on

         25   June 29th, 2017, by Walgreens Boots Alliance.

                                                                      216



          1                  And you'll see there's a press release

          2   attached as Exhibit 99.1.

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   Okay.  You -- did you review this press release

          5   at the time it was issued in -- at the end of June of

          6   2017?

          7        A.   So this is the day after it was called off?  Is

          8   -- I'm asking.

          9        Q.   I don't have to -- I can't answer the question,

         10   unfortunately.  This is a one-way street, unfortunately.

         11        A.   Okay.

         12        Q.   But I do think if you look at the date of the

         13   press release, perhaps that could --

         14        A.   Yeah.

         15        Q.   -- help refresh.

         16        A.   That's why I asked.

         17        Q.   So if you look at the Rite Aid acquisition

         18   update on page 2.

         19        A.   Yes, okay.

         20        Q.   And you're -- again, you're welcome to read the

         21   whole thing, if you would like to.

         22        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

         23                  Yeah, I remember this.

         24        Q.   What do you remember about it?

         25        A.   I remember the announcement and I wasn't too

                                                                      217



          1   happy that they were going to cut the company in half.  I

          2   remember this announcement.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Having reviewed -- did you review any

          4   other information concerning the termination of the Merger

          5   Agreement in June 2017?

          6        A.   I'm not sure, but I remember this

          7   and -- although I can't say there's anything misleading

          8   about the statement, it's because this -- this -- at the

          9   time, this was -- this statement was produced, it was an

         10   accurate statement.  So I can't say it's misleading.  But

         11   I know I wasn't happy with the -- what transpired here at

         12   all.  I was not happy.

         13        Q.   And what were you not happy with?

         14        A.   Because I -- they're cutting the company in

         15   half.  They're decimating the company.

         16        Q.   And "the company" you're referring to there is

         17   Rite Aid?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   Okay.  And when you say, I can't say it's

         20   misleading, were you referring to the -- this press

         21   release that's in Exhibit 32?

         22        A.   What they're doing in this press release is --

         23   to me, is accurately describing what the new deal is.

         24        Q.   Did this press release indicate to you that any

         25   prior statements in the press releases that we have just

                                                                      218



          1   reviewed were misleading?

          2        A.   Well, I guess it wasn't clear sailing all --

          3   after all.  And this is what it led to.  And this was

          4   certainly not a good decision for Rite Aid stockholders,

          5   this decision to cut the company in half.

          6        Q.   Who made that decision?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

          8        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   To you extent that you know.

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah, objection to the

         10   extent --

         11                  MS. ZALKA:  I mean, the company -- sorry; I

         12   -- why don't you go ahead with your objection and then I

         13   can rephrase.

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  If you want to rephrase, go

         15   ahead.

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Sure.  So you say that, you

         17   know, when you read this, you weren't happy with the

         18   decision to cut the company in half.

         19        A.   Right.

         20        Q.   Who ultimately, to your understanding, was

         21   responsible for making that decision with respect to, in

         22   your words, cutting Rite Aid in half?

         23        A.   I don't know, but it takes two parties to strike

         24   an agreement.  Okay.  I don't think there's any one party

         25   necessarily making that decision.  I think it's a

                                                                      219



          1   collaboration between both companies.

          2        Q.   Could Walgreens force Rite Aid to cut itself in

          3   half?

          4                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

          5   speculation, calls for a legal conclusion.

          6                  Don't divulge anything discussed with your

          7   attorneys, but you can answer.

          8        A.   I don't know what Walgreens has over Rite Aid.

          9   They may have something over Rite Aid that I'm not aware

         10   of.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   That's just speculation, right,

         12   though?

         13        A.   That's right.

         14        Q.   Okay.  So let's recap those.

         15                  So to the extent that the announcement of

         16   the termination of the Merger Agreement in June of 2017,

         17   what specifically did that tell you in terms of what, if

         18   any, prior statements about the deal by Walgreens had been

         19   misleading?

         20                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

         21   a couple of times throughout the day.

         22                  But you can -- to the extent that you have

         23   anything to add --

         24                  THE WITNESS:  I have nothing to add from

         25   the previous statements that I mentioned.

                                                                      220



          1        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Well, so, when we went through

          2   each of the press releases, I asked you a question with

          3   respect to as of June -- July 2017, after the announcement

          4   of the Merger Agreement had been terminated, what did you

          5   understand or think about which aspects of these specific

          6   statements were false or misleading.  And we can go

          7   through it again, but we've just spent probably half an

          8   hour going through methodically each of the press

          9   releases.

         10                  Do you recall that testimony?

         11        A.   Yes.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Now, so, having now read the

         13   announcement, and your testimony was that you could not

         14   identify anything specifically misleading that you recall

         15   knowing about as of June 2017 -- actually, strike that.

         16                  My understanding of your testimony, and you

         17   correct me if I'm wrong, is having reviewed each of the

         18   press releases we just went through, it was your testimony

         19   that as of the end of June 2017 and the announcement of

         20   the termination of the Merger Agreement, you could not and

         21   did not identify any specific statements as misleading in

         22   the press releases that we reviewed; is that correct?

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, misleading.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  We're going to have to

         25   go through them.

                                                                      221



          1                  I mean, why don't you just answer.  Is that

          2   correct?

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  You're asking him to summarize

          4   his testimony?

          5                  MS. ZALKA:  No, I'm -- I'm reminding him

          6   and I'm asking him if that's different, because he seems

          7   to be suggesting something different now, having reviewed

          8   the termination announcement.

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well, no, no, no.  Just to be

         10   clear, your early question said statements; now you're

         11   asking about the specific press releases that you showed

         12   him.

         13                  So just -- just make sure that you're clear

         14   what you're asking about.

         15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Are you ready, Mr. Dayton?

         16        A.   Yeah.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So you have testified that you did not

         18   review the earnings calls transcripts or SEC filings

         19   issued by Walgreens during the periods we're just talking

         20   about, 2016 and 2017; is that correct?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   Okay.  And that the only thing that you recall

         23   reviewing that was actually issued by Walgreens was

         24   between one and five press releases during the period of

         25   2016 and 2017.

                                                                      222



          1                  Do you recall that?

          2                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, that misstates the

          3   testimony.

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   How -- was that accurate, yes

          5   or no?

          6        A.   I guess, yes.

          7        Q.   Okay.  So and with respect to -- and we've just

          8   walked through what I will represent to you were the press

          9   releases issued by Walgreens concerning the Rite Aid

         10   transaction in 2016 and 2017.

         11        A.   Okay.  Yeah.

         12        Q.   Okay.  And you identified, I believe, at least

         13   two, potentially three, and we can check the record, that

         14   you specifically remember reviewing the actual press

         15   release and with others, the remaining press releases, you

         16   thought you might have reviewed in a news article quoting

         17   the press release, or the press release itself, correct?

         18        A.   Right.

         19        Q.   Okay.  So now my question is:  Sitting -- as of

         20   the announcement of the Merger Agreement termination in

         21   June 2017, are there any aspects of those statements in

         22   the press releases that we've reviewed that you believed

         23   were false or misleading, in light of the fact that

         24   ultimately, the Merger Agreement had been terminated?

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  So, objection.

                                                                      223



          1                  I'll ask you not to reveal anything that

          2   you've learned from counsel during litigation.  But you

          3   can answer your views as to those specific press releases.

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And I don't think you retained

          5   counsel as of June 2017, so I'm not ask -- it couldn't

          6   call for privileged communications?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  But I think he did.

          8                  MS. ZALKA:  Not with respect to -- oh, I'm

          9   sorry.  So are you willing to actually say with respect to

         10   a retainer agreement going backwards, because that was

         11   not -- you refused to let him answer that question?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Either way, you can answer to

         13   the extent that you didn't learn things from your

         14   attorneys or revealing communications with us.

         15        A.   Okay.  At the time I read the press releases, I

         16   thought it -- I thought the information was accurate.  I

         17   thought it was truthful.  I thought it was accurate, okay?

         18                  Then after the merger was cancelled, was

         19   broken off, okay, that was at the point when I felt that

         20   some of the press releases were not -- were not accurate.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So we're going to have

         22   to go through the press releases again.

         23        A.   Well, go ahead.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Let's take out -- do you --

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  So, I mean, I'll object.

                                                                      224



          1   We've gone through the press releases.  You've asked him

          2   what was misleading.  He's testified specifically as to

          3   things that he thought was misleading and then you've

          4   tried to fight him about it.

          5                  He's provided you his testimony about the

          6   press releases.  We aren't even suing about those press

          7   releases.

          8                  MS. ZALKA:  Well, it's the only thing

          9   Mr. Dayton testified that he actually reviewed.

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  That's not correct.

         11                  MS. ZALKA:  That is correct.

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  It's not.  If you'll go back

         13   and check...

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Mr. Dayton, you

         15   previously testified that after the Merger Agreement was

         16   terminated, and I asked you specifically for at the time

         17   that you understood that the Merger Agreement had been

         18   terminated, did you think that any of the statements in

         19   the press releases were false and misleading.

         20                  And you answered that with -- should we --

         21   we're going to go through all of them again.  Okay.  One

         22   second.

         23                  Do you want to change any of your testimony

         24   in that regard?

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  Are you threatening him to

                                                                      225



          1   spend more time deposing him if he doesn't change his

          2   testimony?  Is that what you're doing?

          3                  MS. ZALKA:  I'm just asking him do you want

          4   to change your testimony.

          5                  MR. KNOTTS:  Counsel, this is not

          6   appropriate.  You can't use more time in a deposition to

          7   threaten him in order to change his testimony.

          8                  MS. ZALKA:  There is actually zero aspect

          9   of what I'm doing that is threatening in any way, shape or

         10   form, Mr. Knotts.  I suggest you calm down in that regard.

         11   I'm simply asking -- I'm offering the witness an

         12   opportunity if he wants to correct any of his testimony.

         13                  THE WITNESS:  No.

         14        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Upon reviewing the

         15   announcement of the termination of the Merger Agreement,

         16   what specific statements, if any, that had been previously

         17   made by Walgreens did you believe were false and

         18   misleading?

         19        A.   That there would be little opposition -- and I

         20   mentioned this several times -- to the merger.

         21        Q.   Was that statement that there would be little

         22   opposition -- so let's just first get the list.

         23                  Other than the statement that there would

         24   be little opposition to the merger, is that -- are there

         25   any other specific statements by Walgreens that you

                                                                      226



          1   believe were false and misleading, having understood that

          2   the Merger Agreement was terminated?

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

          4   a few times.

          5                  I'll ask you not to disclose any

          6   attorney/client privileged communications, but you can

          7   answer.

          8        A.   The only other item was that they had

          9   special -- well, they had insider information about the

         10   FTC, and they had a special relationship with them.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Is there anything else?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   Okay.  With respect to either of those

         14   statements; one, that there would be little opposition to

         15   the merger by the FTC; and two, that there was a special

         16   relationship between the FTC and Walgreens, did either of

         17   those statements appear in any of the press releases that

         18   you reviewed in connection with this deposition?

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.

         20        A.   Yes, I believe.  Yes.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Which?

         22                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered a couple

         23   times.

         24        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I want to know where both of

         25   those statements appear in the press releases that we've

                                                                      227



          1   just reviewed?

          2        A.   Well, okay.  I --

          3                  (Witness reviews document.)

          4                  I don't know if you've provided me with all

          5   the press releases over this period.

          6        Q.   I'm just asking you of the press releases that

          7   we've reviewed.

          8        A.   In what you provided, I -- I don't remember

          9   the --

         10        Q.   Exhibits 24 to 31, if that's helpful.

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Well --

         12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   But you continue.  Sorry; I

         13   just saw that you were looking among the documents, so I

         14   was trying to help.

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  You were interrupting him.

         16        A.   (Witness reviews documents.)

         17                  Okay.  I found it, what I'm looking for.

         18        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What -- what's the

         19   exhibit number?

         20        A.   27.

         21        Q.   And what is the date of the filing?

         22        A.   The date of the filing, October 20th, 2016.

         23        Q.   Okie doke.  Okay.

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Which exhibit?

         25                  MS. ZALKA:  27, I believe Mr. Dayton

                                                                      228



          1   identified.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  What page are you,

          3   Mr. Dayton?

          4        A.   Page 3; the middle paragraph.

          5        Q.   Uh-huh.

          6        A.   (Witness reviews document.)

          7        Q.   So on page 3, which statements do you believe

          8   that as of June 2017, you thought were false and

          9   misleading?

         10        A.   Well, I mean, what I believed was that

         11   the -- that the -- that they were -- Walgreens was engaged

         12   in discussing the acquisition with the FTC, and that they

         13   had to divest between 500 and 1,000 stores.  Okay.  And I

         14   don't -- as far as -- I think that -- that may be an

         15   accurate statement, what they're saying here --

         16        Q.   Uh-huh.

         17        A.   -- okay, but I'm not so sure if it's an accurate

         18   statement after the deal was called off.

         19        Q.   What about the deal being called off in June of

         20   2017 makes this statement on page 3 false, which is

         21   October 2016?

         22        A.   Well, it -- it just seems like this is all they

         23   had to do to get the approval from the FTC, was to diverse

         24   (sic) the between 500 and 1,000 stores, and -- and as time

         25   went on, there was very little update from either --

                                                                      229



          1   from -- primarily from Walgreens on -- no details on how

          2   the talks were going.

          3                  And this is lacking detail as well.  But

          4   this is only -- this is at the beginning stages, so maybe

          5   that's why it's lacking detail.

          6                  But as discussions went along, there was

          7   information that wasn't included in the press releases,

          8   that possibly should have been included in the press

          9   releases.

         10                  So I think it's also their obligation

         11   to -- you know, I think that it's -- it was -- they were

         12   under the impression that it's better to say nothing than

         13   to make any kind of announcement that's going to hurt

         14   the -- the acquisition, as far as having -- having people

         15   trading in the stock.

         16                  So I think it was the lack of information

         17   that is sort of misleading as well.

         18        Q.   So what is the lack of information with respect

         19   to this statement that is misleading that you realized as

         20   of June 2017?

         21        A.   Not particularly this statement, but the -- the

         22   press releases down -- down the line that -- there were no

         23   statements.

         24                  There was information that I felt should

         25   have been in there to inform the stockholders of the

                                                                      230



          1   detailed discussions that they were having with the FTC.

          2   I mean, I -- I had no information on the detailed

          3   discussions.  They had no information on detailed

          4   discussions with the FTC.

          5        Q.   What effort did you understand -- did you

          6   undertake to understand the full universe of information

          7   that was disclosed by either Walgreens or Rite Aid

          8   concerning the detailed discussions?

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         10                  You can answer.

         11        A.   All I -- all I did was read the news releases

         12   and that's the extent of --

         13        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So sitting here today --

         14        A.   -- my knowledge.

         15        Q.   Sorry.  So sitting here today, you have no

         16   knowledge of what the total universe of information was

         17   with respect to the discussions, disclosures around the

         18   FTC process, correct?

         19                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

         20   speculation.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You just said you had -- well,

         22   I'll let you answer the question.  Go ahead.

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Yeah.

         24        A.   All right.  I do not know what the process is.

         25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I'm not asking about the

                                                                      231



          1   process.  You said, and I quote, there was information

          2   they felt should have been in there to inform the

          3   stockholders of the detailed discussions they were having

          4   with the FTC.  I mean, I had no information on the

          5   detailed discussions.  They had no information on the

          6   detailed discussions with the FTC.

          7                  So my question to you is:  Beyond reading

          8   the press releases or news articles, sitting here today,

          9   do you have any understanding of what information was

         10   disclosed with respect to the detailed discussions with

         11   the FTC?

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

         13   multiple times today.

         14        A.   No, I don't.

         15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So what did you mean when you

         16   said I had no information on the detailed discussions,

         17   they had no information on the detailed discussions?

         18        A.   I would have liked more information on what the

         19   progress of the talks were.

         20        Q.   Great.  What effort did you undertake at the

         21   time to read the disclosures issued by either Walgreens or

         22   Rite Aid concerning the merger?

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         24                  You can talk about what you read.

         25        A.   I read the news articles.  That's -- that's what

                                                                      232



          1   I undertook, reading the news articles.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So sitting here today, you

          3   don't know whether or not there were in fact more detailed

          4   discussions made by Walgreens or Rite Aid concerning the

          5   status of discussions with FTC that you just didn't

          6   review, correct?

          7        A.   I didn't review everything, that's a fair

          8   statement, okay, but I did review quite a bit.  And those

          9   were in news articles primarily.  It was all -- a lot of

         10   it was hearsay.  It wasn't concrete information.  This is

         11   what -- this is how it's going and this is what was

         12   discussed, and these are the things that we have to do in

         13   order for the merger to be successful, this is what we

         14   talked about.

         15                  Maybe they're not allowed to divulge that

         16   information.  I don't know.  It's sort of out of my area

         17   of expertise.  But I was expecting more detailed

         18   information on how the talks were going that I didn't see.

         19   And I'm not saying it's not there; it's just that I didn't

         20   see it.

         21        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  So during the class

         22   period, so October 2016 to June 2017, you were aware of

         23   the fact that the timing for the close of the Merger

         24   Agreement had been extended once, correct?

         25        A.   I was aware that it was extended once, correct.

                                                                      233



          1        Q.   You were aware of the fact that there had been

          2   concerns identified by the FTC in its review, correct?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   You were aware of the fact that the FTC had

          5   demanded store divestitures?

          6        A.   But not -- yes.  Not to the detail, no.

          7        Q.   You were aware of the fact that Walgreens had

          8   entered into an agreement with Fred's to -- whereby there

          9   would be a divestiture of 865 stores, correct?

         10        A.   Yes.  That was at the very beginning.

         11        Q.   Okay.  You were aware that they had then in

         12   January extend -- amended the Merger Agreement again, to

         13   extend the timing, correct?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   And you were aware that that was in order to

         16   continue the process with the FTC?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Okay.  And you also knew that they had increased

         19   the number of stores that had to be divested in connection

         20   with the amendment to the Merger Agreement?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   Okay.  And you were aware -- I think you

         23   testified to this this morning -- but you were aware kind

         24   of from the outset that there was a risk that the FTC

         25   would not approve the deal, that that's common in any

                                                                      234



          1   merger?

          2        A.   That's common in any merger, and I'm aware that

          3   there's always a risk involved with any merger.

          4        Q.   Okay.  In connection with your decision to

          5   purchase 1,000 shares of Walgreens in January of 2017 --

          6   are you with me -- did you consider any specific

          7   statements by Walgreens in connection with the decision to

          8   make that purchase on January 3rd?

          9        A.   I don't remember.

         10        Q.   Okay.

         11        A.   I didn't even remember I shorted Fred's.  So...

         12                  MR. KNOTTS:  Just stick with the --

         13                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

         14                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- questions.

         15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So you first contemplated suing

         16   Rite Aid related to the deal, I believe, in 206 -- late

         17   2015 or early 2016; is that correct?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   Why did you decide to invest in a company that

         20   you had contemplated suing?

         21        A.   It was -- the reason for that was I felt that

         22   the stock price was too low.  That was the only reason.

         23        Q.   Did it make any difference to you in deciding

         24   whether or not to invest in Rite Aid that you had actually

         25   contemplated suing them?

                                                                      235



          1        A.   Yes.

          2        Q.   But you got over that?

          3        A.   Yes, I did.

          4        Q.   And how did you --

          5        A.   Because I had -- I had already -- I had shares

          6   that I owned previously.  All -- I think dating all the

          7   way back to 2013.  Okay.  And so, you know, I -- I was

          8   taking a risk, but I felt that -- I felt that the third

          9   largest drug store in the U.S. was worth more than $9 a

         10   share.

         11        Q.   And what was the risk that you were taking?

         12        A.   Well, the risk I was taking was that -- it's

         13   with any stock, you purchase a stock and you're taking a

         14   risk.  Okay.  It's not a sure thing, okay.  And I wasn't

         15   sure if the rest of the shareholders or, you know, even if

         16   the analysts -- the analysts didn't think that $9 was good

         17   enough.  The analyst thought that it should be more than

         18   that, and I agreed with the analyst.

         19        Q.   Was that the analysts you -- either the time you

         20   made your purchase in January 2017?

         21        A.   I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't remember.

         22        Q.   Was that the analyst's view -- what was the

         23   analyst's view when you purchased in June 2017?

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

         25   speculation.

                                                                      236



          1        A.   I don't remember.

          2        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   To the extent that you --

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Just let me get my objection

          4   out.

          5                  THE WITNESS:  Sorry.

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  I know we're getting late in

          7   the day.  Go ahead.

          8        A.   I'm sorry; I don't remember.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  And to be clear, and

         10   just to reframe in light of the objection, did you

         11   actually review any analysts' views that you can recall in

         12   connection with the June 2017 purchase?

         13        A.   June 2017?  No.  On that one I may have done

         14   that one on my own.  But I do remember reading that the --

         15   that it was -- it was a -- it was at a good level to

         16   purchase the stock.  I think it was $3 a share, something

         17   like that.

         18                  So that was at a good level.  I felt if the

         19   merger would go through, that the $3 would eventually be

         20   the $9, or at least 6.50.

         21        Q.   That was going to be my next question.

         22                  So -- okay.  What did you think about if

         23   the merger wouldn't go through?

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

         25        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So you testified that it was at

                                                                      237



          1   a good level.  I felt if the merger would go through, that

          2   the $3 would eventually be the 9, or at least 6.50.

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   What did you think about the risks that the

          5   merger wouldn't go through?

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection to form.

          7        A.   I thought the -- I thought there was less --

          8   less of a risk of it -- I was more confident that it would

          9   go through than not go through, which is why I purchased

         10   it.

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You were taking a chance that

         12   the merger would go through?

         13        A.   I was taking a chance that the merger would go

         14   through.

         15        Q.   Okay.  With respect to the events between the

         16   announcement of the Merger Agreement in 2015 and the end

         17   of 2017, did you take any -- I believe you testified that

         18   you were -- that you have no expertise in the FTC process;

         19   is that correct?

         20        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   That you haven't taken any courses on regulatory

         22   approval of mergers --

         23        A.   No.

         24        Q.   -- FTC specifically?

         25        A.   No, I haven't.

                                                                      238



          1        Q.   I think you testified you know just a little

          2   enough to be dangerous?

          3        A.   I do recall saying that.

          4        Q.   Okay.  So what did you do, if anything, during

          5   this time period to understand the FTC process and the

          6   risks attending to it?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

          8   multiple times.

          9                  You know, I think, Counsel, we're getting

         10   very, very redundant to material that -- that we've

         11   covered, and that you've asked specifically.  You started

         12   out with this -- with the same question.  You asked the

         13   question again a few minutes ago, and you're asking it

         14   again now.

         15                  You can answer to the extent you have

         16   anything to add.

         17        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Do you remember the question?

         18        A.   Yeah, I remember the question.

         19                  I have nothing else to add from what I

         20   previously said.

         21        Q.   So I don't think I actually previously asked

         22   this, so let me just be very clear.  If you could listen

         23   to this question.

         24                  What did you do, if anything, during the

         25   2015, 2016, 2017 time period to understand, as a general

                                                                      239



          1   matter, not specifically with respect to this transaction,

          2   just the FTC process and the risks that go along with it?

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Oh, okay.  And I didn't

          4   understand the question.  Just generally the FTC

          5   process --

          6                  MS. ZALKA:  Correct.

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- of merger reviews, not this

          8   one.

          9                  You can answer.

         10        A.   I didn't do anything regarding that particular

         11   area.  The only thing was reading the news chatter, okay,

         12   and different analysts giving different reasons; this is

         13   why this could happen, this is why that could happen.  But

         14   that's the only thing that -- that's the only training

         15   that I had, was just reading the news.

         16        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And I think there's one

         17   article -- and let's just make sure we have the record

         18   complete.

         19                  You mentioned, I think, by name one

         20   article.  Was it a Bloomberg article?

         21        A.   Well, I -- yeah, I remember that there were

         22   probably more than one Bloomberg article.

         23        Q.   Okay.  So I --

         24                  MR. KNOTTS:  He mentioned the names of a

         25   couple publications, more than Bloomberg, earlier today.

                                                                      240



          1   So I just -- I don't want you to --

          2                  MS. ZALKA:  Fair enough.

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  -- misstate that.

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So let me just -- what were the

          5   news sources that you reviewed in connection with

          6   monitoring Rite Aid and Walgreens and the deal during this

          7   time period?

          8                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.

          9        A.   Okay.

         10        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   What were they?

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered.  We've

         12   covered this.

         13        A.   I -- the -- the Bloomberg for sure.  I believe

         14   there were some Wall Street Journal, there were various

         15   Yahoo articles, but Yahoo's not necessarily the author of

         16   those articles.

         17                  I read many articles from many different

         18   analysts.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  When did you learn the

         20   truth?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, vague.

         22        A.   What truth?

         23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   So you're claiming that

         24   Walgreens made false statements, correct?

         25        A.   Uh-huh.

                                                                      241



          1        Q.   You are?

          2        A.   I'm saying --

          3                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Go ahead.

          5        A.   I -- I answered those questions already, right?

          6                  So I answered those questions already.  So,

          7   in hindsight, there was -- there was some

          8   misrepresentations, I think, in hindsight.

          9        Q.   When did you learn that?

         10        A.   Well, I learned that after -- I don't know

         11   the -- the days, but I learned that after the

         12   acquisition -- or after the merger broke up, in various

         13   news articles.

         14        Q.   Okay.  So is it your testimony that you learned

         15   the truth -- and by that I mean that Walgreens statements

         16   had been, according to you, previously misleading.

         17        A.   Uh-huh.

         18        Q.   Do you understand what I'm saying?

         19        A.   Uh-huh.

         20        Q.   Okay.  So when did you first learn that?

         21                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered.

         22        A.   I don't know.

         23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   You don't know?

         24        A.   No, I don't remember.

         25        Q.   Do you recall how long it was after --

                                                                      242



          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   -- the announcement of the Merger Agreement?

          3        A.   I don't recall.

          4        Q.   Was the first time that you learned that, of the

          5   truth, quote/unquote --

          6        A.   Uh-huh.

          7        Q.   -- was that after the announcement of the Merger

          8   Agreement termination?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   Okay.  How long after the announcement of the

         11   termination of the Merger Agreement announcement?

         12        A.   I don't know.

         13        Q.   Did the termination announcement in and of

         14   itself reveal the truth to you?

         15        A.   In a way, yes.  As far as -- no, it did -- as

         16   far as the -- you know, I thought that the -- during the

         17   time I was reading the statements, I thought it was

         18   truthful.  After the merger broke up, okay, I started

         19   thinking that some of the statements may not have been

         20   truthful.

         21        Q.   And that was --

         22        A.   And I don't know --

         23        Q.   Sorry.  Go ahead.

         24        A.   -- what the date is or how long after, but it

         25   was after the merger was cancelled.

                                                                      243



          1        Q.   Okay.  Did you learn the truth because the

          2   Merger Agreement was terminated?

          3        A.   I learned the truth after the agreement was

          4   terminated.  That's -- and reading articles about it also

          5   triggered memory.

          6        Q.   Got it.  What was the truth that you learned?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection.

          8                  I'll ask you not to divulge any

          9   communications with counsel.  I think she's just asking

         10   your independent understanding apart from what we've

         11   discussed about this lawsuit.

         12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Correct.

         13        A.   All right.  That -- again, it was that the

         14   merger would be successful.  That's what I thought at the

         15   beginning, okay.  And that's how I felt that Walgreens was

         16   communicating it to the shareholders, that it would be

         17   successful.  Then towards the end, they weren't

         18   communicating enough.  I was -- I felt like I was starved

         19   for information on how the merger was going.

         20                  But I kept with it.  And as I have already

         21   mentioned, I was expecting that the -- there would be a

         22   formal announcement that if the FTC didn't approve the

         23   merger, that that's how it would be, a formal announcement

         24   .  I didn't know that they were going to terminate it

         25   beforehand.  I mean, hindsight is 20/20.  If I knew they

                                                                      244



          1   were going to terminate it beforehand, I would have sold

          2   my stock.

          3        Q.   Do you think that if Walgreens was going to --

          4   knew that they were not going to get FTC approval

          5   beforehand, they would have undertaken all of the effort

          6   over the course of two years to get FTC approval?

          7                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, calls for

          8   speculation.

          9        A.   I don't know what they would have done.  I

         10   can't --

         11        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Does that make sense to you?

         12        A.   I can't put myself in their shoes, in their

         13   position.  It is speculating on my part.  I'm -- I can't

         14   answer that question.

         15        Q.   Okay.  So going back to when you learned the

         16   truth.

         17                  You -- I asked you specifically what was

         18   the truth that you learned, and counsel instructed you not

         19   to divulge privileged communication.  I agreed with that

         20   instruction, and you said the following:  It was the

         21   merger would be successful, that's what I thought at the

         22   beginning, and that's how you felt that Walgreen's was

         23   communicating it to the shareholders, that it would be

         24   successful.

         25                  Towards the end, they weren't

                                                                      245



          1   communicating, I felt like I was starved for information

          2   how this merger was going.  But I kept with it.  And as

          3   I've already mentioned, I was expecting that there would

          4   be a formal announcement, that if the FTC didn't approve

          5   the merger, that is how it would be, a formal

          6   announcement.  I didn't know they were going to terminate

          7   it beforehand.  I mean, in hindsight, it's 20/20.

          8                  What about that revealed the truth that had

          9   been previously concealed from you?

         10                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same instruction about not

         11   revealing communications with counsel or information that

         12   you've learned from counsel in connection with this

         13   lawsuit.  But you can answer based on your own independent

         14   views.

         15        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Again, I'm just asking about

         16   specifically what you recall thinking at the time, having

         17   read the disclosures, not about what you discussed with

         18   your lawyers.

         19        A.   No, no.  It's just -- no, this has nothing to do

         20   with what I discussed with attorneys.

         21                  You know, this -- I felt that there was

         22   information that could have been shared with the

         23   shareholders so the shareholder can make a better informed

         24   decision on which way to go with the stock.

         25        Q.   When was the truth revealed to you?

                                                                      246



          1                  MR. KNOTTS:  Objection, asked and answered

          2   multiple times.

          3                  MS. ZALKA:  I was going to say you've not

          4   answered my questions, and that's why I keep on having to

          5   ask it.

          6                  MR. KNOTTS:  He said he didn't remember.

          7        A.   I don't remember; I'm sorry.  I don't remember;

          8   I'm sorry.

          9        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Okay.  Putting aside when, what

         10   was the truth --

         11                  MR. KNOTTS:  Now, this is --

         12        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   -- that you learned about that

         13   you think was previously concealed by Walgreens'

         14   statements that you reviewed at the time?

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Asked and answered a number of

         16   times.  And again, I'll ask you not to divulge

         17   attorney/client communications.  But you can answer to the

         18   extent that you have anything to add to what you

         19   previously said.

         20        A.   At this point, I have nothing to add to what I

         21   previously said.  It -- I've said it five different ways,

         22   the same thing.

         23        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton, I

         24   don't think you've answered my question.

         25                  MR. KNOTTS:  You just don't like his

                                                                      247



          1   answer.  But he's answered.

          2                  MS. ZALKA:  No.  I'm perfect -- I -- he

          3   can --

          4        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   I -- I'm always here to hear

          5   what you have to say.  Right.

          6        A.   Sure.

          7        Q.   It's your testimony that counts.  Our lawyer

          8   bickering back and forth does not.  That can be up for the

          9   Judge to resolve.

         10                  What I want to understand is, you're

         11   sitting here today, you're, you know, suing for securities

         12   fraud against Walgreens.  And, right, I want to understand

         13   when and what led you to understand the truth that you

         14   think Walgreens lied about.

         15                  MR. KNOTTS:  Same objections.

         16                  I instruct you not to divulge

         17   communications with your attorneys.  But to the extent you

         18   had an independent understanding, you can answer.

         19        Q.   (BY MS. ZALKA)   And if you had no independent

         20   understanding of that until you had conversations with

         21   your attorneys, you can just say that.  I'm just -- I just

         22   want to understand what the basis was.

         23        A.   No, I -- I -- I thought that there was -- there

         24   could have been more information disclosed that wasn't

         25   disclosed.  That's it.  If I -- if there was more

                                                                      248



          1   information disclosed, I could have made a better informed

          2   decision on what to do with my stock.

          3        Q.   What was the information that you claim should

          4   have been disclosed?

          5        A.   Basically, a detailed explanation of how the

          6   talks were going.  And I didn't see that.  I just saw

          7   one-liners, talks are going well.  You know, that -- I

          8   didn't see anything detailed to help me make an informed

          9   decision.

         10                  MS. ZALKA:  Okay.  I have no further

         11   questions.

         12                  I'm going to make a formal request on the

         13   record that Plaintiffs produce all of the Ameritrade

         14   monthly account statements during the period between

         15   October 2015 and 2017.  I also think that there appears to

         16   have been a folder called the RAD folder that exists

         17   within Mr. Dayton's Ameritrade account that has not been

         18   produced.  That needs to be produced.  I also want to --

         19   we should schedule a meet and confer very promptly with

         20   respect to when those documents will be produced, because

         21   we're going to want to continue the deposition until

         22   they're produced.

         23                  MR. KNOTTS:  So we've already talked about

         24   trading records.  We'll get back to you on that.  And the

         25   folder that you're talking about, he testified clearly

                                                                      249



          1   that there's not currently information on the TD

          2   Ameritrade screen about the things that he was reading

          3   during the time period.  But to the extent -- but we're

          4   happy to look into those sorts of things.

          5                  I think you maybe -- you may have misheard

          6   what he said on that particular issue, but we'll look into

          7   all of this, and we're happy to meet and confer.

          8                  MS. ZALKA:  Great.

          9                  MR. KNOTTS:  Okay.  Off the record.

         10                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

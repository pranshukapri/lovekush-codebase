           19  did on May 19th?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  And you worked by yourself at the Kuraray EVAL

           22  plant on May 19th, correct?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  Did ISI tell you that there would be a startup

           11  during your employment at the Kuraray EVAL plant?

           12       A.  Yes.

           19  to work before you got any days off?

           20       A.  I -- I don't remember the exact days.

           21       Q.  Was it around two weeks or something like that?

           22  You don't know?

            1  said, to the muster point, did it continue to hurt?

            2       A.  Yes.  But with the adrenaline and just trying

            3  to -- to exit, I wasn't paying too much attention to the

            4  pain at that moment.

            5       Q.  And you didn't tell anybody that day that you

            8       Q.  So it was a layoff?

            9       A.  Well, I left a week before it ended --

           10       Q.  Because you knew --

           11       A.  -- to go to ISI.

           12       Q.  So is it fair to say that the employers that

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  And you went to the location that you had been

           15  trained to go to when the siren went off, correct?

           16       A.  Correct.

           17       Q.  And that was on the day of the incident on

           18  May 19th of last year?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  Okay.  And you received safety training on a

           21  regular basis throughout your career, correct?

           22       A.  Correct.

           23       Q.  And you've practiced sirens and drills?

           24       A.  Yes.

            2       A.  Correct.

            3       Q.  And looking back on the day of the incident, do

            4  you agree that you could have moved more calmly by not

            5  jumping down the stairs to get to the muster point?

            6                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

            7                THE WITNESS:  It was a thing at the moment

            8  where you're seeing fire, and you're trying to save your

            9  life.

           10       Q.  (BY MS. LUNCEFORD)  And you -- your testimony

           11  today is you could see the fire from that -- those steps

           12  when you opened that door?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  And that's the reason that you jumped?

           15       A.  I was trying to rush out.

           16       Q.  So you don't believe you could have moved any

           17  more safely?

           18       A.  At the moment I -- that's how -- that was my

           19  reaction, to get out as fast as I could.

           20       Q.  Okay.  Have you ever been disciplined for

           21  violating plant safety rules at any of the places you

           22  worked?

           23                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           24                THE WITNESS:  No.

           25       Q.  (BY MS. LUNCEFORD)  And you never attended the

                                                                      93



            1  regular safety meetings every morning at the Kuraray

            2  EVAL plant, correct?

            3       A.  No.

            4       Q.  Had you ever been trained in fall protection?

            5       A.  No.

            6       Q.  Have you ever failed a safety training test?

            7       A.  No.

            8       Q.  Based on your 20 years of experience working as

            9  a timekeeper for contractors in the chemical plants,

           10  would you agree there are certain risks associated with

           11  working in the chemical industry?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  What are those risks?

           14                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           15       Q.  (BY MS. LUNCEFORD)  You can answer.  That's

           16  just a legal thing.

           17       A.  Stuff like this.  Explosions.

           18       Q.  And you knew about those risks when you went to

           19  work at the Kuraray EVAL plant, correct?

           20       A.  Correct.

           21       Q.  And you were trained in how to respond to those

           22  risks, correct?

           23       A.  Correct.

           24       Q.  And safety is important in your business,

           25  correct?

                                                                      94



            1       A.  Correct.

            2       Q.  And that's because you work in a business that

            3  has a lot more risks than a lot of other people?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  And you face those risks every day that you

            6  work at these plants, correct?

            7       A.  Correct.

            8       Q.  And that's one of the reasons you receive

            9  frequent extensive safety training is so you have the

           10  knowledge on how to take the necessary precautions while

           11  you're working, correct?

           12       A.  Correct.

           17       Q.  Before May 19th, did you have any plans to

           18  become a supervisor?

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  Okay.  Do you have any plans now to become a

           21  supervisor?

           22       A.  No.

           23       Q.  Have you ever been hurt on the job before

           13       A.  This recent -- yes.

           14       Q.  Yes.

           15                So when you were laid off earlier this

           16  year, you applied for unemployment?

           17       A.  I'm not understanding what you're asking me.

           18       Q.  Okay.  You -- you applied for unemployment when

           19  you were laid off by ISI, I think you said, in March of

           21       A.  Yes.

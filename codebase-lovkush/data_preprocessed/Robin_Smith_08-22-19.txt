          5        Q.    I'm putting in front of you what's been

          6   marked as the first exhibit to this deposition.  Is

         11   further, John, would you like to agree -- as counsel

         12   for the deponent, would you like to agree to the

         13   usual stipulations?  In other words, all objections,

         14   except as to form, are reserved for the time of trial

          4   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

          5        Q.    And what is your -- do you see that your

          6   deposition was noticed, Miss Smith, as an officer,

          7   director, or managing agent of the defendant

          8   Smith Marine, Inc. in this lawsuit?

          9        A.    Yes.

         10        Q.    And what is your -- are you an officer,

         11   director, or managing agent of the defendant Smith

         12   Marine, Incorporated?

         13        A.    Yes.

         14        Q.    What are your positions in those

         15   capacities?

         16        A.    CEO, director, treasurer, clerk.

         17        Q.    All right.  And how long have you had

         18   those positions?

         19        A.    2003 we incorporated.  In 2005, I became

         20   CEO.

         21        Q.    So you've held those positions since at

         22   least 2005 --

         23        A.    Yes.

         24        Q.    -- in your estimation?

                                                                  8





          1        A.    Yes.

          2        Q.    And what business does Smith Marine,

          3   Incorporated engage in?

          4        A.    Smith Marine is a marine contracting

          5   company.  We support many marine projects such as we

          6   provide tugboats and -- I have to ask.  Am I looking

          7   at you or --

          8        Q.    You can look in any direction you like.  I

          9   actually do not insist that a deponent -- whatever

         10   makes the deponent more comfortable.  If you would

         11   like to look at Mr. Bromley, that's perfectly fine.

         12        A.    I feel like I should look at you, but I

         13   realize I don't have to look at you.

         14        Q.    And if you would like to look at our court

         15   reporter, that's fine, if it's fine with her.  It's

         16   just fine.

         17        A.    I'll look at everybody.

         18        Q.    That's fine.

         19        A.    Back to the question.  So Smith Marine is

         20   a marine contracting company.  We have barges and

         21   tugboats and specialize in a variety of marine

         22   consulting and marine contracting.  We provide

         23   tugboats to assist with dredge projects.  We do

         24   coastal towing.  We do pier building.  We do pile

          1   driving, drill support, bridge inspections with

          2   MassDOT, Rhode Island DOT.  Marine contracting is a

          3   wide variety of services and equipment that we offer.

          4        Q.    And does Smith Marine -- by the way, I'll

          5   refer to "Smith Marine, Incorporated," the defendant

          6   in this lawsuit that we referenced at times just as

          7   "Smith Marine" or as "SMI."  Is that okay?

          8        A.    Sure.  Absolutely.

          9        Q.    Okay.  And does Smith Marine own a tugboat

         10   called the M, backslash V, as in Victor, Meridian, M

         11   as in Mike, E-R-I, D as in delta, I-A, N as in

         12   November?

         13        A.    Correct.  Yes.

         14              MR. FITZPATRICK:  We'll have this marked

         15   as the next exhibit.

         21        Q.    And I've just put in front of you what's

         22   been marked as Exhibit 2 for today's deposition.  Can

         23   you identify what that eight-page photocopied

          1        A.    It's photographs and specs of our towing

          2   vessel, the Meridian.

          3        Q.    Does this appear to be pulled from the

          4   Smith Marine website?

          5        A.    Yes, it does.

          6        Q.    And did you own -- did Smith Marine own

          7   the Meridian back in 2014 and 2015?

          8        A.    We do own the Meridian with a note to our

          9   bank.

         10        Q.    But it was under your operation -- under

         11   Smith Marine's operation and control?

         12        A.    Yes, absolutely.

         13        Q.    All right.  And I'm going to ask you what

         14   the total horsepower of the Meridian is, and please

         15   feel free to refer to this printout from the Smith

         16   Marine website to refresh your memory if you're not

         17   sure.

         18        A.    Fourteen hundred.  Two 700-horsepower twin

         19   diesels.

         20        Q.    So the Meridian has two twin diesel

         21   engines of 700 horsepower each for a total horsepower

         22   for the Meridian of 1,400 horsepower; is that

         23   correct?

         24        A.    Yes.

          1        Q.    Could you please describe Smith Marine's

          2   involvement in the Royal River Project in 2014

          3   through 2015?

          4        A.    Smith Marine was hired by Burnham

          5   Associates to tend the dredge equipment.

          6        Q.    In what way?

          7        A.    In the manner of -- or in the way of

          8   moving the barges out to the offload site and back

          9   into the jobsite.

         10        Q.    So Smith Marine's role in the Royal River

         11   Project would be to move Burnham barges to and from

         12   the dredge site to open ocean?

         13        A.    To the dredge location off-site and then

         14   back in light scow to the jobsite, yes.

         15        Q.    So it was moving the Burnham Associates's

         16   barges or scows back and forth during the project,

         17   correct?

         18        A.    Yes.  Tending the barges.

         19        Q.    And by "tending," does that mean either

         20   pushing or towing the barges?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    And what vessel -- what Smith Marine tug

         23   vessel was used for this purpose on the Royal River

         24   Project?

          1        A.    The Meridian.

          2        Q.    And approximately what was the time period

          3   of Smith Marine's involvement in the Royal River

          4   Project, if you recall?

          5        A.    November 2014 to approximately the end of

          6   January of 2015.

          7        Q.    And how did the project go?

          8        A.    Good.

          9        Q.    What was your role in the Royal River

         10   Project in terms of what you were doing?

         11        A.    I oversaw the operations from the office

         12   and oversaw the administrative duties associated with

         13   the job such as the payroll, the timecards, the

         14   invoicing.  So financial, HR, contracting office

         15   roles.

         16        Q.    And were there any others who worked with

         17   you in the Smith Marine office?

         18        A.    Can I clarify?  On this project, or in

         19   general in my office?

         20        Q.    Well, yes.  Thank you for that

         21   clarification.  So during the Royal River Project,

         22   who else worked with you in the Smith Marine office?

         23        A.    Well, at that time, I used Sage payroll

         24   company.  They're my third-party payroll company.

          1   They weren't physically in my office, but the reports

          2   went to them.  And I have an assistant who would help

          3   with payroll, but that's -- I oversaw it.  It was my

          4   duties at that time to oversee.

          5        Q.    And who was that?

          6        A.    Kathy Christopher.  And if I can retract,

          7   I have to actually go back and say I don't know if

          8   she was assisting me during this job or not.  She

          9   helps me with my payroll, so I don't know if she was

         10   in the office during this project.

         11        Q.    So during the Royal River Project, your

         12   role for Smith Marine was work out of the office --

         13   the Smith Marine office in the way you've described?

         14        A.    Correct.

         15        Q.    And were you working in the office either

         16   alone or with this assistant who you described just

         17   now?

         18        A.    It's two questions, alone or with the

         19   assistant.  If the time frame matches -- you know

         20   what?  I'm going to take that back.  I don't think

         21   she was with me in 2015.  She came on later that

         22   year.  So it was just myself working on the payroll

         23   and the contracting and the log -- doing the

         24   insurance certificates to Burnham and all the

          1   administrative duties associated with the project.

          2   Just myself.

          3        Q.    And you were doing this from the Smith

          4   Marine office --

          5        A.    Yes.

          6        Q.    -- during the Royal River Project?

          7        A.    Correct.

          8        Q.    And where was the Smith Marine office

          9   located at this time?

         10        A.    16 Anderson Street, Suite 201, Marblehead,

         11   Mass.

         12        Q.    And is Smith Marine still located there?

         13        A.    Yes.

         14        Q.    Who is Matt Plauche?

         15        A.    Matt is my business partner.

         16        Q.    And how is his name spelled?  The last

         17   name.

         18        A.    P-L-A-U-C-H-E.

         19        Q.    And what was his role, if any, in the

         20   Royal River Project?

         21        A.    Matt does the estimating.  So he

         22   corresponded back and forth with Burnham Associates

         23   regarding setting up the pricing and the structure of

         24   the project and the logistics of what equipment was

          1   going to be used and what was going to be needed for

          2   their project.

          3        Q.    Does he work out of the Smith Marine

          4   office, or does he work remotely?

          5        A.    He works from Smith Marine office as well.

          6        Q.    So he was also working at the Smith Marine

          7   office during the time of the Royal River Project?

          8        A.    On his duties, yes.

          9        Q.    And was there anybody else -- other than

         10   you and Matt, was there anybody else who was working

         11   out of the Smith Marine office during the Royal River

         12   Project for Smith Marine?

         13        A.    John Harvey may have been working in our

         14   downstairs office.  I would have to refer back to my

         15   lease to see if we had the downstairs office at that

         16   time, but John Harvey did office work as well.  Not

         17   on the Royal River Project, but other office work.

         18   So he would have been in the downstairs, which is

         19   Suite 201.

         20        Q.    Anyone else possibly involved?  So

         21   John Harvey was not involved, but anybody else from

         22   Smith Marine who worked out of the Smith Marine

         23   office with you and Matt who was possibly involved in

         24   the Royal River Project?

          1        A.    Kathy would have also done -- Kathy does

          2   my onboarding, my HR, uploads into our HR software.

          3   So she would have run the I-9s and she would have

          4   done the scanning of documents.  She doesn't sign

          5   anything.  She doesn't have authorization to sign

          6   anything, but Kathy Schalck -- this is a different

          7   Kathy -- she does my onboarding paperwork.  Once I

          8   hire somebody, she then scans it.  She's an

          9   administrative assistant.

         13        Q.    And would this Kathy have been performing

         15   Royal River Project?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    And for the Royal River Project?

         18        A.    Yes.  Any -- yes.

         19        Q.    And the duties you're describing focused

         20   primarily on the hiring of crew members for Smith

         22        A.    The administrative support for onboarding.

          1   running the E-Verify with Homeland Security.  The

          2   administrative paperwork behind hiring somebody.

          3        Q.    For the Smith Marine vessel crew members?

          4        A.    Correct.  Yes.

          5        Q.    Anyone else involved in the Royal River

          6   Project working out of the Smith Marine office?

          7        A.    Andy was on -- Andy does come to the

          8   office, and I'm sure he was physically in the

          9   office -- Andy Smith, my husband -- at that time, but

         10   he was not assigned to the office because he was

         11   actually on the project.

         12        Q.    So your husband, Andy Smith, also worked

         13   on the Royal River Project for Smith Marine, correct?

         14        A.    Yes.

         15        Q.    And Andy -- may I call him Andy to

         16   differentiate him from you?

         17        A.    Yes.

         18        Q.    And Andy is an officer in Smith Marine?

         19        A.    Yes.

         22        A.    Matt is a vice president of operations and

         23   a senior estimator.

          1   business partner.  In what sense is Matt a business

          2   partner with you in Smith Marine?

          3        A.    Matt owns 20 percent of the business.

          4        Q.    So that would be 20 percent of the stock?

          5        A.    Yes.  Twenty percent of the shares.

          6        Q.    Okay.  And how are the shares otherwise

          7   distributed?  Between you and your husband?

          8        A.    They are.  In fact, we also have other

          9   shareholders as well.

         10        Q.    Is the stock publicly traded?

         11        A.    No.

         12        Q.    Anyone else, other than crew members, from

         13   Smith Marine who were involved in the Royal River

         14   Project?

         15        A.    Not that I can recall.

         16        Q.    All right.  Now, did -- there was a

         17   grounding of a Burnham scow on the Royal River

         18   Project that was brought to your attention; is that

         19   correct?

         20        A.    Yes.

         21        Q.    And do you recall which scow this was?

         22        A.    I believe the 104.

         23        Q.    And do you remember approximately when you

         24   first learned about the 104's grounding on the Royal

          1   River Project that was brought to your attention?

          2        A.    January 11th is the date that comes to

          3   mind without my notes.

          4        Q.    What year?

          5        A.    2015.

          6        Q.    And who -- how did you learn about the

          7   grounding?

          8        A.    I was actually notified by Andy or Matt.

          9   I do not recall which one.  One of them took the

         10   initial call, and they -- the information got back to

         11   the office, and that's when I was made aware.

         12        Q.    And how did Andy or Matt tell you --

         13   whoever you were speaking to, either Andy or Matt,

         14   about this grounding at the time that you described,

         15   did they indicate how they learned of it?

         16        A.    I do not recall.

         17        Q.    And what were you told, if you recall, by

         18   Andy or Matt?

         19        A.    I don't recall details.  I recall being

         20   told there was an incident, and my role at that time

         21   was to -- Matt and Andy took over completely with

         22   whatever the incident was at that moment, which we do

         23   immediately in this industry, and in terms of what I

         24   did, I don't recall doing anything at that moment

          1   other than carrying on my day-to-day operations.

          2        Q.    And you were basically leaving it -- at

          3   that point, after you first received notification

          4   about this grounding of the 104 -- the Burnham scow

          5   or barge 104 in early January of 2015, after

          6   receiving this notification, you basically for that

          7   time left it to Andy and Matt to handle it?

          8        A.    That day in the moment.  And I want to

          9   just back up for one moment.  At that point, it

         10   wasn't being told to me it was even a grounding.  It

         11   was an incident.  It was very open.

         12        Q.    At some point, did you alert an insurance

         13   representative that this incident of a grounding or

         14   the incident that you were told about might lead to

         15   an insurance claim?

         16        A.    Yes.  I alerted my agent, Thomas Gregory

         17   Associates.

         18        Q.    And who did you alert about this potential

         19   claim there?

         20        A.    It would have been Andrew Gregory or

         21   Mary Cote.

         22        Q.    Who is J.P. Williamson?

         23        A.    J.P. Williamson is an adjustor/surveyor

         24   who -- an adjustor or surveyor who he works for IMU,



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  21





          1   who works -- who represents the underwriter, and TGA

          2   represents the client, which is Smith Marine.

          3       So Smith Marine is the client.  TGA is my agent.

          4   IMU and TGA work together without the client.  And

          5   then IMU -- J.P. at the time worked for IMU.

          6        Q.    And J.P. Williamson, what was his role?

          7   You described him as an adjuster, but in particular,

          8   what was his role with regard to this claim for what

          9   you call the Royal River incident?

         10        A.    It was my understanding that he was

         11   notified -- once ISR, International Special Risk, was

         12   notified by my agent, which is TGA, Thomas Gregory

         13   Associates, they got J.P. Williamson involved to go

         14   out and assess the damages to see what this incident

         15   was all about and what happened.

         16        Q.    It sounds like it was being taken pretty

         17   seriously both on your end -- on the Smith Marine end

         18   as well as by the insurer?

         19        A.    We take every incident, minor or severe,

         20   seriously.

         21        Q.    When did it become apparent to you this

         22   had been a grounding?  When did that first become

         23   apparent to you?

         24        A.    I'm trying to think back.  I do not recall



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  22





          1   the exact answer to that question.

          2        Q.    Was it still in January of 2015?

          3        A.    Yes.

          4        Q.    And how -- well, you're probably learning

          5   all this information secondhand?

          6        A.    A lot of hearsay in the office because it

          7   wasn't my duties at that time to do anything other

          8   than notify the insurance company and let the

          9   insurance company then contact the people they needed

         10   to contact to find out more information.

         11        Q.    As best you can recall, what was your next

         12   involvement -- after first being notified, what was

         13   your next involvement with this Royal River incident?

         14        A.    I remember having a conversation with Matt

         15   and Andy.  It was probably a few days after, and it's

         16   standard practice that we would get anybody who had

         17   any information documented while it was fresh in

         18   their mind.

         19        Q.    And who was it that were identified?  Who

         20   were the persons identified as being witnesses to the

         21   incident or the grounding of the Burnham scow or

         22   barge 104?

         23        A.    So I e-mailed Glenn Walker, who was a

         24   captain of ours, and I e-mailed Paul Poirier, who is



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  23





          1   a captain of ours as well working on the job that

          2   day.

          3        Q.    And this was with regard to the

          4   January 11, 2015 grounding of the 104?

          5        A.    Yes.

          6        Q.    Okay.  And who else did you learn was a

          7   witness to this grounding in January of 2015?

          8        A.    I believe Jeff Mank was the deckhand on

          9   board.  I'm not 100 percent confident on that.  I'd

         10   have to go back to my own internal payroll notes, but

         11   I feel confident in my answer, but I believe -- I'm

         12   not 100 percent sure -- that Jeff was the deckhand.

         13        Q.    Did you obtain statements from the

         14   individuals you just identified, namely Mr. Walker

         15   and Mr. Poirier?

         16        A.    I absolutely did, yes.

         17        Q.    And those were written statements?

         18        A.    Yes.  I requested that they put everything

         19   in writing, as I do with every single incident in

         20   this business, whether it's a staple gun through a

         21   finger or a tire that goes flat on the highway.  If

         22   it's operated and owned by Smith Marine, it needs

         23   very detailed documentation.

         24        Q.    What about Jeff Mank?  Did you obtain a



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  24





          1   written statement from Jeff Mank about the

          2   January 11, 2015 grounding?

          3        A.    I do not recall.  I don't think I did.

          4        Q.    Okay.  Do you know why?

          5        A.    I do not recall.

          6        Q.    And did you speak to Glenn Walker or

          7   Paul Poirier or both about the January 11, 2015

          8   Burnham 104 grounding?

          9        A.    I did not at the time.  Since the

         10   statements, I have had very vague conversations such

         11   as is this still going on?  Is something happening?

         12   Are we still in this, because they obviously wanted

         13   to know why I asked for a statement originally, and

         14   that is the level of the conversations, but nothing

         15   in detail about the actual details of that day or the

         16   damage or the lack of damage or the tide or the

         17   depths or any of the logistics involved.

         18        Q.    Is what you're describing you're obtaining

         19   written statements from Paul Poirier and Glenn Walker

         20   in January of 2015, and thereafter they would be

         21   calling or contacting you from time to time to find

         22   out if this case is still going on?

         23        A.    No.

         24        Q.    All right.



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  25





          1        A.    I wouldn't phrase it that way.

          2        Q.    Please clarify, then, what you're

          3   describing.

          4        A.    Paul Poirier I have not had communication

          5   with.  Glenn Walker, we see him because we live in

          6   the same town.  So it was more in passing in the

          7   sandwich shop or at the local restaurant or something

          8   of that nature, at a cocktail party that we were all

          9   at that we would see one another and just a very

         10   casual conversation.  Never in an office setting

         11   talking about facts.  It was more of, you know, for

         12   checking in on us, and we're making sure we were

         13   staying open with our employees.

         14        Q.    Have you ever discussed the grounding of

         15   the Burnham barge or scow 104 with anyone from

         16   Burnham Associates?

         17        A.    By e-mail or discuss?  Is that verbal, or

         18   is it --

         19        Q.    Communicated with.  Let me put it that

         20   way.

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    Communicated with by e-mail, phone --

         23        A.    Yes.

         24        Q.    -- in person, or in writing some other



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  26





          1   way?

          2        A.    Oh, yes.

          3        Q.    Okay.  And how so and with whom?

          4        A.    Craig and I have e-mailed back and forth

          5   regarding invoicing and items -- line items on the

          6   invoices that we held off on or credited back for the

          7   time being as retainage.  At the time being, Matt and

          8   I -- Sullivan, I believe it is -- did the same with

          9   invoicing.  Actually, Craig and I started the

         10   conversation with invoicing, and Matt took over in

         11   Craig's place to finish that process, what we decided

         12   to do with a few open items.

         13        Q.    So Matt Sullivan is Matt Sullivan from

         14   Burnham Associates?

         15        A.    Yes.

         16        Q.    And anyone else from Burnham Associates

         17   who you've communicated with regarding the Royal

         18   River January 11, 2015 grounding of the 104?

         19        A.    No.

         20        Q.    And how often have you spoken to anyone

         21   from Burnham Associates by phone or in person about

         22   the grounding?

         23        A.    Oh, gosh.  Not frequent.  I do not recall.

         24        Q.    Okay.  And do you recall -- you may have



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  27





          1   just answered this question, but do you recall -- if

          2   you have spoken with anybody from Burnham Associates

          3   about the grounding or this lawsuit, do you recall

          4   what was said?

          5        A.    I do not recall.

          6        Q.    So your communications with Burnham

          7   Associate about this lawsuit, about the grounding in

          8   January 2015 should all be pretty apparent -- should

          9   all be evident from e-mails going back and forth --

         10        A.    Yes.

         11        Q.    -- between you and Burnham Associates?

         12        A.    Yes.  And I'd like to just say one thing

         13   with that.  In terms of communication, there was

         14   never -- we didn't communicate about the incident or

         15   the employees on board or the weather conditions or

         16   anything of that nature.  We communicated about what

         17   I discussed a few minutes ago.

         18        Q.    And what was that?

         19        A.    The invoicing and the money attached to

         20   the certain days in question that we were charging

         21   for.

         22        Q.    So in terms of the particulars of

         23   Burnham's claims, was that discussed?

         24        A.    No.

                                                                  28





          1        Q.    Do you recall at some point during or just

          2   before the Royal River Project Craig Burnham having a

          3   discussion with you about Glenn Walker?

          4        A.    I do not recall.

          5        Q.    Do you recall Craig Burnham speaking to

          6   you about Glenn Walker and specifically saying he did

          7   not want Glenn Walker hired working on the Royal

          8   River Project?

          9        A.    I do not recall.

         10        Q.    Do you know what DQM is?

         11        A.    I do not.

         12        Q.    All right.  And I'll just ask a follow-up

         13   to that.  Have you ever heard of dredge quality

         14   management?

         15        A.    Yes.

         16        Q.    And what is that?

         17        A.    To my knowledge, it's going back to the

         18   DQM, the software in which the equipment uses to

         19   track movements on the job.

         20        Q.    Are you talking about something that is

         21   actually installed in the vessel?

         22        A.    Yes.

         23        Q.    In the tow vessel?

         24        A.    Yes.



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  29





          1        Q.    Have you heard a term "dredge pack" or

          2   "high pack"?

          3        A.    Yes.

          4        Q.    And do you think that dredge quality

          5   management is another name for that?

          6        A.    I don't know.

          7        Q.    So how sure are you that dredge quality

          8   management is the same as a dredge pack or a high

          9   pack?

         10        A.    I am not sure.

         11        Q.    During the Royal River project, how did

         12   Smith Marine assign its captains for the Meridian?

         13        A.    Can you clarify that question?

         14        Q.    The Meridian, when it was operating during

         15   the Royal River Project, was required to have a

         16   captain --

         17        A.    Correct.

         18        Q.    -- directing the vessel, correct?

         19        A.    Right.

         20        Q.    And so how were those captains assigned?

         21        A.    They were assigned based on availability,

         22   based on a fair rotation, based on licensing that

         23   they had at the time.  They were assigned just as if

         24   we assigned any competent individual to a role on a



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  30





          1   vessel.

          2        Q.    Are any criteria used for that purpose?

          3        A.    They're prerequisites with the onboarding

          4   and the hiring of a person in which we use in a role

          5   on a tugboat.  There are references done.  There are

          6   resumes received.  There are applications as well as

          7   just standard onboarding practices that I do as well

          8   as Matt and Andy would in terms of -- we share the

          9   role of reference checks in getting recommendations.

         10   I'm not always looking for what they're looking for,

         11   and they're not always looking for what I'm looking

         12   for.  I do drug tests on all my employees.  It's just

         13   a preemployment practice.

         14       So in terms of the actual assignment of the

         15   job -- I think I'm answering two questions, for the

         16   assignment of the job and onboarding with Smith

         17   Marine, and it's different for both of these

         18   gentlemen because one was already onboarded and one

         19   was not.

         20        Q.    More specifically, and as just a very

         21   practical matter, day to day, week to week during the

         22   Royal River Project, who from Smith Marine was

         23   deciding who was going to be the captain of the

         24   Meridian during any given shift or day?

                                                                  31





          1        A.    That would have been Andy and Matt

          2   together.  They work collaboratively on all of those

          3   decisions.

          4        Q.    And was a record kept at Smith Marine

          5   recording who was the captain on a particular day?

          6        A.    Yes.

          7        Q.    And what is that record?

          8        A.    There's a variety of ways.  There's a

          9   schedule that -- we switched software.  So there's a

         10   schedule that is kept now for weekly schedule.

         11   Everybody knows their role going into the week.  I do

         12   not recall what I did in 2015 for assignments.  I

         13   don't know if it was electronic at that time or if it

         14   was old school posted or if it was texted

         15   individually to folks.  I would have -- I do not

         16   recall what format of scheduling I used in 2014, '15.

         17        Q.    Does Smith Marine have any records of who

         18   was assigned as a captain on the Royal River Project

         19   for each day of Smith Marine's involvement in the

         20   Royal River Project for the Meridian?

         21        A.    Can I ask you a question to clarify that?

         22        Q.    Please.  Yes.

         23        A.    The captain's notes would be in the

         24   logbook indicating they were the captain at the time,



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  32





          1   and we, obviously, had every role assigned on the

          2   vessel.  The question that you're asking me is that,

          3   prior to them getting on the vessel, was there a

          4   stated document that said who was in what role?

          5        Q.    Yes.

          6        A.    That's how I'm understanding the question.

          7        Q.    So let me rephrase the question to

          8   hopefully clarify.

          9       Other than -- you've described the logbook,

         10   correct?

         11        A.    Uh-huh.

         12        Q.    You have to say "yes" or "no."

         13        A.    Yes.

         14        Q.    And the Meridian, like every vessel that

         15   is licensed by the Coast Guard, it has to maintain a

         16   logbook; is that correct?

         17        A.    Yes.

         18        Q.    And the logbook must record crew members

         19   and important events of that day, correct?

         20        A.    Yes.

         21        Q.    And is there -- and the logbook for the

         22   Meridian consists of a bound notebook with

         23   handwritten notes on it; is that correct?

         24        A.    Yes.

                                                                  33





          1        Q.    And that's the way it was back in 2014 and

          2   2015 for the Meridian?

          3        A.    Yes.

          4        Q.    Other than whatever was written in the

          5   logbook, did -- or does, I should say, Smith Marine

          6   keep records -- or does Smith Marine have records of

          7   who the captain was for the Meridian day to day back

          8   in 2014 to 2015, and specifically during the Royal

          9   River Project, other than what's in the log?

         10        A.    I do not recall.

         11        Q.    Who is Dave Smith?

         12        A.    David Smith is our -- he's our attorney.

         13   Smith Marine's attorney.

         14        Q.    And was David Smith consulted with

         15   regarding this lawsuit?

         16        A.    No.

         17        Q.    Do you recall sending David Smith e-mails

         18   regarding this lawsuit asking for his advice?

         19        A.    Well, David Smith wrote the time charter

         20   party, so in terms of consulting -- I want to back

         21   up.  I'm going to put that in the realm of

         22   consulting.  So he was -- I'm going to go back and

         23   say yes, he was.  He wrote our time charter party --

         24        Q.    Pardon me for interrupting, but please do



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  34





          1   not volunteer to me whatever the contents of your

          2   discussions were with David Smith.  I'm trying to be

          3   very general.  Whatever you and David Smith discussed

          4   is privileged, and so please don't tell me that

          5   information.

          6        A.    Right.

          7        Q.    The particulars of it I don't want to

          8   know.

          9        A.    There weren't a lot, so that's easy.

         10        Q.    I can appreciate that.  But I'm talking in

         11   very, very general terms, and I'm sure your lawyer

         12   will interrupt you if you go too far astray, but I

         13   also want to give you that heads-up.

         14        A.    Sure.  Do you mind just asking the

         15   question one more time?

         16        Q.    Sure.  Okay.  Did you consult with

         17   Attorney David Smith about this lawsuit of Burnham

         18   Associates against Smith Marine?

         19        A.    Yes.

         20        Q.    And was that primarily by e-mail?

         21        A.    No.  I'm sure there were a few e-mails,

         22   but I actually don't recall even writing an e-mail.

         23        Q.    So what were your communication with

         24   David Smith about this lawsuit -- what did those



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  35





          1   communications primarily consist of?

          2              MR. BROMLEY:  Well, be careful there

          3   because the attorney-client privilege is going to

          4   include topics discussed.  He can ask you if you

          5   talked, how long you talked, what date you talked on.

          6   The physics of it, but not the contents.

          7        A.    I don't really remember talking that much

          8   because I knew there was a conflict of interest

          9   because he represents Burnham, too.  So he didn't

         10   want to get involved, which I respected because we

         11   have a lot of respect for each other.  I didn't want

         12   to put him in that position.

         13       So David Smith has really stayed out of this.  It

         14   was probably me or it was me going to him saying I

         15   was -- an officer just showed up at my door and

         16   handed me papers.  What do I do?  You know, this is

         17   my attorney.

         18        Q.    Right.  So you're describing how you were

         19   first sued --

         20        A.    Exactly.

         21        Q.    -- and you were served --

         22        A.    I think I was just sued by Craig Burnham.

         23   What do I do?

         24        Q.    Again, as your counsel just said, please



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  36





          1   don't tell me what he told you to do.

          2        A.    Right.  And I don't think he really told

          3   me to do anything.  It was more of me going to my

          4   comfort attorney saying this is what just happened,

          5   and that's where -- and there were probably a few

          6   conversations, but David Smith has really stayed out

          7   of this for the reasons that I mentioned before.

          8       In fact, he learned this morning that I was

          9   coming here because he had to write my will for my

         10   kids.  So he didn't even know.  I tried to keep him

         11   out as much as possible knowing that it was a

         12   conflict of interest, and he has an interest in

         13   Craig Burnham as well.

         14        Q.    Did you ever give any sort of a written or

         15   recorded statement to your insurer -- to Smith

         16   Marine's insurer regarding this lawsuit?

         17        A.    Gosh --

         18              MR. BROMLEY:  Just for clarification, if

         19   you don't mind, John, when you say "insurer," are you

         20   talking about the underwriter, or are you talking

         21   about the agent?

         22              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Any insuring

         23   representative or party as widely as possible.

         24        A.    I don't work with my insurance company at



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  37





          1   all.  I work only through the agent.  Did I ever give

          2   a written -- I'm sure I did.  I don't recall.

          3        Q.    And how about -- if you recall, how about

          4   anybody from Smith Marine?  Did anyone from Smith

          5   Marine ever give a statement of any sort in writing,

          6   sitting down with a court reporter like the court

          7   reporter we have here today, recorded to any

          8   insurance representative with regard to Burnham

          9   Associates's grounding claims?

         10        A.    I do not recall.  I don't know if an

         11   e-mail or a verbal phone call outlining the

         12   information was ever given.

         13        Q.    Who is Tom Kula, K-U-L-A?

         14        A.    I have no idea.  Can you -- K -- what is

         15   it?

         16        Q.    K-U-L-A.  K as in kilo, U as in uniform, L

         17   as in lima, A as in alpha.

         18        A.    No idea.  Can you give me any reference?

         19        Q.    We have a few exhibits to go through, so

         20   it may be in one of those.

         21        A.    Okay.

         22        Q.    How was -- how did Smith Marine -- during

         23   the Royal River Project, how did Smith Marine

         24   determine operator competency for those who operated

          1   its vessels?

          2        A.    Our captains are -- starting with our

          3   onboarding process we have an application in which

          4   all of their work history is listed.  We take a

          5   resume.  We keep copies of all of their licensing.

          6   We very often will do reference checks.  It's not

          7   standard.  I mean, it's not always the case.

          8   Sometimes captains will come to us through personal

          9   references in which we trust the person who sent them

         10   to us.  We look at their credentials and their past

         11   experience and interview them, and if the fit is

         12   right, we make up our offer, which is generally how

         13   we bring somebody on board.

         14              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Let's mark this as the

         15   next exhibit, please.

         21        Q.    I have put in front of you a two-page

         22   document.  It's a photocopy of e-mails.  The first

         23   page bears in the lower left-hand corner the document

         24   production page number of ASIC-1069, and the

          1   following and last page of this two-page deposition

          2   exhibit in the lower left-hand corner has page number

          3   1070.  Can we agree that that is what deposition

          4   Exhibit 3 for this deposition consists of?

          5        A.    Yes.

          6        Q.    And just please let me know -- please take

          7   a moment to review that deposition exhibit, and then

          8   let me know if you recognize it.

          9        A.    Yes.  All set.

         10        Q.    And first of all, going back to what

         11   appears to be the originating e-mail in this thread,

         12   which is from, it appears, you to Sarah Shepard --

         13        A.    Yes.

         14        Q.    -- and copying several people.  The e-mail

         15   being dated January 13, 2015 at 6:34 a.m.  Do you see

         16   that e-mail?

         17        A.    Yes.

         18        Q.    And that's on page 2, correct?

         19        A.    Yeah.

         20        Q.    Is that the e-mail you used back in 2014

         21   and 2015 that is shown here in this exhibit in this

         22   January 13 e-mail, robin@ -- one word --

         23   smithmarineinc.com?

         24        A.    Yes.



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  40





          1        Q.    And do you still use that e-mail?

          2        A.    Yes, I do.

          3        Q.    And what was happening here?

          4        A.    So this is -- this is making me recall now

          5   what I didn't recall before, so thank you.  This is

          6   my notification to Thomas Gregory Associates.

          7   Sarah Shepard is the claims representative, or was at

          8   the time, at TGA.  And Mary Cote, I work with Mary.

          9   It generally went to Mary Cote.  In this case I sent

         10   it to Sarah and Mary.  It was what I knew at that

         11   time, and I was given information that there was an

         12   incident, and I reported that right to Thomas Gregory

         13   Associates a few days after the fact.

         14        Q.    So this indicates that by

         15   January 13, 2015, you were notifying your insurer

         16   about the Burnham scow grounding; is that right?

         17        A.    Yes.  Notifying my agent, yes.

         18        Q.    And then do you see at the top of the

         19   first page, there's an e-mail from you that concludes

         20   this thread in this Exhibit Number 3 where you say,

         21   "J.P. is in touch with vessel captain directly

         22   already.  So he'll get the reports he needs directly

         23   from the vessel and share them with you"?

         24        A.    Yes.

                                                                  41





          1        Q.    And by that point, you seem in this e-mail

          2   to be familiar with who J.P. is; is that correct?

          3        A.    Yes.  We've worked with J.P. for 15 years

          4   or so or a little less than 15 years.

          5        Q.    Is J.P. -- again, J.P.'s role here is what

          6   exactly?  J.P. works for IMU?

          7        A.    J.P. is an -- well, now he's independent.

          8   I don't know if he was at the time.  He used to work

          9   for ISR, which is International Special Risk, which

         10   represents the IMUs, which represents the

         11   underwriters where Thomas Gregory represented the

         12   client.  So J.P. Williamson works for -- he worked

         13   for ISR, and that's who they assigned this claim to.

         14        Q.    So was J.P. Williamson always assigned to

         15   Smith Marine, you're saying for 15 years, to handle

         16   claims?

         17        A.    Yes.  We haven't had many, but in the time

         18   we have, we would request him, and he would be

         19   requested -- he had a great rapport with ISR, and

         20   they automatically would give our claims to

         21   J.P. Williamson.

         22        Q.    If you know, do you know if your insurance

         23   underwriter would change from year to year?

         24        A.    Change what from year to year?

                                                                  42





          1        Q.    In other words, did you always have the

          2   same insurance underwriter?

          3        A.    We would go out to --

          4        Q.    In other words, Smith Marine.  Did Smith

          5   Marine have the same insurance underwriter every

          6   year?

          7        A.    For 15 years I didn't have the same

          8   underwriter, no.

          9        Q.    So just to clarify --

         10              MR. BROMLEY:  Are we talking about the

         11   person or the underwriting entity?

         12              MR. FITZPATRICK:  That's what I'm trying

         13   to clarify actually is --

         14   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

         15        Q.    In other words, what I'm trying to figure

         16   out here with your help is who you understood

         17   J.P. Williamson works for, if there are different

         18   insurance companies you're using for 15 years, and

         19   it's always J.P. Williamson you're using to do

         20   certain tasks?

         21        A.    So Smith Marine is right here.  Smith

         22   Marine has Thomas Gregory Associates for -- since the

         23   day we incorporated, which was 2003.  Thomas Gregory

         24   Associates works with ISR.

                                                                  43





          1        Q.    And Thomas Gregory Associates is an

          2   insurance agency?

          3        A.    My agent, yes.  They work with

          4   International Special Risk who then goes out to bid

          5   or goes out to market to find the underwriters that

          6   work for us.

          7        Q.    So ISR coordinates obtaining an

          8   underwriter for you through TGA?

          9        A.    So I was with TGA and ISR, or I have been

         10   with TGA and ISR since 2003.

         11        Q.    And J.P. Williamson then works for ISR is

         12   your understanding?

         13        A.    Correct.  So when we were insured by Star

         14   Marine, J.P. still worked with us.  When we were

         15   insured with One Beacon, when we were insured with

         16   Atlantic Specialty, which is what we're talking about

         17   here, J.P. Williamson still represented us with the

         18   different underwriters.

         19        Q.    If you recall, when did the name of your

         20   insurance underwriter change from One Beacon to

         21   Atlantic Specialty?

         22        A.    I do not recall.  I don't think One Beacon

         23   was ever even written on a COI.

         24        Q.    But you mentioned One Beacon.  That



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  44





          1   obviously has come to your attention in some way?

          2        A.    I think -- it's very confusing because

          3   Atlantic Specialty is also -- it was an umbrella.  I

          4   only saw Atlantic Specialty on my COIs, and that's

          5   what I deal with day to day, so --

          6        Q.    Did you understand Atlantic Specialty to

          7   be one of the One Beacon family of insurers?

          8        A.    You know, I don't know.  It was all very

          9   confusing.

         10              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Let's have this marked

         11   as the next exhibit.

         17        Q.    Anything else about that Exhibit 3, a

         18   photocopied e-mail, that you would like to add or

         19   comment on?

         20        A.    No.

         21        Q.    And otherwise, the e-mail speaks for

         22   itself?

         23        A.    Yes.

         24        Q.    The next exhibit is deposition Exhibit 4.

          1   Can we agree that deposition Exhibit Number 4

          2   consists of seven photocopied pages stapled together.

          3   The first two pages in the lower left-hand corner

          4   bearing the production numbers of ASIC-1131 and 1132,

          5   and then the following pages starting with a page

          6   number in the lower left-hand corner 1166 through and

          7   including 68, and then the final two page numbers

          8   being 1142 and then 18?

          9        A.    Yes.

         10        Q.    And please review these e-mails, and then

         11   when you're done, please let me know, and I just have

         12   a few questions about them.

         13        A.    They start in the back and move up?

         14        Q.    Whatever makes more sense for you.  They

         15   start, I believe, on January 15th of 2015, and then

         16   they end --

         17        A.    I got it.

         18        Q.    -- on June of 2015.

         19        A.    Okay.

         20        Q.    So just starting with the earliest e-mail

         21   from January 15, 2015 and working forward

         22   chronologically from that.  The January e-mailing,

         23   yours to J.P. Williamson of January 15, 2015 at 1:22

         24   p.m. -- and this is your e-mailing I'm referring to

                                                                  46





          1   on the first page of deposition Exhibit 4, correct?

          2        A.    Yes.

          3        Q.    And then --

          4              MR. BROMLEY:  For the record, that was

          5   from Williamson to Robin.

          6   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

          7        Q.    Oh, I apologize.  From J.P. Williamson to

          8   you on January 15, 2015 at 1:22 p.m., and then your

          9   reply at the top of page 1 to J.P. Williamson on

         10   January 15th, 2015 at 3:33 p.m.  That appears to

         11   relate to J.P. Williamson's review or inspection of

         12   the barge SE 104 as he describes in his e-mail; is

         13   that correct?

         14        A.    Yes.

         15        Q.    Does he also say that he had a

         16   conversation with David Smith as well wherein he

         17   offered to help if he could?

         18        A.    Yes.

         19        Q.    And so was it your understanding that was

         20   referring to this claim?

         21        A.    I do not recall.  I did not write this

         22   e-mail.

         23        Q.    On the third page, and for the next three,

         24   including the third page, do you see heavily a

                                                                  47





          1   redacted e-mail communication between you and

          2   Andy Smith?

          3        A.    I do, yes.

          4        Q.    And that's dated January 26, 2015; is that

          5   right?

          6        A.    Yes.

          7        Q.    And the attachment states "Royal River

          8   Events."  Is that correct?

          9        A.    Yes.

         10        Q.    Now, the contents of the e-mail are

         11   redacted, which means your lawyer is asserting some

         12   sort of privilege.  So I'm not going to force the

         13   issue in this setting and ask you about what's in the

         14   blacked-out section.  So please avoid telling me the

         15   particulars that have been redacted.

         16       In general, is what you were discussing with Andy

         17   in this e-mail that you sent to him on

         18   January 26, 2015 that looks lengthy -- it looks like

         19   it's about two and a half pages -- does it concern

         20   the Royal River events involving the grounding of the

         21   Burnham barge 104 in January of 2015?

         22        A.    I can't answer that.  I don't recall.  I

         23   would assume so because it's pretty particular with

         24   the subject of my e-mail matching the content, but I

                                                                  48





          1   read a lot of e-mails in a day, so I have no

          2   recollection of what's written on here.

          3        Q.    And the attachment, Royal River Event, do

          4   you know what that attachment was?

          5        A.    I do not recall.

          6              MR. BROMLEY:  Can we go off the record

          7   just for a moment?

          8              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Sure.

          9              (Discussion off the record)

         10              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Back on the record.

         11   BY MR. FITZGERALD:

         12        Q.    So directing your attention now to ASIC

         13   page number 1114 in this deposition Exhibit Number 4,

         14   do you see this e-mail exchange on February 5, 2015

         15   between you and J.P. Williamson?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    And the e-mail exchange speaks for itself?

         18        A.    Yes.

         19        Q.    And the e-mail that you refer to -- you

         20   start your e-mail to J.P. Williamson with Andrew and

         21   J.P.  Is Andrew, Andrew Smith?

         22        A.    No.  That's Andrew Gregory of Thomas

         23   Gregory Associates.  The original Andrew I referred

         24   to.

          1        Q.    In your e-mail -- your originating e-mail

          2   of February 5, 2015 to which J.P. Williamson is

          3   responding on that same date, you begin your e-mail

          4   to J.P. Williamson that day with "Andrew and J.P.,

          5   just received this e-mail from our client Burnham.

          6   Interesting."  And then you go on to say more

          7   particulars about it.  Do you recall what that e-mail

          8   that you refer to was on February 5, 2015?

          9        A.    To the best of my knowledge, I recall an

         10   e-mail from Craig regarding three days in particular

         11   that he had in question that we had invoiced for.

         12   One was a day in December, and two were days in

         13   January.  I believe it would be the 10th and 11th, or

         14   the 11th and 12th of January 2015.

         15        Q.    Do you recall anything further at this

         16   time?

         17        A.    I don't recall the details of the e-mail

         18   which would have sparked this response, but it was

         19   some kind of notification from Craig that -- I don't

         20   think we had been served papers at this point.  I

         21   don't recall.  There were a few e-mails that went

         22   back and forth, so I don't recall the timeline of

         23   this.

         24        Q.    And directing your attention to the last

                                                                  50





          1   page of this deposition Exhibit Number 4, what is

          2   this e-mail here?

          3        A.    Just give me one minute.  To the best of

          4   my knowledge, I believe this was the e-mail from --

          5   the letter that came in the mail from Craig

          6   indicating that he was holding us responsible for the

          7   damages to his barges.

          8        Q.    Okay.  Did your e-mail in February 5 --

          9        A.    Wait.  This is June.  Sorry.  Go ahead.

         10        Q.    Did your e-mail of February 5, 2015 also

         11   refer to such a claim by Burnham Associates?

         12        A.    On what page?

         13        Q.    This is the second to last page.  We were

         14   just discussing this e-mail from you to Andrew and

         15   J.P. on February 5, 2015.

         16        A.    I don't believe so because one refers to

         17   e-mail and one refers to mail in bold.  So I would

         18   believe that was two different notifications to Smith

         19   Marine from Burnham, to the best of my knowledge.

         20   Without the documents in front of me, I can't say

         21   exactly what they were.

         22              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Let's have this marked

         23   as the next exhibit.

          5        Q.    I've put in front of you what's been

          6   marked as deposition Exhibit 5 for this deposition.

          7   Can we agree that this is a three-page exhibit that

          8   bears the page numbers in the lower left-hand corner

          9   ASIC-1003 on the first page, 414 on the second page,

         10   and 415 on the third and last page?

         11        A.    Yes.

         12        Q.    And these three photocopied pages are

         13   photocopied pages of e-mails; is that correct?

         14        A.    Yes.

         15        Q.    When you've had a moment to review the

         16   exhibit, please let me know, and I have a few

         17   questions about it.

         18        A.    Do you have readers that I can borrow?

         19        Q.    That's how -- I notice that you're kind of

         20   squinting at the very top of the first page where the

         21   print is teeny tiny, and that's how it was produced.

         22   Fortunately, I do have bifocals which I'm using, and

         23   you're welcome to borrow them.

         24        A.    That's okay.  I can make it out.  Okay.

                                                                  52





          1        Q.    So on the first page there, I'll read the

          2   very beginning.  First of all, what is that e-mail on

          3   the first page of this deposition Exhibit Number 5?

          4        A.    This is something that my insurance

          5   company received.  It was a letter from Craig that my

          6   insurance company received indicating that there was

          7   damage to their vessel and that they were hauled out

          8   of Fitzgerald shipyard, and they were seeking what

          9   the next steps were going to be with insurance.  One

         10   of our insurance surveyors were going to come look at

         11   it while it was up on dry dock.

         12        Q.    You sent this e-mail?

         13        A.    I don't know.  It looks like -- I wouldn't

         14   have cut and pasted something like this with a

         15   signature in it.

         16        Q.    Do you see who the e-mail is from there at

         17   the very top?

         18        A.    It's from me.  It's definitely from me.  I

         19   just don't know if this was an e-mail or if this was

         20   a letter in the mail.  My understanding -- I don't

         21   know why it would have been addressed to TGA and

         22   gotten in my hands, though.

         23        Q.    Is what you're describing --

         24        A.    This looks like an e-mail from Burnham



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  53





          1   that he maybe copied me on.  "Attached is an e-mail I

          2   just received from Burnham regarding the damage and

          3   letter to our insurance company."  So he probably

          4   copied me on an e-mail that was sent to TGA, I would

          5   imagine.

          6        Q.    When you say "Burnham," you're talking

          7   about Craig Burnham from Burnham Associates?

          8        A.    Yes.  That Craig Burnham would have copied

          9   me on something he also sent to TGA.

         10        Q.    Could you -- if you can, could you read

         11   the tiny print that precedes what appears to be a

         12   cut-and-paste copy of a letter signed by Craig

         13   Burnham?

         14        A.    "Attached is an e-mail I just received

         15   from Burnham regarding the damage and letter to our

         16   insurance company.  Apparently the damage is more

         17   significant on one than the other, but Craig is

         18   claiming that all damage which will require

         19   significant permanent repair to be paid for by our

         20   insurance completely.  Please read the attached, and

         21   I will follow up with TGA this afternoon as the claim

         22   is already open with J.P.  I am sure Craig was

         23   writing this letter at the same time he was notified

         24   that Glenn was operating.  Hence the frustration and

                                                                  54





          1   anger he had at you, Andy."

          2        Q.    Now, who wrote those words that you just

          3   read?  Craig Burnham or you?

          4        A.    I wrote those.

          5        Q.    Okay.  And why did you refer in this

          6   e-mail that you just read the beginning of, why did

          7   you refer to your being sure Craig was writing the

          8   letter that you cut and pasted and included in the

          9   e-mail at the same time he was notified Glenn was

         10   operating, and that's the reason for Craig's anger

         11   and frustration at Andy?

         12        A.    I do not recall.

         13        Q.    In other words, do you recall having any

         14   idea why when Craig Burnham was told that

         15   Glenn Walker was operating the Meridian and

         16   controlling the Burnham barge 104 in that way when

         17   the grounding occurred on January 11th that he was

         18   frustrated and angry at Andy?

         19        A.    What is the question preceding that?

         20        Q.    In other words, why would Craig Burnham be

         21   frustrated and angry at Andy upon learning of

         22   Glenn Walker's involvement in the grounding?

         23        A.    I don't recall.  I don't know what their

         24   relationship is.

          1        Q.    And is this a letter you received -- this

          2   is a letter to TGA Cross Insurance, Inc. in

          3   Wakefield, Massachusetts, correct?

          4        A.    Correct.

          5        Q.    And it is a notice of claim for damages to

          6   the Burnham barges 103 and 104?

          7        A.    Correct.

          8        Q.    And by the way, if I refer to the Burnham

          9   barges as scows interchangeably, is that okay?

         10        A.    Yes.

         11        Q.    So as of February 5, 2015, were you aware

         12   that Burnham Associates was claiming Smith Marine was

         13   responsible for damages to the Burnham barges or

         14   scows 103 and 104?

         15        A.    Yes.

         16        Q.    And this is as of February 5, 2015, the

         17   date of this e-mail?

         18        A.    Yes.

         19        Q.    Do you see the next two pages of this

         20   exhibit consist of e-mailing on -- photocopies of

         21   e-mailing on February 27, 2015?

         22        A.    Yes.

         23        Q.    And what, in general, is that e-mail

         24   concerned with?

                                                                  56





          1        A.    This is concerning a large invoice that I

          2   believe we had seen at this point that was forwarded

          3   to us by Burnham Associates.  I'm not sure if Craig

          4   sent it directly or if one of his employees sent it.

          5   But we received a very substantial invoice for a

          6   whole lot of repairs that we had nothing to do with

          7   that he was looking to recover from our insurance

          8   company.

          9        Q.    And who did he send that letter to, or

         10   invoice to, I should say?

         11        A.    I do not recall if it was sent directly to

         12   me or if my insurance company forwarded it to me.  I

         13   think it came directly to me.

         14        Q.    And the e-mail at the top of this page

         15   marked in the lower left-hand corner 414, this e-mail

         16   of February 27, 2015 at 3:33 p.m. is your e-mail?

         17              MR. BROMLEY:  Which one are you looking

         18   at?

         19              MR. FITZPATRICK:  On the second page.

         20              MR. BROMLEY:  Of Exhibit 4?

         22   be on the second page.  It's not there?

         23              MR. BROMLEY:  I've got 1132.

          3   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

          4        Q.    In this February 27, 2015 e-mail that you

          5   sent to Matt Plauche of Smith Marine, copying

          6   Andy Smith and J.P. Williamson, do you state that

          7   Craig Burnham of Burnham Associates had indicated to

          8   Smith Marine that the barges -- the Burnham barges or

          9   scows 103 and 104 would be hauled out for quick fixes

         10   for temporary work and that a later "real" -- in

         11   quotes that you put -- "fix" would happen after New

         12   Bedford?

         13        A.    Correct.  Yes.

         14        Q.    And New Bedford referred to a New Bedford

         15   dredging project Burnham was involved in?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    And was Smith Marine working for Burnham

         18   on the New Bedford project?

         19        A.    Yes.

         20        Q.    And this was in 2015 as well, correct?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    So as of February 27, 2015, you were aware

         23   -- Smith Marine was aware that Burnham Associates's

         24   plan was to do temporary fixes for both the Burnham

          1   barges or scows 103 and 104, and after the New

          2   Bedford project to have them hauled out again for a

          3   "real," quote, unquote, "fix," as you say here in the

          4   e-mail?

          5        A.    Yes.

          6              MR. FITZPATRICK:  We'll have this marked

         13        Q.    I've put in front of you what's been

         14   marked as deposition Exhibit Number 6 for this

         15   deposition.  Can we agree deposition Exhibit Number 6

         16   consists of two photocopied pages.  The first page

         17   being a photocopy of a draft invoice on Smith Marine

         18   letterhead bearing in the lower left-hand corner file

         19   number 872, and then on the second and last page a

         20   photocopied e-mail with a cut-and-pasted image in the

         21   middle of the e-mail, and in the lower left-hand

         22   corner bearing page number 876?

          1   time to look at deposition Exhibit Number 6.

          2        A.    I'm all set.

          3        Q.    What is deposition Exhibit Number 6?

          4        A.    Deposition Exhibit Number 6 is a very,

          5   very draft copy of a working invoice.

          6        Q.    And whose handwriting is on the first page

          7   of deposition Exhibit Number 6, this draft Smith

          8   Marine invoice?

          9        A.    That's my handwriting.

         10        Q.    And you make a note here to Andy; is that

         11   correct?

         12        A.    Yes.

         13        Q.    And what is your request to Andy?

         14        A.    "Please summarize your logs for billable

         15   time."

         16        Q.    And do you make a notation of names in the

         17   left-hand margin next to dates in the lower part of

         18   this invoice -- draft invoice for dates 12/15 and

         19   12/16?  December 15 and 16.

         20        A.    Yes, I do.

         21        Q.    What are those three names you've written

         22   next to 12/15 and 12/16 or December 15 and 16?

         23        A.    Taccetta, Mank, and Walker.

         24        Q.    And what would that refer to?



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  60





          1        A.    Those were the three crew members on board

          2   at the time on those working days.

          3        Q.    And is there any indication of who the

          4   captain was on those two days?

          5        A.    No.

          6        Q.    Do you know who the captain was?

          7        A.    To my recollection, it was Chip Taccetta.

          8        Q.    For both December 15 and for December 16?

          9        A.    Yes.

         10        Q.    Is there anywhere that that is indicated,

         11   at least on this draft invoice?

         12        A.    Could you repeat -- is what indicated on

         13   this draft invoice?

         14        Q.    That Chip Taccetta was the captain on

         15   December 15 and December 16 as shown on this Smith

         16   Marine --

         17        A.    On this invoice, no.

         18        Q.    However, further up the invoice, again, in

         19   the left-hand margin, did you write down the names of

         20   crew members designating one of them as a captain?

         21        A.    Yes.

         22        Q.    And where is that?

         23        A.    Andy.  Captain Andy.

         24        Q.    And that would be your husband,

          1   Andy Smith, correct?

          2        A.    Yes.

          3        Q.    And who are the other two individuals

          4   identified there?

          5        A.    Mark Gothier, I think was his last name,

          6   and Jeff Mank.

          7        Q.    Why did you designate Andy as the captain

          8   further up the left margin of this draft invoice but

          9   not when identifying the crew for December 15 and 16

         10   further down the left margin?

         11        A.    Because these are my chicken scratch

         12   diaries that I jot down a lot of things that

         13   sometimes go to final draft and sometimes are my

         14   internal way of -- there's no rhyme or reason to why

         15   I would write "captain" on one and not on another.

         16        Q.    Going to the next page of this deposition

         17   exhibit, is that your e-mail to Robin Smith, Smith

         18   Marine on December 18, 2015?

         19        A.    Yes, but it looks like I was e-mailing

         20   myself a copy of a log sheet probably to print at

         21   some other location.

         22        Q.    And is what you did there with this e-mail

         23   insert a scanned image of a photocopied log page from

         24   the Smith tug Meridian?

          2        Q.    Into the e-mail itself?

          3        A.    Yes.

          4        Q.    And is that similar to what we see done

          5   with the first page photocopied e-mail in deposition

          6   Exhibit Number 5 where a letter from Craig Burnham

          7   with his signature is inserted into the body of an

          8   e-mail from you?

          9        A.    Oh, yes.  I assume so.  It's a cut and

         10   paste feature, I believe.

         11        Q.    So with reference now back to deposition

         12   Exhibit Number 5, could that have been how you

         13   composed this e-mail?  In other words, by cutting and

         14   pasting as you did in deposition Exhibit Number 6 on

         15   the second page, by cutting and pasting a scanned

         16   image of Craig Burnham's letter to TGA Cross

         17   Insurance and inserting that in your e-mail on

         18   February 5, 2015?

         19        A.    It could have been.

         20        Q.    And directing your attention to the

         21   scanned image -- copied image of the Meridian log

         22   page that's included in deposition -- the second page

         23   of deposition Exhibit Number 2 in your e-mail of

         24   December 18, 2014, who is shown as working as the

          1   crew on the Meridian during the Royal River Project

          2   on December 15 and 16, 2014?

          3        A.    Taccetta, Mank, and Walker are on December

          4   15, and Taccetta, Mank, and Walker on December 16.

          5        Q.    And are either -- are any of those

          6   designated as the captain for either of those days?

          7        A.    I would assume Taccetta is because he's

          8   listed first.

          9        Q.    But is that designated -- but he's

         10   designated as captain even though he's listed as

         11   first?

         12        A.    I do not recall.  I do not know.  I did

         13   not write this, and I do not do the logbooks.

         14        Q.    But do we see a designation of captain on

         15   this log page?

         16        A.    No.  I don't see the word "captain."

         17              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Let's have this marked

          2   deposition Exhibit Number 7 consists of six

          3   photocopied pages of e-mails?  The first three pages

          4   consisting of page numbers in the lower left-hand

          5   corner 92 through and including 94, and then the next

          6   page being in the lower left-hand corner designated

         16   we just take a quick break?

         20        Q.    Have you had enough time to review

         21   deposition Exhibit Number 7?

         22        A.    I just need one more minute because I

         23   didn't really do it before.

         24        Q.    Sure.

          1        A.    Okay.

          2        Q.    The first three pages, page 92 through 94

          3   of deposition Exhibit Number 7, what do those first

          4   three pages consist of?

          5        A.    They're -- as the subject states, it's a

          6   claim letter to Smith Marine from the oyster farm

          7   that operates in the vicinity of the dredging

          8   operation in Yarmouth.

          9        Q.    And so was this a claim by an oyster farm

         10   in a letter to Smith Marine dated January 7, 2016 for

         11   damage they were alleging to their oyster beds on or

         12   about January 10th, 2015?

         13        A.    Yes.  This is alleged damage, yes.

         14        Q.    And is what they're alleging true?

         15        A.    I do not know.

         16        Q.    And did Smith Marine end up paying their

         17   claim?

         18        A.    Yes.

         19        Q.    The final pages of this deposition exhibit

         20   consist of redacted e-mails to and from David Smith;

         21   is that correct?

         22        A.    Yes.

         23        Q.    And David Smith, again, is Smith Marine's

         24   lawyer?

          1        A.    Yes.  He's our corporate attorney.

          2        Q.    Just to clarify, is David Smith a relation

          3   to you and Andy Smith?

          4        A.    No, he's not.

          5        Q.    And was -- without getting into the

          6   particulars of the contents of these e-mails to and

          7   from Attorney Smith that have been redacted, this

          8   appears to be e-mailing to and from the oyster

          9   claimants regarding their oyster claim, correct?

         10        A.    Yes.

         11        Q.    And did Attorney Smith take the lead in

         12   negotiating with the oyster claimants in settling

         13   that claim?

         14        A.    Yes, he did.

         15        Q.    On behalf of Smith Marine?

         16        A.    Yes, he did.

          1   as deposition Exhibit Number 8.  Can we agree it's a

          3   lower left-hand corner the document production page

          4   number of 1127?

          5        A.    Yes.

          7   enough time to review that exhibit, and I'll ask you

          8   a few questions about it.

          9        A.    Yes, I have reviewed it.

         10        Q.    In this exhibit, this concerns -- the

         11   subject of this -- first of all, who is this e-mail

         12   from and to?

         13        A.    So it starts with an e-mail from

         14   J.P. Williamson, the claims manager, to me, and let

         15   me look at the times here.  At 3:50 on October 16.

         16        Q.    October 16th of what year?

         17        A.    2015.  And I have no recollection of what

         18   he e-mailed me without seeing this.

         19        Q.    What is the subject of his e-mail?  The

         20   subject line.  Not the redacted portion, but just the

         21   subject line that's not redacted?

         22        A.    Smith Marine SE 104 and SE 103.

         23        Q.    What did you understand that to refer to?

         24        A.    The two scows in which Burnham brought the

          1   claim to Smith Marine.

          2        Q.    In other words, this lawsuit?

          3        A.    Yes.

          4        Q.    At the top of this e-mail thread is your

          5   reply to J.P. Williamson later on October 16th; is

          6   that correct?

          7        A.    Yes.

          8        Q.    All right.  Do you know why David Smith --

          9   Attorney David Smith was being copied on this

         10   communication about this lawsuit?

         11        A.    I don't recall.  I do not recall.

          2   being page in the lower left-hand corner of 341?

          3        A.    Yes.

          4        Q.    Please take a look at those e-mails, and I

          5   just have a few questions about them when you've had

          6   enough time to review them.

          7              MR. BROMLEY:  I've got to object insofar

          8   as does this exhibit have anything to do with the

          9   claim that's being stayed?  Because these are all

         10   communications between the TPA and Bernice Ford at

         11   IMU, and that's been stayed.

         12              MR. FITZPATRICK:  I understand that.  My

         13   questioning is going to be very brief.

         14              MR. BROMLEY:  But it's directed towards

         15   this claim at Smith Marine?

         16              MR. FITZPATRICK:  It is directed to her

         17   knowledge -- I mean, if you want to stay my question

         18   -- basically all I'm going to ask is as of October --

         19              MR. BROMLEY:  We can go off the record.

         20              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Sure.

         21              (Discussion off the record)

         22              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Back on the record.  The

         23   defendant, Smith Marine, has interposed an objection

         24   to my questioning about this exhibit on the basis



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC

          1   that it concerns the stayed issues having to do with

          2   insurance that are part of this lawsuit.  I recognize

          3   the basis for the objection, and without waiving our

          4   rights, I am willing to defer this questioning of

          5   this witness on this point until we reach the --

          6   until the court indicates that we are permitted to

          7   pursue our currently stayed claim against the

          8   insurance defendant or defendants.  Is that correct?

          9              MR. BROMLEY:  Yes.  Thank you.

         20   photocopied pages of e-mails.  The lower left-hand

         21   corner bearing the page number of 321, and then the

          1        Q.    And when you've had enough time to review

          3   you, please let me know, and I'll ask you a few

          4   questions about it.

          5              MR. BROMLEY:  We've got the same objection

          6   on page 2 of this exhibit as the last objection.  We

          7   acknowledge that Miss Smith was involved in the

          8   e-mails on page 1, of course.

          9              MR. FITZPATRICK:  All right.  Well, let me

         10   -- I understand your objection on that, but she is

         11   included in this e-mailing here, and the only

         12   question that I have actually relates to Smith

         13   Marine.  So I'll phrase the question that way, and

         14   then if you still object, please let me know, and

         15   then what I can do is we can then sidebar about it.

         14        Q.    I put in front of you what's been marked

         15   as deposition Exhibit Number 11, and this is a

         16   two-page exhibit of photocopied e-mails.  Can we

         17   agree that it consists of the two pages of

         18   photocopied e-mails, and in the lower left-hand

         19   corner beginning on the first page with page number

         20   1037, and then on the second and last page in the

         21   lower left-hand corner ending in page number 1038?

         22   Can we agree that's what this deposition Exhibit

         23   Number 11 consists of?

         24        A.    Yes.

          1        Q.    And when you've had enough time to review

          2   this deposition exhibit, please let me know, and I

          3   have a few questions to you about it.

          4        A.    Okay.

          5        Q.    What does this e-mail consist of, or what

          6   does it concern?

          7        A.    This is an invoice we received from a

          8   vendor, and I cannot tell you exactly what the vendor

          9   was for without a description on the invoice.

         10        Q.    So this is an e-mailing between you -- in

         11   February of 2016 between you, the vendor, and

         12   J.P. Williamson, Smith Marine's insurance

         13   representative; is that right?

         14        A.    Yes.

         15        Q.    And how does this invoice for $3,517.43

         16   relate to this case?  How does the invoice relate to

         17   the Burnham Associates's claims in this lawsuit for

         18   the Burnham scows or barges 103 and 104?

         19              MR. BROMLEY:  Objection.

         20        A.    I do not recall.

         21              MR. FITZPATRICK:  We'll mark this as the

         22   next exhibit.

          2   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

          3        Q.    I've put in front of you what's been

          4   marked as deposition Exhibit Number 12.  Can we agree

          5   it consists of one photocopied page with an image of

          6   some sort embedded in it, and otherwise consisted of

          7   -- well, consisting of photocopied e-mails with an

          8   embedded image, and as I think I stated, in the lower

          9   left-hand corner of this single-page photocopied

         10   exhibit being designated as page 108?  Can we agree

         11   that's what the exhibit consists of?

         12        A.    I do not recall.  This is a -- something

         13   sent to my phone that was then screenshotted and

         14   forwarded.  So I don't recall.

         15        Q.    Well, let me re-clarify the question.  I'm

         16   just asking the exhibit itself --

         17        A.    Oh, yes.  I'm sorry.

         18        Q.    Can we agree it's a photocopied series of

         19   e-mails --

         20        A.    Yes.

         21        Q.    -- a single page in length, and it bears

         22   the page number on the lower left-hand corner 108,

         23   and that's what deposition Exhibit Number 12 consists

         24   of?  Are you in agreement with that?

                                                                  75





          1        A.    Yes.

          2        Q.    And what is this?  I think that's what you

          3   were next describing?

          4        A.    Yes.  And I do not -- I cannot tell you

          5   what this is in detail because it was a screenshot

          6   that was sent to my phone, looking back at these

          7   addresses, which was then forwarded on to J.P. from

          8   my phone.

          9        Q.    And do you write to J.P. on

         10   January 26, 2015 -- this is in very tiny print, and I

         11   have the aid of reading glasses in reading this -- do

         12   you write to J.P. here in this e-mail that is copied

         13   and is now deposition Exhibit Number 12, "J.P., below

         14   please find actual track line diagrams taken from the

         15   navigational computer shipboard, the Meridian"?

         16        A.    Yes, I write that.

         17        Q.    Okay.  And what's the relevance of the

         18   e-mail and this embedded image in the e-mail that you

         19   refer to as the track line diagram taken from the

         20   navigational computer on board the Meridian, what is

         21   the relevance of this to the Burnham claims for the

         22   scows or barges 103 and 104?

         23        A.    I do not recall as this was an image that

         24   was sent to me on my phone and I forwarded it

                                                                  76





          1   directly to J.P.

          2        Q.    Do you recall anything else about why you

          3   were obtaining this image of what you refer to as the

          4   track lines and why you were forwarding them?

          5              MR. BROMLEY:  Objection.

          6        A.    I do not recall.

          7        Q.    Do you recall anything about the

          8   significance of what is shown here in deposition

          9   Exhibit Number 11 (sic), and specifically the diagram

         10   taken from the navigational computer on board the

         11   Meridian that you state in your e-mail shows the

         12   actual track line?

         13              MR. BROMLEY:  For the record, it's Exhibit

         14   12.  You referred to 11.

         15              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Yes.  I'm sorry.  This

         16   is Exhibit 12.  Let me restate the question.

         17   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

         18        Q.    Are you aware of any -- what the relevance

         19   is or significance, I should say -- I'll rephrase the

         20   question.

         21       Are you aware of what the significance is of this

         22   embedded image in this photocopied e-mail from

         23   January 26, 2015, that we've been discussing, the

         24   embedded image being what you refer to as the actual

                                                                  77





          1   track line diagram taken from the navigational

          2   computer on board the Meridian?  What is the

          3   significance of this?

          4        A.    The significance of this is showing the

          5   tracking which the Meridian took.

          6        Q.    But what does that tell us about this

          7   case?

          8        A.    I am not going to interpret diagrams.

          9   That's not in my job description.  That's not part of

         10   my role.  This was an image that was forwarded on to

         11   me, and I can tell by the phone number and from the

         12   line item in the bottom e-mail from my mobile phone

         13   that I then forwarded it right on to J.P., and I do

         14   not recall who sent me this image.

         15        Q.    And do you recall why you were sent the

         16   image?

         17        A.    I do not recall why I was sent the image.

         18              MR. BROMLEY:  Also, for the record, if the

         19   matter goes to trial, we object to the first e-mail

         20   at the top of the page or the first in line from the

         21   top of the page that's only between J.P. Williamson

         22   and Bernice Ford, if I'm reading it correctly, but

         23   not the remainder.

          6        Q.    I've put in front of you what's been

          7   marked as deposition Exhibit Number 13 for today's

          8   deposition.  Can we agree this deposition exhibit

          9   consists of photocopied e-mails?  The first page

         10   being designated in the lower left-hand corner as

         11   page number 1042, and then continuing on through and

         12   including the last page being designated in the lower

         13   left-hand corner at 1045?

         14        A.    Yes.

         15        Q.    And please review these e-mails and let me

         16   know when you've had enough time to do so, and I'll

         17   ask you a few questions about them.

         18        A.    Okay.

         19        Q.    Can you tell us what this e-mailing is

         20   about?

         21        A.    Sure.  I just want to make sure I'm

         22   starting with the right one.

         23        Q.    And specifying who's e-mailing who here?

         24        A.    So it looks as though I inquired with



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  79





          1   Matt Sullivan at Burnham Associates just looking for

          2   payment on outstanding invoices, and I immediately

          3   got a response back from Craig on the same day

          4   shortly thereafter just saying that we're processing

          5   payment, but he was also inquiring what the fuel

          6   levels were.  Since the fuel was on Burnham

          7   Associates, they were responsible for the fuel.  And

          8   so I just thanked him for that information.

          9       And I then got in touch with those in charge of

         10   the fuel logs, which would have been Matt -- at that

         11   point, Matt Plauche.  Let me back up a minute.  Craig

         12   also inquired what the status of the claim was, if I

         13   had heard anything about the claim.

         14       And so I sent an e-mail to three individuals, to

         15   J.P. asking what the status of the claim was so that

         16   I could get back to him, and also to Matt and Andy

         17   about the vessel fuel and what was on board.  My

         18   Matt, Matt Plauche, indicated to me or e-mailed to me

         19   that the next person on board would give me the

         20   readings so I then could relay that back to Craig and

         21   adjust the invoice as necessary either issuing a

         22   credit or charging for the fuel that he needed to.

         23       And the final response to that was we were up 900

         24   gallons.  We were up 900 gallons on Burnham, meaning

                                                                  80





          1   that when we arrived back in Boston, and we had 900

          2   gallons more than when we took the reading at the

          3   beginning of the job, and --

          4        Q.    So did that mean that Smith Marine owed

          5   Burnham a credit in this transaction?

          6        A.    Yes.  We said we would then apply that --

          7   I'll wait for the next amounts.  We have readings for

          8   him as I'm sure he'll want exact -- basically we need

          9   the day it left Chelsea and the date it arrived back

         10   from whoever was on the Meridian next.  It may be

         11   easier to determine that credit and apply to an open

         12   invoice now or do an IOU for the -- maybe tow-down, I

         13   think that's supposed to say, instead of town down.

         14   I think that's just a typo on my part.

         15        Q.    So basically the e-mail -- the upshot of

         16   the e-mail thread that we're looking at from February

         17   of 2015 is that Smith Marine owed Burnham a credit

         18   for some extra fuel; is that right?

         19        A.    Correct.

         20        Q.    And also that Craig Burnham was asking

         21   about the status of the claim?

         22        A.    Correct.

         23        Q.    And that would be the Burnham claims for

         24   the Burnham barges or scows 103 and 104 during the

          2        A.    Yes.

          4   next exhibit.

         10        Q.    I've put in front of you what's been

         11   marked as deposition Exhibit Number 14.  Can we agree

         12   deposition Exhibit Number 14 consists of four pages

         13   of stapled together photocopied e-mails?  The first

         14   page being numbered in the lower left-hand corner

         15   1123; the second page being numbered in the lower

         16   left-hand corner 109; the third page being numbered

         17   in the lower left-hand corner of 110; and the fourth

         18   and final page being numbered in the lower left-hand

         19   corner 111?

         20        A.    Yes.

         21        Q.    And when you've had enough time to review

         22   these photocopied e-mails in deposition Exhibit

         23   Number 14, please let me know, and I just have a few

         24   questions about the e-mails.

          1        A.    Okay.

          2        Q.    And what are these e-mails about?

          3        A.    These are e-mails from our adjuster asking

          4   for personal statements, and this request went to

          5   Andy from J.P.  Andy does not do office work for the

          6   most part, and so he, I'm sure, at dinner asked me to

          7   reach out to individuals in which they were looking

          8   for statements, and I sent separate e-mails to both

          9   Glenn Walker and to Paul Poirier requesting them to

         10   recall every and any possible thing they could and

         11   put it on paper so that we had their own statements

         12   while things were fresh in their mind for anything

         13   that occurred that day with their involvement and

         14   others involved as well.

         15        Q.    And when did this e-mailing occur?

         16              MR. BROMLEY:  Objection.  You're saying

         17   other than the dates on the document?

         18              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Yeah.

         19   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

         20        Q.    In other words, this e-mailing occurred --

         21   did this e-mailing occur in January of 2015?

         22        A.    Yes.

         23        Q.    As otherwise shown in the dates of the

         24   specific e-mails that are included in this deposition

                                                                  83





          1   exhibit?

          2        A.    Yes.

          3        Q.    And the e-mailing is from and to you as

          4   well as Andy Smith, Glenn Walker -- and Glenn Walker,

          5   correct?

          6        A.    Correct.

          7        Q.    I don't see an e-mail to or from

          8   Paul Poirier.  Is there a reason for that?

          9        A.    I do not recall.

         10        Q.    Do you recall e-mailing with Paul Poirier?

         11        A.    I believe I did, but I'd have to go back

         12   and look.  I do not recall.

         13        Q.    And did you obtain a statement from

         14   Paul Poirier concerning the grounding on

         15   January 11, 2015 of the Burnham scow barge 104?

         16        A.    Yes.

         17        Q.    And how did you obtain that statement, if

         18   you recall?

         19        A.    I believe it was e-mail.  I'd have to go

         20   back and look.  To the best of my knowledge, it was

         21   e-mail.

         22        Q.    And these e-mails in deposition Exhibit

         23   Number 14 show you obtaining in January 2015 a

         24   written statement from Glenn Walker about the

          1   grounding on January 11, 2015 of Burnham Associates's

          2   104?

          3        A.    Yes.

          4        Q.    Did you obtain any other statements about

          5   the January 11, 2015 of the Burnham Associates's

          6   barge or scow 104 from anyone else other than

          7   Glenn Walker and Paul Poirier?

          8        A.    I do not think I did.  You asked me that

          9   earlier about Mank, and I don't think I have one from

         10   Mank.  I don't think I requested one from Jeff Mank.

         11              MR. FITZPATRICK:  We'll mark this as the

         12   next exhibit.

         18        Q.    I put in front of you what's been marked

         19   as deposition Exhibit Number 15, and can we agree

         20   this deposition exhibit consists of three pages of

         21   photocopied e-mails?  The first page consisting or

         22   being designated in the lower left-hand corner as

         23   page 100, and then the final and third page being

         24   designated in the lower left-hand corner as page 102?

          1        A.    Yes.

          2              MR. BROMLEY:  And just for the record, we

          3   object to the top portion of page 1, specifically the

          4   e-mail between J.P. Williamson, Mary Wan, and

          5   Jeanne Conneely.

          6   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

          7        Q.    I'm going to be directing your attention

          8   and asking you about the, not the e-mailing that your

          9   counsel just referred to between the insurance

         10   representatives internally, but towards the bottom of

         11   the first page of these photocopied e-mails, do you

         12   see e-mailing that originated from you?

         13        A.    Yes.

         14        Q.    And then if we go on to the second and

         15   third page of this photocopied e-mail thread, there's

         16   other e-mailing to and from you?

         17        A.    Yes.

         18        Q.    I'll be asking you about that.

         19        A.    Okay.

         20        Q.    In this e-mail -- what's the general

         21   subject -- without describing the particulars of

         22   what's been redacted from one of the e-mails from

         23   you, what is the subject -- the general subject that

         24   is being raised and discussed in this e-mailing

                                                                  86





          1   between you and J.P. Williamson?

          2        A.    The retainage that was discussed between

          3   me and Craig, which then was carried over between

          4   myself and Matt Sullivan, I believe.  Yes.

          5        Q.    And this is retainage from what project?

          6        A.    The Royal River Yarmouth project.

          7        Q.    And this was involved in the Burnham --

          8   was this involved in the Burnham claims for the

          9   damages to the Burnham scows or barges 103 and 104

         10   from the Royal River Project?

         11        A.    Yes.

         12        Q.    And how so?

         13        A.    I received an e-mail from Craig sometime

         14   in January -- I believe it was January.  It could

         15   have been later -- February, March -- regarding

         16   charges that he did not feel that Burnham Associates

         17   should pay for.  One was a date in December.  I

         18   believe it was around the 21st.  It could have been a

         19   little later.  The end of December.  A day in which

         20   there was no work being done because the barges were

         21   being -- or the barge was being dewatered, and he

         22   didn't want to pay a full eight-hour minimum day rate

         23   for the barge that day.  There were also then the two

         24   days in question, the 10th and 11th, that were also



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  87





          1   charged eight hours $3,000 a day for days in which

          2   the incident occurred.

          3       At that time, we didn't know what the incident

          4   was so we had all just been discussing it as an

          5   incident.  I immediately responded back to Craig and

          6   suggested that in interest of time and getting the

          7   balance paid off that we just hold those three days,

          8   and I used the word "retainage," until the claim was

          9   settled.  And Matthew -- I think Matthew responded

         10   back to me.  I didn't get a response back from Craig.

         11   I got a response back from Matt, who, I assume, was

         12   discussing it with Craig that even though they didn't

         13   agree with it, they were going to go ahead and pay

         14   the per diem on that day, but they would agree to

         15   hold on to the $3,000 a day, which was a total of

         16   $9,000 until the insurance claim was settled or until

         17   this was taken care of by insurance.  We didn't know

         18   where this was going at that point.  We hadn't been

         19   served papers.

         20        Q.    Why were you copying Attorney David Smith

         21   on this e-mail?

         22              MR. BROMLEY:  Don't say the reasons if

         23   they're between you and Dave and anything he told you

         24   to do.  Does that make sense?  They're

                                                                  88





          1   attorney-client privilege.  Again, you can ask when

          2   did you talk, how long did you talk.  You can't say

          3   what you talked about.  The reason that he's named on

          4   there, if it's a reason having to do with his advice

          5   that you took or received, then I'm going to advise

          6   you not to violate the client privilege that you have

          7   -- attorney-client with him.

          8        A.    Can you just ask me the question one more

          9   time?

         10        Q.    Sure.  Why did you copy Attorney Smith on

         11   this e-mail?

         12        A.    I do not recall.

         13              MR. FITZPATRICK:  This will be our last

         14   exhibit.

         20        Q.    I put in front of you what's been marked

         21   as deposition Exhibit Number 16.  Can we agree

          1              MR. BROMLEY:  Did you want to make 24 page

          2   1?

          3              MR. FITZPATRICK:  No.  If you look at the

          4   third page -- I'm going to take the exhibit away from

          5   you, and I'm going to rearrange the pages.

          6              MR. BROMLEY:  This is going to be off the

          7   record.

         11        Q.    I've now put in front of you what's been

         12   marked as deposition Exhibit Number 16, and can we

         13   agree that deposition Exhibit Number 16 consists of a

         14   series of heavily redacted e-mails that are five

         15   pages -- five photocopied pages in length?  The first

         16   three pages consisting of page number starting in the

         17   lower left-hand corner marked as 1024 through and

         18   including 1026 on the third page, and then the final

         19   two pages of this deposition Exhibit Number 16

          1   photocopied e-mails that have been marked as

          2   deposition Exhibit Number 16, and when you've had

          3   enough time to do so, please let me know.

          4        A.    Okay.

          5        Q.    So these -- what are these e-mails in

          6   general, and I would reference the caution that your

          7   counsel gave you before that counsel has redacted

          8   extensive portions of these e-mail I'm inferring,

          9   based on the attorney-client privilege.  So do take

         10   care to be mindful of that assertion of the

         11   attorney-client privilege.

         12              MR. BROMLEY:  That's correct.

         13        A.    Looking at the dates of these, which seem

         14   to be around the time that we were starting to share

         15   more information with the insurance company and J.P.

         16   was asking more questions about acquiring statements

         17   and whatnot, I, obviously, kept my corporate attorney

         18   in the loop of what was going on, noticing that

         19   things weren't looking all perfect moving right on to

         20   the next job.  Looking ahead, there may be -- I

         21   didn't necessarily think litigation, but I was

         22   thinking there may be follow-up or maybe something

         23   that we needed -- were going to be looked at

         24   contractually, and since Dave was the originator of



                              EPPLEY COURT REPORTING, LLC


                                                                  91





          1   the time charter party and it's his document or my

          2   document, but we've worked on it together over the

          3   years, that I -- he's our only corporate attorney.

          4   So he's the one who was copied on any concern that I

          5   had at that time.  Assuming this is a concern.  I do

          6   not recall what I wrote in here without reference.

          7   So I would imagine it's me looking at the subject

          8   being contracts.  It was me just responding to a

          9   former e-mail from probably October-ish, November

         10   when we were working on contracts to keep him in the

         11   loop.

         12        Q.    And it was produced as part of this

         13   lawsuit because it relates to the Burnham

         14   Associates's claims for the groundings of the Burnham

         15   scows or barges 103 and 104 on the Royal River

         16   Project in the way you've described?

         17        A.    Yes.  But when I submitted this e-mail to

         18   him, this was more of a general counsel contracting

         19   question, I would assume.  I'd have to go back and

         20   look at the e-mails because I really don't know what

         21   was in them, but just based on the contracts, the

         22   subject matter, I would identify this as me inquiring

         23   like any business person would with their counsel

         24   about contractual language and where this might go

          1   from here.

          2        Q.    Vis-a-vis Burnham Associates and Smith

          3   Marine?

          4        A.    Correct.

          5              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Give me just a second,

          6   please.

          7              MR. BROMLEY:  Sure.

          9   exhibit.  We can just go off the record briefly.

         19   believe will be the last of my exhibits in this

         20   deposition.  Can we agree it consists of several

         21   pages of photocopied documents that are written --

         22   typewritten statements, and there are various page

         23   numbers starting on the first page with MSC-203 and

          3   corner as page 210.  The fourth page in the lower

          8        A.    Yes.

          9        Q.    And basically these are photocopied

         10   photographs.  This deposition Exhibit Number 17

         11   consists of photocopied and stapled-together

         12   photographs, written statements, and in one case a

         13   page of a photocopied written diagram; is that

         14   correct?

         15        A.    Yes.

         16              MR. BROMLEY:  You stopped at 207.  Did you

         17   want this one, too, or no?

         18              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Yes.  It should be 209.

         19   Let me tally up the total pages to this exhibit.

         20   BY MR. FITZPATRICK:

         21        Q.    Can we agree the exhibit is seven pages in

         22   length, and that, as your counsel just pointed out --

         23   with thanks to your counsel -- the seventh and last

         24   page in the lower right-hand corner marked as page

          1   number 209?

          2        A.    Yes.

          3        Q.    And do you recognize what this exhibit

          4   consists of?

          5        A.    Yes.

          6        Q.    What is this exhibit?

          7        A.    They are two personal accounts that I

          8   requested -- and this answers one of my previous

          9   questions with a "I don't recall" -- of written

         10   statements that I do have a written statement from

         11   Poirier and Glenn Walker.  This is Glenn Walker's

         12   written statement that I e-mailed him asking to put

         13   every possible thing he could remember in writing and

         14   send it to me to send to my insurance company because

         15   they requested it from Andy.  And then the second

         16   portion of the exhibit is the same, but from

         17   Paul Poirier, who also included a few photographs or

         18   -- yeah.

         19        Q.    So to recap, is deposition Exhibit Number

         20   17 photocopies of the written statements obtained by

         21   you from Paul Poirier and Glenn Walker with

         22   photographs, or in one case a diagram they included,

         23   that accompanied their written statements concerning

         24   the grounding of the Burnham scow or barge -- Burnham

          1   Associates scow or barge 104 on January 11, 2015

          2   during the Royal River Project?

          3        A.    Yes.

          4              MR. FITZPATRICK:  That's all I have.

          5              MR. BROMLEY:  So that concludes the

          6   deposition of Robin Smith as director, etc.  Does it

          7   also conclude the 30(b)(6) deposition of Smith

          8   Marine?

          9              MR. FITZPATRICK:  Yes, it does.  I do not

         10   intend to call any more representatives from Smith

         11   Marine at this point.  I do not anticipate calling

         12   anyone else from Smith Marine.

         13              MR. BROMLEY:  Thank you very much.  We're

         14   concluded.

         15              MR. FITZGERALD:  In other words, to be

         16   clear, I do not anticipate calling anyone else from

         17   Smith Marine under the auspices of the previously

         18   served Rule 30(b)(6) notice or in their capacity as

         19   an officer, director, or corporate representative of

         20   Smith Marine.

         21              MR. BROMLEY:  Okay.  Thank you.

         23              4:58 p.m.)

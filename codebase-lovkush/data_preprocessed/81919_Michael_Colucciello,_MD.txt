            6    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            7          Q.       Good evening, Doctor.  We met

            8    just before this deposition began; is that

            9    right?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       And you and I have never meet

           12    before or spoken before?

           13          A.       Never met or spoken before.

           14          Q.       You understand that I'm here to

           15    take your deposition because you've been

           16    identified as an expert witness in the case of

           17    Cook versus Wang?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       And because I know you take that

           20    oath very seriously, I just want to have a

           21    couple of agreements with you.  If I ask a

           22    question that you don't understand or that you

           23    don't hear or that is confusing, will you let

           24    me know that?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               8



            1          Q.       I will be happy to repeat the

            2    question or rephrase the question, but I'm

            3    going to need for you to let me know that you

            4    don't understand it.  All right?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       And if you answer my question,

            7    can I assume that you understood it?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Also, as we go through the

           10    deposition, it is important that we not talk at

           11    the same time.  The court reporter needs to

           12    take down a good record.  So please let me

           13    finish my question before you start your

           14    answer, and I will be careful not to begin my

           15    next question until you've finished; is that

           16    okay?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       If per chance I think that

           19    you're finished and you're not, just say, hey,

           20    I wasn't finish, and I will be happy to let you

           21    say whatever you need to truthfully answer the

           22    previous question.  All right?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       Also, it's not an endurance

           25    contest.  If you need to take a break, you can

                                                               9



            1    take a break.  I will try to move along and

            2    explore your opinions as quickly as I can, but

            3    I do have some questions to ask you.  You also

            4    understand that I'm going to hold you to the

            5    answers that you say today when you appear at

            6    trial or when the remaining portion of your

            7    testimony is played for the jury.  I'm going to

            8    expect you to tell the truth consistently

            9    throughout this case.  All right?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       Have you ever given a deposition

           12    before?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14          Q.       How many occasions?

           15          A.       I'm not going to be able to

           16    answer that accurately.  If I may give you an

           17    approximation.

           18          Q.       Sure.

           19          A.       It would be less than ten, and

           20    I've been in practice since 1992.  So that's 27

           21    years.

           22          Q.       In the approximately ten or less

           23    depositions that you've given, have any of them

           24    been in medical malpractice cases?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                               10



            1          Q.       Have all of them been in that

            2    subject?

            3          A.       As an expert witness, yes.

            4          Q.       Have you ever testified in a

            5    case where you are a party?

            6          A.       No.

            7          Q.       Okay.  Have you ever been a

            8    party to a lawsuit?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       What kind of case was that?

           11          A.       This was in the late 1990's.  It

           12    was a retinal detachment repair, which was done

           13    on an emergent basis successfully.

           14    Postoperatively, the patient had strabismus,

           15    crossed eyes.  I referred the patient

           16    immediately to the appropriate specialist.  The

           17    eye was saved from the retinal detachment.

           18                   The crossed eye specialist,

           19    strabismologist, elected to observe the patient

           20    rather than treat the patient surgically.  The

           21    crossed eyes did not improve so the patient

           22    sued me along with her husband for lack of

           23    consortium.  The case dragged on for

           24    approximately a year and a half.  When it was

           25    time to name the expert, I named my expert and

                                                               11



            1    they, at that time, dropped the case saying

            2    that I didn't do any harm, didn't do anything

            3    wrong.  That was entirely dropped at that time.

            4          Q.       Did you give a deposition in

            5    that case?

            6          A.       No.  It never got to that point.

            7    I met with the lawyer that was representing me

            8    several times.  Again, this was approximately

            9    20 years ago, and it was my only experience in

           10    malpractice cases.

           11          Q.       All right.  And you can

           12    certainly relate to the fact that sometimes a

           13    patient may be dissatisfied with the result of

           14    care and chooses to file a lawsuit, which may

           15    or may not have merit, true?

           16                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           17          form.

           18    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           19          Q.       You can still answer the

           20    question.

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       In working on this case, I would

           23    like to know how you were first contacted and

           24    what you were told about the case and then how

           25    you embarked on your review and analysis of the

                                                               12



            1    case to reach the opinions that you've

            2    expressed.  So who contacted you?

            3          A.       I was contacted by Mr. Akins.

            4          Q.       And what did Kelly Akins tell

            5    you?

            6          A.       He gave me a broad overview of

            7    the case and asked whether or not I felt that I

            8    could render an opinion.

            9          Q.       All right.

           10          A.       I said I could review it and

           11    render an opinion.

           12          Q.       All right.  When he spoke with

           13    you and asked you if you would review the case,

           14    you didn't make up your mind until you had all

           15    the materials sent to you?

           16          A.       I made up my mind that I would

           17    be able to review the case prior to that.

           18          Q.       Sure.  But as far --

           19          A.       But I said I wasn't sure which

           20    way I would go until I had the opportunity to

           21    review the documents.

           22          Q.       Okay.  Because you've testified

           23    in other cases, you know that the jury system

           24    that may evaluate evidence and decide factual

           25    disputes and evaluate the credibility of

                                                               13



            1    witnesses, needs to have individuals who are

            2    careful in the way they analyze and testify to

            3    make sure that they have a sound basis for

            4    their opinions.  Would that be true?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       And I take it that when you

            7    undertook this responsibility to review the

            8    case and let Mr. Akins know what you thought,

            9    there is some certain ethical principles that

           10    you used to guide you as to how best to do

           11    that.  Would that be true?

           12          A.       I'm guided by medical principle.

           13          Q.       Okay.  For example --

           14          A.       In evaluating a case, the most

           15    important aspect of that is evaluating based on

           16    sound medical principles, which of course have

           17    ethical underpinnings.  Is that what you're

           18    getting at?

           19          Q.       Yes.  And just simple facts that

           20    you want to make sure that if you're offering

           21    opinions, it falls within the area of your

           22    expertise.  Would that be true?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       You wouldn't review a case that

           25    was outside your area of expertise?

                                                               14



            1          A.       I would not review a cardiac

            2    case.  You're correct.

            3          Q.       And, likewise, when you get the

            4    materials, you want to review those in a fair

            5    and honest and objective way as the care that

            6    you're reviewing unfolded in the day-by-day

            7    process of treatment.  Would that be true?

            8          A.       Can you repeat that again.

            9          Q.       I can.  What I would like to

           10    say, you don't look at the result and then go

           11    back in hindsight.  You try to view the facts

           12    as they unfolded to the clinician or the doctor

           13    that is trying to make decisions in order to

           14    fairly evaluate their judgment based on the

           15    circumstances that they confronted?

           16          A.       It's very important to look at

           17    the dynamics of the case and the setting of the

           18    case.  Not only with regard to the flow, but

           19    what the pervasive treatment is at the time the

           20    case was occurring.

           21          Q.       Okay.

           22          A.       So that's very dynamic because

           23    the way that they treat something nowadays, may

           24    be different than the way we treated it years

           25    ago.

                                                               15



            1          Q.       Okay.  And why -- I know you've

            2    eluded to some reasons as to why it's important

            3    to look at the circumstances that you're

            4    evaluating at the time they occurred.  Are

            5    there any other reasons other than the fact

            6    that treatment may change or that new

            7    modalities may surface?  Any other reasons why

            8    it's important to carefully look at the facts

            9    and circumstances that were known at the time

           10    clinical judgments were made?

           11          A.       That's very important.  I try to

           12    look at it very objectively, but I also realize

           13    that I'm in the unique position, having

           14    practiced retina, a retina subspecialty, and

           15    most uveitis in the United States today is

           16    treated by retina specialists, as you may know.

           17    Having practiced for 27 years and having many

           18    patients who present in a similar fashion, that

           19    I'm able to be in a position to not only have

           20    studied the particular issue at hand, having

           21    seen it evolve over the years and how we treat

           22    this now versus how we treated it before, but

           23    also having had several similar patients.  So

           24    I'm able to evaluate it from that standpoint as

           25    well.

                                                               16



            1          Q.       Would it be true that every

            2    patient has their own unique presentation?

            3          A.       Every patient has unique

            4    presentation, unique luggage, unique

            5    characteristics that we have to take into

            6    consideration.  Unique medical histories,

            7    medications, surgical histories, immune status,

            8    and background that we need to take into

            9    account when we're evaluating the patient as a

           10    whole in order to assimilate the picture and

           11    synthesize it to approach the problem in the

           12    best way for each individual patient.

           13          Q.       Okay.  And in the practice that

           14    you have, you're in a group of other

           15    ophthalmologists that have different areas of

           16    specialty; is that true?

           17          A.       That's correct.

           18          Q.       And is almost all of your

           19    practice -- in your subspecialty of retina and

           20    then even some other subspecialty areas of

           21    interests, is almost all of it referable

           22    practice for you and your group?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       So --

           25          A.       I'm so sorry.  Not only within

                                                               17



            1    the doctors in the group, but referrals that I

            2    get from outside of the group.

            3          Q.       Okay.  Are you familiar with

            4    Texas Retina Associates?

            5          A.       I am familiar with their names.

            6    It all depends on what you mean by familiar.

            7          Q.       Yeah.

            8          A.       I know that, you know, I've seen

            9    over the years attending meetings the American

           10    Society of Retina Specialists.  I've seen Dr.

           11    Fuller, I believe it is.  I think he's got a

           12    couple of sons in the group, if I'm not

           13    mistaken.  Dr. Spencer has been there for a

           14    number of years.  But outside of that, I'm

           15    really not familiar with them.  I just know of

           16    them.

           17          Q.       Yeah.  It wouldn't be surprising

           18    if, like your specialty, they have individuals

           19    in different parts of Texas and beyond that

           20    refer the most complex cases to them, just like

           21    people up here refer the puzzling cases, the

           22    most complex cases to your place?

           23                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           24          form.

           25    BY MR. PATTERSON:

                                                               18



            1          Q.       Would that be true?

            2                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

            3          form.

            4    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            5          Q.       You can answer.

            6          A.       It's very difficult to attempt

            7    to make an analogy in that situation because --

            8    and I see where you're trying to come from, but

            9    there are so many excellent groups in Texas.

           10    That for me to assume that all of the most

           11    complex cases are going to go to Texas Retina

           12    Associates, I think, would be incorrect because

           13    there is a lot of excellent doctors in Texas

           14    and in that environment that -- you understand

           15    what I'm saying?

           16          Q.       Sure.

           17          A.       It's difficult for me to make a

           18    definitive analogy.  We all have difficult

           19    cases.

           20          Q.       Okay.  Let me just ask the facts

           21    of this case.  Obviously, there was a physician

           22    in Paris, Texas, which is a number of miles

           23    away from the Dallas, Fort Worth area and was

           24    referred to this group.  Then the patient was

           25    first seen by Dr. Spencer and then referred to

                                                               19



            1    Dr. Wang.  I mean, you saw that in the records;

            2    is that true?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       And that's something that may

            5    happen in your group in almost a very similar

            6    way.  An outlining doctor may refer to your

            7    group once it's evaluated by one person in the

            8    group, they may say I think you would be best

            9    treated by another physician that has a

           10    different area of expertise.  Would that be

           11    fair that's how it works?

           12          A.       I think that that would be

           13    appropriate, yes.

           14          Q.       In this case, I know in your

           15    letter you listed the things that you had to

           16    review.  Do you feel like you had an adequate

           17    amount of information upon which to base your

           18    opinions in this case?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       Was there any information that

           21    you felt like you needed and you didn't have?

           22          A.       No.

           23          Q.       Okay.  With respect to reviewing

           24    records, I know that in medical legal cases the

           25    information contained in medical records is

                                                               20



            1    often the subject of great interest.  My

            2    question is, do you recognize that there are

            3    some things that clearly occurred in the course

            4    of treatment that may not be specifically

            5    documented in the record, but you know that

            6    those things occurred simply because of the way

            7    the records read and the events that happened?

            8    And I can give you an example if you need it.

            9                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           10          the form of the question.

           11    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           12          Q.       Can you answer that?

           13                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Same

           14          objection.

           15                   THE WITNESS:  When I see a

           16          patient, I'm very, very careful in

           17          documenting my thought process, the

           18          differential diagnosis, and when I'm

           19          treating a patient I make sure that I

           20          have the medication or the laser or the

           21          surgery, the dosage.  These things are

           22          critical and I don't want anybody to

           23          assume or read between the lines because

           24          that's not the way it should be.  It's

           25          not the way I was taught.  So I have to

                                                               21



            1          say, no.  That I look at the records and

            2          the records are what transpired.

            3    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            4          Q.       Okay.

            5          A.       If a dosage is written, that's

            6    the dosage and no other dosage is the dosage

            7    that was administered.

            8          Q.       Gotcha.  Okay.  I think part of

            9    my question involved just the fact that it's

           10    impossible to document every word of history

           11    that is stated by the patient, but it's

           12    incumbent upon the doctor to ask the history

           13    and to generally document it.  Would that be

           14    fair?

           15          A.       It's important to accurately

           16    describe the history that a patient gives.  You

           17    can do that without a transcription of every

           18    word, comma, period, and semicolon that a

           19    patient is giving you.

           20          Q.       Right.  And even some of the

           21    things, some of the treatments, like an

           22    interocular injection, there is certain

           23    techniques, sterile techniques, that are used

           24    that may obviously occur, but they are not

           25    always written down in detail, fair?

                                                               22



            1          A.       Are you using that as a specific

            2    example, intraocular injection, intravitreal

            3    injection, because the reason why I'm saying

            4    that is that it's critical not only from a

            5    medical standpoint, but from a medical legal

            6    standpoint that the procedure is documented

            7    accurately.  And in this era of electronic

            8    medical records, it's easier than ever to do

            9    that efficiently and correctly.

           10          Q.       All right.  My question is a

           11    little bit different so I'm just going to say

           12    responsiveness for the record.  But let me ask

           13    it a bigger picture.  When you reviewed the

           14    records, did you review them from a fair and

           15    realistic standpoint trying to understand what

           16    actually occurred?

           17                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           18          form.

           19                   THE WITNESS:  I always strive to

           20          be fair and realistic.  So I'm biased in

           21          my answer saying that, yes, I feel that I

           22          was fair and realistic.

           23    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           24          Q.       All right.  And you do agree

           25    that it would be inappropriate to

                                                               23



            1    retrospectively judge the conduct as a Monday

            2    morning quarterback?  It's important to judge

            3    the conduct based upon the facts and

            4    circumstances when the judgment or the action

            5    was taken.

            6                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

            7          form.

            8    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            9          Q.       True?

           10                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Same

           11          objection.

           12                   THE WITNESS:  So when I read the

           13          records, I read the records in what I was

           14          trying to perceive as realtime.  You

           15          necessarily look back and you, as a

           16          normal individual, look back and say what

           17          if that didn't occur, what would have

           18          happened?  Would the patient still have

           19          had his eye?  I think that's human

           20          nature.

           21    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           22          Q.       Sure.

           23          A.       And if I didn't, it wouldn't be

           24    truthful.

           25          Q.       Yeah.

                                                               24



            1          A.       So of course I read it in

            2    realtime, looked at the pictures that were

            3    available in realtime.  Then I did look back

            4    and say, if that Methotrexate wasn't injected

            5    in the eye, would the patient still have had

            6    their right eye?

            7          Q.       Absolutely.  When you make

            8    evaluations of causation, you necessarily have

            9    to look back.  But as far as judging the

           10    conduct that's under the facts and

           11    circumstances, and that's what I think you've

           12    explained; is that right?

           13                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           14          form.

           15                   THE WITNESS:  I was trying to

           16          say that I was evaluating the

           17          circumstances as if they were occurring

           18          in realtime.  What would I have thought

           19          had I seen that patient, which I've seen

           20          several times in my career, and what

           21          differential diagnosis would I have

           22          formulated, and what testing would I have

           23          considered, and then what treatments

           24          would I have done given the data that was

           25          given at the time.  That's why I believe

                                                               25



            1          I was asked to review this.

            2    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            3          Q.       Okay.  Let me just ask, when you

            4    would attempt to give me your definition of

            5    what the standard of care is, that you believe

            6    is the standard that is required of a

            7    specialist like Dr. Wang.  Would you give me

            8    your definition as you have used it in making

            9    your opinions.

           10          A.       So you're asking -- I need you

           11    to ask me that again because I'm probably

           12    misunderstanding your question.

           13          Q.       Okay.

           14          A.       And I want to make sure that I'm

           15    understanding it correctly.

           16          Q.       Okay.  Well, the reason -- one

           17    of the reasons I ask it in the manner in which

           18    I did was in your last answer you said, I try

           19    to put myself in that position, what would I

           20    think, what would I do, what would I -- what

           21    would be my thought processes.  And would you

           22    agree that the standard of care is something

           23    different than what just one physician may do.

           24    It is what a reasonably prudent physician may

           25    do under the same or similar circumstances, and

                                                               26



            1    there can be different shades of conduct that

            2    are still within the standard if it's not

            3    specifically what you would do.  Would you

            4    agree with that?

            5          A.       Your last -- I'm sorry.

            6                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Just a form

            7          objection.  You can answer.

            8                   THE WITNESS:  Your last question

            9          had nothing to do with the standard of

           10          care, at least my interpretation of your

           11          last question had nothing to with the

           12          standard of care.  Your last question

           13          asked me whether or not I looked back at

           14          it as a Monday morning quarterback or how

           15          did I view the case, how was I assessing

           16          the case.  That's not to say that others

           17          may look at it differently.  Maybe some

           18          others would look at it in retrospect.

           19          Under the retrospectoscope, if you want

           20          to use that word.  I think that's quite a

           21          different question than what do you feel

           22          the standard of care is.

            2    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            3          Q.       Okay.  Well, let me come back to

            4    the definition of the standard of care in a

            5    minute.  I'm going to take care of a little bit

            6    of housekeeping and then we'll come back to

            7    that.  All right?  I marked a number of

            8    exhibits as we began the deposition.

            9                   MR. PATTERSON:  This is a copy

           10          of the exhibits, Joe.

           11    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           12          Q.       The first one is kind of a

           13    formal document that was the notice for the

           14    deposition.  It had what is known as the

           15    subpoena duces tecum that asked you to bring

           16    certain documents with you if they existed.

           17    Then Mr. Akins filed some objections to my

           18    subpoena, which I also have marked as an

           19    exhibit to this deposition.  I just want to

           20    know, what did you bring with you to the

           21    deposition today in response to the subpoena?

           22          A.       So I brought my fees for

           23    deposition.

           24          Q.       Okay.  This is your --

           25          A.       Fee schedule.

                                                               28



            1          Q.       Fee schedule.  All right.  This

            2    is a standard document that you use whenever

            3    you do a review of medical records for an

            4    attorney?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6                   MR. PATTERSON:  I'm going to

            7          mark that as Exhibit-8.

           12    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           13          Q.       Then you brought a copy of your

           14    report, I see?

           15          A.       A copy of my report, which

           16    you've labeled Exihibit-3.

           17          Q.       Okay.

           18          A.       And I brought an updated

           19    curriculum vitae, which you've labeled

           20    Exhibit-5.

           21          Q.       All right.

           22          A.       And I brought a model of the

           23    eye, which I thought would be helpful.

           24          Q.       Yes.  It would be.  Did you

           25    bring the materials that you reviewed?

                                                               29



            1          A.       I did not.

            2          Q.       Did you bring any notes that you

            3    made during your review process?

            4          A.       I did not.

            5          Q.       Do those exists somewhere?

            6          A.       No.  I just -- my report.

            7          Q.       Okay.  All right.  So you didn't

            8    generate any notes before you wrote your

            9    report?

           10          A.       No.

           11          Q.       And did you look at the records

           12    and photographs and materials electronically?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14          Q.       So Kelly was able to e-mail you

           15    those documents electronically and you could

           16    look at them on your computer screen?

           17          A.       E-mail and then the CD of the

           19          Q.       Okay.

           20          A.       -- which was existing.

           21          Q.       All right.  So you looked at

           22    those --

           23          A.       UT -- I'm sorry.

           24          Q.       UT Southwestern?

           25          A.       Yes.

            1          Q.       Yes.  Okay.

            2                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Ken, not to

            3          interrupt, but I did bring some color

            4          photos that, I think, the doctor wanted

            5          to use.

            6                   THE WITNESS:  Oh, yes.  Thank

            7          you so much.

            8    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            9          Q.       If you need to look at those,

           10    just let me know when it arises, if you would.

           11          A.       Will do.

           12          Q.       Were those documents that you

           13    prepared or were they just --

           14          A.       They were in the medical

           15    records.

           16          Q.       Okay.

           17          A.       And I pointed them out.

           18          Q.       Okay.  Good.  Have you ever

           19    written any other reports that deal with

           20    toxoplasmosis and medical legal litigation?

           21          A.       No.

           22          Q.       Have you ever published any

           23    literature that deals with Methotrexate and its

           24    use in intraocular lymphoma?

           25          A.       No.

                                                               31



            1          Q.       Have you ever done any research

            2    in that area --

            3          A.       In which area?

            4          Q.       -- personally?  Methotrexate

            5    used to treat intraocular lymphoma.

            6          A.       No.

            7          Q.       Have you ever testified at trial

            8    in a courtroom before a jury or a judge?

            9          A.       No.

           10          Q.       Have you ever advertised as an

           11    expert witness?

           12          A.       No.

           13          Q.       Do you know of the slightly less

           14    than ten depositions you've given in medical

           15    legal cases, how many times you may have

           16    appeared on behalf of the patient versus how

           17    many times you may have appeared as an expert

           18    witness on behalf of a physician?

           19          A.       Can I give you an approximation?

           20          Q.       Please.

           21          A.       Approximately 90 percent for the

           22    physician and maybe 10 percent for the patient.

           23          Q.       All right.  Have you ever

           24    reviewed any cases for Mr. Akins in the past?

           25          A.       No.

                                                               32



            1          Q.       Do you know Dr. Wang?

            2          A.       No.

            3          Q.       Have you ever participated in

            4    any studies or trials, clinical trials, that he

            5    has also participated in?

            6          A.       No.

            7          Q.       What about Dr. Steven Yay?

            8          A.       No.

            9          Q.       You don't have any reason to

           10    believe that Dr. Wang is not appropriately

           11    trained and does not have the qualifications

           12    that he showed on his resume and discussed in

           13    his deposition?

           14          A.       I don't happen to know his

           15    specific training, but I don't happen to, you

           16    know, have any issues.

           17          Q.       Okay.  So we have -- Exhibit-4

           18    was the resume that was the one that was

           19    produced, but the designation as number five is

           20    the one that is the most current.

           21                   I want to ask you a little bit

           22    about more about your background.  From looking

           23    at the basic bio that is on your website, or

           24    the website of your group, it says you have

           25    special interests in diabetic retinopathy and

                                                               33



            1    macular degeneration.  Tell me about those

            2    aspects of your interests.

            3          A.       Retina specialists commonly

            4    treat diabetic retinopathy and macular

            5    degeneration.  My experience has been no

            6    different.  Diabetic retinopathy is the leading

            7    cause of blindness in working age adults, and

            8    macular degeneration is the leading cause of

            9    blindness in more mature individuals, but those

           10    are not the only things that I deal with.

           11                   I deal with uveitis, retinal

           12    tears, retinal detachments, inherited retinal

           13    disease, and a variety of retinal disorders,

           14    vascular disorders, retinal vascular disease.

           15          Q.       Tell me in your treatment of

           16    macular degeneration, do you give intraocular

           17    injections to treat that disease?

           18          A.       Very commonly use intravitreal

           19    injections to treat not only macular

           20    degeneration, but diabetic retinopathy, retinal

           21    venous occlusive disease, and intravitreal

           22    injections of the anti-inflammatories for

           23    uveitis are a big part of my practice.

           24          Q.       Tell me, with respect to the

           25    intravitreal injections for macular

                                                               34



            1    degeneration, what is your standard with

            2    respect to the amount, the quantity, of fluid

            3    you typically inject when you're doing

            4    treatment for macular degeneration?

            5          A.       I use the three major -- for

            6    macular degeneration, I use the three major

            7    anti-VEGF compounds; Bevacizumab, Ranibizumab,

            8    Aflibercept, in their standard dosages.  That

            9    is 1.25 milligrams of Bevacizumab, .5

           10    milligrams of Ranibizumab, and 2 milligrams of

           11    Aflibercept, and generally .05 cc's volume.

           12    These things have been worked out.

           13          Q.       How do you -- that is a very

           14    common -- those three are very common

           15    medications for macular degeneration?

           16          A.       Yes.  And thank goodness we've

           17    got others to follow in the near future that we

           18    will be able to use for our patients.

           19          Q.       Did you give them in tantum with

           20    each other or do you select one of those?  But

           21    as you're talking about them, are they all

           22    together or are they separate?

           23          A.       Well, each patient gets

           24    monotherapy with one or the other.

           25          Q.       Okay.

                                                               35



            1          A.       And we may elect to switch at

            2    some point based on response, which we can

            3    judge by many different factors.  Not only the

            4    clinical examination, fundus optical coherence

            5    tomography.  We have multimodal imaging in my

            6    practice.  So I evaluate each patient

            7    individually and evaluate their responses

            8    individually and treat them as appropriately as

            9    we can with the available agents.  These

           10    intravitreal injections have changed the

           11    practice of retina dramatically.

           12                   When I first started my

           13    fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania in

           14    1990, and I did a two year fellowship there as

           15    you may have seen, in medical and surgical

           16    retina.  None of these anti-VEGF medications

           17    were available.  We were treating macular

           18    degeneration with thermal laser, which was

           19    notoriously destructive, but it was really the

           20    only thing we had until July of 2000 when we

           21    had available verteporfin photodynamic therapy.

           22    That was the main agent for treatment of

           23    macular degeneration between the years of 2000

           24    and 2005.  We used that extensively for our

           25    patients.

                                                               36



            1                   It represented an improvement in

            2    the management of macular degeneration.  But

            3    these pharmacologic treatments represented a

            4    quantum leap in our ability to treat that

            5    disease.

            6          Q.       What is a normal volume of

            7    vitreous in the eye?

            8          A.       So normally you can think of it

            9    as a shot glass almost.  It's about four or

           10    five cc's.

           11          Q.       Okay.  And when you are giving

           12    one of these medications that is appropriate

           13    for macular degeneration, you indicated that

           14    you may inject .05 cc's as part of the therapy.

           15    Is that -- that's your chosen volume of dosing;

           16    is that right?

           17          A.       That's correct.

           18          Q.       How does it work in your office

           19    where you ask for a syringe to been drawn up or

           20    brought to you as you're doing your work.

           21    Let's just take a macular degeneration patient

           22    since that's a common one.  How does it work in

           23    your office?

           24          A.       That has evolved as well.

           25          Q.       Okay.

                                                               37



            1          A.       I write a regular column in the

            2    Journal of Retinal Physicians called

            3    Controversies and Care.  Also, I'm on the

            4    editorial board, and I write occasional

            5    articles in that journal.  One of the articles

            6    that I wrote within the last year had to do

            7    with prefilled syringes.

            8                   The prefilled syringe has

            9    changed and will continue to the change the way

           10    the clinic flows because no longer do we have

           11    to draw up medications from a vile.  Instead,

           12    we're given these prefilled syringes, which the

           13    technician hands to me and I inject.  And so

           14    these prefilled syringes have the appropriate

           15    medicine dosage.  So there is not a lot of

           16    guess work that has to occur.  There is no

           17    calculation of dilutions.  There can't be

           18    dilution errors made by the staff.  It really

           19    has streamlined the situation.

           20                   When we get the Bevacizumab from

           21    compounding pharmacies, likewise, it's in a

           22    prefilled syringe.  Ranibizumab is given in a

           23    prefilled syringe.  Recently, Aflibercept now

           24    is going to be offered, just FDA approved last

           25    week, in a prefilled syringe.  But that was the

                                                               38



            1    only one up until, you know, it's the only one

            2    that we had to draw.

            3          Q.       Okay.

            4                   MR. PATTERSON:  Let me just

            5          object nonresponsive.

            6                   THE WITNESS:  Right.

            7    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            8          Q.       I guess the way it works in your

            9    office when you're giving a common macular

           10    degeneration drug, you request for that

           11    specific repackaged syringe to be brought to

           12    you so that you can use it in giving that

           13    medication to the patient, true?

           14          A.       If it's a drug that has a

           15    prefilled syringe, yes.

           16          Q.       And your office maintains at

           17    least some supply of those prefilled syringes

           18    because it's a common medication that you and

           19    many of your colleagues may use on occasion,

           20    true?

           21          A.       Yes.  We have supply based upon

           22    our schedule, based upon anticipated patients,

           23    in the refrigerator maintained by a drug

           24    inventory system that we have so that we can

           25    keep track of the medications that we have.

                                                               39



            1          Q.       So when you, for example, just

            2    so we now how it works, say you need drug "X"

            3    and there is a --

            4                   MR. PATTERSON:  I apologize.

            5          That's my phone ringing in my briefcase.

            6          Let's take a break briefly.

            7                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  6:17 p.m.  We're

           13                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  6:24 p.m.  We're

           14          back on the record.

           15    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           16          Q.       Doctor, we just took a short

           17    break off the record and you're ready to

           18    continue?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       I was just trying to understand

           21    how it works.  So when you need a medication

           22    you ask for a, let's say, a standard prefilled

           23    medication, you ask your medical assistant or

           24    nurse to bring you that prefilled syringe and

           25    she dutiful marks the inventory that one is

                                                               40



            1    missing and it makes sure it gets charged to

            2    the patient or their insurance company or

            3    however it works.  Is that the way it works in

            4    your office?

            5          A.       In general, yes.

            6          Q.       And as far as the injections, I

            7    guess, some of these medications are very

            8    expensive; is that true?

            9          A.       You know, I think it all depends

           10    on your perspective.  But where I grew up,

           11    yeah.  Very expensive, yes.

           12          Q.       And part of the reason why the

           13    drug companies want to give prefilled syringes

           14    is they want to sell it in only the quantity

           15    that's needed so as to reduce the cost perhaps

           16    to the patient and the physicians that are

           17    using that medication?

           18                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           19          form.

           20    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           21          Q.       Is that part of the reason?

           22                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           23          form.

           24                   THE WITNESS:  So ask that one

           25          more time.  I'm sorry.

                                                               41



            1    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            2          Q.       The compounding pharmacies by

            3    design are requested to give either the

            4    appropriate standard dosage in a prefilled

            5    syringe either as determined by the drug

            6    company or as determined and requested by the

            7    doctor who is ordering the compounded

            8    medication.

            9                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           10          form.

           11                   THE WITNESS:  So a certain

           12          amount of drug is in a prefilled syringe.

           13          We don't always use prefilled syringes,

           14          as I explained before.  Sometimes we get

           15          medication from a vile, in which case we

           16          do draw it up, in which case often there

           17          is more drug than we need.  And often in

           18          the prefilled syringe there is a little

           19          more than the dose is there, but we

           20          always document the amount that is

           21          administered.

           22    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           23          Q.       All right.

           24                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

           25                   THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  I just

                                                               42



            1          want to make sure I answer the rest of

            2          your question.  You said to reduce the

            3          cost.  Now, I'm not aware of any

            4          medication in a syringe that's put in the

            5          syringe in a particular fashion to reduce

            6          the cost.  Unless I'm misunderstanding

            7          with what you were trying to get at.

            8    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            9          Q.       It's probably my ignorance with

           10    respect to the medications and their expense,

           11    but I think it just would be logical to me that

           12    if a medication is very expensive, as the

           13    physician wants to buy as little as is

           14    necessary to affectively dose the medication

           15    and not buy extra amounts that have to be

           16    wasted.

           17                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           18          form.

           19    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           20          Q.       That's just my thought so I'll

           21    withdraw the question because I'm really not

           22    trying to make a distinction about cost in any

           23    way.

           24          A.       Okay.

           25          Q.       It is true that often even the

                                                               43



            1    prefilled syringes give you a little bit more

            2    medication than is the standard dose simply so

            3    you can clear the air out of the hyperdermic

            4    needle and inject exactly the amount of volume

            5    of that concentration or mixture of medication

            6    into the eye.  Would that be right?

            7          A.       Yes.  And because also there is

            8    going to be residual medication in the lumen of

            9    the needle when you push the syringe down to

           10    the base.  So, yes.

           11          Q.       Now, as I understand it, since

           12    we're talking about an eye that has a definite

           13    size and a cavity, when you add volume to that

           14    cavity, you want to be careful as to the amount

           15    of fluid you add to that cavity because it can

           16    create higher pressures inside the globe of the

           17    eye in the vitreous and you don't want to do

           18    that.  Would that be true?

           19          A.       Fortunately, the eye, although a

           20    relatively ridged structure, has normal

           21    mechanism for fluid outflow inside the eye --

           22    and I'm not talking about tears on the outside

           23    -- I'm talking about fluid on the inside so

           24    that when you inject these volumes, it can

           25    tolerate even, you know, two times at least the

                                                               44



            1    amount of volume that we're injecting typically

            2    without causing harm.

            3                   So while you're right, the

            4    pressure in the relatively closed system does

            5    increase for a short bit, there has never been

            6    any evidence that that increase and pressure

            7    for that short amount of time causes any harm

            8    to the inside of the eye.

            9          Q.       It may cause discomfort to a

           10    patient?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       And so, for example, one of the

           13    reasons why you and your macular degeneration

           14    injections do .05 cc's is that studies have

           15    shown that that is an easily tolerated

           16    medication where it really does not cause any

           17    discomfort to patients that receive that small

           18    quantity of fluid.  Would that be true?

           19          A.       The dilution was made based upon

           20    the concentration of the medication that we're

           21    using.  If an increased volume was necessary,

           22    it could have been done.  I think that the most

           23    important part of the dosage is not the volume,

           24    is not the volume, but rather the specific

           25    dosage of the medication to ensure efficacy for

                                                               45



            1    treatment of the prolem.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  Not my question.

            3          Object to the answer.

            4    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            5          Q.       It is true that over the course

            6    of studying macular degeneration where there

            7    are injections of .05 cc's of volume,

            8    regardless of the type of the medication that's

            9    being used, that is evaluated to be a very safe

           10    and non-discomfort producing quantity going

           11    into a patient's eye?  Would that be true?

           12          A.       Some patients have a lower

           13    tolerance to even the same amount of volume.

           14    So my answer had to do with the fact that .05

           15    cc's was given based upon the concentration of

           16    the medication rather that than the tolerated

           17    volume.

           18          Q.       I understand that.

           19          A.       Okay.

           20          Q.       Yeah.  And really it is a

           21    factor.  There are two different factors

           22    involved.  One is the concentration of the

           23    medication, true?  And one is the volume of the

           24    medication administered, true?

           25          A.       The factor that is important is

                                                               46



            1    the dosage of the medication.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object,

            3          nonresponsive.

            4    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            5          Q.       The dosage of the medication can

            6    be in a larger volume with less concentration

            7    or a smaller volume with a more potent

            8    concentration, but the -- so it's two factors.

            9    It's not only the concentration, but it's the

           10    volume that is injected into the eye.  There

           11    are two factors, true?

           12          A.       I disagree with that.

           13          Q.       Okay.

           14          A.       Because a wide range of volumes

           15    can be tolerated.  Whereas not a wide range of

           16    dosages can be tolerated.

           17          Q.       I understand.

           18                   MR. PATTERSON:  And I object,

           19          nonresponsive.

           20    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           21          Q.       So it's your testimony that .05

           22    cc's being a standard volume of Methotrexate --

           23    excuse me.  I said the wrong word.  Let me

           24    start over. .05 cc's being a standard amount of

           25    volume for delivery of macular degeneration

                                                               47



            1    medications is something that has been

            2    developed over time because it is -- has

            3    minimal complaints from patients receiving that

            4    amount of volume when they receive their

            5    treatments.

            6                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

            7          form.

            8                   THE WITNESS:  So I'm sorry.

            9          What was -- can you make that a question?

           10    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           11          Q.       Yeah.  Let me see if I can state

           12    it better.

           13          A.       Okay.

           14          Q.       Would you agree that injecting

           15    .1 cc's is more likely to cause discomfort in a

           16    patient than injecting .05 cc's?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       Okay.  Although you say patients

           19    have different tolerances as to pain, and even

           20    some can get the .05 cc injection and still

           21    have discomfort, would you agree with me that

           22    in your experience most patients who receive

           23    .05 cc's of a medication seldom have complaints

           24    related to a transient increase of pressure?

           25          A.       True.

                                                               48



            1          Q.       Okay.  And the natural drainage

            2    system of the eye is something that can

            3    accommodate maybe even twice the .05, maybe a

            4    .1 cc, and it can accommodate it without any

            5    harm to the eye other than some momentary or

            6    short lived discomfort to the patient.  Would

            7    that be true?

            8          A.       At least twice, yes.

            9          Q.       Okay.  And the same thing is

           10    true when we're taking fluid out of the eye

           11    when we're doing a vitrectomy and removing

           12    fluid from the eye, there is a certain point of

           13    time when after we start removing fluid from

           14    the eye we need to replace fluid back in the

           15    eye so that the globe does not collapse or get

           16    too small.

           17          A.       And that point is immediate.

           18          Q.       All right.

           19          A.       That's why we have -- we use a

           20    trocar system with an infusion canula that we

           21    make sure is turned on immediately so the eye

           22    doesn't collapse.  Because you can get a

           23    variety of other issues when you have hypotony

           24    or low pressure in the eye.

           25          Q.       Yeah.

                                                               49



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       The eye, although it is amazing

            3    in the way it's able to adapt when it's

            4    receiving treatment whether it be injections,

            5    adding fluid to the eye, or removing vitreous

            6    from the eye, there is a need to maintain a

            7    proper balance so that the eye does not

            8    collapse or that the patient does not feel

            9    pressure that is painful.  Would that be true?

           10          A.       You said there is a need.  I

           11    think that it's much, much more important to

           12    prevent the eye from collapsing rather than the

           13    other way around.

           14          Q.       All right.

           15          A.       Within a range of course.

           16          Q.       And that is why when you're

           17    doing a vitrectomy you almost have to

           18    immediately start replacing fluid.  It limits

           19    you as a physician from getting a large

           20    quantity of pure or native vitreal fluid to be

           21    sent off for testing or culture or PCRs?

           22          A.       So when you're --

           23          Q.       Is that true?  You can explain.

           24                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  He's

           25          entitled to answer the question.

                                                               50



            1                   MR. PATTERSON:  Yeah.  I'm just

            2          --

            3                   THE WITNESS:  So when you are

            4          doing a diagnostic vitrectomy, there are

            5          ways to remove the vitreous to try to get

            6          a pure sample even as you're infusing.

            7          And so the answer is yes.  But with the

            8          advanced PCR techniques that we have, you

            9          can effectively get enough with even ten

           10          microliters of fluid, almost a negligible

           11          amount, to test for things like

           12          toxoplasmosis.  So you're never really

           13          limited in terms of your testing based

           14          upon the need to perform a diagnostic

           15          vitrectomy.

           16                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

           17    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           18          Q.       The new techniques that you're

           19    talking about, the PCR testing, who does your

           20    PCR testing for your practice when you have the

           21    need to run those?

           22          A.       I send it out.

           23          Q.       And you send it out to who?

           24          A.       Usually University of

           25    Washington.  Outside of the area.

                                                               51



            1          Q.       Okay.  And has the amount of

            2    sample changed over time as far as what is

            3    necessary in order to run PCR tests?

            4          A.       I am not a pathologist.  I'm

            5    sure that they would rather have more than

            6    less.  I can't give you chapter and verse in

            7    terms of any specific laboratory amount that

            8    they are required.  But increasingly less and

            9    less is required as the gene specificity has

           10    improved.

           11          Q.       When you say increasingly, is

           12    that over the last few months, few years, few

           13    --

           14          A.       Over the fast few years

           15    specifically for toxoplasmosis.  The B1 gene

           16    has increased the -- the B1 gene PCR has

           17    increased the specificity of toxoplasmosis

           18    diagnosis to about 88 percent.

           19          Q.       There is still some false

           20    positives?

           21          A.       It's not 100 percent yet.

           22          Q.       What is your experience, just so

           23    I know, in treating primary ocular lymphoma?

           24          A.       Well, the incidents of primary

           25    ocular lymphoma is about .1 to .4 per 100,000.

                                                               52



            1    So it's extremely low, and I have no experience

            2    in treating it.

            3                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object,

            4          nonresponsive.

            5    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            6          Q.       So you've never specifically in

            7    your own practice had occasion to treat someone

            8    with primary ocular lymphoma?

            9          A.       Primary vitreoretinal lymphoma I

           10    assume you're referring to?

           11          Q.       Yes.  Intraocular --

           12          A.       Vitreoretinal.

           13          Q.       Vitreoretinal?

           14          A.       Yes.  No.

           15          Q.       It is so rare that you have

           16    never had an opportunity to treat it even in

           17    your 27 years --

           18          A.       Even in my 27 years.

           19          Q.       Have you treated vitreoretinal

           20    lymphoma in conjunction with CNS lymphoma in

           21    your practice?

           22          A.       80 to 90 percent of patients

           23    with primary vitreoretinal lymphoma will have

           24    CNS lymphoma.  So you can almost assume that

           25    they're going to have it.  And so the answer to

                                                               53



            1    that also is no because they occur in tantum.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

            3    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            4          Q.       Are they treated separately?

            5          A.       No.  The most important aspect

            6    of treatment of that is systemic treatment.

            7    The systemic treatment is the critical

            8    treatment rather than the intravitreal

            9    injection of Methotrexate.  When that diagnosis

           10    is suspected, since it has such a grave

           11    prognosis, it's very important to treat it

           12    systemically and that takes priority over

           13    injection of Methotrexate in the eye.  That's

           14    also treated systemically with Methotrexate or

           15    Rituxan.

           16          Q.       Let's talk a bit --

           17    responsiveness -- about that grave.  The grave

           18    prognosis of CNS lymphoma.  When that is

           19    present, what are the statistics about the

           20    prognosis for the patient?

           21          A.       It depends on when systemic

           22    treatment is initiated.

           23          Q.       All right.

           24          A.       If you treat systemically, you

           25    can frequently have a three year survival.  The

                                                               54



            1    five year survival is going to be about five

            2    percent.  But if you don't treat systemically,

            3    you most certainly almost will never have a one

            4    year survival.  So the most critical portion of

            5    that -- and this is important because even

            6    though I have never treated it, it is important

            7    to recognize it or at least have it in your

            8    mind as a differential diagnosis when you see

            9    something like this.  It's important to be able

           10    to save lives, and the way that you save lives

           11    is not injecting Methotrexate in the vitreous.

           12    The way that you save lives is to initiate

           13    systemic treatment as soon as you feel that

           14    that's a possibility.

           15                   That systemic treatment will

           16    often take care of the vitreoretinal component

           17    of the lymphoma.  And so you will have done two

           18    things at the same time.  Often times, the

           19    systemic treatment is all that's needed to

           20    treat the ocular component or the vitreoretinal

           21    component.

           22                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object,

           23          responsiveness.

           24    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           25          Q.       Do you agree that retrovitreal

                                                               55



            1    lymphoma --

            2          A.       Vitreoretinal?  Sorry.

            3          Q.       Vitreoretinal lymphoma -- thank

            4    you -- when it is present only in the eye

            5    requires treatment as soon as possible in order

            6    to prevent it from becoming CNS lymphoma?

            7                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

            8          form.

            9                   THE WITNESS:  I think that the

           10          jury is still out with regard to whether

           11          or not we're ever going to truly see

           12          vitreoretinal lymphoma in the absence of

           13          CNS lymphoma because the retina is part

           14          of the central nervous system and

           15          certainly it's appropriate and necessary

           16          to treat such an individual systemically

           17          and the priority is to treat

           18          systemically.

           19    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           20          Q.       Do you agree that primary

           21    vitreoretinal lymphoma can exist without CNS

           22    lymphoma?  I know you say the jury is out, but

           23    what's your belief?

           24          A.       My belief is, probably if it's

           25    in the retina, it's in the CNS.

                                                               56



            1          Q.       And you don't have any studies

            2    that prove that, do you?  Or you can't site any

            3    studies that prove that?

            4          A.       There are studies that show that

            5    80 to 90 percent of the time it's in the CNS.

            6    I don't have any with me right now nor do I

            7    have any on the top of my head as to chapter

            8    and verse of where those exist, but --

            9          Q.       And I don't --

           10          A.       I'm so sorry.  In my review of

           11    this case, that was one of the things that was

           12    quite remarkable and quite appropriate to treat

           13    systemically, quite important to treat

           14    systemically, when that is suspected.

           15                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

           16    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           17          Q.       I don't expect you to have the

           18    study, but even that what you sited, 10 to 20

           19    percent may occur with just the vitreoretinal

           20    lymphoma in the eye alone before it has moved

           21    into the CNS lymphoma, true?

           22          A.       The question I had in my mind --

           23    and I want to answer your question.  I wish it

           24    was a simple yes or no answer.  But the

           25    question that I have in my mind is whether or

                                                               57



            1    not it would have evolved because the preferred

            2    treatment is systemic because you don't die

            3    from vitreoretinal lymphoma, you die from the

            4    CNS component.  You want to make sure to

            5    protect the patient and try to extend survival.

            6    What's important is not an injection in the eye

            7    to extend survival, but what's important to

            8    extend survival of a given individual is the

            9    systemic treatment.

           10                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

           11    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           12          Q.       The study you sited recognizes

           13    that there are 10 to 20 percent of the

           14    vitreoretinal lymphomas that may just exist in

           15    the eye and not CNS lymphomas.

           16          A.       I'm not convinced.

           17          Q.       Okay.  And so when you say --

           18    and I understand exactly what you're meaning.

           19    But since a jury is going to consider this,

           20    when you say, you know, the jury is out on

           21    whether or not this even a disease entity

           22    exists or not, you're saying that learning

           23    people who are vitally interested in knowing

           24    how to best manage and treat a very grave

           25    diagnosis are still -- it's still in a state of

                                                               58



            1    flux as far as what the understanding is in

            2    that particular area of disease?

            3                   THE WITNESS:  Can you read back

            4          exactly what he said with regard to

            5          whether or not a disease exists.  I just

            6          want to make sure that I'm answering the

            7          question because there is no question

            8          that that disease exist.  Can you just

            9          read back.  I want to make sure I'm

           10          answering your question.

           11                         - - -

           12                   (Whereupon, the court reporter

           13          read back the previous question.)

           14                         - - -

           15                   THE WITNESS:  I never said --

           16          and I think that you can go back and

           17          confirm this.  I never said nor did I

           18          mean to say that primary vitreoretinal

           19          lymphoma as a disease entity does not

           20          exist.  I'm not questioning that.

           21                   What I'm questioning is whether

           22          or not we should treat it in isolation or

           23          whether or not we should assume when we

           24          see that it is in the retina that it's

           25          going to be in the CNS.  And that's

                                                               59



            1          precisely, I'm sure, Dr. Wang's thought

            2          process when he ordered the MRI of the

            3          brain.

            4    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            5          Q.       He wanted to see whether or not

            6    there was evidence of lymphoma in the brain,

            7    right?

            8          A.       Which would have added credence

            9    to the possibility that what he was seeing in

           10    the retina was primary vitreoretinal lymphoma.

           12    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           13          Q.       And the reason he wanted to, if

           14    it was not shown in the brain as it was not on

           15    the MRI, that motivated him to try to treat the

           16    lymphoma which may be in the eye as a

           17    possibility in order to prevent Mr. Cook from

           18    suffering from the more grave diagnosis of CNS

           19    lymphoma.  That was his thought process, wasn't

           20    it?

           21                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           22          form.

           23                   THE WITNESS:  That couldn't have

           24          been his thought process.  Because a

           25          simple injection of Methotrexate in the

                                                               60



            1          eye will not prevent the cells from going

            2          to the brain.

            4    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            5          Q.       Let me ask you about your report

            6    for a second, and then we're going to talk

            7    about toxoplasmosis.  But when you wrote this

            8    three page report, which is Exhibit-3 to your

            9    deposition, what were you asked to do as far as

           10    creating this document?

           11          A.       I was asked to review the case,

           12    which I did.

           13          Q.       Okay.  And then when you setout

           14    to write this letter, you wanted to include

           15    your opinions concerning this case in this

           16    letter, did you not?

           17          A.       I wanted to -- I was asked to

           18    give my opinion about the case with regard to

           19    standard of care, with regard to proximate

           20    cause of vision loss in the right eye, and so I

           21    did.

           22          Q.       All right.  Did you intend to

           23    leave out some of your opinions when you wrote

           24    this letter or did you intend to put all of

           25    your opinions, at least generally, in the

                                                               61

            3          form.

            4    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            5          Q.       What was your intent?

            6          A.       My intent was to summarize the

            7    case as I had been requested to do so and I

            8    did.

            9          Q.       And to put your opinions in the

           10    letter?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       All right.  Did you intend to

           13    put all of your opinions in the letter, at

           14    least touch on?

           15          A.       My intent was to review the

           16    case, review the records, review the temporal

           17    progression of the case as you said in

           18    realtime, and provide an opinion with regard to

           19    whether or not the standard of care was carried

           20    out and also the proximate cause of the vision

           21    loss in the right eye.

           24          marked for identification.)

            1    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            2          Q.       Okay.  There is a document that

            3    is Exhibit-6 that I have marked, and then I've

            4    created a document, which is Exhibit-7 which is

            5    just only two paragraphs of document number six

            6    because I'm only interested in what was written

            7    about your opinions in this document.

            8                   So let me hand you this, six and

            9    Exhibit-7, which I think you have a copy of

           10    seven over there, but basically if you follow

           11    this one -- look at seven.  It says, that for

           12    any testifying expert there are certain things

           13    that have to be done and one is the general

           14    substance of the expert's mental impressions

           15    and opinions and a brief summary of the basis

           16    for them.  Is that what you intended to put in

           17    your letter, the general substance of your

           18    mental impressions and opinions and a brief

           19    summary of the basis for your opinions?

           20          A.       Am I allowed to read this?  I've

           21    never seen this document.

           22          Q.       Yeah.  I'm just focusing on this

           23    number three and I'm asking is that what you

           24    intended to put in your letter?

           25          A.       Number three on page two?

                                                               63



            1          Q.       No.  Number three under F at the

            2    very beginning.  The first --

            3                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  He's

            4          talking about page two of Exhibit-7.

            5                   THE WITNESS:  Page two of

            6          Exhibit-7, number three?

            7    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            8          Q.       No.  Page one.

            9          A.       Number three?

           10          Q.       No.  Go back.  Turn to the first

           11    page.  I'm looking at item, you see, F at the

           12    top?

           13          A.       Okay.  The name, address, and

           14    telephone number, and the general substance.

           15          Q.       Right.  And then number three

           16    after that, the subject matter upon which the

           17    expert will testify.  Then three, that number

           18    three is the one I was reading.  I've said the

           19    general substance of the expert's mental

           20    impressions and opinions and a brief summary of

           21    the basis for them.  I'm asking you, is that

           22    what you intended to put in your letter?  The

           23    general substance of the expert's opinions,

           24    your opinions, and brief statement of the basis

           25    for them?

                                                               64



            1          A.       I was asked to review the

            2    documents.

            3          Q.       Okay.

            4          A.       And I was asked to review the

            5    documents that I said I reviewed with regard to

            6    the standard of care and the proximate cause of

            7    the vision loss in the right eye.

            8          Q.       All right.  And that's what you

            9    wanted to put in this letter, your opinions

           10    about the standard of care and the proximate

           11    cause of the vision loss in Mr. Cook, right?

           12                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  I think he

           13          said in the right eye just to be fair to

           14          you.

           15    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           16          Q.       In the right eye.  Okay.

           17          A.       Along with the summary of the

           18    case.

           19          Q.       Sure.

           20          A.       Because --

           21          Q.       Okay.

           22          A.       You have to have something to go

           23    by.

           24          Q.       Sure.  So let's look at your

           25    report, Exhibit-3.  All right?  As we go

                                                               65



            1    through it from the beginning you recite what

            2    you looked at; the Texas Retina Associates

            3    medical records, UT Southwestern Medical

            4    records, and the depositions of Dr. Wang and

            5    Mr. Cook, right?

            6          A.       That was as of June 30, 2019.

            7          Q.       Okay.  You've seen some

            8    photographs since then, is that right, color

            9    photographs?

           10          A.       Those were reviewed -- the

           11    answer is no because --

           12          Q.       You saw those as part of Texas

           13    Retina records?

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       Have you received any additional

           16    records?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       Would those include the records

           19    from Paris Hospital?

           20          A.       Paris Hospital?

           21          Q.       Where Mr. Cook was hospitalized.

           22          A.       No.

           23          Q.       Okay.

           24          A.       Although, I'm aware of that.

           25          Q.       All right.

                                                               66



            1          A.       That was in the middle of June

            2    of 2016.

            3          Q.       Yes, sir.

            4          A.       Immediately after he got the

            5    injection of Methotrexate.

            6          Q.       Right.

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       He was in the hospital for --

            9          A.       Hypertensive emergency.

           10          Q.       Right.  Hypotensive emergency,

           11    is that what you said, hypotensive?

           12          A.       There was an emergency with his

           13    blood pressure.  I'm trying to --

           14          Q.       He was fainting and falling

           15    down?

           16          A.       Right.  Yes.

           17          Q.       And it was hypostatic blood

           18    pressure --

           19          A.       Orthostatic.

           20          Q.       Orthostatic.  Thank you.

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       All right.  Let's go on.  You

           23    say a brief review of the case shows Mr. Cook,

           24    age 79, with a medical history of coronary

           25    heart disease, status postcoronary artery

                                                               67



            1    bypass graft 1992, cardiac dysrhythmia, colon

            2    cancer; diagnosed and treated in 2007,

            3    hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy,

            4    presented with vision changes in February of

            5    2016 to Richard Grossnickle who referred

            6    Mr. Cook to Texas Retina Institute.  Did I read

            7    that correctly?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       And that is part of that history

           10    that we talked about being significant when you

           11    have a patient that you're trying to treat and

           12    advise, true?

           13          A.       Every patient is unique.  It's

           14    appropriate to introduce the patient so that

           15    you have a vision of what this patient looks

           16    like maybe in terms of their medical history

           17    and significant other issues.

           18          Q.       And this visual changes were

           19    something that started at age 79 for this

           20    gentleman according to the history?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       Okay.  Then when you read

           23    Mr. Cook's deposition you saw that he was not a

           24    stranger to the fact that cancer was a serious

           25    diagnosis since his first wife, his second

                                                               68



            1    wife, and then his girlfriend all died of

            2    different types of cancer during his

            3    relationships with them.  You saw that too,

            4    right?

            5                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

            6          the form of the question.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  That would not

            8          significantly impact on my evaluation of

            9          this patient.  So I don't recall that.

           10          Often times we look at cancer in terms of

           11          genetic predispositions, which would be

           12          entirely appropriate.  But whether or not

           13          an individual's girlfriend has a history

           14          of cancer does not impact upon our

           15          medical evaluation of the patient.

           16    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           17          Q.       I certainly agree with that.

           18    However, it would impact upon the patient's

           19    thought processes about cancer or it could

           20    impact the patient's thought processes about

           21    cancer, couldn't it?

           22                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           23          form.

           24                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.  But I fail

           25          to see a connection with his medical

                                                               69



            1          treatment at this point.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

            3    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            4          Q.       And in it sites this very same

            5    process of Grossnickel referring him to Texas

            6    Retina.  He was seen by Dr. Spencer and then

            7    referred over to Dr. Wang that we discussed

            8    before, right?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       Okay.  When this patient was

           11    initially evaluated, did he present with a

           12    picture of toxoplasmosis?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14          Q.       Let's talk about that a bit.

           15    Tell me about the characteristics of

           16    toxoplasmosis that are present in the classic

           17    presentation of toxo, and then we're going to

           18    talk about Mr. Cook.  Okay?

           19          A.       They're one in the same.

           20          Q.       Okay.  Then how does it appear?

           21                   THE WITNESS:  May I have that

           22          exhibit?

           23                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Is that all

           24          right with you?

           25                   MR. PATTERSON:  Sure, yeah.

                                                               70



            1                   THE WITNESS:  Like this

            2          (indicating).  This was a drawing that

            3          was made by Dr. Spencer on March the 2nd

            4          of 2016, with a typical headlight in the

            5          fog appearance of retinitis in the

            6          midperipheral fundus of this individual.

            7          It's distinct from a viral retinitis

            8          where we would see peripheral rather than

            9          midperipheral retinal whitening.

           10                   Dr. Spencer drew this very well

           11          in that he has the vitreous haze and you

           12          can almost see headlight in the fog if

           13          you look at it.  It's not a Rorschach

           14          test, but you can almost see a headlight

           15          in the fog appearance and that's not

           16          atypical in any way, shape, or form in

           17          what we see in a toxoplasmic retinitis,

           18          which unlike primary vitreoretinal

           19          lymphoma with an incidence of .1 to .4 in

           20          100,000.

           21                   Toxoplasmosis, if we check the

           22          serum of individuals in the world,

           23          one-third of us have toxoplasmic

           24          antibodies.  Toxoplasmic uveitis makes up

           25          a significant percentage of the posterior

                                                               71



            1          uveitis that we see.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  I'm going to

            3          mark that since we've referred to it, if

            4          I may, unless we have another copy.  I

            5          will let you keep this.

            6                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Sure.

            7                   MR. PATTERSON:  But I'm just

            8          going to mark it 12 so that we know when

            9          --

           10    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           11          Q.       12 is a drawing out of Texas

           12    Retina Institute records of Dr. Spencer, right?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  To be clear

           15          without interrupting, that's a series of

           16          documents so it's not as if that's the

           17          only one.

           18                   MR. PATTERSON:  Okay.

           19                         - - -

           20                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-12 was

           21          marked for identification.)

           22                         - - -

           23    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           24          Q.       Behind that are the photographs

           25    that were taken by Dr. Spencer at the initial

                                                               72



            1    evaluation of the patient, true?

            2          A.       Yes.  And I would like to also

            3    say --

            4          Q.       Well, you can --

            5          A.       I'm trying to finish.

            6          Q.       I know, but I'm not going -- we

            7    have to do it question and answer.

            8          A.       So you asked me a question and I

            9    was trying to answer it, but then you asked me

           10    -- so that you could label the exhibit.  I

           11    hadn't quite finished with my initial answer,

           12    if I may.

           13          Q.       All right.  That's fine.  I may

           14    object to it, but go ahead.

           15          A.       So I was trying to also say how

           16    this is differentiated from a typical viral

           17    retinitis picture, which is a peripheral

           18    retinitis.  This is a midperipheral retinitis

           19    focus with an overlying vitreous haze as

           20    opposed to primary vitreoretinal lymphoma,

           21    which we see often as a multiple focal

           22    retinitis with vitreous cells.

           23          Q.       Okay.

           24          A.       Thank you for letting me finish.

           25                   MR. PATTERSON:  Just

                                                               73



            1          nonresponsive just for the record.

            2    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            3          Q.       And that's just us talking

            4    lawyers and to the judge.

            5          A.       I understand.

            6          Q.       It should not influence anything

            7    that you say --

            8          A.       It does not.

            9          Q.       -- in answering my questions.

           10          A.       I understand.  You're doing your

           11    job.

           12          Q.       Was there any black scarring

           13    around the area of the toxoplasmosis?

           14          A.       Since 2003, really we've

           15    recognized that toxoplasmic retinitis, the

           16    majority of toxoplasmic retinitis, is going to

           17    be acquired rather than congenital.  That

           18    really wasn't our thought process before 2003

           19    where we thought most of the time toxoplasmic

           20    retinitis was going to be congenital in that

           21    the mother acquires the disease, transmits it

           22    through the placenta to the child, if there is

           23    no spontaneous abortion because it can be a

           24    significant serious issue, it often does go to

           25    the retina and the patient's immune system or

                                                               74



            1    the mother's immune cells fight off the

            2    retinitis and it forms a scar.

            3                   But on the edge of that brown

            4    scar, which I think you're referring to, later

            5    on in life you can get reactivation and you'll

            6    see a white retinitis next to an inactive

            7    retinitis.  That's typical of congenital

            8    toxoplasmosis, which during a person's lifetime

            9    can reactivate.  But increasingly we recognize

           10    that most toxoplasmic retinitis is not

           11    congenital and will not be accompanied by such

           12    a scar that you're referring to and will

           13    present like this, as an acquired toxoplasmic

           14    retinitis.

           15                   How do we acquire it?  Through

           16    inadequately cooked meat.  If we're asking for

           17    steak that's medium rare, real pink on the

           18    inside, it's got to be 145 degrees on the

           19    inside.  If we're not washing fruits and

           20    vegetables well.  We're not washing our

           21    strawberries, we're not washing our fruits.

           22    These bradyzoites of the toxoplasmosis can be

           23    ingested and result in this.  Handling cats,

           24    cat litter.  Certainly cats are the definitive

           25    host of toxoplasmosis.  Sexual reproduction of

                                                               75



            1    the toxoplasmosis occurs in cats.  So they are

            2    the definitive host.  We can acquire it through

            3    the kitty litter.

            4                   So most of the cases of

            5    toxoplasmosis are acquired and unfortunately

            6    Mr. Cook acquired the toxoplasmosis, age 79,

            7    age 79, but it was not congenital.  You're

            8    right.  It has a telltale sign that it was not

            9    congenital.

           10                   MR. PATTERSON:  Okay.

           11          Responsiveness.

           12    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           13          Q.       It did not have scarring in the

           14    way it presented in Mr. Cook, true?

           15                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           16          form.

           17                   THE WITNESS:  True.  Because it

           18          was not congenital.

           19    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           20          Q.       It was acquired by the parasite

           21    coming into his eye and having the effect on

           22    the retina?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       And it is far more common for

           25    the primary toxoplasmosis to occur in

                                                               76



            1    individuals that are 50 or below, true?

            2          A.       Not necessarily.

            3          Q.       Okay.

            4          A.       Because we recognize that most

            5    toxoplasmic retinitis now is acquired.

            6          Q.       Is it more common in

            7    immunocompromised patients?

            8          A.       Most patients that we see, just

            9    because of the numbers, are going to be

           10    immunocompetent.  It certainly can happen in

           11    immunocompromised patients, in which case it

           12    can be very aggressive.  But because most of

           13    the folks that we see nowadays, especially AIDS

           14    patients, even have highly active

           15    antiretroviral therapy on board.  Most of the

           16    cases we're going to see happen as acquired

           17    cases in immunocompetent individuals.

           18          Q.       All right.

           19          A.       And that's why frequently if

           20    it's not vision threatening, that is if the

           21    focus of toxoplasmosis is not near the macula

           22    which is the center portion of the retina or

           23    the optic nerve, sometimes you can just observe

           24    it because the patient's own immune system will

           25    take care of it.

                                                               77



            1          Q.       All right.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

            3    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            4          Q.       What is your understanding of

            5    why Dr. Spencer referred the patient to Dr.

            6    Wang or do you have one?

            7          A.       I have no understanding of that.

            8    That's an excellent question.

            9          Q.       Do you disagree with Dr.

           10    Spencer's diagnosis of viral retinitis being a

           11    primary consideration for this 79-year-old

           12    patient who presented to him?

           13          A.       Yes.  For the reasons that I

           14    just elaborated on.  The viral retinitis that

           15    is typically seen and the viral retinitis that

           16    I see is peripheral retinitis, not a

           17    midperipheral retinitis.  When I see it, I

           18    treat it with Valganciclovir, but I treat it as

           19    been recommended in the literature of two

           20    grams, three times a day, for a total of six

           21    grams a day, which has been shown to equal the

           22    intravenous dose in terms of bioavailability.

           23          Q.       Okay.

           24                   MR. PATTERSON:  I object,

           25          nonresponsive.

                                                               78



            1    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            2          Q.       I'm trying to -- I would like

            3    you to be responsive to my questions.  I don't

            4    want to interrupt you, but some times it may be

            5    best if you just try to answer my question and

            6    not elaborate.  But you're free to answer the

            7    questions however you want.  Okay?

            8                   In your report, if we -- I

            9    guess, would you agree that it was not a

           10    typical presentation of toxoplasmosis as it

           11    presented in Mr. Cook initially?

           12          A.       No.

           13          Q.       Okay.  What caused the keratic

           14    precipitants that were seen that you noted in

           15    the March and May examinations?

           16          A.       So the vitreous haze is because

           17    of white blood cells in the vitreous and the

           18    keratic precipitates are just an anterior

           19    segment manifestation of those white blood

           20    cells.  They just migrated to the front of the

           21    eye and accumulated on the under surface of the

           22    cornea and we call those keratic precipitates.

           23          Q.       Is that an inflammation of the

           24    cornea?

           25          A.       No.

                                                               79



            1          Q.       It is just a collection of

            2    precipitants in the area of the cornea?

            3          A.       From the retinitis, correct.

            4          Q.       All right.  When we look at the

            5    second page of your report, you note that at

            6    the time of the vitrectomy, which was done on

            7    6/6/16, Dr. Wang ordered the HSV, the VZV, and

            8    the CMV, PCRs.  Do you have any quarrel or

            9    criticism of him ordering those PCRs from the

           10    vitreous sound?

           11          A.       As I indicated, a request for

           12    toxoplasmosis would have been appropriate.

           13          Q.       That's not my question and let

           14    me ask you, you don't have any criticism of him

           15    ordering those, yes or no?

           16          A.       No.

           17                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Wait a

           18          minute.  I can instruct him not to answer

           19          if the answer is going to be misleading.

           20          When you asked that question, he does

           21          have a criticism in that it was absent

           22          from the protocol.  So if that's his

           23          answer, I don't think it's --

           24    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           25          Q.       What other things do you believe

                                                               80



            1    that he should have ordered?

            2          A.       Well, given the characteristic

            3    appearance of the toxoplasmic retinitis, the

            4    toxoplasmosis PCR should have been ordered if

            5    there was still a question.  Frequently in this

            6    situation -- and I know I'm elaborating, but I

            7    think it's important.

            8          Q.       Go ahead.

            9          A.       Frequently in this situation,

           10    one will not need to do such a biopsy.  Rather

           11    just do empiric antibiotic treatment if it's

           12    indicated.  But if you're going to do a

           13    vitreous biopsy, it's standard of care with

           14    this type of appearance to order toxoplasmic

           15    PCR.

           16          Q.       And -- let me start again.  In

           17    the wording of your report -- I just want to

           18    read this sentence.  It is the second paragraph

           19    down right after the PCRs that I had mentioned.

           20                   It says, no PCR request for

           21    toxoplasmosis was documented.  Although, that

           22    would have certainly been appropriate and would

           23    have given critical information for diagnosis

           24    and management of this case.  Period.  I read

           25    that correctly, right?

                                                               81



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       And you're saying that is --

            3    that failing to do that, is it your testimony

            4    that that is a violation of the standard of

            5    care --

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       -- failing to order that?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Can you tell me what the results

           10    would have been had it been ordered?

           11          A.       It would have been positive.

           12          Q.       All right.  I want to go down

           13    and skip another -- down to the next paragraph.

           14    You would agree with me that Dr. Wang ordered

           15    the MRI in order to determine whether or not it

           16    had evidence of central nervous -- CNS lymphoma

           17    in the brain?

           18          A.       That apparently was his thought

           19    process at the time.

           20          Q.       Okay.  All right.  And then the

           21    next paragraph it says, on 6/16/16, prior to

           22    the disclosure of the results of the MRI, Dr.

           23    Wang administered an 800 microgram intravitreal

           24    dose of Methotrexate.  What is the basis for

           25    you saying that he did that prior to knowledge

                                                               82



            1    of the results of the MRI?

            2          A.       Well, it's a statement of fact.

            3          Q.       Okay.  I want to show you a

            4    couple of records that may have changed that

            5    for you.  Let me give you these exhibits.  Did

            6    you read Dr. Wang's testimony about these three

            7    pages?  I'm just going to describe this record

            8    and then I'm going to hand it to you.  This is

            9    Exhibit-13 and it consists of --

           10                   MR. PATTERSON:  Here counsel.

           11          Here is a copy of it.

           12                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Thank you.

           13                         - - -

           14                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-13 was

           15          marked for identification.)

           16                         - - -

           17    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           18          Q.       It consists of the two page

           19    report of the MRI imaging report that was done

           20    by Magnetic Imaging of Paris.  It also has page

           21    87, from Dr. Wang's records, that talks about

           22    the Methotrexate discussion he had with the

           23    patient before the Methotrexate injection.  And

           24    then it has page 88 of the records, which is

           25    Mr. Cook's signature on the consent form.  Let

                                                               83



            1    me show you these three.

            2          A.       Was that a question?

            3          Q.       No.  I just --

            4                   THE WITNESS:  Can you read that

            5          back.  What was -- did I -- I'm sorry.

            6    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            7          Q.       I said --

            8                   THE WITNESS:  When he said, did

            9          you read, can you just read that back.

           10                   MR. PATTERSON:  Just the very

           11          beginning.  I interrupted a question too

           12          to identify the document.

           13                   THE WITNESS:  What was said

           14          there?

           15                         - - -

           16                   (Whereupon, the court reporter

           17          read back the previous question.)

           18                         - - -

           19                   THE WITNESS:  Was that connected

           20          to those documents or was that a separate

           21          question?

           22    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           23          Q.       It was not a question.  I

           24    withdrew it because I wanted to explain this.

           25    I will re-ask the question about whether you

                                                               84



            1    read his testimony, but I wanted to --

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       -- identify what's in

            4    Exhibit-13.

            5          A.       What was the date of that MRI?

            6    The report there that you have in your hands.

            7          Q.       Well, that's what I want to hand

            8    you and show you so that you can tell me.  So

            9    let me ask questions about these documents.

           10    You have them in front of you now.  This first

           11    is the MRI that was done on June 15th on 2016,

           12    at 4:30 in the afternoon.  That's when it says

           13    that the exam was done.

           14          A.       Done.  Not read.

           15          Q.       I agree.  Then if you look at

           16    the report, it shows that it was dictated by

           17    Michael Hartman on 6/16 at 12:08 p.m.

           18          A.       But not electronically signed

           19    until 12:23.

           20          Q.       Not electronically signed until

           21    6/16 at 12:23 p.m., right?

           22          A.       And nowhere does it say when it

           23    was communicated to the doctor.

           24          Q.       Well, that's why I wanted to ask

           25    you if you read Dr. Wang's testimony about his

                                                               85



            1    visit with Mr. Cook on June 16.  Mr. Cook came

            2    to the Sherman Office and brought a CD with the

            3    images of the MRI on it.  Did you read that

            4    portion of the testimony?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Wait a

            7          minute.  Object to form.  Unless his

            8          question is, did you read that portion of

            9          the deposition.

           10    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           11          Q.       Did you read that?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       And Dr. Wang got the person who

           14    took the MRI on the phone and discussed his

           15    findings on the telephone.

           16                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           17          form.  I don't believe that's what the

           18          deposition said precisely, so...

           19                   THE WITNESS:  I don't have the

           20          deposition with me.  Is that documented

           21          in the medical record is what my question

           22          because --

           23                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Doctor,

           24          just to be clear, I don't want a question

           25          asked that would beg for a misleading

                                                               86



            1          answer.  My only objection is, if he's

            2          testifying about what was in the

            3          deposition, and I don't believe that's

            4          precisely what it is, then your answer

            5          would always be misleading because it's

            6          based on a false premise.

            7                   That said, he's entitled to ask

            8          questions and he can even say, that's

            9          what I think the deposition said or

           10          something like that, but I don't want to

           11          interfere with your answer.

           12                   THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

           13                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  I just want

           14          to make sure the premise has to be

           15          untainted.

           16    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           17          Q.       Do you remember him talking

           18    about in his deposition speaking with the

           19    radiologist who interpreted the MRI on the

           20    phone?

           21          A.       Not specifically.

           22          Q.       Okay.  When a report is not

           23    generated, it's not uncommon to call a

           24    radiologist and say, hey, I need a quick read

           25    on this or get your impressions before you do

                                                               87



            1    your final report.  That happens all the time,

            2    doesn't it?

            3          A.       It happens.  I'm not sure if it

            4    happens all the time.

            5          Q.       All right.  Okay.  And it shows

            6    that the report was completed at 12:08 p.m.

            7    That's when he dictated the end of the report.

            8    Do you see that?

            9                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Objection.

           10          Misleading.  It says edited at 12:23,

           11          which means it couldn't have been

           12          completed before it was edited.

           13    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           14          Q.       It was dictated.  I'm not

           15    talking about signing it or editing it, but it

           16    was dictated at 12:08 p.m.  Do you see that on

           17    that document?

           18          A.       Yes, I do.

           19          Q.       All right.  Now, look at the

           20    next page, which is page 87 of Dr. Wang's

           21    records.  He discusses the fact that he is

           22    having a conversation with Mr. Cook about his

           23    belief that this may be ocular lymphoma, and he

           24    is getting the inform consent for the patient

           25    to receive the Methotrexate injection in this

                                                               88



            1    note.  Do you agree with that?

            2                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

            3          form.

            4                   THE WITNESS:  Please ask the

            5          question again.

            6    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            7          Q.       Okay.  This note of Dr. Wang is

            8    explaining to the patient that normally we need

            9    a biopsy.  However, because his MRI was normal

           10    he wanted to go ahead and proceed with the

           11    Methotrexate injection in the right eye.

           12          A.       I'm reading it as saying, if the

           13    MRI is normal.  It does not say that the MRI is

           14    normal.

           15          Q.       Okay.

           16          A.       Am I reading that incorrectly?

           17    It's the word if.  If the MRI is normal.

           18          Q.       You're reading the words

           19    correctly, but the gist of the conversation

           20    between Dr. Wang and the patient was to

           21    understand the risks and benefits of the

           22    procedure, discuss the risks and benefits.

           23    Patient understands and elects to proceed.

           24                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           25          the form of the question.

                                                               89



            1    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            2          Q.       Do you see the time of this

            3    recommendation?

            4          A.       I'm sorry.  You're asking --

            5    what question are you asking?  I want to make

            6    sure that I'm answering the question that

            7    you're asking.  I'm not trying to be difficult.

            8          Q.       I understand.

            9          A.       I apologize.  Because this is

           10    critical.

           11          Q.       I agree.  Do you agree with me

           12    that Dr. Wang ordered the MRI to rule out CNS

           13    lymphoma in the brain?

           14          A.       It appears as if that would be

           15    the case.

           16          Q.       He ordered it back earlier in

           17    June because he wanted to know that result to

           18    determine future treatment; isn't that right?

           19          A.       That appears to be his thought

           20    process.

           21          Q.       This shows a discussion that was

           22    dictated at 12:12 p.m.  If 12:12 p.m. is after

           23    the conversation with the radiologist who

           24    dictated his report when he discussed with Dr.

           25    Wang, it makes perfect sense that that

                                                               90



            1    information was conveyed to Dr. Wang before the

            2    Methotrexate was injected, true?

            3          A.       I don't agree with that.

            4          Q.       Okay.

            5          A.       And I can give you reasons why

            6    if you would allow me to elaborate.  But if you

            7    don't want me to elaborate, I won't.

            8                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  You

            9          answered his question.

           10                   THE WITNESS:  Okay.

           11    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           12          Q.       So it's your testimony that

           13    despite the fact that Dr. Wang wanted to know

           14    the results before he injected the

           15    Methotrexate, he just disregarded and moved

           16    ahead without knowing those results?

           17          A.       It appears as if, based on the

           18    timestamps that we see here, that that would be

           19    the case.

           20                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Is this a

           21          good time for a break?

           22                   MR. PATTERSON:  Yeah.  If you

           23          need a break.

           24                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Yeah.

           25                   MR. PATTERSON:  Yeah.  Let's

                                                               91



            1          take a break.

            2                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  7:34 p.m.  We are

            3          off the record.

            4                         - - -

            5                   (Whereupon, a brief recess was

            6          taken.)

            7                         - - -

            8                   VIDEOGRAPHER:  7:42 p.m.  We're

            9          back on the record.

           10    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           11          Q.       I just want to ask a couple of

           12    questions.  I know you acknowledge that from

           13    time-to-time a physician may want to know the

           14    results of a MRI before the formal report is

           15    created.  And in those circumstances, it's not

           16    unusual for the physician who ordered the test

           17    to call the radiologist and say, can you give

           18    me a quick read on this because I want to know

           19    the results?  That happens, right?

           20          A.       I would imagine that it does.

           21          Q.       Have you ever done that?

           22                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Wait a

           23          minute.  Did you finish your answer?

           24                   THE WITNESS:  I think that's

           25          appropriate.  I imagine that it does.

                                                               92



            1          The answer is no.  I've not done it.

            2          Maybe when I was a fellow or an intern

            3          and I was in the hospital, you know,

            4          taking care of folks in a hospital

            5          setting.  I imagine I did, but we're

            6          going back into the 1980's.

            7    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            8          Q.       Have you ever called the lab

            9    that you sent PCRs to and say, I'm really

           10    anxious to learn what the results are of a

           11    study and get it told you to over the phone?

           12          A.       Not in private practice.  You

           13    know, when I was an intern, you know, when I

           14    was taking care of patients in a CCU setting or

           15    an ICU setting and we needed the results stat,

           16    you know, but this is different.

           17          Q.       Did you -- do you ever treat

           18    patients that live 60, 70 miles away from where

           19    you are?

           20          A.       I've treated patients from

           21    Canada that have come down and seen me to do

           22    surgery and et cetera.

           23          Q.       Have you ever asked them to go

           24    get a blood study or a lab test done at a local

           25    facility and have that information sent to you?

                                                               93



            1          A.       When I do surgery on patients,

            2    they have studies done at the local facility in

            3    due time before the surgery and we get those

            4    results back.

            5          Q.       Okay.  If those results are not

            6    yet back but they are just in process, wouldn't

            7    it be logical for you to call and say, hey, I

            8    need these results?

            9          A.       Seems like it would be logical.

           10          Q.       The MRI facility in Paris,

           11    Texas, do you know where that is in relation to

           12    where the plaintiff lived in Oklahoma?

           13          A.       I'm not familiar with the

           14    specific geography there.

           15          Q.       And do you know where that MRI

           16    facility is in reference to Dr. Wang's office?

           17          A.       Which MRI facility?  I'm sorry.

           18          Q.       Where he got his MRI done.  Do

           19    know how far away that is?

           20          A.       Well, the nice thing about -- I

           21    don't mean to be smart about the way I'm

           22    answering this in any way, shape, or form,

           23    please.  But the nice thing about having the

           24    internet or the, you know, electronic medical

           25    records and faxes and things like that is that

                                                               94



            1    it sort of eliminates the importance of the

            2    geographic distance.

            3          Q.       Yes, it does.  Doesn't it?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       And, in fact, Dr. Wang requested

            6    that it be faxed to him as soon as it was

            7    completed, didn't he?

            8          A.       Where should I see that?  What I

            9    see is a note for the -- that you handed me.

           10          Q.       Yes.  That's what I'm asking

           11    you.  Is --

           12          A.       I see that the radiologist did

           13    their final edited reading at 12:23 p.m., and I

           14    see a consent form that was signed at 12:13

           15    p.m.  So I'm seeing a consent form that was

           16    signed before the MRI was read.

           17          Q.       When was the initial report

           18    dictated, Doctor?

           19          A.       The unedited report?

           20          Q.       When was the dictated report?

           21          A.       Which is not the final report.

           22          Q.       When was it dictated by the

           23    radiologist?

           24                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Ken, please

           25          keep your decorum.

                                                               95



            1                   MR. PATTERSON:  Yeah.

            2    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            3          Q.       When was it dictated by the

            4    radiologist?

            5          A.       12:08.

            6          Q.       Okay.  All right.

            7          A.       But later edited official report

            8    12:23, patient signed consent, which implies

            9    that the risks, benefits, and alternatives

           10    discussion had already taken place at 12:13

           11    p.m.

           12          Q.       The deposition of Dr. Wang, page

           13    46, says, do you recall having a conversation

           14    with the radiologist who read the MRI?  Page

           15    46, line 12.  Answer, I do recall calling the

           16    facility and getting the report and

           17    information.  I don't remember, recall, who we

           18    spoke to at the time.  Question, you personally

           19    called?  Answer, I personally remember getting

           20    on the phone because we didn't have the results

           21    and I really needed them.  We needed a

           22    preliminary report.  Question, all right.  If

           23    the MRI was negative, how did that affect your

           24    decision making?  Was the next question.  And

           25    the answer, well, it's like I mentioned before.

                                                               96



            1    It could be CNS lymphoma that goes into the eye

            2    or can it be eye -- goes into the brain.  So

            3    since it's not in the brain, that didn't give

            4    us any leads to go on.  So it didn't eliminate,

            5    unfortunately, CNS lymphoma.  It would have

            6    been great because then we would have figured

            7    it out that way.  So it still left two

            8    diagnostic possibilities on the table.  Out of

            9    highest and most serious was still lymphoma.

           10    When you look at the severity, lymphoma and the

           11    clinical appearance was still the highest.

           12                   That testimony shows that he had

           13    the preliminary readings given to him over the

           14    phone before he did the injection, doesn't it?

           19          Q.       Okay.

           20          A.       I'm sorry.

           21          Q.       All right.

           22          A.       And I'm still unclear as to why

           23    systemic treatment wasn't opted initially if he

           24    was so concerned about systemic lymphoma even

           25    in the face of a negative MRI.

            3          Q.       The language that you are

            4    focusing on on the report says the final and

            5    edited report and some at 12:23.  But Dr. Wang

            6    remembers discussing the preliminary report,

            7    which was dictated before 12:13 at 2:08,

            8    correct?

           16                   MR. PATTERSON:  Did I say the

           17          times wrong?

           18                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  No.  You're

           19          making an assumption based on your

           20          client's credibility in a deposition you

           21          read.  That's not an appropriate

           22          hypothetical.  My client said I did

           23          everything right.  Does that mean

           24          everything is right?  The answer would be

           25          whatever it is.  It's like assuming all

            1          of your problems away.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  Gotcha.  Okay.

            3          That's fine.  Sidebar.

            4                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  I'm not

            5          trying to interrupt.  You asked me.

            6                   MR. PATTERSON:  I know.

            7    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            8          Q.       So it is still your opinion that

            9    Dr. Wang injected the Methotrexate before he

           10    knew anything about the results of the MRI?  Is

           11    that your testimony?

           12          A.       From the medical record that I

           13    see here, which is the only thing I can go by

           14    and the times because I wasn't in the room,

           15    understanding that we're discussing an issue

           16    that involves an incorrect diagnosis and an

           17    incorrect medication for a classic typical

           18    picture of a different diagnosis, this is all I

           19    can go by.

           20          Q.       The report -- I'm looking for

           21    your report.  Your report states that 800

           22    micrograms intravitreal dose of Methotrexate

           23    quote, twice the standard dosage prepared by

           24    Stephanie Menchaca according to the notes.  Is

           25    it -- where does it say the amount of

                                                               99



            1    medication that was injected into Mr. Cook's

            2    eye?

            3          A.       In the note that you just handed

            4    me, actually, sir (indicating).  800

            5    micrograms.

            6          Q.       All right.  Let me show you --

            7                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Is that

            8          Exhibit-13?

            9    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           10          Q.       What page?  Is it Bates stamped

           11    at the bottom of that page?

           12          A.       6 out of 6.

           13          Q.       No.  This little Bates stamp.

           14    It's page 87.

           15          A.       Okay.

           16          Q.       Okay.  I'm going to show you

           17    page 76, which is the preceding page of that.

           18    It says treatment notes, patient had uneventful

           19    intravitreal injection of 800 micrograms

           20    Methotrexate, 800 micrograms.  The patient

           21    tolerated the procedure well.  Where does it

           22    say the amount of fluid that was injected into

           23    the eye?  It does not, does it?

           24          A.       In material.

           25          Q.       Well, it is material.  Isn't it,

                                                              100



            1    Doctor?

            2          A.       Not at all.

            3          Q.       If .05 cc's was injected into

            4    the patient's eye, then only 400 micrograms of

            5    Methotrexate would have be delivered; isn't

            6    that correct?

            7          A.       No.  That's incorrect.

            8          Q.       How is that incorrect?

            9          A.       We report dosage of medication.

           10    Total dosage is much more important, as I

           11    eluded to earlier, rather than volume.  800

           12    micrograms was the amount of medication that

           13    was given.  You can take penicillin, for

           14    instance, in a certain amount in a tablet and

           15    it comes in various tablets.  The important

           16    thing is not how many tablets you've taken to

           17    ingest a given amount of penicillin, but the

           18    important thing is how much penicillin you have

           19    actually taken.  And you can take different

           20    amounts of penicillin based on different tablet

           21    sizes that are available.  And the of efficacy

           22    of that penicillin will not be dependent upon

           23    the number of tablets you happen to ingest of

           24    either, you know, 250 milligrams, 500

           25    milligrams or whatever it happens to be.  The

                                                              101



            1    efficacy will be based upon the dosage.  And so

            2    it's the dosage rather than the volume.

            3                   He's indicated on three

            4    occasions on this page 86 of injecting 800

            5    micrograms of Methotrexate, and then he

            6    duplicates it here.  Intravitreal injection of

            7    800 micrograms of Methotrexate, 800 micrograms.

            8    And then on the next page, amount, 800

            9    micrograms.  So it's quite clear to me after

           10    reading this that the dosage injected was in

           11    fact 800 micrograms.

           12    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           13          Q.       Is that the sole basis of your

           14    belief that 800 micrograms was injected?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       If, and I want you to assume

           17    this set of facts.  Okay?  Assume it to be true

           18    even though you may disagree with it.  But Dr.

           19    Wang had a 800 microgram per .1 cc

           20    concentration of Methotrexate and he injected

           21    .05 cc's of that into Mr. Cook's eye.  The

           22    dosage that would have been delivered to the

           23    eye would be 400 micrograms, right?

           24          A.       You could give me any number of

           25    dilutions and we could talk all night about

                                                              102



            1    different concentrations and different

            2    dilutions.  What I like to point out is exactly

            3    what was given.

            4          Q.       Well, the quantity is not

            5    specified.  The concentration is specified.

            6          A.       The concentration is not

            7    specified.

            8          Q.       The --

            9          A.       The dosage is specified.

           10    Concentration is dose per volume.

           11          Q.       Okay.  Would you answer my --

           12          A.       I'm answering it.  I'm sorry.

           13    The concentration is not specified.  The dose

           14    is specified.  The dose is the most important.

           15          Q.       Okay.  I would like for you now

           16    to answer my question.

           17                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           18          the form and the sidebar.

           19    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           20          Q.       I would like for you to answer

           21    this question.  I would like for you to assume

           22    for me that Dr. Wang injected only .05 cc's of

           23    a 800 microgram concentration per .1 cc of

           24    Methotrexate.  If he did that, he would have

           25    only injected 400 micrograms of Methotrexate

                                                              103



            1    into Mr. Cook's eye; isn't that right?

            2          A.       Where do you see that in the

            3    medical record?

            4          Q.       I'm asking you to assume for me

            5    that Dr. Wang had a syringe that had a

            6    concentration of 800 micrograms of Methotrexate

            7    per .1 cc and that when that was handed to him

            8    he wasted everything except .05 cc's of that

            9    800 microgram concentration of Methotrexate.

           10    Assuming that and assuming he injected that

           11    into Mr. Cook's eye, Mr. Cook would have only

           12    received 400 micrograms of Methotrexate; isn't

           13    that correct?

           14                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           15          form.

           16                   THE WITNESS:  Sir, I was asked

           17          to review the medical records and there

           18          is nowhere in the medical records that

           19          hypothetical situation that you're just

           20          bringing up.  As an expert witness, I was

           21          expected, I believe, to review the

           22          records that exist, not some type of

           23          hypothetical dosage or concentration.

           24                   We could discuss hypotheticals

           25          at infinitum.  You can do the math, just

                                                              104



            1          like I can do math in terms of dilutions.

            2          You don't need me for that.  That's not

            3          why you're asking me to come here

            4          tonight.  I'm here to look at the medical

            5          records that exist.  I'm not trying to be

            6          smart in my answer.  We can all do math.

            7          You're essentially asking me what's 800

            8          divided by 2.  And I say, well, we all

            9          know what 800 divided by 2 is.  I don't

           10          see that as -- in the medical records.

           11                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object,

           12          nonresponsive.

           13                   THE WITNESS:  Okay.

           14    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           15          Q.       I just want you to ask -- it is

           16    appropriate for me to ask hypothetical facts

           17    and ask your opinion based on a hypothetical.

           18    I'm asking you to assume it to be true.  I know

           19    you disagree with it.  I know you think it's

           20    not --

           21          A.       It's not that I disagree with

           22    it, sir.  It's just that I don't see it

           23    anywhere in the medical record.  I have to say

           24    that if that was the case, absolutely we would

           25    have 400 micrograms.  I just don't see it

                                                              105



            1    anywhere.  And, in fact, the opposite.  It's

            2    documented on multiple occasions that he

            3    injected 800 micrograms, which is twice the

            4    standard dose and is toxic.

            5                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object,

            6          nonresponsive.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  Okay.

            8    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            9          Q.       Would you agree with this, just

           10    to do the math for me, that a 800 microgram per

           11    .1 cc concentration of Methotrexate, if .05 cc

           12    is injected, that only delivers 400 micrograms

           13    of Methotrexate through the injection.  Did I

           14    do the math correctly?

           15          A.       800 divided by 2 is 400.

           16          Q.       All right.

           17          A.       Is that what you're asking?  Is

           18    800 divided by 2, 400?  And we all have to say

           19    at this table, 800 divided by 2 is 400.

           20          Q.       My question is slightly

           21    different.  My question is slightly different.

           22    .05 cc's of 800 micrograms per .1 cc of

           23    Methotrexate, if that is injected, only .05

           24    only delivers 400 micrograms of Methotrexate?

            3          Q.       True?

            5          objection.

            6    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            7          Q.       So you refuse to answer that

            8    question?

            9          A.       I've answered it before, and

           10    I'll continue to answer.  If you inject half of

           11    800, you're injecting 400.  800 divided by 2 is

           12    400.  I don't know how else to say that other

           13    than I'm trying to answer your question.

           14          Q.       It would not be unreasonable for

           15    a physician who wants to minimize any potential

           16    complaint of discomfort when in doing a

           17    intravitreal injection to use .05 as a opposed

           18    to .1, would it?

           19                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           20          form.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  No.  I disagree

           22          with that.

           23    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           24          Q.       It would be unreasonable to do

           25    that?

            1          A.       It would be unreasonable if what

            2    you wanted to inject needed to be injected in

            3    .1.

            4          Q.       Not my question.

            5          A.       Okay.

            6          Q.       If a physician has a routine and

            7    a custom and a practice of injecting .05 of any

            8    intraocular injection in order to minimize or

            9    eliminate any discomfort which may be created

           10    by injecting .1 cc, that would be a reasonable

           11    thing for that physician to do?

           12                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           13          form.

           14                   THE WITNESS:  I disagree.

           15    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           16          Q.       Okay.  What was the mechanism of

           17    injury of the Methotrexate to Mr. Cook's eye in

           18    your opinion?

           19          A.       In my opinion, there could have

           20    been several different mechanisms.  Certainly,

           21    the reason why 400 has been given since decades

           22    instead of 800 is because 400 is efficacious

           23    and we try to avoid toxicity.  In my opinion,

           24    there could have been a couple of different

           25    mechanisms.  Number one could be that there

                                                              108



            1    would be a difference in the osmolality or

            2    osmolarity of the solution at the level of the

            3    retina and that would be damaging to the cells.

            4    It's well-known that if a substance is injected

            5    in the eye that has a vary high osmolarity, it

            6    damages the cells and can cause a toxic

            7    reaction.

            8                   Alternatively, there are other

            9    possible explanations.  But just like you don't

           10    say if you hit somebody in the head with a

           11    hammer, why do you think they are hurt?  We

           12    don't need scientific evidence to know that if

           13    you inject twice the dose of a chemotherapeutic

           14    agent, why would that be harmful to a patient.

           15          Q.       So I'm getting your answer --

           16    object, nonresponsive to the extent that it was

           17    -- but it's your testimony that because you

           18    believe 800 micrograms was injected -- no.  Let

           19    me just stop that.  Let me just make it real

           20    tight.

           21                   You believe that the toxic

           22    reaction in Mr. Cook's eye was a difference

           23    created in the osmolarity at the level of the

           24    retina, which was damaging to the cells of the

           25    retina?

                                                              109



            1          A.       If you read back my answer,

            2    you'll see that I said there are a number of

            3    possible mechanisms.

            4          Q.       And that's the only one that you

            5    said.

            6          A.       No.  I said that there were a

            7    number of possible ones.

            8          Q.       But give me the number.  Give me

            9    the possibilities because I want to write them

           10    down.  Did I get one of them correct?

           11          A.       Yes.  And that would be my

           12    leading one.

           13          Q.       Okay.  The difference in

           14    osmolarity at the level of the retina that

           15    caused damage to the cells of the retina.

           16          A.       That would be one.

           17          Q.       Okay.  What's another?

           18          A.       Secondly, it's a

           19    chemotherapeutic agent that interferes with

           20    cellular proliferation and normal cellular

           21    function.  We're injecting it at twice normal

           22    levels.  So it not only attacks abnormal cells,

           23    but it attacks the normal retinal cells, which

           24    can cause a hemorrhagic retinopathy,

           25    hemorrhagic retinitis.

                                                              110



            1                   Another mechanism is that it

            2    caused the toxoplasmosis to proliferate because

            3    the local environment was -- you didn't have

            4    any immune system in the local environment and

            5    it could have caused the toxoplasmosis to

            6    proliferate.  But my main idea would be the

            7    local chemical therapy.

            8          Q.       Okay.

            9          A.       In any case, it was twice the

           10    normal dosage and it was toxic to the retina.

           11          Q.       Your opinions are based on the

           12    assumption that it was twice the normal dosage.

           13    That it was in fact 800 micrograms and not 400

           14    micrograms, true?

           15          A.       It would certainly be the case.

           16          Q.       Okay.  In the literature that

           17    you sited --

           18          A.       I'm sorry.  What literature did

           19    I say?

           20          Q.       In the literature that you

           21    referenced in your report.  The studies that

           22    were down at the end of your report.  None of

           23    these articles relating to use of Methotrexate

           24    in treating intraocular lymphoma reported any

           25    of these three as the side effects or reactions

                                                              111



            1    to the dosage of Methotrexate in those

            2    articles, true?

            3          A.       I disagree.

            4          Q.       Okay.  Wasn't the main side

            5    effect of Methotrexate corneal epithelium

            6    problems?

            7          A.       No.

            8          Q.       What other problems were the

            9    side effects?

           10          A.       Side effects that have been

           11    reported are maculopathy.  Retinal pigment

           12    epithelium toxicity is a chronic type of thing.

           13    But you have to know that -- this is important

           14    -- I'm elaborating, but this very important.

           15    All of these articles deal with normal dosages,

           16    400 micrograms of Methotrexate.  None of these

           17    articles deal with what happens if we inject

           18    800 because 800 has never been inject on a

           19    single dose, ever been reported.

           20                   This is regardless of the fact

           21    that we're having all of this discussion over

           22    injecting an incorrect drug for an incorrect

           23    diagnosis, which is a shame.  But we're having

           24    all this discussion when if the diagnosis of

           25    typical toxoplasmic retinitis was made, we

                                                              112



            1    wouldn't be having this discussion.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

            3    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            4          Q.       You are of the opinion that this

            5    reaction of the Methotrexate was immediate; is

            6    that right?

            7          A.       What is your definition of

            8    immediate?

            9          Q.       Within a day.

           10          A.       I'm going by the medical records

           11    and the medical records say that, yes.

           12          Q.       The medical records state it

           13    several different ways, don't they?

           14          A.       The medical record that I'm

           15    referring to is the telephone conversation that

           16    the patient said the vision in the right eye

           17    had been dark since 6/16.

           18          Q.       All right.  Did you look at that

           19    phone call in the record when you included that

           20    in your report?

           21          A.       I'm sorry.  What do you mean by

           22    that question?  What did I look at it?

           23          Q.       Yeah.

           24          A.       I included it in my report

           25    because I looked at it.  I don't know if that

                                                              113



            1    answers the question appropriately.

            2          Q.       Did you read it carefully, I

            3    guess, is my question.

            4          A.       Well, I like to think that I

            5    read things carefully.  Again, I'm biased in

            6    that regard.

            7                   MR. PATTERSON:  I'm going to

            8          mark as Exhibit-9 --

            9                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Did we mark

           10          page 87, Ken?  The one that has the

           11          Methotrexate.

           12                   THE WITNESS:  That's 86.

           13                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  I'm sorry.

           14          86.

           15                   THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

           16                   MR. PATTERSON:  Let me mark this

           17          one so that we have it.  I'll mark it 10.

           18          This is page 86 and it's marked as

           19          Exhibit-10 now.

           20                          - - -

           21                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-9 through 11

           22          were marked for identification.)

           23                         - - -

           24                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  The reason

           25          I ask is because I'm going to try and

            1          follow your...

            2    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            3          Q.       I'm going to show you Exhibit-9

            4    and 11, if I can, Doctor.  This is Exhibit-9

            5    and this is Exhibit-11.  Exhibit-9 reports a

            6    conversation that occurred with the wife of the

            7    patient, Chiquita --

            8          A.       I'm sorry.  Number 9?

            9          Q.       Exhibit-9.

           10          A.       Number 9.  Patient called.  It

           11    says patient states.

           12          Q.       It says patient's wife, Chiquita

           13    McGee.

           14          A.       Oh, I'm sorry.  I was reading

           15    the second paragraph where it says patient

           16    states that vision --

           17          Q.       Let's read the whole thing.

           18    Okay?

           19          A.       Okay.

           20          Q.       Because we'll find what the

           21    patient stated.  Patient wife, Chiquita McGee,

           22    mentioned patient has experienced being unable

           23    to see out of, I'm going say right eye, and

           24    experienced the same symptom in left eye.  Then

           25    they talk about scheduling.  Then the next

                                                              115



            1    sentence, I spoke with Leann, who is the

            2    patient's daughter, and informed her wife

            3    mentioned that he had surgery this month and

            4    she is very concerned in regards to OU.

            5    Occular -- what does OU mean?

            6          A.       Both eyes.

            7          Q.       Both eyes.  Then it says,

            8    comment, patient called, see notes.  No further

            9    action required.  Patient states OD visual

           10    acuity, that his right eye visual acuity, has

           11    been dark since 6/16.  Now that is a summary of

           12    the phone call that occurred with the wife and

           13    the daughter, true?

           14          A.       No.  That's the patient states

           15    that the vision has been dark since 6/16, not

           16    the wife or the daughter.

           17          Q.       Okay.  When the patient came in

           18    the following day, what is the history that the

           19    patient gave on page 93, which is Exhibit-11?

           20          A.       That wasn't the following day.

           21          Q.       It was the visit that was

           22    discussed.  What did the patient say when he

           23    was in-person?

           24          A.       That his vision in the right eye

           25    three days after his Methotrexate injection.

                                                              116



            1          Q.       Would you expect a Methotrexate

            2    toxic reaction to occur three days after the

            3    injection?  That is --

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       -- is the temporal relationship

            6    --

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       -- of any significance to you at

            9    all?

           10          A.       This is a very important point

           11    you're bringing out because the patient was

           12    given the medication.  The patient was seeing

           13    20/60 before he was given the injection and

           14    immediately thereafter in the next visit the

           15    vision dropped not to 2100, not to 2200, not to

           16    2400, but to light perception.  It was

           17    dramatic.  It was a dramatic decrease in

           18    vision.  You're asking me -- and I know I'm

           19    expounding on this -- but this is the crux of

           20    the whole thing.

           21                   The patient was given twice the

           22    normal dosage of a medication and then

           23    experienced profound vision loss right after

           24    that.  The appearance of the retina was

           25    distinctly different than that seen with the

                                                              117



            1    typical toxoplasmic retinitis that he had.  It

            2    was hemorrhagic and it was defuse whitening of

            3    the retina with profound vision loss.

            4          Q.       Was it a proliferation of the

            5    toxoplasmosis?

            6          A.       It's probably -- you know,

            7    again, you asked me about what could that have

            8    been.  And I think the leading thing is

            9    toxicity from the Methotrexate.  I think that

           10    regardless of what it was, the patient was

           11    given an inappropriate dosage and had immediate

           12    vision loss.  It was -- it's almost too simple

           13    to ignore, isn't it?

           14                   You have a patient, you give

           15    them an incorrect dosage of a medication, and

           16    then the next thing you know they are blind in

           17    that eye.  I know it sounds simplistic, but the

           18    time course is just too straightforward and

           19    it's a shame that it occurred.

           20          Q.       Can vision loss also occur

           21    because of a lack of profusion to the optic

           22    nerve?

           23          A.       Vision loss can occur from a

           24    number of different things.  But the answer to

           25    your question is, yes, amongst a number of

                                                              118



            1    different disorders that we know of that can

            2    cause vision loss.

            3          Q.       The -- let's talk a second about

            4    the left eye for a moment, and then we'll come

            5    back to where we are.  You with me?

            6          A.       I'm still trying to understand

            7    why you asked me that question about lack of

            8    profusion.

            9          Q.       Well, do you know why Mr. Cook

           10    went to the Paris Hospital on 6/20?

           11          A.       He had hypotension.

           12          Q.       Okay.  And what was it causing?

           13          A.       I didn't review the records of

           14    the Paris Hospital.

           15          Q.       Okay.

           16          A.       But hypotension was, I think,

           17    the main reason.

           18          Q.       Okay.  And hypotension -- how

           19    severe was the hypotension?

           20          A.       I'm not sure, but if you're

           21    trying to tie together the hypotension with the

           22    hemorrhagic retinopathy, you're going in the

           23    wrong direction because --

           24          Q.       Object.  Nonresponsive, Doctor.

           25                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Wait a

                                                              119



            1          minute.  Wow, wow.

            2                   THE WITNESS:  Can I explain?

            3    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            4          Q.       Sure.  You can explain.  I

            5    object, nonresponsive.  It goes question and

            6    answer, Doctor.  He's going to have a chance to

            7    ask questions.

            8          A.       But I wanted to try to respond

            9    to your --

           10                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Doctor,

           11          hold on a second.  Here's what happened,

           12          you're both guilty.  You guys were having

           13          a little bit of a discussion.

           14                   MR. PATTERSON:  Okay.

           15                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Let's just

           16          backup.

           17                   MR. PATTERSON:  Okay.

           18                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  You can't

           19          ask him, do you know something and then

           20          he in turns answer it and then you guys

           21          get into a quarrel about it and then say

           22          I'm going to object to your part of it.

           23                   MR. PATTERSON:  All right.

           24                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  You're both

           25          sinners in this case.

                                                              120



            1                   THE WITNESS:  I apologize.

            2                   MR. PATTERSON:  I apologize too

            3          and I appreciate your cautioning.

            4    BY MR. PATTERSON:

            5          Q.       So let's -- I just like for you

            6    to answer my questions.  You didn't review the

            7    Paris records, right?

            8          A.       No.  I wasn't given those

            9    records to review that I recall.

           10          Q.       Do you know what degree of lack

           11    of profusion to the brain it takes to cause a

           12    person to faint and fall down based upon

           13    rising, getting up?

           14          A.       I would like a clarification.

           15    Are you talking about that with regard to this

           16    specific case or just a theoretical

           17    hypothetical case?

           18          Q.       Theoretically.  Theoretically.

           19    Do you have an answer theoretically?

           20          A.       The question again.

           21          Q.       How low does the blood pressure

           22    have to get before someone loses consciousness?

           23          A.       There is no set blood pressure

           24    because elasticity of arterials vary.  But I

           25    can tell you you wouldn't get hemorrhages if

                                                              121



            1    you didn't have blood flow to the retina.  He

            2    had a hemorrhagic retinopathy and you can't get

            3    hemorrhages if you don't have blood in the

            4    retina.  So that excludes the possibility of

            5    the hypotension causing the vision loss in

            6    Mr. Cook's right eye.

            7          Q.       Do you agree that someone can

            8    have bilateral loss of vision due to a low

            9    profusion of the optic nerve?

           10          A.       Yes.  But you wouldn't have a

           11    hemorrhagic retinopathy in that case.

           12          Q.       How often in your practice,

           13    Doctor, have you treated bilateral

           14    toxoplasmosis?

           15          A.       I would say that it happens

           16    about 20 percent of the cases.

           17          Q.       A statement made by Dr. Wang in

           18    his record says, denies cats.  That shows that

           19    he's thinking about a possibility of

           20    toxoplasmosis, doesn't it?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       Did you see anything in the

           23    records that revealed where the source of John

           24    Cook's toxoplasmosis was, came from?

           25          A.       No.

                                                              122



            1          Q.       The left eye of Mr. Cook had

            2    problems from the time that he started

            3    treatment at Texas Retina, but not to the

            4    degree that it was seen in the right eye.

            5          A.       It was asymmetric involvement,

            6    yes.

            7          Q.       And is it your belief that the

            8    toxoplasmosis that was in Mr. Cook's right eye

            9    was the same type of toxoplasmosis that he

           10    experienced in his left eye?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       Do you agree that the

           13    toxoplasmosis in his left eye was treated

           14    appropriately and early based in comparison to

           15    the toxoplasmosis in his right eye?

           16          A.       The dosages that were used of

           17    the medications, I would have not done the same

           18    dosages as I indicated in my report, but at

           19    least --

           20          Q.       So you're critical of --

           21                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Let him

           22          finish.

           23                   MR. PATTERSON:  Okay.  Sorry.

           24    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           25          Q.       Go ahead.

                                                              123



            1          A.       But at least it was treated and

            2    it was inactive by the time they did the

            3    surgery in the left eye on April the 10, 2017.

            4          Q.       So are you critical of the

            5    physicians at UT Southwestern because they

            6    didn't use the medications that you would have

            7    used?

            8          A.       Am I critical?  You know, I

            9    think that they did what they could do.  They

           10    apparently encountered some side effects, or

           11    Mr. Cook encountered some side effects, and I

           12    think that they did what they could do and

           13    treated the way they thought they could treat.

           14    Wondering why they didn't use Bactrim DS, which

           15    has been shown to be, you know, just as

           16    effective and you don't have to use the folic

           17    acid and maybe could have spared the

           18    Clindamycin and the Pyrimethamine.  But, you

           19    know, at least it was treated and it was

           20    rendered inactive by the time they did the

           21    surgery on April the 10th of 2017.

           22          Q.       But ultimately, Mr. Cook had a

           23    loss of significant vision in his left eye

           24    secondary to the toxoplasmosis?

           25          A.       Not secondary to the

                                                              124



            1    toxoplasmosis in my opinion.

            2          Q.       It was secondary to the surgery

            3    that he had?

            4          A.       Without saying that it was

            5    incompetent surgery, because I don't think it

            6    was, but we all know that there are risks

            7    involved when you do surgery.  They did surgery

            8    to try to remove the vitreous opacities.  I was

            9    looking in the records to see if I could find a

           10    risk, benefit, alternative discussion and I was

           11    having trouble finding that.  Certainly, if you

           12    have a monocular patient, you have to treat it

           13    very seriously and I'm generally pretty

           14    conservative when it comes to that.  Especially

           15    if the patient is monocular.

           16                   Apparently, they went ahead to

           17    try to remove the residual inflammatory debris

           18    in the vitreous.  There was no active

           19    retinitis.  The last note that I saw in the

           20    left eye, which I believe was in January for

           21    some reason, the retina was attached.  There

           22    was no active retinitis and there was just

           23    debris in the gel.  They did the surgery.  A

           24    retinal detachment ensued, which they needed to

           25    treat with the silicone oil.  There was some

                                                              125



            1    problems with the silicone afterwards.

            2                   They had to do a laser in the

            3    office and then they finally did the silicone

            4    oil exchange and repaired a recurrent retinal

            5    detachment and the visual acuity was left at 20

            6    over 200, unfortunately, in the left eye.  The

            7    proximate cause of that was not active

            8    retinitis from the toxoplasmosis, which was

            9    inactive.

           10          Q.       But the toxoplasmosis had caused

           11    the inflammation and debris that they wanted to

           12    remove?

           13          A.       Yes.  But the question is, did

           14    they need to go in and remove the debris or

           15    could they have just waited.  There certainly

           16    wasn't any emergency.  I didn't even see in the

           17    notes where it was important for them to do

           18    that or they -- I didn't see in any of the

           19    notes that they felt it was an important thing

           20    to do and --

           21          Q.       But their decision to proceed

           22    was to remove the inflammation debris that had

           23    been left by the resolved toxoplasmosis?

           24          A.       Was it?  I didn't see any of

           25    that documented in the chart.

            1          Q.       I'm not -- I'm saying, according

            2    to your testimony even though the toxoplasmosis

            3    was inactive, as you have said, there was still

            4    debris that they wanted to remove in order to

            5    hopefully improve the vision of Mr. Cook?

            6          A.       I can't say that because I

            7    didn't read that in the record.

            8          Q.       Well, you just -- what did you

            9    mean then when you stated they went in to clean

           10    out the debris?  Where did the debris come from

           11    that they chose to clean out?

           12                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Object to

           13          form.

           14                   THE WITNESS:  Did I say that

           15          they went in to clean out the debris any

           16          time?  I said they did the vitrectomy.

           17    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           18          Q.       Well --

           19          A.       I can't find in the medical

           20    records the reason for their surgery.  Did you

           21    -- did I miss something?

           22          Q.       No.  I heard you say that they

           23    went in to clean out and I'm asking what did

           24    they clean out?

           25          A.       I don't know if they did.

            1          Q.       Okay.  Do you know why they did

            2    the vitrectomy?

            3          A.       It was not documented in the

            4    medical records.

            5          Q.       Okay.  All right.

            6          A.       I wish it was.  It would have

            7    been easier for me to understand.

            8                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

            9          Let me look over my notes, and I think

           10          I'm about to wrap it up so give me about

           11          five minutes and I will -- we'll go off

           12          the record and I'll look over my notes.

           13                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Do you want

           14          us to leave the room?

           23    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           24          Q.       We took a short break off the

           25    record.  Are you ready to continue?

                                                              128



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       Did you have an opportunity to

            3    read Dr. Yee's report of his analysis of this

            4    case?

            5          A.       Yes.  Which one?  The -- yes, I

            6    did.

            7          Q.       Did you take any notes about it

            8    or do you have any --

            9          A.       No.  I have no notes.

           10          Q.       -- quarrels with it that you can

           11    recall?

           12          A.       Oh, yeah.  I didn't agree with

           13    some of the things that he said there.  When he

           14    said that it was atypical toxoplasmosis, I

           15    thought it was a very typical headlight in the

           16    fog as I indicated earlier.  That was one.

           17                   The other was the fact that he

           18    wasn't sure that the 800 microgram dosage was

           19    used.  It was obviously used.  No other dosage

           20    other than 800 micrograms was used.

           21          Q.       Well --

           22          A.       And there is no evidence that

           23    anything else other than 800 micrograms was

           24    used.  It was stated on multiple occasions and

           25    multiple pages that 800 micrograms was used.

                                                              129



            1    And he said that that was done in some of the

            2    earlier studies.  I couldn't find a single

            3    study that said 800 micrograms was used.  So I

            4    disagree with that.

            5          Q.       It's the -- as I read your

            6    report, the main issue that you have a quarrel

            7    with is the dosage of 800 micrograms that you

            8    believe was given, true?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       And that is -- you made clear

           11    tonight in your testimony?

           12          A.       It's one thing to make a

           13    misdiagnosis.  It's another thing to give a

           14    toxic injection of a medication that blinds an

           15    eye.  If he had given the normal dosage,

           16    perhaps that would not have occurred, but --

           17          Q.       So you do agree that if it had

           18    been 400 micrograms this would likely have not

           19    occurred?

           20          A.       I'm not even certain about that

           21    because of the immunosuppression that could

           22    have caused the toxoplasmosis to proliferate in

           23    an uncontrolled fashion.  But it's an

           24    unfortunate situation.

           25          Q.       Have you understood my

                                                              130



            1    questions?

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       Or let me know when you didn't

            4    understand them?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       And although I've had to make

            7    some objections, have I been courteous to you?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Did I ever prevent you or cut

           10    you off where you were unable to answer a

           11    question as you wanted to answer the question?

           12          A.       No.

           13          Q.       Then I --

           14          A.       And I thank you for that.

           18          Q.       Okay.  Dr. Colucciello, I

           19    represent Mr. Cook and prior to yesterday had

           20    you and I ever met?

           21          A.       No.

           22          Q.       Had we ever spoken or

           23    corresponded to the best of your knowledge?

           24          A.       No.

           25          Q.       Do we know any of the same

                                                              131



            1    people?

            2          A.       No.

            3          Q.       To the best of your knowledge,

            4    did me mail, text, or otherwise communicate?

            5          A.       No.

            6          Q.       You've been asked to provide

            7    expert testimony today about the facts

            8    underlying the dispute; is that correct?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       And was it important for you to

           11    be objective?

           14                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           15    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           16          Q.       Was it important for you to come

           17    into this and be independent in your

           18    processing?

            1          Q.       -- in favor of one or the other?

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       Okay.  Why was it important for

            4    you to be fair?

            5          A.       Because it's important that we

            6    look at the case objectively.  When we're

            7    evaluating any particular case, and as I said

            8    from the outset with Mr. Akins, I said I would

            9    just take a look at the case and I would let

           10    him know what my feelings were one way or the

           11    other.

           12          Q.       Getting pleasure in criticizing

           13    Dr. Wang's performance?

           14          A.       No.

           15          Q.       And in fact, you've been an

           16    expert witness before or been asked to review

           17    cases before, correct?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       And by far, that's been on

           20    behalf of defendants; is that correct?

           24          Q.       Let me ask it has this way, has

           25    most of your work been done on behalf of

                                                              133



            1    defendants?

            2          A.       As I explained before, I don't

            3    have the exact statistics, but it's been about

            4    90 percent defendant and maybe ten percent for

            5    the patient.

            6          Q.       In connection with the notion

            7    that you should be objective, did you know

            8    Mr. Cook or know of Mr. Cook prior to

            9    undertaking this representation?

           10          A.       No.

           11          Q.       Did you know Kelly Atkins?

           12          A.       No.

           13          Q.       Did you know anyone that he knew

           14    to the best of your knowledge?

           15          A.       No.

           16          Q.       Did you know Dr. Wang?

           17          A.       No.

           18          Q.       Did you know Dr. Yee?

           19          A.       No.

           20          Q.       Did you share business with

           21    them?

           22          A.       No.

           23          Q.       Did you send patients to them?

           24          A.       No.

           25          Q.       Did you guys go to seminars

                                                              134



            1    together?

            2          A.       We were in the same meetings,

            3    but I didn't communicate with them.

            4          Q.       Would you know what they looked

            5    like if you saw them?

            6          A.       No, I wouldn't.

            7          Q.       Do any papers together?

            8          A.       No.

            9          Q.       You're not social with them at

           10    all?

           11          A.       No.

           12          Q.       Were you able to formulate

           13    opinions in this case?

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       Before we get those opinions, I

           16    need to make sure that you're qualified to

           17    provide those opinions, and I'm not trying to

           18    be insulting when I say that.  But what I need

           19    to do is to make sure that you're qualified.

           20    Do you understand?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       And so what I would like to do

           23    is start with your educational background.  I

           24    understand, for example, that you have actually

           25    been on faculty at the University of Penn.

                                                              135



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       And in fact, currently you're a

            3    clinical associate with the University of Penn?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       Have you provided instruction at

            6    that university?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       Now, let me turn it over to you

            9    and I want you to tell us why you believe

           10    you're qualified to testify in this case about

           11    toxoplasmosis, its treatment and its diagnosis,

           12    and lymphoma, and its treatment and diagnosis,

           13    and et cetera, if you could.

           14          A.       So I've been a practicing

           15    medical surgical retinal consultant since I

           16    completed my two year medical surgical retina

           17    fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania in

           18    1992.  Subsequent to that, for a number of

           19    years, I was an instructor on staff at the

           20    University of Pennsylvania teaching residents,

           21    ophthalmology residents, and retina fellows,

           22    which I did quite a bit actually early on, did

           23    several fluorescein angiograms, you know,

           24    presented at several of their meetings

           25    including their annual meeting.

                                                              136



            1                   I took call at the University of

            2    Pennsylvania for the fellows and the residents

            3    up until a few years ago actually.  I was on

            4    staff at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia

            5    until about ten years ago when I voluntarily

            6    was off staff there.  But because of the

            7    experience that I've had, I've seen a wide

            8    variety of patients.  Not only in pediatric age

            9    group, but also the adult age group that had

           10    toxoplasmic retinitis amongst other retinal

           11    diseases.

           12                   Again, as I said earlier, I've

           13    not had a patient with primary vitreoretinal

           14    lymphoma.  It's a very rare disorder.  But

           15    we've discussed it frequently in meetings as

           16    part of a differential diagnosis of something

           17    to think of when you see posterior uveitis with

           18    vitreous cellular reaction.  So I feel that

           19    I've had significant experience not only in

           20    terms of treating patients, but treating.

           21          Q.       So you do have a medical degree?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       You do have board-certification

           24    in ophthalmology?

           25          A.       Yes.

                                                              137



            1          Q.       You're a specialist in retinal

            2    disease?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       You've been a professor or

            5    faculty member?

            6          A.       Not a professor, but a member,

            7    yes.

            8          Q.       What hospital affiliations do

            9    you have?

           10          A.       So the University of

           11    Pennsylvania System.  The Hospital of

           12    Pennsylvania, Presbyterian Medical Center.  In

           13    New Jersey, Virtua Hospital System, and I'm

           14    also on staff at the Memorial Ambulatory

           15    Surgery Center.

           16          Q.       Okay.  And you've been given

           17    awards, for example, you were Phi Beta Kappa;

           18    is that correct?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       And are you in any memberships

           21    that are associated with the ophthalmology

           22    business?

           23          A.       So the American Academy of

           24    Ophthalmology, the New Jersey Academy of

           25    Ophthalmology, The American Society of Retina

                                                              138



            1    Specialist, Retina Society.  Those are the

            2    ophthalmology -- American Medical Association,

            3    Medical Society of New Jersey.

            4          Q.       Aside from those things, do you

            5    also give seminars?  In other words, you're one

            6    of the speakers at some of these seminars.

            7          A.       I have in the past.  Most

            8    recently I gave a talk at the American Society

            9    of Retina Specialists at the end of July, but

           10    I've been in seminars.  The Tenth Annual

           11    Retinal Physicians Seminar in Washington D.C.

           12    was in 2014.  I was one of the main speakers

           13    there.

           14          Q.       I note that you're involved in

           15    other 40 publications in ophthalmology.  Does

           16    that sound right?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       Are those -- any of those

           19    speeches that you've given or publications that

           20    you provided dealing with toxoplasmosis?

           21          A.       No.  Dealing with uveitis, but

           22    not specifically with toxoplasmosis.

           23          Q.       How often do you see

           24    toxoplasmosis in your business?

           25          A.       We see it about -- not extremely

                                                              139



            1    commonly.  I would say six times a year, maybe.

            2          Q.       Do you recall a lecture by

            3    invitation that you provided was concomitant --

            4          A.       Concomitant.

            5          Q.       Retinitis toxoplasmosis --

            6          A.       Oh, yeah.  When was that?  Oh,

            7    1992.  Oh, yes, yes.  I gave the rounds at the

            8    University of Pennsylvania.  That was 28 years

            9    ago, yes.

           10          Q.       So to speed this up, there is an

           11    exhibit that has your curriculum vitae on it.

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       Is that accurate as of today or

           14    close to today?

           15          A.       Yes, it is.

           16          Q.       And that will talk about the

           17    publications.  But what's important is, do you

           18    believe that you're experienced in

           19    toxoplasmosis, its diagnosis and treatment,

           20    based on your experience and your education?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       All right.  And do you have a

           23    private practice now?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       How any patients do you see a

                                                              140



            1    day, approximately?

            2          A.       Between 30 and 40 patients a

            3    day.

            4          Q.       And how long have you been in

            5    private practice?

            6          A.       Since 1992.  So 27 years.

            7          Q.       And what I would like to do,

            8    Doctor, is provide you with some definitions,

            9    if I could.  I would like you to follow those

           10    definitions in answering my questions today.

           11    Can we agree to that?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       So when we speak of negligence,

           14    I want you to use this following definition:

           15    Negligence when used with respect to the

           16    conduct of Dr. Wang means failure to use

           17    ordinary care, that is failing to do which an

           18    ophthalmologist of ordinary prudence would have

           19    done under the same or similar circumstances,

           20    doing that which an ophthalmologist of ordinary

           21    prudence would not have done under the same or

           22    similar circumstances.  Did you understand

           23    this?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       Next definition, ordinary care

                                                              141



            1    when used with respect to the conduct of Dr.

            2    Wang means, is that degree of care that an

            3    ophthalmologist of ordinary prudence would use

            4    under the same or similar circumstances.  Do

            5    you understand that definition?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       In answering the questions,

            8    would you use those definitions that I've just

            9    given you?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       Thirdly, proximate cause when

           12    used with respect to the conduct of Dr. Wang

           13    means, a cause that was a substantial factor in

           14    bringing about the injury or the occurrence of

           15    that which caused such injury or occurrence

           16    would not have occurred.  In order to be a

           17    proximate cause, the act or omission complained

           18    of must be such that a physician using ordinary

           19    care could have foreseen that the occurrence or

           20    the injury or some similar occurrence or injury

           21    might reasonably result there from.  There may

           22    be more than one proximate cause of an injury

           23    or occurrence.  Did you understand that?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       What I also want you to agree to

                                                              142



            1    do for me, if you will, is all of your opinions

            2    need to be based on a reasonable degree of

            3    medical certainty.

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       Can you do that for me?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       You've given some opinions to

            8    opposing counsel today.  Have all of those been

            9    based on a reasonable degree of medical

           10    certainty?

           11          A.       A reasonable degree of medical

           12    certainty, yes.

           13          Q.       Thank you.  You have drawn some

           14    opinions about the standard of care in what

           15    caused the blindness in Mr. Cook's right eye,

           16    have you not?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       And you have an opinion on

           19    whether Dr. Wang breached his standard of care

           20    in his diagnosis of Dr. Wang's disease?

           21          A.       Of Mr. Cook's disease.

           22          Q.       I'm sorry.  Mr. Cook's disease.

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       And you have an opinion on

           25    whether Dr. Wang violated his standard of care

                                                              143



            1    in the testing he ordered in trying to

            2    determine the proper diagnosis of Mr. Cook's

            3    disease?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       And you have an opinion on

            6    whether Dr. Wang had any grounds to use

            7    Methotrexate in Mr. Cook's eye at all --

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       -- in his treatment, correct?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       It's not just the amount he

           12    used, but whether he should have been using it

           13    at all.

           14          A.       Correct.

           15          Q.       Is that right?

           16          A.       That's correct.

           17          Q.       And you also have an opinion on

           18    whether he should have used it in an

           19    intraocular fashion, injected into the eyeball,

           20    as opposed to systemic?

           21          A.       Systemic.

           22          Q.       Systemic; is that correct?

           23          A.       That's correct.

           24          Q.       All right.  And then you have an

           25    opinion on the proximate causation of those

                                                              144



            1    standard of care breaches --

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       -- is that correct?  All right.

            4    What is a differential diagnosis?  What does

            5    that mean?

            6          A.       It means different diseases that

            7    you think could fit the clinical picture that

            8    you need to be thinking about when you take a

            9    look at a patient.

           10          Q.       When did Mr. Cook first present

           11    to Texas Retinal?  You can look at Exhibit, I

           12    believe, that's 14, if you would like.

           13          A.       12.

           14          Q.       Okay.  Exhibit-12.  Is that the

           15    exhibit you would like to use?

           16          A.       On or about March the 2, 2016.

           17          Q.       And tell us what toxoplasmosis

           18    is.

           19          A.       Toxoplasmosis is an obligate

           20    intracellular parasitic infection that can

           21    affect different organs, but most commonly

           22    affects or can commonly affect the retina, can

           23    be either acquired in a congenital fashion or

           24    an acquired fashion after birth.

           25          Q.       Using your model, can you show

                                                              145



            1    us where the retina is.

            2          A.       So the retina is in the back of

            3    the eye.  It's like film in a camera.

            4          Q.       And so when you say

            5    toxoplasmosis is a parasite, where is the

            6    parasite in the eye when it's attacking the

            7    eye?

            8          A.       It's inside the retina cells,

            9    damaging the retinal cells in the eye.

           10          Q.       What is the prevalence of

           11    toxoplasmosis in the world?

           12          A.       Approximately one-third of all

           13    of us have serum evidence that we've been

           14    exposed to toxoplasmosis.  So it's very common.

           15    It constitutes one of the more common causes of

           16    posterior uveitis.

           17          Q.       So if someone took the position

           18    that it wasn't common at all, you would

           19    disagree with that?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       What's the prevalence in the

           22    United Stated of toxoplasmosis?

           23          A.       It's slightly less than

           24    one-third, zero prevalence, but not much less

           25    than that.  I think around 20, 25 percent from

                                                              146



            1    what I recall.

            2          Q.       And, again, does that make it

            3    common in your position?

            4          A.       Yes.  Very common.

            5          Q.       If someone took the position

            6    that it wasn't common, would you disagree with

            7    that?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       What does it mean when somebody

           10    refers to the bilateral effect of

           11    toxoplasmosis?

           12          A.       Bilateral toxoplasmic retinitis

           13    is when it's in both eyes.

           14          Q.       Is that common or uncommon?

           15          A.       It happens about 20 percent of

           16    the time in acquired case.

           17          Q.       Would you consider that to be

           18    highly uncommon?

           19          A.       No.

           20          Q.       And you've seen it in your

           21    practice?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       If someone doesn't have -- if

           24    someone has a bilateral indication of

           25    toxoplasmosis, do you exclude that from your

                                                              147



            1    differential diagnosis because it's bilateral?

            2          A.       No.

            3          Q.       Why not?

            4          A.       Because it's fairly common.

            5          Q.       So toxoplasmosis, can you see

            6    it?

            7          A.       It has a typical appearance like

            8    Mr. Cook's right eye on presentation of a white

            9    retinitis, of a focal white retinitis, and the

           10    vitreous haze makes it look like a headlight in

           11    the fog.

           12          Q.       You're holding up a document

           13    we've marked as Exhibit-12.

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       What is that document, sir?

           16          A.       That's a fundus drawing from Dr.

           17    Spencer from March 12, 2016.

           18          Q.       Dr. Spencer with Texas Retina?

           19          A.       Texas Retina.

           20          Q.       What is that drawing depicting?

           21          A.       It looks like a typical

           22    toxoplasmic retinitis.

           23          Q.       Had you seen that, what would

           24    your conclusion have been, if anything?

           25          A.       It would have been my leading

                                                              148



            1    diagnosis.  Although, certainly, I would have

            2    thought of other things, but I would have sort

            3    of excluded them in my mind as being likely.

            4          Q.       If someone took the position

            5    that it's atypical because it's in both eyes,

            6    what would your response to that be?

            7          A.       That is not at all atypical

            8    because we do see it fairly frequently in both

            9    eyes.  About 20 percent.

           10          Q.       Is that 20 percent your

           11    percentage of seeing it or is that 20 percent

           12    based on literature and statistics?

           13          A.       I think both.

           14          Q.       Are there other documents behind

           15    that drawing that support that drawing?

           16          A.       There is a fundus photograph

           17    taken that day that shows the white retinitis.

           18    There is no hemorrhage associated with this

           19    retinitis so it's very typical of toxoplasmic

           20    retinitis.  And these are hazy pictures, which

           21    tell us that there is vitreous cellular

           22    inflammatory reaction in front of it.

           23                   The following visit on March the

           24    9th shows that area of white retinitis in the

           25    right eye, but also now shows a focus of

                                                              149



            1    retinitis in the fellow eye, the left eye, as

            2    well.

            3          Q.       What is it about those pictures

            4    that made you think it was toxoplasmosis?

            5          A.       The typical headlight in the fog

            6    appearance.

            7          Q.       And the fact that it is in both

            8    eyes, not atypical?

            9          A.       No.

           10          Q.       The fact that it is in a

           11    79-year-old man who is not immunocompromised,

           12    is that atypical?

           13          A.       No.

           14          Q.       If someone had took that

           15    position, would you disagree with it?

           16          A.       Yes.

           17          Q.       And why do you take that

           18    contrary position?

           19          A.       Because the clinical picture is

           20    typical of toxoplasmic retinitis.  That it can

           21    be bilateral.  That there was no change in one

           22    week despite the antiviral therapy that was

           23    instituted.  He did institute an empiric

           24    treatment to test, sort of so to speak, whether

           25    or not that could be a diagnosis.  I'm not

                                                              150



            1    surprised that there was no response.

            2          Q.       Okay.  So if Dr. Wang took the

            3    position the patient wasn't immunocompromised,

            4    hence it could not have been toxoplasmosis,

            5    would that be right or wrong?

            6          A.       Wrong.

            7          Q.       And that's based on what?

            8          A.       The fact that most patients with

            9    toxoplasmic retinitis are not

           10    immunocompromised.

           11          Q.       And that's based on your

           12    experience and the literature?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14          Q.       Is that what's taught and what

           15    you teach and everyone --

           16          A.       Yes.

           17          Q.       There was another point that Dr.

           18    Wang made with regard to his claim that the

           19    toxoplasmosis wasn't considered because it was

           20    atypical and that was that there was a scar

           21    that should have been prevalent.  Do you recall

           22    that, sir?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       Do you agree with that?

           25          A.       No.

                                                              151



            1          Q.       Why not?

            2          A.       Because has we said earlier, the

            3    majority of toxoplasmic retinitis was now

            4    recognized as being acquired rather than

            5    congenital.  We see that scar typically in

            6    congenital toxoplasmosis.

            7          Q.       And when did that -- did that

            8    change recently or has that been going on for

            9    some years now?

           10          A.       We recognized since 2003

           11    generally that most cases of toxoplasmic

           12    retinitis are acquired.

           13          Q.       And what is it about being

           14    acquired that does not leave the scar?

           15          A.       Well, it can leave a scar

           16    afterwards, but the initial retinitis certainly

           17    is de novo.  It has no predecessor lesion.

           18          Q.       So in this case, your conclusion

           19    would have been no scar.  That just means he

           20    acquired it?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       All right.  Now, when you say

           23    acquired it, what does that mean?

           24          A.       So you can acquire toxoplasmosis

           25    a number of ways that often cannot be gleamed

                                                              152



            1    with history even if you try.  Things like

            2    handling kitty litter.  Certainly, that would

            3    be pretty obvious.  But other things that may

            4    not be so obvious, meat that might not have

            5    been cooked to 145 degrees.  That's a little

            6    difficult to get by history, if not impossible.

            7    Other things, like, handling fruits and

            8    vegetables that may have the toxoplasmosis cyst

            9    on them.  Very difficult to gather from just

           10    plain history from the patient.

           11          Q.       Okay.  All right.  But you did

           12    notice that at some point in time Dr. Wang

           13    asked Mr. Cook whether he had any exposure to

           14    cats.  Do you remember?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       But that was long after he had

           17    been seeing him; is that true?

           18          A.       Yes.  From what I recall.

           19                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form,

           20          leading.

           23          marked for identification.)

                                                              153



            1          Q.       Was that long after he saw him?

            2          A.       From when I recall, yes.

            3          Q.       Would you look at the exhibit

            4    that has been marked, I think, Exhibit-14.  It

            5    is the 3/2/2016 chart notes.  I handed you a

            6    stack of documents.

            7          A.       Yes, yes, yes.

            8          Q.       See that, sir?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       What is that document,

           11    Exhibit-14?

           12          A.       This is Texas Retina's

           13    Associates office notes beginning on March the

           14    2nd, and carrying on through - oh, this was

           15    March the 2nd, yes.

           16          Q.       And that is when Dr. Spencer was

           17    initially seeing the patient; is that correct?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       And that's the first time

           20    Mr. Cook apparently went to Texas Retina; is

           21    that right?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       Looking at that chart, do you

           24    see anywhere where they asked him about whether

           25    he had any cats?

                                                              154



            1          A.       No.  There is no mention of

            2    that.

            3          Q.       Does it ask him anything about

            4    whether he is in an endemic area in which there

            5    is a lot of toxoplasmosis?

            6          A.       No.

            7          Q.       Is there anything in there that

            8    you can see that's a history about how he grew

            9    up, where he grew up, whether anyone else had

           10    toxoplasmosis in his family?

           11          A.       No.

           12          Q.       In fact, was there a CBC

           13    ordered?

           14          A.       No.

           15          Q.       And a CBC, if you could tell us

           16    what that is.

           17          A.       Complete blood count.

           18          Q.       Was there any blood test

           19    ordered?

           20          A.       No.  No toxoplasmic antibody or

           21    anything like that.

           22          Q.       What is a toxoplasmosis

           23    antibody?

           24          A.       Often if you draw blood and have

           25    a patient with acute toxoplasmosis, you'll get

                                                              155



            1    an IGM antibody spike.  Chronically, it'll be

            2    an IGG, immunoglobulin G.  But acutely IGM

            3    could indicate that the patient has acute

            4    toxoplasmosis.

            5          Q.       That's a blood test, correct?

            6          A.       Yes.  That's a blood test.

            7          Q.       You don't have to go into the

            8    eye to get that?

            9          A.       No.

           10          Q.       Was that done?

           11          A.       No.

           12          Q.       Was that ever done?

           13          A.       No.

           14          Q.       Was any blood test ever done to

           15    the best of your knowledge?

           16          A.       No.

           17          Q.       No CBC was ever taken?

           18          A.       Probably the workup for the

           19    surgical patient, surgical episode.  It

           20    probably was taken.  I don't recall specific

           21    numbers, but the exam didn't prompt it.

           22          Q.       And what was the conclusion of

           23    doctor, the first doctor, with regard to the

           24    affliction of --

           25          A.       Probably related to viral

                                                              156



            1    infection.  He reports having the shingles.  I

            2    can't understand why or where that was

            3    confirmed, and I don't see where on the history

            4    of present illness on the review of systems

            5    where shingles has been documented.

            6                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

            7    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            8          Q.       Do you know where on the body

            9    Mr. Cook had his shingles?

           10          A.       You can't tell based on these

           11    notes.

           12          Q.       So the shingles, which would be,

           13    I guess, form of, like, three different types;

           14    is that right?

           15          A.       Varicella zoster, reactivation.

           16          Q.       All right.  And that would

           17    sometimes appear in the eye?

           18          A.       That sometimes -- if it does

           19    appear in the eye, it usually is on the face

           20    and especially the tip of the nose.  That's

           21    Hutchinson's sign.

           22          Q.       Were you aware that Mr. Cook's

           23    shingles were on his hip?

           24          A.       No.  You can't tell by these

           25    notes.

                                                              157



            1          Q.       Would that have made a

            2    difference --

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       -- in diagnosis?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       All right.  Do you think

            7    somebody might have should have asked him that?

            8          A.       That would have certainly been

            9    appropriate, yes.

           10          Q.       Because the reality is that they

           11    treated him for a viral infection for months,

           12    didn't they?

           13                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to the

           14          form, leading.

           15                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           16    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           17          Q.       Did they treat him for months

           18    for a viral infection?

           19          A.       Yes, they did.

           20          Q.       And if he didn't have a viral

           21    infection in his eyes but on his hip, that

           22    would have been inappropriate?

           23                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           24                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

                                                              158



            1          Q.       So this first appointment, March

            2    3rd, there was no testing done, was there?

            3          A.       No.  Other than the fundus

            4    photographs.

            5          Q.       Other than the fundus

            6    photographs.  There was a determination that he

            7    should be -- that Mr. Cook should be placed on

            8    an antiviral medication; is that right?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       And that was to treat what they

           11    thought was a shingles remanent, is that

           12    correct, or infection?

           13                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           14                   THE WITNESS:  From what I can

           15          gather, they thought it was a viral

           16          infection and they started him on valtrex

           17          based on that.

           18    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           19          Q.       And is valtrex an antiviral

           20    medication?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       All right.  They did not mention

           23    anything about toxoplasmosis on that first

           24    visit; is that correct?

           25          A.       That's correct.

                                                              159



            1          Q.       All right.  What was his

            2    eyesight at that point?

            3          A.       20/50 in the right eye, and

            4    20/25 plus in the left eye.

            5          Q.       At that point in time, the

            6    photographs that you've identified and the

            7    drawings showed that there was inflammation?

            8          A.       Pretty typical toxoplasmic

            9    retinitis in the midperiphery fundus of the

           10    right eye.

           11                         - - -

           12                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-15 was

           13          marked for identification.)

           14                         - - -

           15    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           16          Q.       Could you go to the next

           17    exhibit, which I believe is 15.  That should be

           18    the notes for, I believe, March 18th.  Is that

           19    March 18th?

           20          A.       March 9th.

           21          Q.       And on March 9th, is that still

           22    Dr. Stanley's treatment?

           23          A.       Dr. Spencer.

           24          Q.       I'm sorry.  Spencer.

           25          A.       Dr. Spencer had still opined

                                                              160



            1    that it was acute retinal necrosis from a viral

            2    -- which you get from a viral retinitis.

            3          Q.       All right.  Was there any

            4    additional testing done?

            5          A.       The extended ophthalmoscopy was

            6    drawn, and it indicated possible retinitis at

            7    the 9:00 meridian in the midperipheral fundus

            8    of the left eye.  So that's the only thing we

            9    see.

           10          Q.       Okay.  What effect, if anything,

           11    did that have on what you believe should have

           12    been the diagnosis at that time?

           13          A.       Since there was no change in the

           14    retinitis at one week or the vitreous haze, it

           15    should have prompted consideration of an

           16    alternative diagnosis or plan.

           17          Q.       Okay.  So on the second visit

           18    that Mr. Cook had at Texas Retina, there was an

           19    adherence to the antiviral medication, correct?

           20          A.       Mr. Cook apparently adhered to

           21    the regiment.

           22          Q.       So there was no change in the

           23    antiviral medication?

           24          A.       No.

           25          Q.       And there was no mention of

                                                              161



            1    toxoplasmosis or cancer?

            2          A.       No.

            3          Q.       There was no improvement in the

            4    inflammation?

            5          A.       No.

            6          Q.       So what would that indicate to

            7    you in terms of the medication they were using,

            8    if anything?

            9          A.       It should have prompted a

           10    reconsideration of the diagnosis.

           11          Q.       But the eyesight, was the

           12    eyesight affected at all or was it about the

           13    same?

           14          A.       It was a little worse in the

           15    right eye.  It dropped a couple of letters from

           16    20/50 to 20/50 minus, and it dropped a couple

           17    of letters in the left eye.  This could have

           18    been due to increasing vitreous haze since the

           19    retinitis was outside of the macular region,

           20    which is the center portion of the retina that

           21    we use to see with.

           22          Q.       So we still have no new

           23    diagnosis, no new treatment, correct?

           24          A.       Yes.  And then that was when the

           25    transfer occurred from Dr. Spencer to Dr. Wang.

                                                              162



            1          Q.       Okay.  And that was the 3/18

            2    visit; is that correct?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4                          - - -

            5                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-16 was

            6          marked for identification.)

            7                         - - -

            8    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            9          Q.       All right.  So on the 3/18

           10    visit, was the antiviral classification of

           11    drugs continued by Dr. Wang?

           12          A.       You're saying at the end of the

           13    3/18 visit, yes.  He did continue the valtrex

           14    and added the drops, the steroid drops twice a

           15    day in the right eye.

           16          Q.       What were the steroid drops

           17    reportedly for in your opinion?

           18          A.       To treat the anterior segment

           19    inflammation.

           20          Q.       Okay.  Had there been any

           21    improvement in the inflammation?

           22          A.       According to the notes, there

           23    were still two plus vitreous debris in that

           24    right eye.

           25          Q.       If you look at the very last --

                                                              163



            1    I'm sorry.  Yes.  The last page of that

            2    exhibit.

            3          A.       Yeah.

            4                   MR. PATTERSON:  Could you

            5          mention the Bates number or the exhibit

            6          number.

            7                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Is that

            8          Exhibit-16?

            9                   THE WITNESS:  It's Exhibit-16.

           10                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Exhibit-16

           11          and the Bates number would end in 32.

           12    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           13          Q.       My question is, would you look

           14    at the very last page of Exhibit-16, Doctor?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       You'll see, Richard Rand asked

           17    me to see the patient.  Do you see that?

           18          A.       Richard, comma, Rand asked me to

           19    see the patient.

           20          Q.       Okay.  Do you know what that

           21    means?

           22          A.       It's almost as if he's talking

           23    to or he's directing the comment to somebody

           24    named Richard and Rand Spencer asked me to see

           25    the patient.  So I'm not sure.

                                                              164



            1          Q.       Okay.  We don't know who Richard

            2    is?

            3          A.       The primary care doctor?  Was it

            4    that the primary care doc's first name is

            5    Richard and they thought they were generating a

            6    letter from that?

            7          Q.       Okay.  All right.  It states

            8    doctor -- this is the first time Dr. Wang saw

            9    the patient.  Is that what you're understanding

           10    is?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       And he states on that last page,

           13    the retinitis looks better.

           14          A.       A lot better.

           15          Q.       Okay.  A lot better.  OD still

           16    has some debris -- which means his right eye

           17    still has some debris -- but I think we can

           18    quiet it down without surgery, correct?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       We'll ask him to continue

           21    Valtrex, which is the same drug that he has

           22    been on?

           23          A.       Right.

           24          Q.       And now add Durezol; is that

           25    correct?

                                                              165



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       Durezol is a steroid?

            3          A.       Yup.

            4          Q.       And we'll recheck in two to

            5    three weeks in Sherman; is that right?

            6          A.       Yeah.  Durezol is a topical

            7    steroid and it looks as if Dr. Wang thought the

            8    retinitis was actually better.

            9          Q.       Now, there is no mention of any

           10    toxoplasmosis in these records?

           11          A.       No.

           12          Q.       There is no new medical history

           13    and physical, is there?

           14          A.       No.

           15          Q.       The eyesight is still relatively

           16    stable --

           17          A.       No.  It got worse in the right

           18    eye.  It went down to 20/80.  So now he's lost

           19    a few lines and the vision in the left eye is

           20    20/30.  So we're losing lines.

           21          Q.       So is what you're telling us is

           22    that from the -- that you're seeing a

           23    progression of worsening of the eyesight?

           24                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           25                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Probably

            1          because of the vitreous debris that is

            2          probably advancing.

            3    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            4          Q.       So there's been sort of an

            5    adherence, is that what you're seeing?

            6                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

            7    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            8          Q.       To the same protocol?

            9          A.       Yeah.  I don't see any change in

           10    plan.  I'll leave it at that.

           11          Q.       What, if anything, do you see

           12    that Dr. Wang has done differently on this 3/18

           13    visit that's reflected in Exhibit-16?

           14          A.       He just added some topical

           15    steroid drops to the right eye.

           16          Q.       You didn't see that he ordered

           17    any new testing?

           18          A.       No new testing.

           19          Q.       Did you see whether he ordered

           20    any new medication or treatment or diagnostic

           21    testing for toxoplasmosis?

           22          A.       No.

           23          Q.       Or for cancer?

           24          A.       No.

           25          Q.       You're not seeing an improvement

                                                              167



            1    in the inflammation?

            2          A.       No.

            3          Q.       And you're not seeing

            4    improvement in the eyesight at this point.  Is

            5    that a yes or a no?

            6          A.       Correct.  A decrease in vision.

            7          Q.       No new diagnosis as of 3/18 when

            8    Dr. Wang sees him; is that correct?

            9          A.       No.

           11                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-17 was

           12          marked for identification.)

           14    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           15          Q.       If you look at Exhibit-17, that

           16    should be the 11 -- I'm sorry -- the 3/31/2016,

           17    note for the office visit.

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       Do yo see that?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       Okay.  And that is how many

           22    weeks later?  I guess he seen him two weeks

           23    later, approximately?

            1                   THE WITNESS:  March 31st is

            2          about 13 days after the last visit.

            3    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            4          Q.       Okay.  Who do you understand saw

            5    Mr. Cook on March 31st of 2016?

            6          A.       That would be Dr. Wang.

            7          Q.       Okay.  Is his -- is Mr. Cook's

            8    eyesight getting better or worse in your

            9    estimation?

           10          A.       Going by the medical record,

           11    it's actually a little bit better on March the

           12    31st.  They put 20/60 minus, maybe a line

           13    better, and pretty stable at 20/25 minus in the

           14    left eye.

           15          Q.       Is the inflammation getting

           16    better?

           17          A.       The anterior chamber has trace

           18    cell in the right eye.  There is still two plus

           19    debris in the vitreous in the right eye, and

           20    still documented the retina looks attached in

           21    the right eye with an area of retinitis as

           22    before, and the area of retinitis as before in

           23    the left eye and there was no macular in edema

           24    either eye.

           25          Q.       Would you look at the last page

                                                              169



            1    of Exhibit-17.  Do you see the part that says,

            2    impression provider plan?

            3          A.       Yeah.

            4          Q.       Okay.  Provider plan says area

            5    of retinitis with whitening OD and stable OS.

            6    So whitening in the right eye and stable in the

            7    left eye; is that correct?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       And then what do you see that

           10    the doctor has ordered here or suggested that

           11    he would like to order?

           12          A.       Intraocular Ganciclovir in the

           13    right eye since still looks active, need to

           14    order so will have patient come back in one

           15    week for injection.  Risks and benefits

           16    discussed and answered, continue Valtrex and

           17    Durezol.  So they need to order, which is not

           18    unusual.  It's not a commonly injected

           19    medication.  They needed to order the

           20    Ganciclovir, but still no consideration for

           21    other diagnostic possibilities.

           22                   So the reason why a different

           23    plan would be in place would be because you're

           24    not comfortable with the progression or

           25    treatment and so you're trying to change the

                                                              170



            1    plan, but still no consideration for

            2    toxoplasmosis.

            3                   MR. PATTERSON:  Objection to the

            4          nonresponsiveness.

            5    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            6          Q.       So on March 31st, is Dr. Wang

            7    ordering yet another antiviral medication?

            8          A.       Yes.  This would not treat

            9    toxoplasmosis.  This would treat a virus.

           10          Q.       And it was determined -- or was

           11    it determined that he didn't have a virus?

           12                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           13                   THE WITNESS:  Was it determined

           14          that he did have a virus?

           15    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           16          Q.       Did not have the virus that they

           17    were reportedly treating?

           18          A.       Was it determined that he --

           19          Q.       Did not have the virus that they

           20    were reportedly treating?  Do you understand my

           21    question?

           22          A.       I'm sorry.

           23          Q.       Ultimately, there was testing

           24    done to determine whether or not he had what

           25    they were treating, correct?

                                                              171



            1          A.       The testing at the time of

            2    surgery, the PCR for the virus, yes.

            3          Q.       And that's what I'm asking.  On

            4    March 31st, Dr. Wang is still providing the

            5    antiviral medication with the assumption that

            6    there is something to be treated?

            7          A.       Correct.

            8          Q.       And there is nothing to be

            9    treated for that medication, is there?

           10                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to the

           11          form.

           12                   THE WITNESS:  That medication

           13          does not treat toxoplasmosis.  It treats

           14          a virus and he's still empirically

           15          treating the antiviral thinking that it

           16          was a virus.

           17    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           18          Q.       Okay.  As of the 31st, there was

           19    no mention of toxoplasmosis; is that right?

           20          A.       No.

           21          Q.       And no mention of cancer; is

           22    that correct?

           23          A.       No.

           24          Q.       As of March 31st, Dr. Wang had

           25    not ordered any type of biopsy; is that

                                                              172



            1    correct?

            2          A.       Correct.

            3          Q.       And what would a biopsy be for?

            4          A.       To try to obtain material that

            5    could be evaluated for definitive diagnosis of

            6    virus or other like toxoplasmosis or cytology.

            7          Q.       Could you explain to us how the

            8    biopsy works and what it's for?

            9          A.       So when you do the vitreous

           10    sampling biopsy, you're trying to obtain

           11    material that is vitreous to submit for testing

           12    like PCR for the HSV, VZV, CMV, toxoplasmosis.

           13    You can also get cytology and you can do

           14    culturing, bacterial, fungal culturing.  These

           15    things are typically done.  You can do staining

           16    as well, but you're trying to narrow down the

           17    differential diagnosis or come up with a

           18    specific diagnosis.

           19          Q.       Could you show us using your

           20    model how that testing is done or how that

           21    biopsy is done?

           22          A.       So it's typically entered at the

           23    -- I'm just going to use one of these pens.

           24    But this is the area in the eye called the pars

           25    plana, which is relatively avascular and is not

                                                              173



            1    part of the retina.  So you can place trocars

            2    in these areas.  Typically three are placed to

            3    get sampling of the vitreous.  An infusion

            4    canula and vitreous sampling is done by

            5    removing some of the vitreous hoping that the

            6    environment will glean the information that you

            7    need.  This way, you're not piercing the retina

            8    because you're anterior to the retina and

            9    you're in a relatively avascular area.  So

           10    you're not causing or hope not to cause a

           11    retinal detachment or anything like that.

           12          Q.       You're understanding is that

           13    when Dr. Wang took his initial testing, that

           14    initial biopsy, his position is that the

           15    sampling was so small and restricted that he

           16    couldn't test for toxoplasmosis.  Do you recall

           17    that?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       What is your response to that?

           20          A.       You really don't need a lot.  So

           21    the sampling for toxoplasmosis could have

           22    easily been done with the existing sample.  You

           23    just have to order it and it wasn't order.

           24          Q.       Do you think he should have

           25    ordered it?

                                                              174



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       Do you have an opinion about his

            3    standard of care in not ordering it?

            4          A.       Standard of care was violated in

            5    not ordering it.

            6          Q.       And in fact, someone ultimately

            7    did order it after he was blind in one eye,

            8    correct?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       What did that sample show?

           11          A.       It showed that it was positive

           12    for toxoplasmosis.

           13          Q.       And so had it been determined

           14    that it was toxoplasmosis before Dr. Wang

           15    injected Methotrexate into his eyeball,

           16    Methotrexate would have no role in treating

           17    toxoplasmosis, correct?

           18          A.       Correct.  And the Methotrexate

           19    would have never been injected to begin with.

           25          Q.       Can we look at the next exhibit,

                                                              175



            1    which I believe is 18.

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       And that should be a note dated

            4    April the 7th of 2016.

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       Could you tell us what your

            7    understanding of what happened during that day

            8    is.

            9          A.       It was an injection only visit

           10    it looks like and we'll stick to plan and place

           11    intraocular Ganciclovir right eye.  They

           12    injected the standard 4 milligram dose, and

           13    vision was not checked that day.

           14          Q.       So on April 7th, was there any

           15    additional testing done?

           16          A.       No.

           17          Q.       And the medication that was

           18    inserted was, again, antiviral; is that right?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       So when was the next time

           21    Mr. Cook made an office visit?

           22          A.       It looks like the office visit

           23    was April the 28th.

            3    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            4          Q.       Could you look at exhibit, I

            5    believe that's, 19.

            6          A.       19.

            7          Q.       Do you see that?  What is that

            8    document, sir?

            9          A.       That's an office visit on April

           10    28th.  Vision had improved in the right eye to

           11    20/30, left eye 20/20.  Still the same amount

           12    of vitreitis, still the area of retinitis at

           13    11:00.  He injected intraocular Foscarnet,

           14    which is another antiviral.

           15          Q.       So how many antivirals is that

           16    now?

           17          A.       Well, he's still on the oral

           18    Valtrex and intraocular Ganciclovir,

           19    intraocular Foscarnet, and they're staying with

           20    the diagnosis of the viral retinitis.

           21          Q.       You mentioned, I think you said,

           22    there was sign of vitreitis and retinitis

           23    still; is that correct?

           24          A.       Yes.  Unchanged.

           25          Q.       All right.  So educate me about

                                                              177



            1    how it is that there is still this

            2    inflammation, yet his vision seems to be

            3    improving or at least stabilizing with 20/40, I

            4    think you said, or maybe 20/20?

            5          A.       20/30 minus, yeah.  That does

            6    not appear to be consistent.  It's an excellent

            7    question.  But now we are nearly two months

            8    after the initial visit and there hasn't been

            9    any severe worsening.  But there hasn't been

           10    any, just going by the notes, apparent

           11    improvement in the retinitis despite the nearly

           12    two months of being on Valtrex.

           13          Q.       Is there any mention of

           14    toxoplasmosis on April the 28th of 2016 that

           15    you can find?

           16          A.       No.

           17          Q.       Is there any mention of lymphoma

           18    in his eye or in his brain at that time?

           19          A.       No.

           20          Q.       Is there any other differential

           21    diagnosis mentioned other than the adherence to

           22    the antiviral approach?

           23          A.       No.

           24          Q.       Did you see any urgency in the

           25    records about the prospect that there might be

                                                              178



            1    cancer after this almost two months of

            2    treatment?

            3          A.       No.

            4          Q.       What is the next time that they

            5    saw --

            6          A.       It looks like June the 9th.

            7          Q.       I'm sorry.  I believe it's -- do

            8    you have June the 2nd?

            9          A.       I'm so sorry.

           10          Q.       Just to make my question

           11    clearer.  After April the 28th, what was the

           12    next office visit for Mr. Cook that you could

           13    find?

           14          A.       Return in three to four weeks.

           15    Asked Stephanie to order intraocular

           16    Ganciclovir.  So considering another one.  This

           17    I have as June the 9th, Exihibit-23.

           18          Q.       Do you have June the 2nd?

           19          A.       No, I don't.

           20          Q.       Oh.  Let me hand you Exhibit-20.

           21                         - - -

           22                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-20 was

           23          marked for identification.)

           24                         - - -

           25                   THE WITNESS:  So I have June the

                                                              179



            1          2nd here in front of me.  20/50 minus and

            2          20/30 minus.

            3    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            4          Q.       So just to make sure that we're

            5    marching along at the same time, the last time

            6    that Dr. Cook was seen was April the 28th and

            7    the next time he is seen is June 2nd; is that

            8    right?

            9          A.       Mr. Cook.  April 28th and then

           10    June the 2nd, which was about four weeks.  A

           11    little over four weeks later.

           12          Q.       What is your understanding

           13    that's happening now three months later?

           14          A.       It says that his vision is

           15    blurred out of the left eye and now the vision

           16    is starting to go get a little worse out of the

           17    left eye.  The right eye is worse as well.

           18    Worse than it was in April.  And the vitreitis

           19    is unchanged in the right eye on June the 2nd

           20    and the retinitis in both eyes is unchanged

           21    without evidence for macular edema.

           22          Q.       And what is the provider plan to

           23    the best of your knowledge?

           24          A.       It says here, pre-op surgery

           25    report.  Procedure, vitrectomy 25 gauge,

                                                              180



            1    vitreous biopsy left eye as soon as possible.

            2    Medical clearance required.  Verified patient

            3    had shingles.  Looks more hardened today, but

            4    vision off.  Discussed the risks and benefits

            5    of going to the OR for a biopsy versus

            6    repeating injection and rechecking down the

            7    road.  Patient understands and elects to

            8    proceed with surgery.

            9          Q.       Okay.  Could you look at what's

           10    Bates stamped 59.

           11          A.       59, yes.

           12          Q.       All right.  Do you see where it

           13    says provider plan?

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       It says verified OT had

           16    shingles?

           17          A.       Verified patient had shingles.

           18          Q.       How many months is this after

           19    they saw them?

           20          A.       June the 2nd would be three

           21    months, three full months.

           22          Q.       It doesn't say where he had the

           23    shingles, does it?

           24          A.       No.  It just says verified.

           25          Q.       And it says, looks more harden

                                                              181



            1    today, but VA off.  Visual acuity, is that what

            2    that means?

            3          A.       Yeah.

            4          Q.       Discussed the R and B, that's

            5    risks and benefits for going --

            6          A.       Yeah.

            7          Q.       -- to the OR for a biopsy, which

            8    is BX; is that right?

            9          A.       Yeah.

           10          Q.       Versus repeating injection and

           11    rechecking down the road.

           12          A.       Right.

           13          Q.       Right?  Plaintiff understands

           14    and elects to proceed with surgery, correct?

           15          A.       Right.

           16          Q.       Surgery to most of us sounds

           17    like something really radical.  But the surgery

           18    that they are talking about, is that the biopsy

           19    that you were showing us a moment ago?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       So in that sense, it's surgery

           22    because you're invading someone, but it's not

           23    like we think of where you're getting cut open

           24    and having something taken out or repaired?

           25          A.       But it's a significant event

                                                              182



            1    nonetheless.

            2          Q.       But just so we're clear, the

            3    surgery that they are talking about is this

            4    sampling; is that right?

            5          A.       Yes.  It's a diagnostic surgery

            6    rather than a therapeutic surgery.  I think

            7    that's what you may be asking.

            8          Q.       Sure.  I understand.  All right.

            9    So as of June the 2nd, Dr. Wang has now made it

           10    a decision to do the sampling, the diagnostic

           11    sampling, correct?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       Are you aware of any reason why

           14    he wouldn't have done it before?

           15          A.       No.

           16          Q.       Are you aware of any reason why

           17    he would have to limit that to something that

           18    excluded toxoplasmosis testing?

           20          form, leading.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  No.

           22    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           23          Q.       Are you aware of any reason why

           24    he couldn't have tested for several things

           25    including lymphoma in that test?

                                                              183

            2                   THE WITNESS:  No.

            3    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            4          Q.       Did he do those things?

            5          A.       No.

            6          Q.       What did he do?

            7          A.       He did a vitreous biopsy and he

            8    did PCR for HSV, VZV, and CMV and all were

            9    negative.

           10          Q.       Okay.  So backup a little bit.

           11    What are the things he tested for?

           12          A.       Herpes simplex virus, varicella

           13    zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus.

           14          Q.       That's it?

           15          A.       That's it.

           16          Q.       All right.  And he'd been

           17    treating him, Mr. Cook, for that for how long?

           18          A.       Three months.

           20    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           21          Q.       Viruses?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       Just to make the record clear,

           24    so the things that were being sampled were

           25    viruses; is that correct?

                                                              184



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       And were those viruses already

            3    being treated for three months?

            4          A.       It was being treated empirically

            5    as if it was a viral infection with one of

            6    those viruses.

            7          Q.       What did that test show?

            8          A.       It showed that it was negative

            9    for that.

           10          Q.       And there was no

           11    toxoplasmosis --

           12          A.       No toxoplasmosis PCR test was

           13    done.

           14          Q.       No cancer test done?

           15          A.       No cytology that I saw was done.

           16          Q.       So where does that leave Dr.

           17    Wang at that point in time?

           18          A.       Without a diagnosis that was

           19    considered.

           20          Q.       So the next visit, which is with

           21    a Dr. Lori Coors, do you recall that, sir?

           22          A.       On June the 9th?

           23          Q.       Well, do you recall there was a

           24    record of --

           25          A.       No.

                                                              185



            1          Q.       -- a visit by Dr. Lori Coors on

            2    the 7th?  I don't believe there is an exhibit

            3    for that, but do you have any recollection of

            4    that?

            5          A.       That was post-op day one.  I

            6    don't specifically remember that, but I

            7    couldn't doubt it since it would be post-op day

            8    one.

           11          marked for identification.)

           12                         - - -

           13    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           14          Q.       Which is your next exhibit

           15    number?

           16          A.       Exhibit-23.

           17          Q.       What date is that?

           18          A.       June 9, 2016.

           19          Q.       Tell us what happened at that

           20    visit.

           21          A.       The patient felt that the vision

           22    had improved, although still reading 20/60

           23    minus.  The intraocular pressure was normal.

           24    There was some inflammation at the front of the

           25    eye in the anterior chamber.  The vitreous was

                                                              186



            1    status postvitrectomy.  He had injected a

            2    steroid in the eye called Kenalog.  It says

            3    still looks to be kicking up.

            4                   Now, I'm from the northeast.  So

            5    I don't know exactly what looks to be kicking

            6    up means, but I would imagine that it means

            7    that it's still active.

            8          Q.       Does --

            9          A.       I don't --

           10          Q.       Does Dr. Wang have the biopsy on

           11    this date?

           12          A.       Yes.  The biopsy is negative,

           13    denies cats.  So that tells me that that may

           14    have been the first time that he thought about

           15    toxoplasmosis.

           16          Q.       Okay.  He doesn't ask all the

           17    other questions that would maybe be indicative

           18    of toxoplasmosis, does he?

           19                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form,

           20          leading.

           21    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           22          Q.       Let me fix the question.  Does

           23    he ask on the 9th, that you're aware of, any

           24    questions about toxoplasmosis other than asking

           25    him whether he denies cats or not?

                                                              187



            1                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form,

            2          leading.

            3                   THE WITNESS:  No.  And the

            4          concern here is that he's injected

            5          steroid in the eye, an eye with

            6          toxoplasmosis, and maybe that's why it

            7          was worse.

            8                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object.

            9          Responsiveness.

           10    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           11          Q.       Let's look at provider plan,

           12    which is on 78 of this exhibit.  It says a

           13    addendum, BX negative.  That means what, sir?

           14          A.       The biopsy was negative.  It

           15    doesn't say specifically what it was negative

           16    for, but we know that it was, by the medical

           17    records, negative for PCR for the viral

           18    diseases that we have discussed earlier.

           19          Q.       He says, denies cats.  Do you

           20    see that?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       Do you see anywhere else in the

           23    medical records where Dr. Wang or any of the

           24    doctors at Texas Retina ask about eating raw

           25    meat, being around fruit, or other possible --

                                                              188



            1          A.       No.

            2          Q.       -- ways to get toxoplasmosis?

            3          A.       No.

            4          Q.       Do you see where it says, we'll

            5    get an MRI to rule out lymphoma.  Do you see

            6    that?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       All right.  That does mean rule

            9    out lymphoma, correct?  RO?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       And what -- based on your

           12    medical experience, what is being stated here

           13    in your opinion?  Will get an MRI to rule out

           14    lymphoma.

           15          A.       Well, he's now thinking of other

           16    differential diagnoses and he wants to consider

           17    the possibility of primary vitreoretinal

           18    lymphoma.

           19          Q.       And he wants to rule it out; is

           20    that correct?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       And then he says, and inject

           23    MTX, Methotrexate --

           24          A.       Methotrexate.

           25          Q.       On FU.  What's FU mean?

                                                              189



            1          A.       On follow-up.

            2          Q.       In a week, correct?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       Do you draw any conclusion about

            5    the sequence of events from his statement that

            6    he wants to rule out and inject MTX in a week?

            7          A.       One would ideally like to get

            8    the MRI and then see if it's positive rather

            9    than to priori make a decision that you're

           10    going to inject the Methotrexate.

           11          Q.       And what is Methotrexate for?

           12          A.       It's a chemotherapeutic agent

           13    that's used to treat things like lymphoma.

           14          Q.       Is it used to treat anything

           15    else that you can think of?

           16          A.       It's been tried on some other

           17    diseases, but it's not definitive.  It has been

           18    tried in other uveitides, but nothing

           19    definitive in terms of that.

           20          Q.       If Dr. Wang or Dr. Yee took the

           21    position that it's a mild medication, what

           22    would your response to that be?

           23          A.       That's not correct.

           24          Q.       Why do you take that position?

           25          A.       Because it has the potential for

                                                              190



            1    toxicity and needs to be treated seriously and

            2    it's a significant medicine.

            3          Q.       When does a physician inject

            4    Methotrexate into someone's eyeball?

            5          A.       Well, one of the occasions is if

            6    you're feeling that it could be primary

            7    vitreoretinal lymphoma.

            8          Q.       And what is the chance that that

            9    would be the case based on your experience and

           10    your knowledge?

           11          A.       It's extremely rare.  Like we

           12    said, it's about .1 to .4 in 100,000.

           13          Q.       Have you ever seen it?

           14          A.       No.

           15          Q.       Do you know anyone who has?

           16          A.       No.  Do I know anybody who has?

           17    Yes.  They are ocular oncologists, yes.  Right

           18    here in Philadelphia.  I'm sure they have, but

           19    yes.

           20          Q.       You're sure they have, but you

           21    don't know of any?

           22          A.       I have not seen any.

           23          Q.       I mean, I want you to give us a

           24    sense of how rare it is, if you can.

           25          A.       It's extremely rare.  You know,

                                                              191



            1    again, in the order of ten and a million.

            2          Q.       So based on the objective

            3    information that you had, which you showed us,

            4    the pictures and the -- was there anything to

            5    indicate that he had that kind of cancer in his

            6    eyeball at that point in time?

            7          A.       It's certainly in the

            8    differential diagnosis.  It's not something to

            9    be ignored, but it's certainly way down the

           10    list.

           11          Q.       And so ordering the MRI, what

           12    would that have done?

           13          A.       If there was a focus of lymphoma

           14    in the CNS, that would have given evidence that

           15    that was the case.  That there could have been

           16    primary vitreoretinal lymphoma.

           17          Q.       Could you pull Exhibit-13, which

           18    you and opposing counsel discussed a little

           19    while ago.

           20          A.       13.  Okay.

           21          Q.       What is on the first page of

           22    Exhibit-13?

           23          A.       It discusses the exam with and

           24    without contrast and MRI of the brain and

           25    orbits.

                                                              192



            1          Q.       Is this the MRI that was

            2    provided?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       And the MRI was provided for

            5    what reason?

            6          A.       To rule out lymphoma.

            7          Q.       And it also covers his brain and

            8    it also mentions the word orbital, orbit.  What

            9    does that mean?

           10          A.       That's the boney encasing around

           11    the eye.

           12          Q.       If we look at impression, it

           13    says, no acute brain abnormality, correct?

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       And it says previous bilateral

           16    cataract surgery is suspected.  How would they

           17    know that from an MRI?

           18          A.       They get segments of eye in the

           19    orbital MRI.

           20          Q.       Would that MRI have picked up

           21    cancer if it were in that range?

           22          A.       It would have picked up the

           23    lymphoma in the brain.  The resolution is such

           24    that you would not expect that to pick it up in

           25    the eye, in the retina.

                                                              193



            1          Q.       And so this was done -- what day

            2    was the actual MRI conducted, if you can tell?

            3          A.       June 15, 2016.

            4          Q.       And that's when he went in and

            5    had himself inserted into the MRI vessel; is

            6    that correct?

            7          A.       Yes.

            8          Q.       If you look at the next page,

            9    what does that page say?

           10          A.       It discusses the orbital

           11    findings and the cataract surgery.  It

           12    describes what the test was.  Page 2, it says

           13    when the report was dictated and then when the

           14    report was edited and electronically signed.

           15          Q.       It says, quote, no abnormal or

           16    orbital mast or enhancement is identified.  Do

           17    you see that, sir?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       What does that mean?

           20          A.       There is no tumor in the orbit.

           21    There is no abnormalities in the orbit itself.

           22    That's extra occular.

           23          Q.       So in June, the middle of June,

           24    the MRI tells us what about this suspicion that

           25    there might be cancer in the eyeball?

                                                              194



            1                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

            2                   THE WITNESS:  It doesn't tell

            3          you about the eyeball has much as it

            4          tells you that there is no obvious sign

            5          of lymphoma or cancer intracranially.

            6    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            7          Q.       All right.  So if Dr. Wang and

            8    Dr. Yee take the position that it is as common

            9    to have lymphoma in the eyeball as it is to

           10    have it in the brain, what would your response

           11    to that be?

           12                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           13          Misstates their testimony and opinion.

           14                   THE WITNESS:  Since we know that

           15          80 to 90 percent of all cases of primary

           16          vitreoretinal lymphoma are accompanied by

           17          evidence of involvement in the brain,

           18          it's more likely than not, much more

           19          likely than not, that either it will

           20          develop in the brain or it has developed

           21          in the brain by the time it's in the eye.

           22    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           23          Q.       So you understand that Dr. Wang

           24    may take the position that he got a verbal or

           25    had a verbal discussion with the radiologist

                                                              195



            1    about what the MRI stated before it was put in

            2    final form?

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       All right.  That's what opposing

            5    counsel told you?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       Or indicated to you, I guess, is

            8    a better way of putting it.

            9          A.       Right.

           10          Q.       And so when you look at the

           11    second page, you'll see it says dictated by

           12    Michael Hartman an 6/16/2016.  Do see that?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14          Q.       12:08 p.m.  Do you see that?

           15          A.       Right.

           16          Q.       What does it mean when it says

           17    dictating?  What's he dictating?

           18          A.       He dictated a report at that

           19    time.

           20          Q.       All right.  So he had the

           21    picture, I guess, and he's dictating the report

           22    now of what it means?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       And then it says edited and

           25    electronically signed by Michael Hartman on

                                                              196



            1    6/16, correct?

            2          A.       Yes.

            3          Q.       And is there risk in taking an

            4    oral opinion about what the MRI states and then

            5    risking that they change it later on when

            6    you've acted on it in the middle?

            7          A.       Yes.  There's always a risk

            8    because you can misunderstand what was said

            9    over the phone.  And when it's written down,

           10    there is no misunderstanding.  So you're adding

           11    a little bit more uncertainty when you're

           12    relying on a verbal report.

           13          Q.       If you look at the next page of

           14    your documentation, I think it's the page after

           15    that, the very last page.

           16          A.       Uh-uh.

           17          Q.       You'll see the consent.  Do you

           18    see that?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       When was the consent signed?

           21          A.       On June 16, 2016 at 12:13 p.m.

           22          Q.       All right.  So the consent was

           23    signed before the MRI report was finalized?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       And if you look at the second to

                                                              197



            1    last page, what do you see there?

            2          A.       The impression.  And it also --

            3    the amount of Methotrexate that was injected in

            4    the eye.

            5          Q.       Do you recall speaking with

            6    opposing counsel and you said he had to have

            7    been without the MRI because of the word if.

            8    Do you recall that?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       Do you see that word?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       Would you read that sentence

           13    into the record, please.

           14          A.       However, if MRI normal, might be

           15    able to treat locally.  But if no response,

           16    oncologist might need more pathology, I.E.,

           17    biopsy results.

           18          Q.       Okay.  So he says if it is

           19    normal?

           20          A.       If.

           21          Q.       All right.  What time is that?

           22    What day is that?

           23          A.       That was on June the 16, 2016.

           24          Q.       Okay.  So can you think of any

           25    other meaning of the word if that would mesh

                                                              198



            1    with the idea that he'd already seen the MRI?

            2          A.       No.

            3                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

            4    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            5          Q.       So does it appear that Dr. Wang

            6    injected the right eye without the benefit of

            7    the MRI that he ordered?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Did this fall below the standard

           10    of care in your opinion?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       Now, you also mentioned after,

           13    in the middle of this quarrel, that it didn't

           14    really matter because he shouldn't have been

           15    injecting Methotrexate at all; is that correct?

           16          A.       That's correct.

           17                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form,

           18          leading.

           19    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           20          Q.       Well, is it your opinion that he

           21    shouldn't have been injecting Methotrexate at

           22    all?

           23          A.       Not only did he not need to

           24    inject Methotrexate at all.  There was no

           25    urgency to the injection of Methotrexate now

                                                              199



            1    three and a half months after the initial

            2    encounter.

            3          Q.       You also had a discussion with

            4    opposing counsel about 800, the number of 800

            5    micrograms?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       Do you see anywhere in the

            8    medical records where it says he injected 400?

            9          A.       No.

           10          Q.       Do you see anywhere where that

           11    mathematical equation that opposing counsel had

           12    you go through has listed to determine that it

           13    was 400 instead of 800?

           14          A.       No.

           15          Q.       Do you see any division that was

           16    done that got you there?

           17          A.       No.

           18          Q.       It says 800; is that right?

           19          A.       On three occasions it says 800.

           20          Q.       Is that an overdose of that

           21    drug?

           22          A.       It's a doubling.  It's an

           23    overdose, yes.

           24          Q.       And, again, is it your opinion

           25    that the Methotrexate should have never been

                                                              200



            1    introduced at all, much less twice than what he

            2    gave, should have gave?

            3                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form,

            4          leading.

            5                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.  It's

            6          documented four times actually that 800

            7          micrograms was given and it should not

            8          have been.

            9    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           10          Q.       So to clarify the record now,

           11    how many times was it stated that he gave 800?

           12          A.       Four times.

           13          Q.       And would you list all of the

           14    problems you had with the Methotrexate

           15    including the overdose.  What else was wrong

           16    with giving it?

           17          A.       Methotrexate doesn't treat

           18    toxoplasmic retinitis.  It was given obviously

           19    twice normal dosage, which was toxic.  It was

           20    given without the official MRI reading, and it

           21    was apparently given or decided to be given a

           22    priori almost based on what we saw in the

           23    previous medical records.

           24          Q.       What does a priori mean?

           25          A.       The decision was made to give it

                                                              201



            1    even before any testing was done.

            2          Q.       Should it have been given into

            3    the eyeball?

            4          A.       The other issue is that systemic

            5    treatment, if you're concerned about the grave

            6    prognosis of lymphoma, should have been given

            7    systemically rather than in the eye.  And the

            8    priority should have been given to systemic

            9    treatment rather than intravitreal treatment.

           10          Q.       Can you show us the four places

           11    where he stated that he injected the 800

           12    dosage?

           13                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to the

           14          form.

           15                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  What's the

           16          basis of that objection?

           17                   MR. PATTERSON:  Because it

           18          doesn't say that he injected it.  It does

           19          not use those words.  It says a

           20          concentration.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  It says injection

           22          Methotrexate 800 micro -- actually, I'm

           23          sorry.  It says it five times.  Because

           24          on this page 87, it says injection

           25          Methotrexate 800 micrograms, and it says

                                                              202



            1          800 micrograms there, and then it says on

            2          page 86 --

            3    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            4          Q.       Just so my record is clear,

            5    could you, Doctor, show us the five times that

            6    800 micrograms was listed?

            7          A.       On page 87, it says injection

            8    Methotrexate 800 micrograms.  It says right

            9    next to it, amount 800 units micrograms.  On

           10    page 86 -- do you have that?

           11                   MR. PATTERSON:  It's on the

           12          front of that.

           13                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  You were on

           14          Exhibit-18.

           15                   THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I don't

           16          have it there.

           17                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  It should

           18          be one page.

           19                   THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  On page 86

           20          it indicates it on three occasions.

           21    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           22          Q.       Okay.  What's the next office

           23    visit that you can recall, Doctor?

           24          A.       So I think that was a July 1st

           25    one.

                                                              203



            1          Q.       Well, there was a 6/16.  Do you

            2    recall that office visit?

            3          A.       That was the injection.

            4          Q.       6/16.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I got

            5    my dates mixed up.  The next one was in fact

            6    7/1/16.

            7          A.       Uh-uh.

            8          Q.       To make the record clear, was

            9    July 1, 2016, the next visit after the

           10    injection of Methotrexate?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       All right.  Can you tell us what

           13    happened at that visit.

           14          A.       The vision was recorded as light

           15    perception.  So there had occurred a profound

           16    loss of vision in the right eye and it was

           17    20/70 in the left eye.

           18          Q.       What exhibit are you looking at,

           19    sir?

           20          A.       My report.  I have no -- I don't

           21    have the 7/1 office visit in front of me.

           22          Q.       Your recollection is on 7/1 that

           23    there was a significant event that caused him

           24    to lose sight in his eye?

           25          A.       No.  I think the event had

                                                              204



            1    occurred on June 16th and that was the

            2    injection of the Methotrexate.

            3          Q.       Tell us why you believe that the

            4    Methotrexate caused the blindness in his right

            5    eye?

            6          A.       Because it was temporarily

            7    related.  It was profound.  It wasn't just a

            8    small drop in vision.  It went from 20/60

            9    before the injection to only being able to see

           10    light out of the eye in a very short period of

           11    time.  That profound vision loss implies a

           12    catastrophic event rather than a subtle

           13    clinical event that occurred.  This

           14    catastrophic event is most consistent with the

           15    injection of the toxic amount of Methotrexate

           16    in that right eye.

           17          Q.       Were you able to find any

           18    photographs that supported that position?

           19          A.       Yes.  So the photographs taken

           20    on July 1st, show a distinct change in the

           21    retinal appearance in the right eye, and it

           22    shows a hemorrhagic retinopathy with

           23    predominance of retina whitening and retinal

           24    hemorrhage.  This hemorrhage is distinct from

           25    the typical retinitis that we see with

                                                              205



            1    toxoplasmosis.

            2                   Hemorrhage indicates that it

            3    could not have been hypoperfusion from low

            4    blood pressure because if you have decreased

            5    circulation into an area, you just don't have

            6    the blood to bleed into the retina.  So this

            7    hemorrhagic retinopathy implies damage to the

            8    cells in the retina and the cells in the blood

            9    vessels in the retina.  The retina -- there is

           10    diffuse retinal whitening and a hemorrhagic

           11    retinopathy that's distinct in appearance from

           12    what we see with even more defuse toxoplasmic

           13    retinitis.

           14          Q.       Okay.  So to put that more in my

           15    terms, hemorrhagic means it's bleeding?

           16          A.       Yes.  There is blood.  There is

           17    a predominance of blood in the picture.  And if

           18    there is low blood pressure and you're trying

           19    to argue that it was from the hypotension, the

           20    blood is just not getting to the blood vessels.

           21    When you see a central retinal artery

           22    inclusion, for instance, in the retina, you

           23    don't see any blood.  It's just a white retina

           24    because the retina is dead.  Here, not only is

           25    the retina dead, the whitening, but there is a

                                                              206



            1    lot of blood there.

            2          Q.       All right.  Was there anything

            3    in between the Methotrexate and this picture

            4    that you believe may have caused that bleeding

            5    in his eyeball?

            6          A.       I think the Methotrexate did it.

            7          Q.       Now, opposing counsel suggested

            8    to you that he had low blood pressure and was

            9    hospitalized for it.  Would that have caused

           10    that perhaps?

           11          A.       No.  Because as I was trying to

           12    explain, the low blood pressure, the blood is

           13    not getting to retina.  So you're not going to

           14    get a lot of blood in the retina.  It's an

           15    absence of blood.  So this picture is different

           16    than an artery occlusion.

           17          Q.       Do you recall opposing counsel

           18    suggesting that the patient had not complained

           19    about the loss of eyesight until three days

           20    after the injection?

           21          A.       One of the notes it says three

           22    days.  In another phone conversation it says

           23    that it had been dark since the day of

           24    injection.

           25          Q.       Is three days outside the realm

                                                              207



            1    of when the Methotrexate could have done its

            2    damage?

            3          A.       No.  And often times if a few

            4    weeks have gone by, patients have difficulty

            5    remembering, recalling, was it that day, the

            6    next day, the very next day after that.

            1                   THE WITNESS:  79.  Biopsy

            2          negative.  It's additional phone call

            3          details.  Biopsy negative.  Per Dr. Wang,

            4          would like to inject Methotrexate.

            5          Scheduled patient for Thursday, and will

            7    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            8          Q.       And what is your understanding

            9    after reading that?

           10          A.       That he was definitely going to

           11    inject the Methotrexate regardless of the MRI

           12    results.

           13          Q.       And can you tell us why you draw

           14    that conclusion from that document.

           15          A.       Because it says it's scheduled.

           16    The injection is scheduled for Thursday and

           17    will obtain an MRI to rule out lymphoma.

           23          Q.       Let me hand you what's been

           24    marked as Exhibit-25, and ask if you can

           25    identify that for me, please.

            1          A.       July 1st exam.

            2          Q.       And that's the July 1st record

            3    that I was looking for earlier.  What do you

            4    take away from that office visit, if anything?

            5          A.       Vision is dropped to light

            6    perception in the right eye with a fixed pupil.

            7    So it's what we call an amaurotic pupil.  It's

            8    not responding to light.  That means that

            9    there's no, very little, sensation in the

           10    retina.  The vision also in the left eye

           11    dropped to 20/70.

           12          Q.       So is this the official record

           13    that demonstrates that he's blind in the right

           14    eye?

           15          A.       He's light perception in the

           16    right eye, yeah.

           17          Q.       That's all he has?

           18          A.       Yeah.

           19          Q.       And if you look at the provider

           20    plan on Bates stamp 97 -- do you see the

           21    provider plan?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       And it says, presumptive

           24    lymphoma.  Do you see that?

           25          A.       Yes.

            1          Q.       So even after that, after all

            2    that's happened, what's your reading --

            3          A.       Well, then he says --

            4                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

            5                   THE WITNESS:  Gave intraocular

            6          Methotrexate and was worse.

            7    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            8          Q.       Okay.

            9          A.       And would like to take the OR

           10    again for biopsy in the left eye.

           11          Q.       What's your take away from

           12    what's happening on the first of July 2016,

           13    with Dr. Wang and his offices?

           14          A.       Well, now he's considering the

           15    toxoplasmosis with toxoplasmic PCR.

           16          Q.       All right.  So the first time --

           17    well, strike that.  Does this appear to be the

           18    first time that Dr. Wang is doing anything

           19    about actually testing for toxoplasmosis?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       And then he says, we'll see if

           22    Abbey can do it this weekend, right?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       He also says that he's leaving

           25    town, correct?

                                                              211



            1          A.       It says, leaving town.  That's

            2    interesting.  I wasn't sure whether or not that

            3    meant that the doctor was leaving town or the

            4    patient was leaving town.  I guess that meant

            5    the doctor was leaving town, yeah.

            6          Q.       So on 7/1, does it appear to you

            7    that Dr. Wang is saying that he is leaving town

            8    and Dr. Abbey is going to do the testing for

            9    toxoplasmosis?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           12    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           13          Q.       Just to clarify the record, what

           14    is your understanding from reading the notes of

           15    Dr. Wang for 7/1/2016, as to whether he is

           16    going to do the biopsy or someone else is going

           17    to do it?

           18          A.       It looks like another doctor is

           19    going to be doing the biopsy.  He states the

           20    left eye.  The pre-op surgery report says left

           21    eye.  The operative report says his left eye,

           22    but they did the biopsy on July the 2nd in the

           23    right eye.

           24          Q.       Who is they?

           25          A.       Dr. Abbey.

                                                              212



            1          Q.       And does it appear to you that

            2    Dr. Wang was going out of town based on this

            3    note, leaving town?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       Do you know whether Dr. Wang

            6    ever saw Mr. Cook again after this July 1st

            7    office visit?

            8          A.       I don't think he did.

            9          Q.       Do you know whether he actually

           10    saw him when he stated that he was going to be

           11    out of town by accident?

           12          A.       No.

           13          Q.       You never heard that?

           14          A.       No.

           15          Q.       Was toxoplasmosis tested for?

           16          A.       Yes.

           17                         - - -

           21    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           22          Q.       And could you look at Exhibit-26

           23    and identify that for me, please.

           24                   MR. PATTERSON:  The Bates stamp

           25          too, please.

            1                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  It's hard

            2          to read.

            3                   THE WITNESS:  Can we take a

            4          minute?

            5                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Sure.  Of

            6          course.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  Just a minute.

            8                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  You okay

            9          with that, Ken?

           10                   MR. PATTERSON:  Yeah.

           14                   (Whereupon, a brief recess was

           15          taken.)

           19    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           20          Q.       Dr. Colucciello, do you see when

           21    the next office visit was after the 7/2 visit?

           22          A.       Well, the 7/2 was not a visit.

           23    It was -- 7/2 was a surgery.  7/1 was an office

           24    visit.

           25          Q.       Okay.  Then 7/2 was when they

                                                              214



            1    took the toxoplasmosis sample?

            2          A.       The 7/2 was the vitrectomy of

            3    the right eye, which is on multiple occasions

            4    in the operative report and in the drawing

            5    indicates left eye.  Despite the fact that he

            6    did surgery in the right eye.

            7          Q.       Which exhibit number are you

            8    looking at?

            9          A.       26.

           10          Q.       So 26 is the operative report?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       On 7/2, is it your understanding

           13    that they were taking a sample of the right eye

           14    but were repeating throughout the process that

           15    it was actually the left eye?

           16          A.       Yes.

           17          Q.       Do you know why that mistake was

           18    made?  Do you know?

           19          A.       I can't imagine why it was made,

           20    but they were consistent.

           21          Q.       Do you know if it was made?

           22          A.       I deduced that it was the right

           23    eye by the postoperative visits I remember

           24    seeing.

           25          Q.       If you look at -- I can't tell

                                                              215



            1    what that Bates stamp is, but it looks like 117

            2    on that same Exhibit-26.  You'll see a comment

            3    --

            4          A.       117.  Okay.

            5          Q.       Do you see the comment in the

            6    rectangle that's the third rectangle from the

            7    bottom, comments?

            8          A.       Vitreous biopsy right eye, yes.

            9          Q.       Is that inconsistent with the

           10    rest of the document that says left eye?

           11          A.       It's inconsistent with the rest

           12    of the document that says left eye.

           13          Q.       Whether it was the left eye or

           14    the right eye, what was the result of the test?

           15          A.       That it was positive for

           16    toxoplasmosis PCR.

           17          Q.       What was your understanding,

           18    Doctor, as to what happened after that

           19    toxoplasmosis diagnosis was made in July of

           20    2016?

           21          A.       So, again, I don't have the

           22    report, the records, with me.  I know that at

           23    some point patient presented to University

           24    Texas Southwestern.

           25          Q.       For what reason?

                                                              216



            1          A.       But on July 12th, Foscarnet was

            2    administered in the left eye.  I'm not sure why

            3    that was done because toxoplasmic retinitis had

            4    been established.

            5          Q.       And is that medication indicated

            6    for that?

            7          A.       No.

            8                         - - -

            9                   (Whereupon, Exhibit-27 was

           10          marked for identification.)

           12    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           13          Q.       Let me hand you what's marked

           14    27.  Is that the date that you're talking

           15    about?

           16          A.       Yes.  That's the date.

           17          Q.       And tell us what happened on the

           18    date that's --

           19          A.       Patient is here for an injection

           20    of Foscarnet in the left eye post vitreous

           21    biopsy of the right eye, 7/2.

           22          Q.       And so as of 7/12, what's

           23    happening?

           24          A.       As of 7/12, he's started the

           25    Pyrimethamine, Clindamycin, and Folinic Acid

                                                              217



            1    for treatment of the toxoplasmic retinitis.

            2    I'm trying to see if the -- yeah.  The

            3    Foscarnet was injected in the left eye and this

            4    was Dr. Abbey.

            5          Q.       So on the 12th of July, had they

            6    not changed to Dr. Abbey?

            7          A.       Well, it says return in one week

            8    with Dr. Wang for follow-up.  But Dr. Abbey

            9    injected the left eye with the Foscarnet.

           10          Q.       What's Foscarnet for?

           11          A.       A virus.

           12          Q.       Can you think of any reason why

           13    he was using Foscarnet on the left eye at this

           14    point in time?

           15          A.       No.  He would have to be

           16    thinking that there was a viral retinitis in

           17    the left and the toxoplasmic retinitis in the

           18    right.

           19          Q.       Is there any clinical basis for

           20    that conclusion that you're aware of?

           21          A.       Well, I have seen it in an

           22    immunocompromised patient as I presented in

           23    1992, but this patient was not

           24    immunocompromised and would be highly unlikely.

           25    So you're exposing the patient to risks of the

                                                              218



            1    injection of the medication in the eye, the

            2    only eye, that the patient has at this point.

            3          Q.       And at this point of 7/12/2016,

            4    he's essentially blind in the right eye; is

            5    that right?

            6                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to the

            7          form of the question.

            8                   THE WITNESS:  He's absolutely

            9          blind.  No light perception now in the

           10          right eye on 7/12.

           11    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           12          Q.       Okay.  On 7/12, he had no light

           13    perception in the right eye?

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       And so on 7/12, they're now

           16    injecting something into his left eye; is that

           17    right?

           18                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to the

           19          form of the question.

           20                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           21    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           22          Q.       And do have you any

           23    understanding as to why Dr. Abbey was injecting

           24    anything into his left eye in July of 2016?

           25          A.       No.

                                                              219



            1          Q.       Can you see anything that

            2    justifies that based on the medical records

            3    that were provided in this case?

            4          A.       No.

            5          Q.       And ultimately, did he go blind

            6    in the left eye as well?

            7                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

            8                   THE WITNESS:  His vision went to

            9          2200 in the left eye.

           10    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           11          Q.       If you could just give me an

           12    impression of what 2200 feels like, if you

           13    know?

           14          A.       It's the lowest amount of vision

           15    that you can have to ambulate.  So it's

           16    ambulatory vision.

           17          Q.       What do you mean by ambulatory?

           18          A.       Safely walking around.

           19          Q.       Is that what you understand

           20    Mr. Cook to be now with that left eye?

           21          A.       Yes.

           22          Q.       What is your understanding as to

           23    where he is now with the right eye?

           24          A.       He was at no light perception in

           25    the right eye.

            6          Q.       Let me hand you what I marked as

            7    Exhibit-29.  Can you tell us what happened at

            8    the office visit on the 29th.

            9          A.       The 19th.

           10          Q.       I'm sorry, the 19th.

           11          A.       So on the 19th, the patient was

           12    scheduled to see Dr. Wang and did not see Dr.

           13    Wang.

           14          Q.       Who did he see?

           15          A.       Dr. Abbey.

           16          Q.       What do you recall happening at

           17    that meeting based on the medical records that

           18    you saw?

           19          A.       The vision, still no light

           20    perception in the right eye.  Patient still on

           21    Valtrex twice a day, and now taking Daraprim,

           22    25 milligrams, Clindamycin, 450 milligrams four

           23    times a day, and should be on Leucovorin acid

           24    as well.  I don't see that documented.

           25          Q.       If you look at 141, which is

                                                              221



            1    last page, can you look at the provider plan?

            2          A.       Yeah.  PCR positive for

            3    toxoplasmosis.  Folinic Acid, ten milligrams,

            4    four times a day.  That's a very high dose.

            5    Clindamycin, 450 milligrams, four times a day.

            6    Patient has not started Pyrimethamine.  We'll

            7    plan to inject intravitreal Clindamycin next

            8    visit.  It doesn't say which eye.  Stress the

            9    importance of patient starting the

           10    Pyrimethamine.  And they are not giving the

           11    Bactrim DS because of the last visit on July

           12    the -- said he had an allergy to sulfate, but

           13    didn't say the manifestations of the allergy.

           14          Q.       As of 7/19/2016, Doctor, have

           15    they started him on something that would treat

           16    toxoplasmosis?

           17          A.       The Clindamycin would.  The

           18    Daraprim was a very low dose that was

           19    documented, but it didn't say that he was

           20    taking it and the provider plan did not say

           21    that he was taking it.

           22                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

           23    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           24          Q.       So by, I guess, mid July of

           25    2016, there was now a medication that would

                                                              222



            1    treat toxoplasmosis; is that --

            2          A.       Yes.  But the Pyrimethamine

            3    hadn't been started, and it's unclear as to

            4    whether or not the Daraprim had been started.

            5    So it may be inadequately or incompletely

            6    treated.  Let's say that.

            7          Q.       Is there recorded no light

            8    perception in his right eye now?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       What does that mean?

           11          A.       Well, generally, you are not

           12    going to get that back.  And so generally the

           13    treatment then would be for the left eye, but

           14    you've injected the Foscarnet and I'm not sure

           15    why.

           16                         - - -

           18          marked for identification.)

           20    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           21          Q.       Can I hand you what's been

           22    marked Exhibit-30, which is the 7/22/2016

           23    office visit, and tell me what your take away

           24    from that is in terms of the treatment.

           25          A.       So at that point we're on the

                                                              223



            1    Clindamycin, 450 milligrams, four times a day.

            2    It looks like we are on the Daraprim, again, 25

            3    milligrams.  We're still on the Valtrex by

            4    mouth.  I'm not sure if we started the

            5    Pyrimethamine.  I don't see the Folinic Acid

            6    listed in the medications unless I'm missing

            7    that.

            8          Q.       Doctor, can you tell what the

            9    vision is like in his left eye based on these

           10    medical records after July of --

           11          A.       20/40 minus in the left eye on

           12    July the 22nd.

           13          Q.       So at that point in time, can

           14    you tell whether the toxoplasmosis is being

           15    treated effectively?

           16          A.       He injected Clindamycin on that

           17    day and that would be appropriate.  It looks

           18    like it's being treated appropriately there.

           19          Q.       And at some point in time, is it

           20    your opinion that the toxoplasmosis was placed

           21    into remission?

           22          A.       Yes.  It was noted to be

           23    inactive before the surgery on April the 10th,

           24    and it looked like it was rendered inactive by

           25    January 30, 2017.

            1          Q.       So the treatment for

            2    toxoplasmosis, in your opinion, would be

            3    working or not work?

            4          A.       Working.

            5          Q.       And by 7/22, is Dr. Wang seeing

            6    the patient?

            7          A.       No.

            8          Q.       And Texas Retina was still

            9    seeing the patient, though, correct?

           10          A.       Yes.

           17    Exhibit-31.  I'll ask if you can identify this

           18    for me, please.

           22                   THE WITNESS:  This is a Texas

           23          Retina Associates visit from July 28,

           24          2016.

                                                              225



            1          Q.       Who saw the patient that day,

            2    can you tell?

            3          A.       It's Dr. Abbey again.

            4          Q.       What's the status of his right

            5    eye on that day, if you can tell?

            6          A.       Vision still no light

            7    perception.  That's not going to change.  The

            8    left eye 20/50 minus and --

            9          Q.       Is he being treated for

           10    toxoplasmosis at this point?

           11          A.       Being treated for toxoplasmosis

           12    and they instituted a very large dose of

           13    Prednisone daily, 60 milligrams a day.

           14          Q.       In your opinion, is that too

           15    high of a dose?

           16          A.       It can be tolerated for a short

           17    period of time.  I would try to tapper it down

           18    from there relatively quickly.  I would also

           19    protect the stomach since that dosage has a

           20    very high risk for peptic ulcer disease, and it

           21    also can cause osteoporosis.  So I would make

           22    sure that the patient had been taking ing

           23    vitamin D and calcium, if I was going to

           24    continue that large dose of Prednisone.

           25          Q.       Did you understand that after

                                                              226



            1    that point in time his care was transferred

            2    over to Southwest Medical --

            3          A.       Yes.

            4          Q.       Did you look at those medical

            5    records too?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       What was your impression as to

            8    the treatment there?

            9          A.       We discussed that briefly

           10    previously.  They discontinued all the oral

           11    medications on August the 19th because of

           12    possible side effects, and they instituted a

           13    one medicine at a time therapeutic regiment to

           14    try to treat the toxoplasmosis.  So they

           15    started the Pyrimethamine with Leucovorin and

           16    Clindamycin back on August 23rd, and then

           17    September 19th the Clindamycin was

           18    discontinued.

           19          Q.       When did the toxoplasmosis go

           20    inactive?

           21          A.       I don't have those records in

           22    front of me.  But certainly by January 30th it

           23    was inactive.

           24          Q.       Was that after the care had been

           25    transferred?

                                                              227



            1          A.       Yes.

            2          Q.       I'm going to ask you a series of

            3    questions, Doctor, based on the work that

            4    you've done relating to the standard of care.

            5    Do you have an opinion about whether Dr. Wang

            6    fell below the standard of care in injecting

            7    Mr. Cook's right eye with Methotrexate?

            8          A.       Yes.  Fell below the standard of

            9    care.

           10          Q.       Why do you take that position?

           11          A.       Because he hadn't established a

           12    diagnosis.  The most likely diagnosis could

           13    have been recognized given the typical

           14    appearance of the toxoplasmic retinitis.  That

           15    the dose that he used was twice the standard

           16    dose.

           17          Q.       What about the systemic versus

           18    the --

           19                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to the

           20          form of no question.  Object to the form

           21          of the question.

           22                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  That's

           23          fine.  I'll fix it.

           24    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           25          Q.       Do you have an opinion as to

                                                              228



            1    whether Dr. Wang fell below the standard of

            2    care in injecting Methotrexate into the eyeball

            3    as opposed to some other method?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       What is your opinion?

            6          A.       If your concern is that there is

            7    life threatening lymphoma, that systemic

            8    treatment would be in order before intravitreal

            9    treatment.  An observation to see whether or

           10    not the response was obtain.

           11          Q.       Is it your opinion that he fell

           12    below the standard of care in injecting it as

           13    opposed to using it systemically?

           14          A.       Either using it systemically or

           15    obtaining oncologic consultation with another

           16    physician who is used to using systemic

           17    Methotrexate for treatment of systemic or CNS

           18    lymphoma.

           19          Q.       Neither of which he did,

           20    correct?

           21          A.       Correct.

           22          Q.       Do you have an opinion as to

           23    whether the blindness in the right eye of

           24    Mr. Cook was proximately caused by the failure

           25    to meet the standard of care via Methotrexate

                                                              229



            1    treatment?

            2          A.       Yes.  The proximate cause of

            3    blindness in the right eye was because of

            4    failure to meet the standard of care.

            5          Q.       Okay.  Do you believe that Dr.

            6    Wang was negligent in his treatment of Mr. Cook

            7    in his administration of Methotrexate?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       And is that for the same three

           10    reasons that you gave before?

           11          A.       Yes.

           12          Q.       And do you believe that the

           13    proximate cause was the blindness in his right

           14    eye as a result of that negligence?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16          Q.       Do you have an opinion on

           17    whether Dr. Wang breached his standard of care

           18    in his diagnosis of Mr. Cook's disease?

           19          A.       Yes.

           20          Q.       What is your opinion?

           21          A.       The standard of care would have

           22    been that the primary consideration would be

           23    toxoplasmic retinitis with at least empiric

           24    antitoxoplasmic therapy especially after so

           25    many weeks had gone by without improvement.

            1                   MR. PATTERSON:  Responsiveness.

            2    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            3          Q.       Do you have an opinion on

            4    whether Dr. Wang breached his standard of care

            5    in his diagnosis of Mr. Cook's disease?

            6          A.       Yes.  He breached the standard

            7    of care.

            8          Q.       How so?

            9          A.       Because so many weeks went by

           10    without apparent response or worsening and the

           11    diagnosis was not considered.

           12          Q.       Do you believe that the

           13    empirical evidence demonstrated that he should

           14    have tested for toxoplasmosis?

           15          A.       Yes.  Or treated empirically

           16    with antibiotics, antitoxoplasmic agents, to

           17    see a response without the need for a vitreous

           18    biopsy.

           19          Q.       Is it your opinion that he

           20    breached the standard of care in not doing

           21    those things?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       And do you have an opinion as to

           24    whether not diagnosing the toxoplasmosis timely

           25    was the proximate causation of blindness in the

                                                              231



            1    right eye?

            2          A.       Yes, it was.

            3          Q.       How do you arrive at that

            4    opinion?

            5          A.       Because an appropriately timely

            6    diagnosis would have resulted in earlier

            7    treatment, would have resulted in no injection

            8    of Methotrexate, would have resulted in

            9    preservation of vision and preservation of the

           10    eye.

           11          Q.       Do you have an opinion on

           12    whether Dr. Wang violated his standard of care

           13    in the testing he ordered in trying to

           14    determine the diagnosis for Mr. Cook's disease?

           15          A.       Yes.  Toxoplasmic PCR should

           16    have been tested initially.

           17          Q.       And do you have an opinion as to

           18    what would have happened had that been tested?

           19          A.       That would have been positive

           20    and he would have had his answer sooner.

           21          Q.       And do you believe that to be an

           22    independent proximate causation of the

           23    blindness in Mr. Cook's right eye?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       How so?

                                                              232



            1          A.       Because arriving at a proper

            2    diagnosis earlier would have saved the eye.

            3          Q.       Do you have an opinion on

            4    whether Dr. Wang had any grounds to use

            5    Methotrexate under this circumstance?

            6          A.       There did not appear to be any

            7    grounds to use intravitreal Methotrexate in the

            8    right eye.  There was no explanation of why it

            9    would have been bilateral, and there was no

           10    explanation as to why if you thought it was

           11    primary vitreoretinal lymphoma that he selected

           12    treatment of the right eye with the

           13    Methotrexate rather than bilateral treatment

           14    given the fact that there was an area of

           15    involvement with the left eye that was

           16    document.

           17          Q.       Do you have an opinion as to how

           18    the Methotrexate resulted in the blindness of

           19    Mr. Cook in his right eye?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       Could you tell us what that is,

           22    please.

           23          A.       I think that the double the dose

           24    of this chemotherapeutic agent was toxic to the

           25    retina, either by osmotic property or by

                                                              233



            1    cytotoxicity to the normal tissue.

            2                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Few more

            3          seconds and I think I'm going to wrap

            4          this up.

            5    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            6          Q.       Do you have an opinion as to

            7    whether the loss of vision in the left eye, to

            8    the extent that's it's been lost, was caused by

            9    toxoplasmosis or something else?

           10                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to the

           11          form.

           12                   THE WITNESS:  I don't feel that

           13          the vision in the left eye was lost

           14          because of the toxoplasmosis, which was

           15          inactive and outside of the macular

           16          region.

           17    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           18          Q.       If Dr. Wang and Dr. Yee testify

           19    that it was inevitable that this patient was

           20    going to go blind because of toxoplasmosis

           21    regardless of whether they injected him with

           22    Methotrexate or not, what would your response

           23    be?

           24                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           25                   THE WITNESS:  That's incorrect.

                                                              234



            1                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  What's the

            2          basis of the objection?

            3                   MR. PATTERSON:  That misstates

            4          their opinion.

            5                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Okay.

            6          Assuming that's their opinion.  I assume

            7          that's going to be --

            8                   MR. PATTERSON:  He wouldn't

            9          assume facts for me.  Never mind.

           10                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Your's

           11          were, assume my client is an angel, is

           12          he?  That's a good question.

           13                   MR. PATTERSON:  I object to

           14          anything else.  It was vague and it was

           15          open-ended and I object to the form of

           16          the question.

           17                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  I'll

           18          rephrase.

           19    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           20          Q.       If Dr. Yee testifies that

           21    Mr. Cook was going to go blind by reason of

           22    toxoplasmosis regardless of the conduct of Dr.

           23    Wang, what would your opinion be in response,

           24    if any?

           25                   MR. PATTERSON:  Form.

                                                              235



            1                   THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  Can

            2          you repeat that one more time.

            3    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            4          Q.       Sure.  If Dr. Yee testifies and

            5    takes the position that Mr. Cook was going to

            6    go blind in his left eye and in his right eye

            7    based on toxoplasmosis regardless of the

            8    conduct of Dr. Wang, would you have an opinion

            9    in response to that?

           10                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           11                   THE WITNESS:  Oh.  I would say

           12          that's incorrect.

           13    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           14          Q.       And why would you say that's

           15    incorrect?

           16          A.       Because the toxoplasmosis in the

           17    left eye was inactive and did not cause the

           18    ultimate vision loss.  It was unfortunately

           19    from the after the retinal detachment occurred

           20    after the surgery in the left eye.

           21          Q.       When you say it was inactive, is

           22    that because it was treated?

           23          A.       Yes.  And it was indicated in

           24    the medical records that the retinitis was

           25    inactive preoperatively.  And then the right

                                                              236



            1    eye, of course if it had been diagnosed

            2    appropriately in a timely fashion and the eye

            3    had not been exposed to a toxic dose of the

            4    Methotrexate, the vision would not have been

            5    lost.

            6                   MR. PATTERSON:  Form and

            7          responsiveness.

            8    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

            9          Q.       If Dr. Yee or Dr. Wang testify

           10    the Methotrexate is a mild drug and it had

           11    nothing to do with the blindness in the right

           12    eye, would you have an opinion?

           13          A.       It's not a mild drug.  It's

           14    significant chemotherapeutic agent.

           15          Q.       And what would your response be

           16    to their challenge to you that it didn't have

           17    anything to do with the blindness in the right

           18    eye?

           19          A.       That could be incorrect.

           20          Q.       And why is that?

           21          A.       Because the Methotrexate was

           22    injected and was given in an overdose at twice

           23    the normal amount and the vision loss was so

           24    profound immediately after or very shortly

           25    thereafter the injection of the Methotrexate.

            1          Q.       Based on clinical practice and

            2    your education, if Dr. Yee took the position

            3    that there was a certain amount of Methotrexate

            4    in the syringe but it was just there and not

            5    used, what would your response be to that, if

            6    any?

            7                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to the

            8          form.

            9                   THE WITNESS:  We have

           10          documentation five times in the records

           11          that 800 micrograms was used.  It would

           12          be difficult to assume anything other

           13          than 800 micrograms was used.

           14    BY MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:

           15          Q.       If Dr. Wang or Dr. Yee take the

           16    position that the lymphoma in the eyeball is

           17    more prevalent as a disease than toxoplasmosis

           18    in the eye, what would your response to that

           19    be?

           20                   MR. PATTERSON:  Object to form.

           22          Q.       What would your opinion in

           23    response to that be, if any?

            4          A.       Because toxoplasmic retinitis is

            5    far, far more prevalent than primary

            6    vitreoretinal lymphoma.

            7          Q.       And that's based on the medical

            8    literature and your own experience?

            9          A.       Epidemiologic studies, medical

           10    literature.

           11          Q.       Is that what's taught in the med

           12    schools?

           13          A.       Yes.

           14                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Okay.  Ken,

           15          I think that the court reporter and

           16          videographer are going to hold us hostage

           17          if we don't stop.  So I'm going to pass

           18          to you for now.  I may have a few more

           19          questions, but I'll try not to.

           20                   MR. PATTERSON:  I just have a

           21          few.

           22    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           23          Q.       Doctor, when you say there was a

           24    profound immediate change, you're talking about

           25    the -- from the time of 6/16 to the date of 7/1

                                                              239



            1    when the pictures were taken, that indicated

            2    the profound change; is that right?

            3          A.       I listen to patients, you know,

            4    when we question them in the office visit.  The

            5    patient said, well before July 1st that the

            6    vision had been lost.

            7          Q.       All right.  But the profundity

            8    of the loss was illustrated by the studies and

            9    the photographs that you saw from July 1st?

           10          A.       No.  The profundity of the loss

           11    was demonstrated by the performance of the

           12    patient in terms of visual acuity.  The vision

           13    had dropped from 20/60 before the injection to

           14    light perception and there wasn't any movement

           15    of the pupil, which we call an amaurotic pupil,

           16    which means that the eye is blind.

           17          Q.       But that measurement, that

           18    finding, was 16 days later?

           19          A.       That's when the patient was able

           20    to, because of a medical emergency, next show

           21    up in the office.

           22          Q.       Right.

           23          A.       But also I listen, we listen, to

           24    patients and by history it occurred either on

           25    the 16th or three days, within three days,

                                                              240



            1    according to the medical records.

            2          Q.       But you're not saying -- all I'm

            3    getting at is, when you talk about the

            4    measurements, those measurements were not made

            5    until he presented for evaluation, correct?

            6          A.       That's correct.

            7          Q.       Wouldn't you expect every

            8    provider at Paris Hospital to be recording on

            9    almost daily basis of the patient complaining

           10    of being blind in one eye?

           11          A.       Not necessarily if --

           12          Q.       They were just --

           13                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Wow.  Ken,

           14          let him answer.

           15    BY MR. PATTERSON:

           16          Q.       So not necessarily?

           17          A.       Well, I have to say that I did

           18    review the records from Paris Hospital.  And if

           19    there was a possibility of a life threatening

           20    emergency, then the doctors may not necessarily

           21    have asked the patient about visual acuity.

           22          Q.       In the -- it's your opinion --

           23    to be real clear, it's your opinion that the

           24    vision of the left eye was not lost due to

           25    toxoplasmosis because through the treatment

                                                              241



            1    initiated by Abbey and completed by UT

            2    Southwestern, that became inactive by January

            3    of 2017, true?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       Okay.  There was a time that you

            6    found as you went through the records that the

            7    patient actually improved on the antiviral

            8    medications, but just not to a great degree.

            9    Would that be a fair way to describe that

           10    improvement that you noted?

           11          A.       I didn't notice any improvement

           12    objectively.  The physical examination did not

           13    show any signs of improvement.  The retinitis

           14    continued to be active according to the medical

           15    records.  The vitreous inflammation continued

           16    to be pretty robust according to the medical

           17    records, and I did not see any evidence for any

           18    improvement based upon the clinical examination

           19    that I reviewed.

           20          Q.       Trying to find the words that

           21    you used.  There was documented that it was a

           22    little better in March, March 31st, and then it

           23    continued to improve as of after the antiviral

           24    injections as of 4/28.

           25          A.       What is it that you're referring

                                                              242



            1    to?  Are you referring to the visual acuity?

            2          Q.       Yes.  The visual acuity.

            3          A.       So the visual acuity is not the

            4    indicator for clinical improvement or

            5    non-improvement.  It's the anatomical

            6    appearance of the retinitis and the lesions.

            7    One can vary in their performance on the visual

            8    acuity, one line, two lines, three lines, much

            9    different than coming in and just being able to

           10    see light versus 20/60.  That is a profound

           11    difference.  So what I'm referring to is

           12    clinical improvement based on the appearance of

           13    the retinitis.

           14          Q.       Where was the toxoplasmosis

           15    lesions found on the retina of John Cook during

           16    the spring, March, April, and May?  Where were

           17    the lesions of toxoplasmosis in his eye?

           18          A.       In the midperipheral fundus in

           19    both eyes.

           20          Q.       And how many patches were there?

           21          A.       It was one patch in both eyes

           22    that were documented.

           23          Q.       Would it be uncommon for there

           24    to be multiple patches of retinitis, of

           25    toxoplasmosis?

                                                              243



            1          A.       There could be, but it's not the

            2    most common presentation.

            3          Q.       How rare it is or how uncommon

            4    is it to have multiple patches of

            5    toxoplasmosis?

            6          A.       Bilaterality if that's what

            7    you're referring to, is not uncommon.

            8          Q.       No.  In one eye.  Multiple

            9    patches in one eye.

           10          A.       When you've had it in the past,

           11    they could be there.

           12          Q.       If you had it in the past, there

           13    would be scars, wouldn't there?

           14          A.       Generally.

           15          Q.       So how many patches can there be

           16    of toxoplasmosis in a signal eye?

           17          A.       You can have multiple foci.

           18          Q.       You can have multiple foci --

           19          A.       I can't give you chapter and

           20    verse in terms of percentages.

           21          Q.       Okay.  So you can't say whether

           22    it's uncommon or frequent?

           23          A.       I can't give you chapter and

           24    verse in terms of an exact percentage.

           25          Q.       Should it be considered in

                                                              244



            1    trying to reach a diagnosis of whether

            2    toxoplasmosis exists?

            3          A.       Not generally.

            4          Q.       Not generally.  That means --

            5          A.       No.  The answer is no.

            6          Q.       Not ever?

            7          A.       No.

            8          Q.       Okay.  John Cook was not

            9    immunocompromised when he came to see Dr.

           10    Spencer and Dr. Wang, true?

           11          A.       There was no indication that he

           12    had any immunocompromised status.

           13          Q.       He had never been treated, by

           14    history, with steroids; is that true?

           15          A.       That's not true.  He had had

           16    Flonase nasal spray, which of course is a

           17    steroid, but that would not induce an

           18    immunocompromised status.

           19          Q.       Am I right in saying that you

           20    only treat -- you've only treated toxoplasmosis

           21    six times this year.  Is that what your

           22    testimony was?

           23          A.       Typically, I see about five, six

           24    times a year.

           25          Q.       Okay.  All right.

                                                              245



            1          A.       Typically.

            2          Q.       When you're -- I'm not going to

            3    ask that question.  I'll wait for that.

            4                   MR. PATTERSON:  That's all I

            5          have for right now.  Thank you.

            6                   MR. MASTROGIOVANNI:  Okay.  I'll

            7          reserve for later.  That's all I have.

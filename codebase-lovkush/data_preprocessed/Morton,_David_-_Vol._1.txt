 5              MR. HOOVER:  Before we go on, why don't we
 6   put on the usual stipulations.  That all objections,
 7   except as to form, all motions, except as to strike,
 8   are reserved until the time of trial.  An objection
 9   by one defendant is good for all.  And an appearance
10   here today does not waive any jurisdictional or
11   service arguments.
12              MR. BECERRA:  I can't agree with any of
13   those stipulations.
14              MR. HOOVER:  Okay.  Fair enough.
15              MR. HIGGINS:  They're in the pretrial
16   order.
17              MR. HOOVER:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I appreciate
18   that you can't agree with them.
19              MR. BECERRA:  That's fine.  I understand
20   your position.  I just can't agree with them at this
21   point.
22              MR. HOOVER:  Fair enough.
23              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are now on the
24   record.  The date today is June 26, 2018, and the
0007
 1   time is approximately 9:34 a.m.  This is the
 2   video-recorded deposition of David Morton being taken
 3   in the matter of David C. Morton and Barbara Morton
 4   versus Carrier Corporation, et al., Case Number
 5   17-3759.
 6       This matter is being heard in the Commonwealth of
 7   Massachusetts, Superior Court Department of the Trial
 8   Court.  The deposition today is being held at the
 9   Hilton Garden Inn located at 59 Andrews Parkway,
10   Devens, Massachusetts.  My name is Patrick Blaskopt.
11   I am a legal videographer representing The Varallo
12   Group.  The court reporter is Sandra Raymond
13   representing Eppley Court Reporting.  Counsel will be
14   noted on the stenographic record.  At this time, the
15   witness will be sworn in, and then we may proceed.
16   
17              DAVID C. MORTON, Deponent, having been
18   satisfactorily identified and duly sworn by the
19   Notary Public, deposes and states as follows:
20              MR. BECERRA:  Should we do appearances,
21   Mark, before we get started?
22              MR. HOOVER:  Well, the appearances are
23   generally noted on the stenographic record.

 1   DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. HOOVER:
 2        Q.    I'm happy to introduce myself, sir.  As I
 3   mentioned when I first met you outside, my name is
 4   Mark Hoover.
 5        A.    Right.
 6        Q.    I represent one of the defendants in this
 7   matter.  Just for the record, before we get started,
 8   would you state your full name?
 9        A.    David C. Morton.
10        Q.    Mr. Morton, have you ever been deposed
11   before?
12        A.    Have I been to what?
13        Q.    Deposed.  Have you ever been asked a
14   series of questions by a bunch of lawyers in a room
15   before?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Okay.  How many times have you been
18   deposed?
19        A.    Once.
20        Q.    And under what circumstances?  Why were
21   you deposed?
22        A.    It was an automobile accident, 1989.
23        Q.    Okay.  Were you suing somebody, or were
24   you being sued?
0009
 1        A.    No.  We were suing someone.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And it was a result of a personal
 3   injury from an automobile accident?
 4        A.    Exactly.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Other than that one deposition, any
 6   other depositions?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So what I'm going to do is I'm
 9   going to go over just some general kind of ground
10   rules for today.  I'm going to be asking you the
11   majority of the questions today.  As we go along, if
12   there's a question that I ask that you don't
13   understand or it doesn't seem clear, just let me
14   know, and I'll rephrase it.  Okay?
15        A.    Yup.
16        Q.    Otherwise, I'm going to assume that you
17   understood my question fully when you answered it.
18   Fair enough?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  All of your answers, responses to
21   my questions, have to be verbal.  You and I will
22   understand shrugs of the shoulder and nods of the
23   head, but that doesn't come down in the recorded
24   portion here that's being taken down by the
0010
 1   stenographer.  Okay?
 2        A.    Correct.  Okay.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And then the other thing, too, is
 4   sometimes you might know where I'm going with my
 5   question and might start to answer it before I
 6   finish.  It's just normal human conversation, but if
 7   you could just wait for me to finish my question,
 8   I'll wait for you to finish your answer, and that
 9   way, again, it comes down clearer in the record.
10   Okay?
11        A.    Correct.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    Okay.
14        Q.    Also, if you need a break, sir, at any
15   time, for any reason, stretch, restroom, glass of
16   water, a cup of coffee, just let me know, and we can
17   take a break.  Okay?
18        A.    All right.
19        Q.    All right.  The only thing on that is I
20   would ask, if there's a question pending, we answer
21   that one last question and then take our break.
22   Okay?
23        A.    Yeah.
24        Q.    All right.  And we got your name as David
0011
 1   Morton, and what's your date of birth, sir?
 2        A.    12/23/1940.
 3        Q.    And that makes you how old today?
 4        A.    Seventy-six.
 5        Q.    Where were you born, sir?
 6        A.    Groton, Mass.
 7        Q.    What is your current address?
 8        A.    180 Gay Road, G-A-Y, Groton, Mass. 01450.
 9        Q.    And how long have you lived at 180 Gay
10   Road in Groton?
11        A.    Since 1961.
12        Q.    And who else, if anyone, lives with you at
13   180 Gay Road?
14        A.    My wife, Barbara Morton.  That's Barbara
15   M. Morton.
16        Q.    What's her maiden name, sir?
17        A.    Finan, F-I-N-A-N.
18        Q.    Two of the toughest questions that you'll
19   encounter today.  Her date of birth?
20        A.    5/31/42.
21        Q.    And then the even tougher question, your
22   date of marriage?
23        A.    '61.  3/17/61.
24        Q.    There you go.  And other than your
0012
 1   marriage to Barbara in 1961, any other marriages?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Sir, are you currently on any
 4   medications that might affect your ability to testify
 5   or your memory?
 6        A.    No.
 7        Q.    Other than the lawsuit that you filed as a
 8   result of that automobile accident, have you ever
 9   filed any other lawsuits?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    Any prior workers' compensation claims?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Did you do anything to prepare for today's
14   deposition, aside from speaking to your lawyer?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Okay.  Did you meet with your lawyer?  I
17   don't want to know what you talked about, but did you
18   meet with your lawyer to prepare for today's
19   deposition?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    When was the first -- was today the first
22   time you've met your lawyer?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    Okay.  Had you met with him prior to
0013
 1   today's deposition?
 2        A.    Prior.
 3        Q.    Okay.  How many times have you met with
 4   your lawyer -- again, I don't want conversations --
 5   before today's deposition?
 6        A.    Twice.
 7        Q.    Okay.  When was the first time?
 8        A.    When this whole thing started.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    It would have been December maybe.
11   December.
12        Q.    Of 2017?
13        A.    Yeah.
14        Q.    And you said there was one other time that
15   you met with your lawyer?
16        A.    Yeah.
17        Q.    And when was that, sir?
18        A.    Basically, it was a week ago.
19        Q.    Okay.  And these meetings were in person,
20   sir?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    And were they up here in the -- in the
23   area?
24        A.    In the area.
0014
 1        Q.    In Groton.  Okay.  Did you review any sort
 2   of documents or anything to prepare for today's
 3   deposition?
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    Did you review any type of work records or
 6   Social Security records?
 7        A.    Just in my mind.
 8        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Any sort of product
 9   lists or anything along those lines to prepare?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    Did you review any kind of photographs?
12   Brochures?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    Did you do any type of Internet research
15   to prepare?
16        A.    No.  That's definitely no.
17        Q.    Did you speak with anyone, again, aside
18   from your attorneys?  Any other former coworkers?
19   Supervisors?  Anything along those lines?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    At some point in time, sir, and you said
22   maybe when this whole thing got started back in
23   December of 2017, you decided to file a lawsuit; is
24   that correct?
0015
 1        A.    That's correct.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And when did you come to that
 3   decision to file a lawsuit, if you recall?
 4        A.    I -- I looked into it.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And how did that -- explain that.
 6   What do you mean you "looked into it"?
 7        A.    There's an association that I had talked
 8   to.
 9              MR. BECERRA:  Mr. Morton, I don't want you
10   to discuss any conversations you may have had with
11   any lawyers along the way.  So if your answer to the
12   question involves any conversations with lawyers, I'm
13   going to instruct you not to answer.  Okay?
14              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
15        A.    It was not lawyers.
16        Q.    Okay.
17        A.    It's just an association to help people
18   with this cancer.  If you needed some help on finding
19   a doctor or medical.
20        Q.    Do you remember the name of this
21   association?

 7   particular association?

10   in print, or do you remember?
11        A.    I'm pretty sure it was TV.
12        Q.    Okay.  And so did you see something on TV
13   that had, like, a phone number --
14        A.    Yeah.
15        Q.    -- and you called kind of thing?  Okay.

18   doctors?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  Any other recommendations in terms
21   of attorneys or anything along those lines?
22        A.    For assistance.  For -- if you needed
23   assistance for medical payments and stuff like that.
24        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  Did you have to fill
0017
 1   anything out, or was this more over the telephone?
 2        A.    This was basically over the telephone.
 3        Q.    Uh-huh.  Okay.  And at some point, you and
 4   your wife retained The Ferraro Law Firm; is that
 5   correct?
 6        A.    That is correct.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And, again, I don't want to know
 8   anything about what you and your wife spoke with,
 9   with respect to The Ferraro Law Firm, but how did you
10   come in contact with them?
11              MR. BECERRA:  In other words, how did you
12   learn about us?
13   BY MR. HOOVER:

17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    The first law firm that I talked to
19   recommend -- somehow got them involved.

23        Q.    -- and they, in turn, may have steered you
24   towards this particular firm?
0018
 1        A.    Correct.
 2        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  Did you -- once you were
 3   kind of steered or referred to, as it were, to The

 5   research about them?  Visit their website or anything
 6   like that?

12        A.    Oh, it is fair.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    All right.  It's not perfect.  She had a
15   leg injury some years ago and never really recovered

18   accident or --

14        Q.    And you said she worked there for about 10
15   to 15 years.  Do you have a time frame of when that

 5        A.    Yeah.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And other than working for
 7   Dr. Lewis for those 10 to 15 years, and, obviously,
 8   taking care of your children, any other employment
 9   that she had?
10        A.    No.

18   obviously, happened quite some time ago.
19        A.    Yeah.
20        Q.    If you don't remember, sir, that's

 8   Devens.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    He was in charge of the maintenance of the
11   refrigeration equipment.
12        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever work with your father
13   here at Fort Devens when he was a refrigeration
14   engineer?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  And when did you -- we'll get into
17   more your employment in a little bit.  I'm just
18   trying to get kind of a thumbnail sketch.  When did
19   you first work with your father as a refrigeration
20   engineer?
21        A.    Basically in 1950.
22        Q.    Okay.
23        A.    Obviously, it was not the whole time.
24        Q.    That's the age of 10 for you?
0026
 1        A.    Yeah.
 2        Q.    So you were still in school at that time?
 3        A.    Yes.
 4        Q.    Okay.
 5        A.    It was either evenings or weekends.
 6        Q.    Gotcha.  And was his work limited in terms
 7   of geographically to Fort Devens?
 8        A.    No.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Did he work for a company, or did
10   he own his own business, or both?
11        A.    Well, both.
12        Q.    Yeah.  Okay.  Which came first?  Did he
13   work for somebody and then started his own or vice
14   versa?
15        A.    Yeah.  He worked for Fort Devens.  Uncle
16   Sam.
17        Q.    Gotcha.
18        A.    And through word of mouth, that's how he
19   started Groton Refrigeration.
20        Q.    I gotcha.  Okay.
21        A.    Somewhere in the 1940s.
22        Q.    All right.  So when you were working and
23   helping your father at the age of 10 when you
24   started, it was already Groton Refrigeration, right?
0027
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    Okay.  But before then, he had been
 3   employed by Uncle Sam and Fort Devens?
 4        A.    That was his main employment.
 5        Q.    Gotcha.  How long had he been working for
 6   Fort Devens before in the 1940s he started out on his
 7   own?
 8        A.    It was -- he started at Fort Devens back
 9   in right around the 1940s.
10        Q.    Okay.
11        A.    I don't know the exact date.
12        Q.    Uh-huh.  And then he was employed by them
13   for a period of time and then decided to basically go
14   out on his own?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    No.  Help me out.
17        A.    Basically, he started Groton Refrigeration
18   as a part-time.
19        Q.    Okay.  Did it ever become full-time?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Okay.  So while he was employed by Fort
22   Devens, he would also be doing some side work, as it
23   were, as Groton Refrigeration?
24        A.    Correct.
0028
 1        Q.    Okay.  When he was working for Fort
 2   Devens, that was full-time work, correct?
 3        A.    Correct.
 4        Q.    And was that, again, limited, then, to --
 5   geographically, his work would have been just on Fort
 6   Devens, correct?
 7        A.    Correct.
 8        Q.    But he might do part-time work under
 9   Groton Refrigeration for other customers?
10        A.    Correct.
11        Q.    All right.  When you helped him out
12   starting in 1950 at the age of 10, is most of your
13   work with your dad under the umbrella of Groton
14   Refrigeration?  In other words, when he was doing
15   some of his side jobs?
16        A.    Correct.
17        Q.    Would you ever have come here to work at
18   Fort Devens with your father as part of his work when
19   he was employed by them?  Do you see what I'm saying?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever do that?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    Okay.  When your father passed away in 19
24   -- roughly 1971, was he still working, or had he
0029
 1   retired?
 2        A.    He had retired.
 3        Q.    Okay.  When did your father retire?
 4        A.    I'm going to say probably five years prior
 5   to his passing.
 6        Q.    So roughly 1965?
 7        A.    Yeah, you know.
 8        Q.    Okay.  And when he retired in 1965, did
 9   Groton Refrigeration continue, or did the business
10   cease when he retired?
11        A.    No.  The business continued.
12        Q.    Okay.  And who began, or who took over for
13   Groton Refrigeration when your father died in 1965?
14        A.    No, he didn't die in --
15        Q.    I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  When he retired in
16   1965.  Thank you.  Sorry.
17        A.    Basically, he continued to work until he
18   passed.
19        Q.    Okay.  So he retired in '65 from Fort
20   Devens?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    Continued Groton Refrigeration until his
23   passing?
24        A.    Correct.
0030
 1        Q.    All right.  And then upon his passing, did
 2   Groton Refrigeration continue to exist, or did that
 3   business cease to operate?
 4        A.    It continued to operate for about a year.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And for that year, who was
 6   operating Groton Refrigeration?
 7        A.    I was.
 8        Q.    Okay.  And then the business wrapped up in
 9   approximately 1972?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    Okay.  Other than working as a
12   refrigeration engineer for Fort Devens and then also
13   through his own business, did your father have any
14   other employment that you recall?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Okay.  Your mother, she is also deceased?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    What was your mother's name?
19        A.    Agnus Duguay Morton.
20        Q.    And when did she pass, sir?
21        A.    She passed at 69 also.
22        Q.    At the age of 69?

0031
 1   sir?

 2        Q.    So early 2000 maybe?
 3        A.    Yeah.  Yeah.
 4        Q.    Do you recall how old he was at the time
 5   of the accident?
 6        A.    No, I don't.

15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    And what -- is he still living?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    What was his name, sir?
19        A.    Donald Morton.
20        Q.    And when did Donald pass?
21        A.    Donald passed a year ago.
22        Q.    I'm sorry to hear that.

24        Q.    How old was Donald when he passed?
0034
 1        A.    Seventy -- no.  Eighty-five.
 2        Q.    Do you recall the cause of his death?
 3        A.    Colon cancer.
 4        Q.    What did Donald do for a living?
 5        A.    Auto bodywork.  Painting.
 6        Q.    Did he ever do any sort of auto
 7   maintenance, auto repair work, or was this strictly
 8   bodywork type of deal?
 9        A.    Most of it was painting.
10        Q.    Okay.  Did he ever work in terms of auto
11   repair?  And by that I mean, like, if a car is in an
12   accident, sometimes you need to have fenders pulled
13   out and Bondo work.
14        A.    He worked at a place that -- they were a
15   separate company, but he worked in the -- that's
16   where he got a lot of his work.
17        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall the name of that
18   company?
19        A.    B & D Paint.  B & D -- B & D Paint
20   Company.
21        Q.    Do you recall where they were located?
22        A.    Florida.  West Palm Beach.
23        Q.    Is it fair to say you never worked with
24   your brother at B & D Paint Company?
0035
 1        A.    I tried it for a couple of summers on
 2   part-time --
 3        Q.    Uh-huh.
 4        A.    -- and decided it wasn't for me.
 5        Q.    And when you say you "tried it," was that
 6   the painting aspect of cars?
 7        A.    Yeah.  Basically, I worked on getting the
 8   cars ready, whether to -- sanding, masking them.  In
 9   other words, the prep work before he actually did the
10   painting.
11        Q.    Gotcha.  Did any of that prep work involve
12   -- and I'm assuming a lot of these cars -- and you
13   always get in trouble when you assume anything -- but
14   these cars, for example, have been involved in an
15   accident, and they just kind of needed to be repaired
16   and repainted?
17        A.    Yeah.  Dents or scratches, yeah.
18        Q.    Were you involved in trying to repair and
19   get the cars ready for your brother, then, to paint?
20        A.    Yes.  As long as it wasn't a major --
21   little dings and dents and stuff like that, yes.
22        Q.    Did you ever -- in terms of this work here
23   for a couple of summers -- ever have to work with the
24   Bondo and the --
0036
 1        A.    Correct.
 2        Q.    And you mentioned the sanding.  So you'd
 3   have to -- would you put the Bondo on the car, let it
 4   dry, smooth it out?
 5        A.    Yup.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall of the brand name of
 7   any of the Bondo that you used?
 8        A.    No.
 9        Q.    When you say you did this for a couple of
10   summers -- and, again, we'll kind of get into
11   employment as we go along -- but generally, when did
12   this take place?  When were you down there working
13   with your brother?
14        A.    Oh, probably ninth, tenth grade.
15        Q.    Oh, again, with the 10-year difference, he
16   would have been out of high school, and you were
17   still in high school, right?
18        A.    I was still in high school.  It was just a
19   summer fill-in.
20        Q.    And was this still down in -- he was
21   living in Florida at the time?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    And so you got out of school in the summer
24   of ninth grade, head on down to work with your
0037
 1   brother, and then when the summer is over, you come
 2   back up to go to tenth grade; is that correct?
 3        A.    That's correct.
 4        Q.    And then a second summer, tenth grade, you
 5   go down and do the same thing; is that correct?
 6        A.    Correct.
 7        Q.    When -- were you paid a check, or were you
 8   paid under the table when you were working for these
 9   guys?
10        A.    I'm sure it was a check.
11        Q.    Yeah.  And the shop, B & D Paint Company,
12   can you describe for us what that looked like?  How
13   big it was?  The number of bays kind of thing?  I'm
14   testing your memory.
15        A.    Yeah.  No.  Square -- no.
16        Q.    You mentioned that your brothers, the
17   painting part was part of -- like, the company would
18   do repair of vehicles and the painting all kind of in
19   the same area; is that right?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Did they do any kind of auto mechanic
22   work?  Like, if I came in with, you know, a busted
23   engine, would they also do auto mechanic work?
24        A.    No.
0038
 1        Q.    So this was just body and painting?
 2        A.    Correct.
 3        Q.    All right.  The bodywork, as aside to the
 4   painting work, was that done in generally the same
 5   area, or was there a wall or some sort of separation
 6   between the two?
 7        A.    A separation because it was a spray booth.
 8        Q.    Okay.  All right.  So you would do your
 9   work in terms of the prep work in one area?
10        A.    Right.
11        Q.    You'd move the car to the spray booth?
12        A.    Right.
13        Q.    And that's where your brother would do the
14   work?
15        A.    Correct.
16        Q.    The -- when you were doing the prep work
17   and working with the Bondo and the sanding, did you
18   wear any sort of breathing protection or any sort of
19   mask or anything?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    And if -- how long would you say you were
22   down there between ninth and tenth grade?  School
23   gets out in, what?  The end of May, give or take?
24        A.    Usually four weeks.
0039
 1        Q.    Okay.  So you were down there for about a
 2   month?
 3        A.    Correct.
 4        Q.    Okay.  And that -- would the same be true
 5   the second time you went down?  About the same amount
 6   of time?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Okay.  And was this -- this was a
 9   full-time position for you during those four weeks?
10        A.    Correct.
11        Q.    And would that be five days a week?  Seven
12   days a week?  Do you have a memory?
13        A.    Five days a week.
14        Q.    All right.  And were you living with your
15   brother at the time?
16        A.    At the time.
17        Q.    Other than working with Bondo, do you
18   recall any other types of materials that you worked
19   with while you were doing the prep work?
20        A.    That was the main -- I can't remember the
21   name.  There's another filler that you just used for
22   scratches.
23        Q.    Okay.
24        A.    I don't -- you know --
0040
 1        Q.    Right.
 2        A.    -- remember.  And when you sanded that, it
 3   was a much smoother finish than just the Bondo.
 4        Q.    Okay.
 5        A.    It was like a coating you put over the
 6   Bondo to take care of any of the sand marks or little
 7   dent areas.
 8        Q.    Gotcha.  And would you work on cars that
 9   had all different types of damages?  Everything from
10   little tiny scratches to, you know, some maybe larger
11   damage from an automobile accident?
12        A.    The larger ones always went into the body
13   shop or, you know, that end of it --
14        Q.    Yeah.
15        A.    -- that did the major, major repairs.
16        Q.    You were more of the smaller stuff?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    When the major stuff was being done, and
19   let's say someone was working on a major repair and
20   you were working on a minor repair, would that be
21   done generally in the same area, though?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    So someone might be working with Bondo on
24   a larger repair, and you might be within the same
0041
 1   areas and working on a smaller repair?
 2        A.    Correct.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Did this -- did this particular
 4   body shop have any sort of bay doors that opened and
 5   closed?
 6        A.    No.  Most of them were, being down in the
 7   Florida in the summertime, were open.
 8        Q.    It was open.  Okay.
 9        A.    The only one that was enclosed was the
10   spray booth.
11        Q.    The spray booth.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll ask
12   you, sir, a little bit about your education.  Did you
13   go to high school?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    And what high school did you go to?
16        A.    Groton High School.
17        Q.    What year did you graduate, sir?
18        A.    1960.
19        Q.    After graduating from Groton High School,
20   did you go on to any sort of other formal education?
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    At any time, other than Groton High
23   School, have you ever taken any sort of formal
24   education?
0042
 1        A.    No.
 2        Q.    When you were at Groton High School, did
 3   you take general classes, general college prep
 4   classes, or did you take any sort of shop classes?
 5        A.    I'm going to say general, which were
 6   basically the shop back then.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And when you say "shop," was this a
 8   voc high school or --
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Okay.  So what types classes, then -- if
11   you say they were shop classes, what types of classes
12   did you take?
13        A.    You still had your English, math, social
14   studies, you know.
15        Q.    Yeah.
16        A.    History.  And then you also had your shop
17   class.
18        Q.    And what -- when you were there, did you
19   take shop class?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    And I know there's woodworking, carpentry,
22   automotive.  What types of shop class or classes did
23   you take?
24        A.    Basically, welding and woodworking.
0043
 1        Q.    Tell me a little bit about the welding
 2   class or classes.  How many of those did you take?
 3        A.    They were -- it was more like a -- you
 4   would be working on a project, and until you finished
 5   that project is how long you would be --
 6        Q.    Gotcha.
 7        A.    -- working on, whether it was a
 8   woodworking project or a welding project.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And if you completed a welding
10   project, would you go on and do another welding
11   project, or was it one and done?
12        A.    More -- not necessarily.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    You would not take welding for a month or
15   woodworking for a month.  So when you got that
16   project done, sometimes the teacher gave you your
17   next project.  Sometimes you had something that you
18   would like to do, and as long as the teacher okayed
19   it, then you did it.
20        Q.    Okay.  And so one of the things that in
21   welding is, obviously, the teacher would teach you
22   guys how to do the actual physical welding, correct?
23        A.    Correct.
24        Q.    All right.  And you would have to use, I
0044
 1   assume, certain protective equipment while you're
 2   learning how to weld, right?
 3        A.    Correct.
 4        Q.    And what types of safety equipment were
 5   you provided at Groton High School in the welding
 6   class?
 7        A.    Basically, you had welding gloves that --
 8   to protect your hands from the hot metal, and,
 9   obviously, your mask.
10        Q.    Did you ever have any kind of apron that
11   you had to wear?
12        A.    I'm going to say no.
13        Q.    And were -- were these projects that you
14   were working on, were they conducted at the school,
15   or did you go out in the field to do these kind of
16   things?
17        A.    At the school.
18        Q.    Okay.  And could people from the town
19   bring something in that they needed welded and
20   then --
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    No.  Okay.  Do you know what the gloves
23   that you wore, do you know what they were made of?
24        A.    No.
0045
 1        Q.    And when you were welding, you would do
 2   some practice welds, I would assume?
 3        A.    Yeah.
 4        Q.    And when you were taught that, were there
 5   any sort of fumes that were generated as a result of
 6   the welding work that you were doing?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Okay.  And other than the mask -- and by
 9   that we kind of mean the metal ones we see with the
10   rectangular eyes?
11        A.    Yeah.
12        Q.    Other than that, did you wear any other
13   sort of protection -- breathing protection while
14   these fumes were going on?
15        A.    Not -- no.
16        Q.    The area, the class, this welding class,
17   do you remember the size of it?
18        A.    Not really.
19        Q.    Okay.
20        A.    It was in one corner of the shop.
21        Q.    All right.
22        A.    The rest of the shop was woodworking.
23   That took up the largest section of it.
24        Q.    Right.  Did -- did the high school also
0046
 1   have an automotive shop?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Were there any sort of windows or
 4   ventilation in the shop, whether it be -- well,
 5   woodworking and welding were all kind of together,
 6   right?
 7        A.    They were.
 8        Q.    Yeah.
 9        A.    But the welding was -- yes, you had
10   windows that --
11        Q.    And in the warmer weather, those windows
12   might be open?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    And in the colder, you keep them closed?
15        A.    Yeah.
16        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall the manufacturers of
17   any of the products that you worked with, whether
18   they be the rods or anything along those lines, for
19   welding?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Okay.  With respect to woodworking -- I
22   know the name kind of sounds -- obviously, you're
23   working with wood products.  Is this basic carpentry
24   skills?
0047
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    Did any of the work that you did there for
 3   woodworking, did any of it involve working with
 4   sheetrock?
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    What kind of things were you making in
 7   woodworking?
 8        A.    Mostly cabinets.  Yeah.
 9        Q.    And, again, it's kind of teaching kids
10   basic woodworking skills?
11        A.    Correct.
12        Q.    And, again, did you ever go out into the
13   field and install cabinets or do any other sort of
14   woodworking out on private homes or anything like
15   that while you were in high school?
16        A.    No.
17        Q.    Have you yourself, sir, ever performed any
18   sort of automotive repairs on any of your personal
19   vehicles?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  And what type of automotive repairs
22   have you personally done on your vehicles?
23        A.    Exhaust, brakes, engine replacement, and
24   transmission, and replacements.
0048
 1        Q.    Do you have a memory of the vehicles or
 2   the cars that you did?  Is this just one car or
 3   multiple cars or --
 4        A.    Multiple cars.
 5        Q.    Okay.
 6        A.    Back then it was mostly Ford.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember the first car that
 8   you did some sort of work that involved either
 9   exhaust, brakes, or engine transmission work?
10        A.    A 1947 Ford.
11        Q.    And when did you buy that '47 Ford?
12        A.    That was my first car.  Obviously, I was
13   16.
14        Q.    Right.  Okay.  So that was 1956 roughly?
15        A.    Yeah.

19        Q.    And when you say "brakes," you replaced
20   the brakes on this '47 Ford?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  And it was used at the time you
23   bought it, correct?
24        A.    Correct.
0049
 1        Q.    Do you know the manufacturer or the brand
 2   of the brakes you removed from this used '47 Ford?
 3        A.    No.
 4        Q.    Do you recall the brand name of the brakes
 5   that you installed on the '47 Ford?
 6        A.    No.
 7        Q.    How many brake jobs did you perform on
 8   this '47 Ford?
 9        A.    Probably one.
10        Q.    Briefly, can you describe -- did you
11   replace all four?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Okay.  Front?  Rear?
14        A.    Front.
15        Q.    Front.  And were these drum?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Okay.  Describe for me in general, if you
18   could, the process of removing the front brakes on
19   this '47 Ford.  What did you have to do?
20        A.    Obviously, you have to take the tire off
21   first.  Then you would have to remove the drum.
22        Q.    Uh-huh.
23        A.    And then that exposed the brakes.
24        Q.    Okay.  Once the brakes, then, are exposed,
0050
 1   what did you do next?
 2        A.    You had to -- there was a nut that you had
 3   to adjust to reduce the brakes down.  Meaning, when
 4   you took the drum off, they were fully expanded.
 5   Then trying to put -- take off the old ones, you had
 6   to -- it was a -- I'm not sure exactly what you
 7   called the part, but as you turned the nut one way,
 8   it brought both ends in.
 9        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.
10        A.    I do not know the name of it.
11        Q.    All right.  And then after you've done
12   that, after you brought the ends in --
13        A.    Then you could remove them and replace
14   them with new ones.
15        Q.    When you would remove the old ones -- and
16   by "old ones," we're talking about the old shoes?
17        A.    Yeah.
18        Q.    Okay.  Did you have to do anything to
19   repair the drum to then install the new one?
20        A.    You would, obviously, have to clean with
21   compressed air.  You'd be blowing it out and cleaning
22   it, and those had a brake cylinder, and you would
23   replace the rubber gaskets and put on new rubber
24   caps.
0051
 1        Q.    Okay.  When you were doing this -- this
 2   brake job on the used Ford, where was this work done?
 3        A.    Out in the yard.
 4        Q.    Okay.  So this was at your house?
 5        A.    Yeah.
 6        Q.    All right.  And you said one of the things
 7   you had to do is clean out the old drum with
 8   compressed air.  How did you -- where did that hook
 9   up from?
10        A.    Basically the shed, which had an air
11   compressor.
12        Q.    Okay.  And this is the family home, right?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    Did you have any sort of jacks or a lift
15   at the house?
16        A.    No.
17        Q.    Okay.  So what would you do in terms of
18   how you'd go and remove it?  Would you just jack it
19   up by hand?
20        A.    Jack it up and put a support under it.
21        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  The cleaning out portion
22   of the work, how long did that particular process
23   take?
24        A.    A good hour to two hours.
0052
 1        Q.    Okay.  And I'm talking about just the
 2   cleaning out portion.  Not the entire job.
 3        A.    Yeah.
 4              MR. BECERRA:  Just -- he's just asking
 5   about using the compressed air to clean the brake
 6   drums.
 7              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
 8              MR. BECERRA:  How long did that take?
 9        A.    Half hour a drum.
10        Q.    Per drum?
11        A.    Yeah.
12        Q.    Okay.  Other than using compressed air,
13   did you use any other materials to clean out the
14   drum?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Okay.  Once everything is cleaned out,
17   then, did you do anything to the drum?  Did you ever
18   have them turned or anything along those lines?
19        A.    I did not because they were not that badly
20   scored.
21        Q.    Okay.  All right.  And so, then, now it's
22   just kind of the process of reversing everything and
23   putting on the new shoes and then reassembling the
24   vehicle, correct?
0053
 1        A.    Correct.
 2        Q.    The new shoes that you installed, did you
 3   have to do anything to them prior to installing them
 4   on the vehicle?
 5        A.    Nothing before you install them.
 6        Q.    Right.  Okay.  Do you have a memory of
 7   where you purchased any of these replacements parts?
 8        A.    No.
 9        Q.    You mentioned you did some exhaust work on
10   this used '47 Ford.  What type of exhaust work did
11   you do?
12        A.    A muffler.  Tailpipe.
13        Q.    Okay.  Did any of this exhaust work
14   involve any sort of gasket work?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  And what type of gaskets did you
17   have to work with when you were doing this exhaust
18   work, if you recall?
19        A.    I don't recall.
20        Q.    Uh-huh.
21        A.    It was a hard material.
22        Q.    Okay.  And did you have to remove the
23   gasket at some point during the process of working on
24   the muffler and the tailpipe?
0054
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    And how did -- what was that -- what did
 3   that process entail?
 4        A.    Usually a hammer and screwdriver.
 5        Q.    Okay.  To get the gasket off?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    All right.  And so you're sitting there
 8   kind of, what?  Trying to chisel it off?
 9        A.    Yeah.
10        Q.    Do you know the manufacturer of the gasket
11   that you were removing?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of the
14   muffler or the tailpipe that you were removing?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Did you then have to replace the gasket as
17   part of replacement of the muffler and the tailpipe?
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    And what did the replacement work entail?
20   Is that just essentially putting it back on?
21        A.    Putting it back on.
22        Q.    Were they precut gaskets that you got?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    So there wasn't anything you needed to do
0055
 1   to the new gasket?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Do you know the manufacturer of the new
 4   gasket that you put on?
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    Do you know where you purchased the
 7   replacement gasket from?
 8        A.    I'd be guessing.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And as we mentioned, we don't need
10   you to guess.  All right.
11       Other than doing the gasket work with the muffler
12   and the tailpipe and the one brake job on the '47
13   Ford, any other automotive work you recall doing on
14   that vehicle?
15        A.    Other than oil changes and routine
16   maintenance --
17        Q.    Gotcha.
18        A.    -- no.
19        Q.    Do you recall how many miles were on it
20   when you bought it in '56?
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    Okay.  I'll tell you what.  When we do
23   these depositions, we usually go about an hour to
24   give the witness a chance to take a break.  We've
0056
 1   been going about an hour.  I am happy to give you a
 2   break now if you'd like to get that cup of coffee or
 3   cup of water.  I'm happy to go on.  It's entirely up
 4   to you, sir, how you're feeling.
 5        A.    I feel as good as ever.
 6        Q.    All right.  Do you want to keep going for
 7   a little while, then?
 8        A.    Yeah.
 9        Q.    All right.  Let's move on, then.  Do you
10   recall any other automotive work that you did, other
11   than the work we talked about on the '47 Ford?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    Okay.  What's the next vehicle you
14   remember working on?  And, again, I'm just kind of
15   interested in things that involve brakes,
16   transmissions, engine work.  Something along those
17   lines.  Routine maintenance like oil changes and
18   changing a flat tire, I don't really care too much
19   about that, but if you did any sort of other brake
20   work, transmission work, or engine work, I'd like to
21   hear a little bit about that.
22        A.    The next one is a '52 Ford, and that one
23   there, I did an engine replacement.
24        Q.    Okay.
0057
 1        A.    Not an engine repair.  A replacement.
 2        Q.    Replacement.  Yeah.
 3        A.    It seemed like you were -- back then you
 4   were always working on older cars.
 5        Q.    Yeah.  Yeah.
 6        A.    I remember that.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember when you bought
 8   this '52 Ford?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Okay.  Would it have been after you bought
11   the '47 --
12        A.    It -- obviously, it was afterwards.
13        Q.    Yeah, obviously --
14        A.    I'm going to say maybe two, three years
15   after.
16        Q.    So maybe roughly 1959-ish?
17        A.    Yeah.  It would have been -- no.  It would
18   have been before that.
19        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Well, let's back up a
20   little bit.  The '47 Ford that you bought when you
21   were 16 in 1956, how long did you own that one for?
22        A.    A couple of years.
23        Q.    All right.  So maybe '58 then --
24        A.    Yes.
0058
 1        Q.    -- to this one?  All right.
 2        A.    Yes.
 3        Q.    And, obviously, this was a used vehicle?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    Do you know the amount of miles that were
 6   on it?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Do you know anything about the prior
 9   maintenance or repair history before you bought it?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    And backing up, when you bought the '47
12   Ford, did you know anything about the prior
13   maintenance or repair history before you bought it?
14        A.    No.
15        Q.    Okay.  So you replaced the engine in this
16   '52 Ford, right?
17        A.    Correct.
18        Q.    Okay.  Did -- what did that entail?  Did
19   you essentially just remove the old one and put in a
20   new one?
21        A.    Basically, you had four bolts that held
22   the engine to the transmission.  Then you had two
23   front supports that you had to remove.
24        Q.    Uh-huh.
0059
 1        A.    Then you would need, obviously, a block
 2   and tackle or a chain fall to hoist the engine up.
 3   You didn't just pick the engine up.
 4        Q.    That's not something you just kind of grab
 5   and pull out?  Right.
 6        A.    Right.
 7        Q.    Right.  And was there work done at the
 8   family home?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    And did the work of removing the old
11   engine involve any sort of work with gaskets?
12        A.    Yes.  There would have been a gasket
13   between the engine and the transmission.
14        Q.    And you had to, obviously, remove that
15   gasket?
16        A.    Those were preformed gaskets.
17        Q.    You talked about with the exhaust when you
18   had to use a hammer and a chisel to remove that older
19   gasket.  When you were removing the one between the
20   transmission and the engine, did you have to do that
21   same thing, or did that just come right off?
22        A.    No.  You had to -- you had to scrape.
23        Q.    Okay.  And the gasket is essentially kind
24   of creating a seal between the engine and the
0060
 1   transmission, right?
 2        A.    That's correct.
 3        Q.    We've got kind of two pieces of metal that
 4   come together?
 5        A.    Right.
 6        Q.    And so you want to seal that area up,
 7   right?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    So if you're removing that gasket from
10   either one of the metal portions where they meet, you
11   want to do that carefully because you don't want to
12   kind of, you know, gouge any of the metal on either
13   the engine or the transmission; is that fair to say?
14        A.    That's correct.
15        Q.    Okay.  Because when you put the new one
16   in, again, you want that nice, tight seal?
17        A.    Correct.
18        Q.    Okay.  So you would have to remove the old
19   gasket.  How long does that process take?
20        A.    Usually not long.
21        Q.    Okay.
22        A.    It wasn't that big, and it was in the
23   open.
24        Q.    Gotcha.  And the tools that you would use,
0061
 1   you talked about a hammer and a chisel for the
 2   muffler.  What about, what kind of tools would you
 3   use --
 4        A.    Mostly a chisel just for scraping.
 5        Q.    Uh-huh.  Okay.
 6        A.    Because you didn't want to gouge the
 7   metal --
 8        Q.    Right.
 9        A.    -- in any means.
10        Q.    Right.  This knowledge that you have of
11   swapping out an engine, where did you gain that kind
12   of knowledge?  Was that through your father, or how
13   did you learn how to be -- to do this kind of work?
14        A.    Basically, growing up around tractors and,
15   you know, field -- farm equipment.
16        Q.    Okay.
17        A.    As a kid, I was driving a tractor probably
18   when I was six.
19        Q.    Okay.
20        A.    So that's where --
21        Q.    Was your father -- you talk about a farm.
22   Did you grow up on a family farm?
23        A.    It was a very small family farm.
24        Q.    All right.  Was it -- so, obviously, it
0062
 1   really wasn't a commercial farm because your father
 2   was doing the refrigeration?
 3        A.    Right.
 4        Q.    But he had some sort of farm equipment?
 5        A.    Correct.
 6        Q.    He had tractors.  Do you recall any other
 7   equipment that your father had?
 8        A.    Mostly hay cutting equipment.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    Obviously, there's always a tractor
11   involved.
12        Q.    Yeah.
13        A.    There was a wheel harrow, and there were
14   hay cutting equipment.
15        Q.    And would your father perform maintenance
16   and repairs on the various pieces of equipment?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    Okay.  And would you be present when your
19   father was doing that?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    And that's kind of how you learned how to
22   do the engine work that we talked about, right?
23        A.    That's right.
24        Q.    And with respect to the brake work, you
0063
 1   just went through how you did the brake job on the
 2   old Ford.  Was that also something that you learned
 3   through your father?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    All right.  So he would have been doing
 6   brake work when you were a younger child, right?
 7        A.    Correct.
 8        Q.    And you would have been present when he
 9   was doing this kind of work, right?
10        A.    Yup.
11        Q.    And was this work limited to farm
12   equipment, or was your father also doing brake work,
13   for example, on the family cars?
14        A.    Farm equipment.
15        Q.    Okay.  And so you just kind of took the
16   skills that you learned from farm equipment and go
17   it's kind of the same thing on a car, and you
18   translated it that way?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall the manufacturer of
21   the gasket that you removed from the engine, the one
22   that was connected to the transmission?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    And do you recall the manufacturer of the
0064
 1   gasket that you installed?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    And the one that you installed, that's
 4   just a preformed?  You put it right back in, and they
 5   match up, right?
 6        A.    Correct.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Other than replacing the engine on
 8   this particular Ford, do you recall any other
 9   automotive work that you performed on this vehicle?
10        A.    Nothing that stands out.
11        Q.    Uh-huh.  Okay.  We've talked about the two
12   Fords then.  Do you recall any other automotive work
13   that you have personally done, again, involving
14   either engine work, transmission, gasket, or brake
15   work?
16        A.    Yeah.  It was one of the first family
17   cars.  It was, like, a Ford Falcon.  I'm not sure of
18   the model, but it was a wagon.
19        Q.    Okay.
20        A.    I know it had a six-cylinder engine.
21        Q.    Yeah.
22        A.    It was a station wagon.
23        Q.    And do you recall the model year?  What
24   year the vehicle was?
0065
 1        A.    No.  It was not a new car.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Also used?
 3        A.    I didn't get into the new cars until much
 4   later in life.
 5        Q.    Yeah.  Do you recall -- well, I'll use the
 6   word how used it was.  Like, in other words, the
 7   mileage at the time that you bought it?
 8        A.    No.
 9        Q.    All right.  When you say "the first
10   family," so you had been married at the time you got
11   this one?
12        A.    This one here, yes.
13        Q.    Okay.  Had any of your children been born
14   yet?
15        A.    Yes.  At least -- at least one.  I'm not
16   sure -- I think maybe the twins, too.  So, you know,
17   we're talking about -- I bought it in the -- in the
18   '60s.
19        Q.    Okay.  And once -- you used the word
20   "station wagon", it's like our version of the
21   minivan.  Once the families get bigger, you've got to
22   put them somewhere, right?
23        A.    What's that?
24        Q.    Once the family gets bigger, you need the
0066
 1   more room in the car, right?
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Do you know anything before you
 4   bought it about the history of the repairs or any
 5   sort of maintenance that it underwent before you
 6   bought it?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Okay.  And do you recall what type of work
 9   you performed on this station wagon?
10        A.    I put an engine in it.
11        Q.    All right.  And is the work that you did
12   in terms of an engine a lot like the work you just
13   described?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Or was this different?
16        A.    No.
17        Q.    Kind of the same thing?
18        A.    The same thing.
19        Q.    All right.  So part of the work that you
20   had to do in basically pulling out the old engine and
21   putting in a replacement engine is to remove that
22   gasket between the engine and the transmission,
23   right?
24        A.    Correct.
0067
 1        Q.    All right.  And is the process by which
 2   you do that the same as what you did -- that you just
 3   told us about with that other Ford?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    And with respect to the gasket that you
 6   removed, do you know who made that gasket?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    And the gasket that you replaced, do you
 9   know who made that gasket?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    Okay.  And was this work now done at your
12   home?
13        A.    As a matter of fact, because most of the
14   equipment that I needed was at the family homestead.
15        Q.    Gotcha.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Other than
16   removing and replacing the engine, then, in that Ford
17   station wagon, any other automotive work you recall
18   doing?
19        A.    Other than a battery, you know, I don't
20   remember if I had to do any exhaust work or not.
21        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  Any other cars that you
22   recall personally performing any sort of automotive
23   repairs on?
24        A.    No.
0068
 1        Q.    Okay.  What about automotive repairs for
 2   any friends or family?
 3        A.    There was a small amount done when I was
 4   still in high school.
 5        Q.    Uh-huh.
 6        A.    I worked at a service station mostly
 7   pumping gas.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    And washing windshields back in those
10   days.
11        Q.    I know.
12        A.    Occasionally, I would do a brake job.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    That was not my main business there.
15        Q.    Uh-huh.
16        A.    I think I only did one that was not my own
17   car.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    And that was just because things were busy
20   and it's something I could do.
21        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  This service station, do
22   you recall the name of the service station?
23        A.    Martin's Service Station in Groton.  It
24   was a Jenney station.
0069
 1        Q.    And you say you worked there while you
 2   were in high school?
 3        A.    Yes.
 4        Q.    Was this during the school year or during
 5   the summer or both?
 6        A.    Mostly in the afternoons or on weekends if
 7   they needed someone to fill in.
 8        Q.    And when would you say you first started
 9   working there in the afternoons or the weekends when
10   someone needed to fill in?
11        A.    It would have been in the late '50s.
12        Q.    Okay.  And do you recall what grade you
13   were in?  Were you a freshman?  Sophomore?
14        A.    No.
15        Q.    Let's put it this way --
16        A.    Well --
17        Q.    -- before you started, did you have your
18   license?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  So we knew you were at least 16 or
21   older?
22        A.    Correct.
23        Q.    Okay.  Because you would drive yourself to
24   work?
0070
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    Gotcha.  And -- but your primary job was,
 3   as you mentioned, was to pump gas?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    But it also -- Martin's also serviced
 6   cars; is that correct?
 7        A.    Correct.
 8        Q.    The layout of the service station, did it
 9   have more than one service bay?
10        A.    It had two service bays.
11        Q.    And did Martin's specialize in any type of
12   automotive repair, or was this general?
13        A.    General.
14        Q.    And if you -- you have two bays.  Did it
15   also have an office?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    All right.  And when you were pumping gas,
18   were you assigned to a particular area?  Like, in
19   other words, did you have to be out by the pumps?
20   Could you be in the office?  Could you be in the
21   bays?  How did that work?
22        A.    Basically, mostly in the office.
23        Q.    Okay.
24        A.    Because the office, you just went right
0071
 1   out to the pumps.
 2        Q.    Were you ever in the bays while other
 3   mechanics were performing automotive work?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Other than -- and I know you did
 6   limited automotive repair at Martin's, but other than
 7   pumping gas, did you have any other responsibilities,
 8   like cleaning up, for example, or sweeping up at the
 9   end of a shift?
10        A.    If the office floor was dirty, I swept it.
11        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have --
12        A.    Was it my duty?  No.
13        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have to sweep up in
14   the bays where the mechanics worked?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Okay.  Was the office physically connected
17   to the two bays?  In other words, was there a way to
18   get from the office into the bays without having to
19   go outside?
20        A.    Yes, there was.
21        Q.    Okay.  And the door, was that a door
22   opening between --
23        A.    That was a door opening --
24        Q.    Okay.
0072
 1        A.    -- which was normally closed.
 2        Q.    Okay.  So if you were in the office, the
 3   door between the office and the bays was normally
 4   closed?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Where would they keep -- or if at
 7   all -- would they keep replacement parts at Martin's?
 8        A.    It would be out in the bay section.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Were you ever responsible for
10   ordering and replacing parts for Martin's?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    Okay.  You indicated you recalled on at
13   least one occasion helping or did a brake job for
14   Martin's; is that correct?
15        A.    That's correct.
16        Q.    All right.  Do you recall the vehicle that
17   you worked on on that one occasion?
18        A.    No.
19        Q.    Do you recall the types of brakes that you
20   removed, whether they were drum or disk?
21        A.    Those were a drum.
22        Q.    Okay.  And did you do all four, or just
23   front or rear or --
24        A.    I believe I did just the fronts.
0073
 1        Q.    All right.  And the process of doing this
 2   -- did they have a lift at Martin's?
 3        A.    Yes.
 4        Q.    And so when you did this brake job, did
 5   you utilize the lift?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    And the work replacing the brakes on this
 8   job, that was indoors, obviously, in one of the bays,
 9   right?
10        A.    Correct.
11        Q.    Do you know the manufacturer of the brakes
12   that you removed from that one vehicle?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    And the process of doing it, of removing
15   the shoes from these drum brakes on this one vehicle,
16   is it similar to what you described when you did your
17   own work?
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    Okay.  And did they have a compressed
20   air-type machine at the shop as well?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    And did the time -- you talked about it
23   taking about a half hour to clean out the inside of
24   the drums on the job that you did.  Was it about the
0074
 1   same then?
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And when we say "half hour," is
 4   that 15 minutes per drum, as it were?
 5        A.    Well, 15 to 30 minutes.
 6        Q.    Okay.
 7        A.    Yeah.
 8        Q.    All right.  With respect to the
 9   replacement brakes on this one vehicle, do you recall
10   the manufacturer of those brakes?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    Okay.  I thought I also heard you say that
13   sometimes you might perform automotive work on your
14   vehicles at Martin's?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  What type of automotive work did
17   you perform on your vehicles at Martin's?
18        A.    Mostly general maintenance.
19        Q.    Okay.  The oil changes?
20        A.    Oil change.  Plugs.  You know, you had to
21   change plugs back then.
22        Q.    Okay.
23        A.    You could get at them.
24        Q.    Did you ever assist any of the other
0075
 1   mechanics with any of their automotive work?  If
 2   things weren't busy, for example, at the pumps, did
 3   you ever come in and just assist any of the other
 4   mechanics?
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Have we essentially exhausted -- no
 7   pun intended -- the automotive work that you have
 8   done over the course of your lifetime?
 9        A.    Pretty much so, except for changing tires.
10        Q.    All right.  Did the changing of tires
11   involve handling any of the brakes on the wheels
12   themselves?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    Okay.  So other than that, have we
15   essentially talked about all of the brake, gasket,
16   the transmission-type work that you have done over
17   the course of your life?
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    Okay.  Fair enough.
20              MR. HOOVER:  Now we've been going about an
21   hour and a half.  Because I'm going to move into some
22   of the places that you've lived, do you want to take
23   a quick break?
24              THE WITNESS:  Yes.
0076
 1              MR. HOOVER:  Yeah.  It's kind of a nice
 2   segue.  Again, stretch, grab some coffee, a glass of
 3   water.  We'll take 10, 15 minutes.  Whatever it
 4   takes.  Does that sound good?
 5              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
 6              MR. HOOVER:  All right.
 7              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
 8   approximately 10:51, and this is the end of media
 9   number one.
10              (A break was taken from 10:51 to 11:04
11              a.m.)
12              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on the
13   record.  The time is approximately 11:04, and this is
14   the beginning of media number two.  Counsel, you may
15   proceed.
16              MR. HOOVER:  Thank you.
17   BY MR. HOOVER:
18        Q.    Are you all set to continue, Mr. Morton?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  I want to ask you a little bit
21   about the places you grew up, and I understand you
22   were born in Groton; is that correct?
23        A.    Correct.
24        Q.    All right.  And what's the first address
0077
 1   you remember living after you were born?  We talked
 2   about the small farm that you grew up on.
 3        A.    Brown Loaf Road.
 4        Q.    I'm sorry.  It's called what?
 5        A.    Brown Loaf Road in Groton.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And you indicated this was also a
 7   small farm; is that correct?
 8        A.    Correct.
 9        Q.    All right.  And, obviously, there was a
10   house on this particular property, and what type of
11   house was that?
12        A.    A two-story farmhouse.  I guess it was a
13   saltbox, as a matter of fact.
14        Q.    Sure.  All right.  While you were living
15   there, do you recall any sort of home renovation work
16   being performed?

0078
 1        Q.    All right.
 2        A.    And also some drywall work.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Is there anything else that you can
 4   recall in terms of the renovations that might have
 5   been done to this family home on Brown Loaf Road?
 6        A.    I know we did some work on the water pump.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Anything else you can recall?
 8        A.    That's pretty much -- oh, no.  Yeah.
 9   That's pretty much it.  We got the roof.  We've got a
10   couple of rooms of floor tile.
11        Q.    Uh-huh.
12        A.    Some drywall work and the water pump.
13        Q.    Okay.  Did the -- did this particular
14   residence, did you have a barn or any other sort of
15   other farm buildings?
16        A.    Yeah.  We had a shed.

18   of the equipment that we talked about?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  And how big was the shed?
21        A.    Forty by 30.

0079
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall any sort of
 3   renovations or additions or work being performed on
 4   the shed while you lived at the residence?
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    Okay.  So we have the house.  We've got
 7   the shed.  Were there any other buildings on the
 8   property?
 9        A.    There was another small barn.
10        Q.    Okay.  And what was stored in the barn?
11   Was that for the hay that you guys were cutting?
12        A.    Hay.
13        Q.    And how big was that small barn?
14        A.    Thirty by 40.
15        Q.    Okay.  And while you lived there, was
16   there any sort of renovations, additions, other work
17   done to this small barn?
18        A.    We put on a new roof.
19        Q.    Okay.  Other than that, any other work
20   that you recall being done?
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    Okay.  Let me start with the shed where
23   the equipment was stored because we talked -- just
24   touched on it before we took our break.  One of the
0080
 1   ways you said that you learned about how to do
 2   automotive repair was through watching your father do
 3   repairs on pieces of farm equipment, correct?
 4        A.    Correct.
 5        Q.    And when he did that, would that work be
 6   done in this 40-by-30 shed?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Okay.  And describe for me what your
 9   memory is of the types of equipment.  You talked
10   about tractors and hay cutting equipment, correct?
11        A.    Correct.
12        Q.    Were there any other types of equipment
13   that your father performed repairs on?
14        A.    Obviously, refrigeration equipment were
15   stored in the shed.
16        Q.    Okay.  And I'll get to that separately as
17   part of his business, but I'm just going to
18   concentrate now on the farming equipment per se.
19        A.    Well, let's go over that question one more
20   time.
21        Q.    Sure.  I'm just looking for the types of
22   farm equipment that your father might have stored in
23   this particular shed that he performed various
24   repairs to while he owned the equipment?
0081
 1        A.    Right.
 2        Q.    And we talked about he had tractors?
 3        A.    Yeah.
 4        Q.    He had hay cutting equipment?
 5        A.    Right.
 6        Q.    Was there any other types or pieces of
 7   equipment that your father would perform repairs or
 8   maintenance to?
 9        A.    Like, wheel harrow.
10        Q.    It's a wheel what?
11        A.    Harrow.
12        Q.    Oh, okay.
13        A.    And the hay equipment.  A hay cutter.
14        Q.    Uh-huh.
15        A.    There was one bay in the shed that we used
16   to either back a piece of equipment in and do
17   whatever had to be done for repair.
18        Q.    Okay.  And how big was this bay in the
19   back of the shed?
20        A.    It was like a standard automobile bay type
21   of situation.
22        Q.    Gotcha.  Uh-huh.
23        A.    I'm not sure exactly the square footage.
24        Q.    And in this bay in the back of the shed,
0082
 1   was there any type of lift, or was this --
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Okay.  The -- was there an air compressor
 4   in the shed?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    And was it hooked up basically back by the
 7   bay where the work might be done?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    And back there, your father would perform
10   various repairs to, for example, the tractors; is
11   that correct?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of the
14   tractors that your father worked on?
15        A.    Almus-Chalmus (sic).  That was about a
16   1940 tractor.
17        Q.    Okay.  Uh-huh.
18        A.    And Ferguson was one of the first tractors
19   I remember.
20        Q.    Do you remember what model year that was?
21        A.    That was back in the mid '40s.
22        Q.    All right.  Are there any other tractors
23   that you recall?
24        A.    Any what?
0083
 1        Q.    Other tractors that you recall?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Okay.  The Allis-Chalmers, do you know the
 4   model?
 5        A.    No, I don't.  The only thing I do know, it
 6   had rubber tires.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And what about the Ferguson?  Do
 8   you know what model that was?
 9        A.    That was, as I say, one of the older ones.
10   It had steel tires.
11        Q.    Okay.  Oh, gotcha.  And do you know if
12   your father bought either one of these new, or were
13   they --
14        A.    Used.
15        Q.    -- used?  Okay.  Did your father perform
16   any sort of tractor repair on these, along the same
17   lines where we talked about in terms of automotive?
18   Any sort of brake, engine, gasket work on these?
19        A.    Other than the normal maintenance, no.
20        Q.    Okay.  Now, earlier you had said that one
21   of the ways that you learned about, again, removing
22   the engine of the Ford that you did, for example, was
23   because you had kind of learned that from the work
24   that was done on the farm, right?
0084
 1        A.    Yeah.
 2        Q.    Okay.  So what type of engine work had
 3   your father done on the farm such that it taught you
 4   how to do the engine work on the Ford?
 5        A.    None.
 6        Q.    Okay.  So how then did you learn to do --
 7   for example, when you swapped out those engines, how
 8   did you learn how to do that?
 9        A.    I'm going to say trial and error.
10        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Fair enough.  Did you
11   review anything?  Any sort of books or manuals, or
12   did you just start unhooking bolts?
13        A.    Yeah.
14        Q.    Okay.  What about -- you mentioned, too,
15   that you had been taught how to do brake work; is
16   that correct?
17        A.    Yup.
18        Q.    Okay.  And did your father perform any
19   sort of brake work on any of the tractors that he
20   owned?
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    Okay.  Did anyone else perform any sort of
23   brake work on the tractors?
24        A.    No.
0085
 1        Q.    So then how did you, sir, learn how to do
 2   brake work that you eventually then did on cars?
 3        A.    I'm going to say I did go to a manual.
 4        Q.    So you might review a manual on how to
 5   change out a brake; is that correct?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And when you worked for that gas
 8   station on weekends and after school, and you said
 9   you might have helped out on that one customer's car?
10        A.    Yeah.
11        Q.    Did you review a manual, or did a mechanic
12   help you or show you how to do it?  And by "it," I
13   mean the brake replacement.
14        A.    I already, through doing my own, is how I
15   -- it was all the same process.
16        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  With respect to the hay
17   cutters and the haying equipment, did your father
18   ever perform any sort of repairs on those pieces of
19   equipment?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    And what types repairs did he perform on
22   the hay cutting equipment?
23        A.    Well, basically, you would wind up with
24   some broken teeth on the sickle bar, and you'd have
0086
 1   to remove the bar and replace the broken teeth.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And not being overly familiar with
 3   a hay cutting machine, is that motorized in any way,
 4   the machine itself?
 5        A.    No.  It's driven by the tractor.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And does it have brakes?  I'm
 7   assuming if it's driven by the tractor --
 8        A.    No.  It was mostly mechanical.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Do you have any memory of your
10   father doing any mechanical work to any of the
11   components of the hay cutter, other than you talked
12   about the teeth having to be replaced?
13        A.    Yeah.  That was the big issue with that.
14   The rest of it was gears, and they really didn't wear
15   out that fast.  So, no, we did not get into the
16   transmissions of the hay cutter and all that kind of
17   stuff.
18        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of any of
19   these pieces of equipment?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    All right.  And I think you mentioned
22   something called a wheel -- is it called a harrow?
23        A.    Yeah.
24        Q.    H-A-R-R-O-W?
0087
 1        A.    Yeah.
 2        Q.    What is that?  What type -- piece of
 3   equipment is that?
 4        A.    Basically, it chews up the sod and exposes
 5   the dirt.
 6        Q.    Gotcha.  Is that something that is hand --
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Okay.  You have to -- you drive it?  You
 9   operate it?
10        A.    You pull that with a tractor.
11        Q.    Gotcha.  So it's pulled behind one of the
12   family tractors?
13        A.    Yeah.
14        Q.    Is that powered by any sort of motor?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Okay.  How does that machine -- piece of
17   machinery operate, then?
18        A.    Basically, it's on the ground, and there's
19   a shaft, and you've got these disks.
20        Q.    I know, yes.
21        A.    And the disk is turned by the ground --
22        Q.    Yeah.  Okay.
23        A.    -- as you're pulling it along.
24        Q.    Yeah.  I've seen those.  I know what
0088
 1   you're talking about.
 2        A.    So, no, there's no motor to it.  No
 3   transmission to it --
 4        Q.    Right.
 5        A.    -- except for bearings at the end of the
 6   shaft so they turn freely.
 7        Q.    Right.  And those you might have to grease
 8   from time to time to keep them flowing freely, right?
 9        A.    Yeah.
10        Q.    Okay.  Did the family farm have any sort
11   of, you know, like, pickup trucks or anything along
12   those lines?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    No.  Okay.  Did your father -- he must
15   have had his own car or --
16        A.    Correct.
17        Q.    Did he have any sort of van for his -- for
18   Groton Refrigeration?
19        A.    Not a special van, no.
20        Q.    Yeah.  Would he ever perform any sort of
21   maintenance or repairs to any sort of the company
22   vehicles?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Let's talk a little bit
0089
 1   about the small barn.  You said that a new roof at
 2   one point was put onto that; is that correct?
 3        A.    Right.  It was a flat -- flat roof.
 4        Q.    Okay.
 5        A.    And --
 6        Q.    And so what kind of -- well, let me back
 7   up a little bit.  Do you recall how old you were when
 8   this new roof was put on?
 9        A.    Probably around 12, you know.
10        Q.    Yeah.  Were you involved at all in terms
11   of the work of putting on this new roof?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    Okay.  And what were your assignments as a
14   12-year-old for this new roof?
15        A.    Whatever I could lift.
16        Q.    Okay.
17        A.    I was more or less the gofer.
18        Q.    Right.  Okay.  So the small barn had a
19   flat roof and --
20        A.    Then we put on an A-frame.
21        Q.    All right.  So you put on a pitched roof?
22        A.    Pitched roof.  What the pitch was, I don't
23   recall.
24        Q.    Were you -- and on that -- on that old
0090
 1   roof, what was the old roof, the flat roof, made out
 2   of?
 3        A.    Boards and tarpaper.
 4        Q.    Okay.  And did you assist at all in
 5   removing any of the tarpaper?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    Do you know who manufactured the tarpaper
 8   that was removed?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Were there any sort of shingling or
11   anything on that, on top of the tarpaper?
12        A.    Not on top.
13        Q.    Okay.  So, then, the new pitched roof was
14   installed, correct?
15        A.    Correct.
16        Q.    And did your father hire anybody, or did
17   he rely on you and your brothers?
18        A.    No.
19        Q.    You and your brothers?
20        A.    Correct.
21        Q.    Okay.  And so the new roof that was -- I'm
22   assuming the frame itself is made out of wood?
23        A.    Correct.
24        Q.    And was tarpaper then added on top of the
0091
 1   frame?
 2        A.    We -- we used a felt paper.
 3        Q.    Yeah.
 4        A.    And then shingles on top of that.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall who manufactured the
 6   felt paper?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Do you recall who manufactured the
 9   shingles that you put on?
10        A.    Not the shingles.
11        Q.    Do you recall the type of shingles that
12   they were?
13        A.    They were just regular asphalt shingles.
14        Q.    Okay.  Other than felt paper and the
15   asphalt shingles, did you have to put anything else
16   on that new pitched roof?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Okay.  How long would you say that whole
19   project lasted?
20        A.    Oh, that was weeks.
21        Q.    Okay.  And that's the only renovation or
22   work that was done to that small barn, right?
23        A.    That's correct.
24        Q.    All right.  So let's, then, kind of turn
0092
 1   to the farmhouse, the two-story saltbox farmhouse,
 2   that you grew up in.  I understand, as you said, one
 3   of the things that you did was the family put on a
 4   new shingle roof; is that correct?
 5        A.    That's correct.
 6        Q.    Approximately how old were you when that
 7   work was done?
 8        A.    I was probably 10 or --
 9        Q.    And do you recall -- and I'm assuming this
10   is something your father and your brothers and you
11   did?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    What did the removal process entail?  What
14   did you have to do in order to put it on?
15        A.    We had to strip the roof --
16        Q.    Uh-huh.
17        A.    -- which involved a flat shovel to slide
18   underneath the row of shingles.
19        Q.    Uh-huh.
20        A.    And then you press down on the handle to
21   pop the shingles up.
22        Q.    Okay.  And --
23        A.    Then you'd have to remove any nails that
24   didn't -- didn't come, so --
0093
 1        Q.    Right.  Okay.  Was there any tarpaper that
 2   also had to be removed?
 3        A.    Yes.
 4        Q.    The old shingles, do you recall what type
 5   of shingles those were?
 6        A.    No.
 7        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of the old
 8   ones?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    The tarpaper that you had to remove, do
11   you know who manufactured the old tarpaper?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Once all that is removed, what's the --
14   how do you then install the new -- the new roof?
15        A.    Well, basically, that's -- that's the
16   hardest process --
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    -- the new roof.  You snap some chalk
19   lines to make sure that you keep things lined up and
20   keep going straight.
21        Q.    Gotcha.
22        A.    Once you get that done, then you get your
23   first layer on.
24        Q.    Uh-huh.
0094
 1        A.    And then, as I say, you get up three or
 2   four rows, and you've got a chalk line up there, and
 3   you can vary it a little bit just to make sure you
 4   keep everything straight.
 5        Q.    Right.
 6        A.    And all your notches lined up.
 7        Q.    Uh-huh.  The -- was tarpaper or some sort
 8   of felt paper put down on before you laid out the
 9   shingles themselves?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    And other than the paper, was there
12   anything else that you had to add?  Any sort of
13   roofing cement or anything along those lines?
14        A.    No.
15        Q.    The shingles themselves, do you recall
16   what types of shingles those were?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Do you know the manufacturer of the
19   shingles?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall where you purchased
22   them from?
23        A.    GV Moore in Ayer.  They're still in
24   business today.
0095
 1        Q.    Did you also purchase the paper from --
 2        A.    Yes.
 3        Q.    All right.  And with respect to any of
 4   these shingles that you were installing, did any of
 5   them have to be cut?
 6        A.    The shingles, yes.
 7        Q.    Yes.  All right.  And how would you go
 8   about having to cut the shingles?
 9        A.    A straightedged knife.
10        Q.    Okay.  And is it --
11        A.    Using a straightedge.
12        Q.    You'd have to measure how much you needed
13   to cut off?
14        A.    Yeah.
15        Q.    And then, you know, as they say, measure
16   twice, cut once, right?
17        A.    Yeah.  And then you just -- with a
18   straightedge blade.
19        Q.    And as a 10-year-old, to do this type of
20   work, were you assisting in the cutting of these
21   particular roofing shingles?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    Okay.  And then once they're -- whatever
24   ones you need cut to the correct size, in terms of
0096
 1   installing them, is that just essentially kind of
 2   nailing them to the roof?
 3        A.    Right.
 4        Q.    And as a 10-year-old, again, were you up
 5   there with your brothers and father nailing these to
 6   the roof?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Approximately how long did this whole
 9   process take of removing and installing this new
10   roof?
11        A.    Oh, one week.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    Because it wasn't a full-time thing.
14        Q.    Yeah.
15        A.    So it took longer than if you put a full
16   crew up there --
17        Q.    Sure.  Sure.
18        A.    -- to do a roof.
19        Q.    Well, because your dad is working.  You're
20   at school kind of thing?
21        A.    Yeah.
22        Q.    Other than the one time that you replaced
23   the -- and put the new shingles up, did you do any
24   other roofing work on this house?
0097
 1        A.    No.
 2        Q.    Now, you had mentioned that several rooms
 3   you did some floor tile work in?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    Okay.  How many rooms did you tile?
 6        A.    Two.
 7        Q.    And what rooms were they that you tiled?
 8        A.    The kitchen and the bathroom.
 9        Q.    The bathroom.  Okay.  And how big was the
10   kitchen that you tiled?
11        A.    I'm going to say 20 -- it's approximately.
12   I'm going to say, 20 by 30.
13        Q.    Okay.  And part of this process of tile,
14   was this retiling?  Did you have to remove old tiles
15   and put new ones in?
16        A.    We had to remove old tile.
17        Q.    Okay.  And do you know the manufacturer of
18   the tiles that you removed?
19        A.    No.
20        Q.    Do you know how old the tiles were that
21   you removed?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Do you know when the home was originally
24   constructed?
0098
 1        A.    Back in the 1800s.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And did you assist at all in the
 3   removal of the tiles?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    And how old would you say you were when
 6   you were doing this kind of work?
 7        A.    I'm going to say 11, 12 years old.
 8        Q.    Okay.  If we were to kind of think of the
 9   roof of the house, do you know if this tile work was
10   done before, after, or around the same time as the
11   roof?
12        A.    No.  In between, you know -- no.
13        Q.    Okay.  The removal process of the old
14   tiles, what -- how did you go about doing that?  What
15   did that entail?
16        A.    Basically, made out best with about a
17   four-inch ice chisel.
18        Q.    Uh-huh.
19        A.    And basically, sliding that under the old
20   tile and snapping them up, and --
21        Q.    And in doing that, was there anything
22   underneath the tile that you also had to remove?
23        A.    You had to make sure -- it was a black
24   cement that you could smooth out most of it with that
0099
 1   chisel.
 2        Q.    Uh-huh.
 3        A.    There was a little bit of sanding when you
 4   got into some rough areas.
 5        Q.    Yeah.  And the sanding, was that done by
 6   hand?
 7        A.    By hand really.  A rough sandpaper.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    And that was sort of a dusty, dirty
10   process.
11        Q.    Do you know who manufactured the -- that
12   cement type --
13        A.    Not the cement.
14        Q.    Okay.  It sounds like you did know the
15   manufacturing of something in terms of you said "not
16   the cement."  Is there another particular product
17   that was involved in the removal that you do recall
18   working with?
19        A.    No.  Not -- no.
20        Q.    Okay.  When you were removing the black
21   cement with the chisel, was that also a dirty
22   process?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    Okay.  Did that create dust when you were
0100
 1   removing that as well?
 2        A.    Yes.
 3        Q.    And when you were sliding the chisel --
 4   the ice chisel that you talked about underneath the
 5   tile itself before you even got to the black cement,
 6   would that cause the tile sometimes to break?
 7        A.    To break.
 8        Q.    Okay.  And when they did that, did that
 9   also create a dirty, dusty environment?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    Okay.  When you were doing this kind of
12   work at the age of 11 or 12, did you have any sort of
13   breathing protection?  Any sort of paper mask or
14   anything?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    What did you do with the old tiles that
17   were removed from the kitchen?
18        A.    Back then we were lucky enough to be able
19   to take them to the dump.
20        Q.    Very nice.  And when you say you were
21   "lucky enough" to be able to do that back then, what
22   do you mean by that?
23        A.    Well, today you couldn't -- they had to be
24   special disposed of.  I'm not sure where you do it
0101
 1   today.
 2        Q.    Yeah.  And why did they -- why, in your
 3   estimation, would the ones that you removed back then
 4   have to be specially disposed of today?
 5        A.    I don't know.
 6        Q.    Okay.
 7        A.    Except they -- the dump will not accept
 8   them.
 9        Q.    Wouldn't accept the old types of tiles?
10        A.    Right.
11        Q.    Okay.  But you don't know why?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    But back then, you just went and threw
14   them in the dump?
15        A.    Right.
16        Q.    Gotcha.  So then you go and buy, I'm
17   assuming, replacement tiles for the kitchen?
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    And did you get these also at -- you
20   talked about GV Moore.  Was that where you --
21        A.    Correct.
22        Q.    And do you recall the brand names of the
23   ones you installed?
24        A.    Those were Armstrong.
0102
 1        Q.    And how -- and how -- what size were
 2   these, do you know?
 3        A.    They were a standard size.  I don't know.
 4   Ten by 10 or a 12-by-12.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And did you have to put down any
 6   sort of, like, cements or anything adhesive
 7   beforehand?
 8        A.    Cement.  Yes.  Back then -- I guess
 9   today's tile are -- have adhesive back.
10        Q.    Right.  Yeah.
11        A.    And then you had to put down a cement.
12        Q.    Okay.  And do you recall who -- the brand
13   name?
14        A.    Not on the cement.
15        Q.    Okay.  And how is that applied?  How did
16   you do that?
17        A.    With a special trowel that's got grooves
18   in it.  So as you drag that across the floor, it --
19   yeah.  A corrugated type of thing.
20        Q.    Gotcha.  And is this -- this application
21   of the cement, is that something that you personally
22   did?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    Okay.  And was your father also helping
0103
 1   with this particular job?
 2        A.    Yes.
 3        Q.    And your brothers?
 4        A.    Yeah.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Did your -- not to exclude her, but
 6   did your sister help out as well?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Okay.  How about your mom?  I'll take a
 9   shot that maybe your mom was helping out with the --
10        A.    She was around.  That's all.
11        Q.    She was the supervisor, right?
12        A.    Yeah.
13        Q.    Yeah, exactly.  And then after the cement
14   is applied to the floor, then the tiles themselves
15   are then laid onto the floor; is that correct?
16        A.    You would do sections.
17        Q.    Yeah.
18        A.    Because, obviously, you had to -- you
19   didn't want to walk on the cement.  So you couldn't
20   do the whole floor.
21        Q.    Gotcha.
22        A.    So you did it in sections.
23        Q.    A section.  Let it dry, and let it set?
24        A.    Yeah, and you put the tile down.
0104
 1        Q.    Uh-huh.
 2        A.    And then you -- now you can stand on those
 3   tiles.
 4        Q.    Gotcha.
 5        A.    Then you do another section.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall the coloring of the
 7   tiles themselves?
 8        A.    It was a, I'm going to say, a neutral
 9   color.  A grayish color.
10        Q.    And you say that these were Armstrong
11   tiles, and how do you have a recollection of them
12   being Armstrong?
13        A.    Because it was stamped right on the
14   boxes --
15        Q.    Okay.
16        A.    -- with their name.
17        Q.    And did you -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  With
18   the name?
19        A.    Yeah.
20        Q.    And did you go with your father to pick
21   these up, or do you have a memory of that?
22        A.    I don't have a memory of it.
23        Q.    Uh-huh.  And how long did this particular
24   project take?
0105
 1        A.    Just a couple of days.  It was fairly
 2   quick.
 3        Q.    And were you, your brothers, and your
 4   father also doing the installation of these tiles?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  So all four of you were working
 7   together to get this 20-by-30 room done?
 8        A.    Yeah.
 9        Q.    Okay.  With respect to the new tiles that
10   you laid down, did you have to cut any of those?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    And how would you go about doing that?
13        A.    There again, you used a straightedge and a
14   sharp instrument and scored the top.
15        Q.    Yeah.
16        A.    Then you would snap them.
17        Q.    Gotcha.
18        A.    Obviously, when you did that, it would
19   create airborne dust.
20        Q.    And when you were making these cuts, you'd
21   have to make sure -- obviously, you want to do it
22   carefully because you don't want to cut along the,
23   you know, wrong line?
24        A.    Right.
0106
 1        Q.    And were you doing any of the cutting?
 2        A.    Oh, yes.
 3        Q.    And did your brothers do the cutting?
 4        A.    You know, I don't remember exactly who did
 5   all the cutting.
 6        Q.    Right.
 7        A.    But, you know, usually once you had one
 8   section, you know, you just go along and cut a bunch
 9   at the top.
10        Q.    Yeah.  And, again, in order to get the job
11   done and in an efficient manner, all four of you
12   might be doing different particular portions of the
13   work?
14        A.    Different -- different times, obviously.
15   My brothers had jobs, too.
16        Q.    Right.
17        A.    So it depends.  I was the lucky one that
18   was around the most.
19        Q.    Okay.  Other than the removal and the
20   replacement of the tiles in the kitchen, did you do
21   any other tile work in the kitchen?
22        A.    Not in the kitchen.
23        Q.    Okay.  We know we did some in the
24   bathroom, right?
0107
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    All right.  And the bathroom, about what
 3   time frame is that work done?
 4        A.    That was done, obviously, right after the
 5   kitchen was done.
 6        Q.    The kitchen was done.  So you finish up
 7   the kitchen, and then you kind of move right in and
 8   do the bathroom?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    How big was the bathroom you did?
11        A.    The bathroom was smaller.  I'm going to
12   say 15 by 12 or something like that.
13        Q.    Okay.  And did the process in terms of
14   what you had to do in the kitchen, was that the same
15   as what you did in the bathroom?
16        A.    The same, but on a smaller scale.
17        Q.    All right.  So you had to remove the old
18   tiles that was there with the ice chisel?
19        A.    Yeah.
20        Q.    You had to remove that black cement that
21   was underneath it?
22        A.    Smooth it out.
23        Q.    And smooth it out.  Did that also involve
24   hand sanding it?
0108
 1        A.    A little bit.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And were those tiles the kind also
 3   that back in that day you could just go and throw
 4   away?
 5        A.    Yeah.
 6        Q.    And then did you install new tile,
 7   obviously, in that bathroom?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of the
10   tiles that you installed in the new bathroom?
11        A.    That would have been the same.  Armstrong.
12        Q.    And were they, like, literally the same
13   tiles?  You just kind of carried the tile work from
14   the kitchen into the bathroom?
15        A.    A little bit different color.
16        Q.    Okay.  In terms of a size?
17        A.    The same size.
18        Q.    The same size.  Okay.  And these tiles
19   that you installed in the bathroom, were they also
20   purchased from GV Moore?
21        A.    Yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  Other -- and how long would you say
23   it took to do the bathroom job?
24        A.    As I say, a much smaller day.
0109
 1        Q.    Okay.  And was this something that you,
 2   your brothers, and your father all kind of worked on
 3   together?
 4        A.    Yeah.  It depends.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And so that took about a day to do?
 6        A.    Yeah.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Does that mean the day was the
 8   removal and the installation all in one day?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    Other than removing and replacing the tile
11   in the bathroom, then, any other tile work that you
12   did at the family home?
13        A.    Not tile work.
14        Q.    Okay.  You spoke of also doing some
15   drywall work in the house; is that correct?
16        A.    Right.
17        Q.    Did you create new rooms or replace walls
18   in the house?
19        A.    No.  It was more repairing damaged areas
20   that -- a board someone was carrying downstairs went
21   through the wall.
22        Q.    Okay.
23        A.    On that -- I mean, it wasn't as if we
24   ripped out rooms --
0110
 1        Q.    Gotcha.
 2        A.    -- or anything like that.  That was mainly
 3   repair.
 4        Q.    And by "repair," are we repairing, again,
 5   dings, dents, holes in walls?
 6        A.    Yes.  Some of it we'd actually cut out
 7   that section and replace it with drywall and then use
 8   a drywall cement to do the seams.
 9        Q.    Gotcha.  When you say you would cut out a
10   section, what type of material are you cutting out?
11   Are you cutting out a piece of damaged wall, right?
12        A.    Old -- yeah.
13        Q.    And what was that old wall -- what was
14   that made out of?
15        A.    You know, it was some type of plaster and
16   it had hair.  I don't know whether it was horsehair
17   or what it was.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    It was fiber that, I guess, held it
20   together.
21        Q.    And so what would you say might be the
22   largest section that you had to cut out of the old
23   plaster to replace some sort of damage?
24        A.    They were all basically four by eight.
0111
 1        Q.    Okay.  Four foot by eight foot?
 2        A.    Huh?
 3        Q.    Four foot?
 4        A.    Yeah.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And approximately how many times
 6   would you say over the course of your living in the
 7   childhood home you were involved in that type of
 8   work?
 9        A.    At least twice.
10        Q.    Okay.  And the -- so you would remove the
11   old plaster portion that was damaged, and then you,
12   as you said, you would have to cut a piece of new
13   sheetrock, then --
14        A.    Right.
15        Q.    -- is that correct?  Okay.  Do you
16   remember the manufacturer of the sheetrock that you
17   had to -- or that you installed in the room?
18        A.    No.
19        Q.    Okay.  And where did you purchase the
20   sheetrock from?
21        A.    GV Moore.
22        Q.    Okay.  And did -- do you remember the size
23   of the sheet that you purchased from GV Moore?
24        A.    They were, like, four by eights.
0112
 1        Q.    So was there any sort of cutting of the
 2   new sheetrock?
 3        A.    Yeah, because it wasn't exactly a four by
 4   eight.
 5        Q.    Right.
 6        A.    So, yes, there was.
 7        Q.    So you'd have to cut it to size?
 8        A.    You had to cut it to fit, yeah.
 9        Q.    And how would you go about doing that?
10        A.    There, again, a straight -- a straightedge
11   with a single-bladed knife.
12        Q.    Yeah.
13        A.    A razor knife.  And you cut one side of
14   it.
15        Q.    Yeah.
16        A.    And then you can snap it.
17        Q.    Uh-huh.
18        A.    And then you come the other way, and it
19   just snaps off the back.
20        Q.    Gotcha.  And was that something that you
21   yourself personally did?
22        A.    I -- not by myself.  Obviously, I would
23   have needed some help.
24        Q.    Right.  Someone has got to hold the --
0113
 1        A.    To handle that sheet.  It was fairly
 2   heavy.
 3        Q.    Sure.  And the cutting of the sheetrock
 4   for the replacement, was -- did that create any sort
 5   of dust when you were cutting through it?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    And -- like you said, you'd have to make,
 8   like, one cut --
 9        A.    One razor --
10        Q.    Yeah.
11        A.    -- cut, and then you could just put it
12   along a table, a straightedge, and snap it.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    And it would actually break down, and then
15   you ran it up the other way, and it just tears off
16   the back.
17        Q.    Gotcha.  And --
18        A.    So it makes a nice, clean cut.
19        Q.    So you might have to cut it, you know,
20   widthwise to make it fit?
21        A.    Yeah.
22        Q.    Would you also have to cut lengthwise?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    So you'd have to essentially kind of make
0114
 1   two cuts?
 2        A.    Two cuts.
 3        Q.    And both of those cuts were done in the
 4   same fashion, with a straightedge?
 5        A.    Yeah.
 6        Q.    And with a helper, and you were present
 7   while that was being done, correct?
 8        A.    Right.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And then once you have the
10   appropriate size, you then install it where the
11   plaster had been removed?
12        A.    Right.
13        Q.    And then once it's installed, once the
14   sheetrock that you've cut has been installed, what do
15   you do next?
16        A.    Then they have a seam tape that you put on
17   the -- on the seams.
18        Q.    Uh-huh.
19        A.    Obviously, you get two seams.
20        Q.    Right.
21        A.    And then on top of that, then you use the
22   -- they have a name for it.  I don't know the name.
23   A filler.
24        Q.    Okay.
0115
 1        A.    Like, a putty.
 2        Q.    Yeah.
 3        A.    A drywall.  A drywall compound.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Does the name "joint compound"
 5   sound familiar?
 6        A.    Yeah.  Yeah.
 7        Q.    And did you then have to install the joint
 8   compound over the -- the seam tape?
 9        A.    Yeah.  A large putty knife and put it on
10   as smooth as you could.
11        Q.    Right.
12        A.    You let it dry, and sometimes it depends
13   on how good you did --
14        Q.    Sure.
15        A.    -- whether you put on a second coat or if
16   you could get away with lightly sanding it.
17        Q.    Okay.  And so would you have to sand the
18   joint compound to make it smooth with the entire
19   wall?
20        A.    It depends on how good you put --
21        Q.    Right.
22        A.    -- the joint compound on.
23        Q.    The first time?
24        A.    Yes.
0116
 1        Q.    Did you yourself ever have to do any
 2   sanding of joint compound?
 3        A.    Oh, yes.
 4        Q.    Okay.  And just kind of smooth it out, and
 5   might you have to add a second layer of joint
 6   compound?
 7        A.    Sometimes.
 8        Q.    And if you added that second one, you'd
 9   have to wait for that to dry as well?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    And would you then have to maybe sand that
12   second one to kind of smooth everything out?
13        A.    Yeah.
14        Q.    How many times -- would you ever have to
15   go three, four --
16        A.    No.  No.
17        Q.    Usually just the two?
18        A.    Yeah.
19        Q.    Okay.  And when you were doing that
20   sanding, what kind of -- was that by hand?
21        A.    You did it by hand when you only had a
22   small area.  If you were doing a large area, you
23   could use a wet sponge, and that would do the same
24   thing.
0117
 1        Q.    Okay.  When you were doing the smaller
 2   areas and using the sandpaper, was that kind of like
 3   a fine --
 4        A.    Fine sandpaper.
 5        Q.    And would that create dust, then, while
 6   you were sanding the joint compound?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    And when you were doing that work, were
 9   you ever wearing any sort of mask or any sort of
10   respirator?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    When you were cutting or helping to cut
13   the pieces of sheetrock to fill in the places that
14   you had removed and that was creating dust, did you
15   ever wear any sort of face mask or any sort of
16   protection when you did that work?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of any of
19   the joint compound that you applied to -- above the
20   seam tape?
21        A.    Other than joint compound, I don't know.
22        Q.    Okay.  But in terms of any specific brand
23   name --
24        A.    No.
0118
 1        Q.    All right.  While you were living at the
 2   home, the family home there on the farm, how many
 3   times would you say you and your brothers had to kind
 4   of repair these various holes that might happen by
 5   various accidents?
 6        A.    Yeah.  That -- that one was a big one, and
 7   so, yeah, we weren't poking holes through --
 8        Q.    At least not on purpose anyway, right?
 9        A.    Yeah.
10        Q.    I don't think folks would be too happy.
11   You had also mentioned, I think, that you did some
12   work on a water pump?
13        A.    A water pump.
14        Q.    Okay.  What was that?
15        A.    That was a shallow well.  A Goulds water
16   pump.
17        Q.    And what type of work was performed on
18   this -- this water pump?
19        A.    Basically, you removed the old one and
20   installed a new one, and you would have some gaskets
21   there that you would have to remove the old gasket
22   and put in a new gasket and put in a new -- connect
23   it up to the new pump.
24        Q.    Okay.  Were you personally involved in
0119
 1   this removal and installation of the water pump?
 2        A.    Yes.  Yes.
 3        Q.    About how old would you say you were when
 4   this work was done?
 5        A.    Oh, I was probably 13 or so.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And the pump that you removed, do
 7   you know how old that pump was when it was originally
 8   installed?
 9        A.    No, I don't.
10        Q.    Okay.  And before you performed any --
11   well, strike that.
12       What type of work did you yourself do in terms of
13   hands-on work as a 13-year-old?
14        A.    On the pump?
15        Q.    Yeah.
16        A.    That was both my father and I.
17        Q.    Okay.  So what was your father doing?
18   What was his role in the work, and what was your
19   role?
20        A.    Mainly handling the pump.  I mean, it's
21   not as if it was that heavy.  One horsepower.  You
22   could do it all yourself, but two always makes it a
23   little easier.
24        Q.    Sure.  So when you say "handling," was
0120
 1   this something that you both worked on, or was there
 2   enough room for two people to work on this pump in
 3   terms of the removal of it?
 4        A.    You really don't need two people.  One
 5   person can do it very easily.
 6        Q.    But I'm just trying to figure out who was
 7   doing the majority of the work?  Was it your father,
 8   and he was just kind of showing you what this was all
 9   about?
10        A.    I'm going to say yes, it was.
11        Q.    Because you don't know the age of the pump
12   that you were removing, is it fair to say you don't
13   know if there had been any prior repairs or any sort
14   of prior maintenance done to the pump?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    No, that's fair, or no -- am I fair?  Is
17   that a correct statement?
18        A.    It's -- I don't know of any --
19        Q.    Right.  Okay.
20        A.    -- prior repairs.
21        Q.    Okay.  Other than the removal and the
22   installation of the water pump, any other work on
23   that water pump that you recall?
24        A.    Not on that water pump.
0121
 1        Q.    Okay.  Were there other water pumps that
 2   you worked on?
 3        A.    In my personal house.
 4        Q.    Okay.  I'm just kind of concentrating
 5   still on the family home.
 6        A.    The farmhouse.  That's it.
 7        Q.    Okay.  All right.  The house itself, the
 8   farmhouse, how was that house heated?
 9        A.    Wood, and there was an oil stove,
10   kerosene, in the kitchen.
11        Q.    Was there any type of work done to the oil
12   stove that was in the kitchen?
13        A.    No.  Just your general maintenance.
14        Q.    Right.
15        A.    There was wicks that had to be replaced
16   every so often that was -- would burn out.
17        Q.    Wicks?
18        A.    Wicks.
19        Q.    Yeah.  Okay.
20        A.    Yeah.
21        Q.    Was there -- was the stove itself in the
22   kitchen, was it insulated in any way?
23        A.    I'm sure it was, but nothing exposed.
24        Q.    Okay.  Was it -- there was a metal jacket
0122
 1   as it were?
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And did your father, when he was
 4   performing any sort of maintenance -- strike that.
 5       Was it your father that did the work?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And to do -- to get to the wicks,
 8   did he have to remove the jacket itself?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Okay.  Was there a door somehow access to
11   it?
12        A.    Yeah.  There was covers, and you could
13   remove the top that exposed the burners.
14        Q.    Gotcha.  And how did the heat, then, get
15   up to the second floor?  In other words, what was the
16   process by which the heat got up to the second floor?
17        A.    Gravity.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    There wasn't too much heat upstairs.
20        Q.    I was just going to say.  Was there any
21   sort of insulation or anything up in the second
22   floor?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    No.  Were there any other renovations or
0123
 1   home work -- home work, work that was done on the
 2   home, the family home, other than what we've -- other
 3   than what we've talked about?
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And when did you move out of the
 6   family home on Brown Loaf Road?
 7        A.    It would have been 1961.
 8        Q.    When you got -- when you got married?
 9        A.    Yeah.
10        Q.    Okay.  And then you moved to 180 Gay Road?
11        A.    Right around the corner.
12        Q.    There you go.  All right.  That was easy.
13   All right.  And this home at 180 Gay, was that new
14   construction, or did you buy that home and it had
15   already been constructed?
16        A.    That was new construction.
17        Q.    All right.  Were you involved at all in
18   the construction itself of the home?
19        A.    Some of it.
20        Q.    What was your involvement?
21        A.    The electrical work, and also I installed
22   the water pump.
23        Q.    Okay.  Any other work that you did other
24   than electrical and install a water pump?
0124
 1        A.    Finished the second floor.  In other
 2   words, the downstairs was done by the contractor.
 3        Q.    Yeah.
 4        A.    And I finished the upstairs.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Any other work?  Electrical, water
 6   pump, finishing the second floor.
 7        A.    The -- no.  They were -- not at this point
 8   in time.
 9        Q.    All right.  With respect to the electrical
10   work that you did, did you have any sort of -- are
11   you a licensed electrician?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Okay.  So what type of electrical work did
14   you do?
15        A.    I did the whole thing.  I had an
16   individual that had his license.
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    He pulled the permit.
19        Q.    Right.
20        A.    And he got the inspector to inspect the
21   work.
22        Q.    Okay.  Was he involved at all in
23   overseeing your work or --
24        A.    I used him a couple of times.
0125
 1        Q.    Right.
 2        A.    One time was to wire the boiler, and I did
 3   the rest.
 4        Q.    The first and second floor?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  You indicated you installed a water
 7   pump?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    All right.  And what type of -- what type
10   of water pump was that?
11        A.    That was a Weil-McLain.
12        Q.    Okay.  And where was that water pump
13   installed?
14        A.    In the cellar.  And that's a shallow well,
15   one horsepower.
16        Q.    And what did the installation of that
17   water pump in the cellar entail?  What did you have
18   to do?
19        A.    Basically, you just connect it up to the
20   water pipes.  So it really wasn't a big deal.
21        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  Is that just kind of a
22   metal-to-metal connection?
23        A.    Yeah.  They -- well, it's a black plastic
24   water pipe.
0126
 1        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  And did you review any sort
 2   of, like, manual or how to do that, or did you know
 3   how to install --
 4        A.    No.  No.  I got all that information from
 5   the farmhouse.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  And --
 7        A.    It's basically the same process.
 8        Q.    Where did you purchase the water pump
 9   from?
10        A.    That water pump was purchased at Fitchburg
11   Plumbing on Main Street in Fitchburg.
12        Q.    The other thing that you said in terms of
13   the new construction that you did is you finished the
14   second floor?
15        A.    Correct.
16        Q.    What did -- what did that entail?  What
17   type of work did you do by finishing the second
18   floor?
19        A.    Insulation and drywall.  Those were the
20   two main things.  The floor, we used carpet.
21        Q.    Okay.  So the second floor is essentially
22   framed out?
23        A.    It's framed out.
24        Q.    Yeah.
0127
 1        A.    Except I had to do some of the framework
 2   on the -- you call it a knee wall -- because it's an
 3   expandable Cape with the upstairs being expanded.
 4        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  Kind of -- is it dormered
 5   in the back?
 6        A.    Dormers in the back, and so I had to put
 7   in a knee wall on the front.
 8        Q.    Gotcha.  All right.
 9        A.    It's, I'm going to say, four, five feet.
10        Q.    And how many rooms are in -- on the second
11   floor?
12        A.    Two rooms and a bathroom.
13        Q.    Okay.  And did you have to drywall the two
14   bedrooms and the bathroom?
15        A.    Correct.
16        Q.    Okay.  And insulation, did you insulate
17   between the walls?
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    And did you have to insulate any sort of
20   -- up in the ceiling?
21        A.    The ceiling was there.
22        Q.    Yeah.  Okay.
23        A.    I had to do the walls.
24        Q.    What type of material did you use for the
0128
 1   insulation?
 2        A.    All I know is rolled insulation.  I cannot
 3   tell you the brand name.  I don't even remember --
 4   no.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember the color?
 6        A.    Not really.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall where that was
 8   purchased from?
 9        A.    GV Moore.
10        Q.    And the two rooms, let's start with those.
11   Are those kind of -- because I used to live in a
12   Cape.  You'd walk up in the center stairs.  You had a
13   room left, a room right, and a bathroom straight
14   ahead, right?
15        A.    You got it.
16        Q.    Okay.  So essentially how big were the two
17   front rooms, as it were?  The two bedrooms?
18        A.    Because there were just two rooms up
19   there, they were a fair size.
20        Q.    Yeah.
21        A.    You know, a Cape is about 28 feet.  So
22   about 14.  Fourteen.
23        Q.    Yeah.  Do you recall how -- 14 across.
24   How far deep?
0129
 1        A.    Depth, 28.  Probably 12.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And so you had to do the drywall
 3   work up there, and did you do this by yourself, the
 4   drywall work?
 5        A.    Yeah.  Except for, obviously, I needed to
 6   get help on the ceilings because lifting a -- trying
 7   to hold up a sheet and screw --
 8        Q.    Screw it in.
 9        A.    -- it to the -- no.  So I had to get a
10   second set of hands.
11        Q.    Okay.  Do you remember who it was that
12   came to help you out?
13        A.    Obviously, it would have been at that
14   point in time one of my nephews.
15        Q.    Okay.  Other than your nephew helping to
16   hold while you were --
17        A.    Yeah.  Use a -- like, a T square type of
18   situation.  You could prop it against the floor and
19   get the sheet up there, and then you go along, screw
20   it in.
21        Q.    Gotcha.  So he was there to help kind of
22   with the manual labor?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    In terms of the actual attachment to the
0130
 1   various studs and the framing, that was something you
 2   did, right?
 3        A.    Right.
 4        Q.    And do you recall the manufacturer of the
 5   sheetrock that you installed?
 6        A.    No, I do not.
 7        Q.    And to do this particular type of work,
 8   did you have to cut any of the sheetrock -- pieces of
 9   sheetrock itself to size?
10        A.    Yes, definitely.
11        Q.    For example, you've got the knee board?
12        A.    Yeah.
13        Q.    You're going to have to cut those pieces
14   down, correct?
15        A.    Yeah.
16        Q.    And you talked earlier about the cutting
17   of the sheetrock that you did when -- did in the
18   family home?
19        A.    Yeah.
20        Q.    Is it substantially similar?
21        A.    The same process.
22        Q.    And the cutting of it, that would have
23   been done within that 14-by-12 room?
24        A.    Yeah.
0131
 1        Q.    Okay.  Did you have the sheetrock
 2   delivered, or did you go pick it up?
 3        A.    I don't know.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Was your nephew there also to kind
 5   of help manually take those sheets and bring them to
 6   the second floor?
 7        A.    Oh, yes.
 8        Q.    All right.  The cutting itself, though,
 9   again, would have been done up in the room?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    And doing that, would that have created
12   any sort of dust when you cut those?
13        A.    Oh, definitely.
14        Q.    Okay.  And while you were doing it, did
15   you wear any sort of mask or any sort of protection?
16        A.    No.
17        Q.    The pieces are then -- are they then
18   physically attached to the wall?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  And is that done with the drywall
21   screws?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    The screwing in of the drywall itself with
24   the screws, does that create any dust at all when you
0132
 1   have to drill through that?
 2        A.    Not so -- I'm going to say no, not on the
 3   screwing in of the sheet wall --
 4        Q.    Right.
 5        A.    -- screws.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And then did you use kind of, like,
 7   that same seam tape?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And then were you then putting on
10   the joint compound afterwards?
11        A.    Yup.
12        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of the
13   joint compound that you used?
14        A.    No.
15        Q.    Do you know where you purchased the joint
16   compound from?
17        A.    Yes.  It would have been the same place.
18        Q.    GV?
19        A.    GV Moore.
20        Q.    Okay.  And we talked earlier about doing
21   this joint compound work that you might apply a coat
22   of it on the seam?
23        A.    Yeah.
24        Q.    You'd have to let it dry?
0133
 1        A.    Yeah.
 2        Q.    And then you might have to sand it; is
 3   that correct?
 4        A.    Because of it being a large area, I would
 5   use a wet sponge.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Were there ever any smaller areas
 7   that you had to hand sand like you did at the family
 8   home?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Okay.  So all of the sanding that you did
11   was via a wet sponge on the second floor; is that
12   fair to say?
13        A.    Yes, that's correct.
14              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
15   BY MR. HOOVER:
16        Q.    And when you were doing any sort of that
17   work, did that create any sort of dust?
18        A.    Most of the dust was created when you were
19   cutting it.
20        Q.    Okay.  Gotcha.  But was any dust created
21   when you were doing any of the wet sponge?  You said
22   most of it was when the cutting, but was any dust
23   created?
24        A.    A small amount because I was able to use a
0134
 1   wet sponge on most of it.
 2        Q.    Yeah.
 3        A.    But you still have a few areas that you'd
 4   have to work at, and any time you'd use the dry
 5   sandpaper, you created dust.
 6        Q.    And when you were doing that, you know, we
 7   talked about when you were cutting, you weren't
 8   wearing any sort of mask or anything like that.  What
 9   about when you were doing either with a wet sponge or
10   those areas that you had to use to sand, any mask or
11   anything worn?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Okay.  And so did you drywall both those
14   bedrooms upstairs and then the bathroom itself?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  Other than doing that work for the
17   new construction -- we talked about the drywall work,
18   the water pump, and the electrical work -- any other
19   work that you performed during this new construction?
20        A.    Not on the new construction.
21        Q.    Okay.  You've been in that home since
22   1961?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    Have there been any sort of home
0135
 1   renovation projects?  Any sort of work that you have
 2   done on that home?
 3        A.    Yes.  But me personally?
 4        Q.    Yeah.
 5        A.    No.
 6        Q.    What type -- so have you hired outside
 7   folks to come in and do some work?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    All right.  What type of work have outside
10   folks come in to do?
11        A.    A roof and the flat roof on the dormer.
12        Q.    Okay.  And so they -- did they remove old
13   shingles and put on new ones?
14        A.    They didn't because there was only one
15   layer, and you can go two layers.
16        Q.    All right.
17        A.    So the dormer was totally removed, and a
18   rubber roof was put on.
19        Q.    Okay.  And this was something that, again,
20   you hired someone else to do?
21        A.    I hired a contractor.
22        Q.    Were you present at all when this work was
23   being done?
24        A.    Oh, yes.
0136
 1        Q.    Okay.  Were you up on the roof with these
 2   guys when it was being done?
 3        A.    A little bit.
 4        Q.    A little bit.  Okay.  When they were doing
 5   the dormer on the rubber roof, did they remove the --
 6        A.    They removed it.
 7        Q.    They removed the old shingles?
 8        A.    I was not there.
 9        Q.    You were not there for that.  Okay.  Other
10   than the roofing work, then, any other home
11   renovation work that was been done to the house on
12   Gay Street?
13        A.    The furnace has been replaced several
14   times.
15        Q.    And is this something that you hired
16   somebody to do?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Okay.  This is something you have
19   personally done?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  The furnace that was originally put
22   into the home, did you install that?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    All right.  Do you know the brand name of
0137
 1   the furnace that was put in?
 2        A.    Weil-McLain.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And do you recall who actually
 4   installed the furnace?
 5        A.    Man Haley.  May & Haley.
 6        Q.    May and -- how do you spell the last one?
 7   H -- May and --
 8        A.    Haley.
 9        Q.    Haley.  Okay.  They were kind of the
10   subcontractors that were doing the work for the
11   builder?
12        A.    Yeah, for the builder.
13        Q.    Okay.  And do you know where they're
14   located?
15        A.    They were in Groton.  Now they're in Ayer.
16   Yeah, they're still -- still called the same.
17        Q.    And you indicated that the furnace itself
18   was replaced?
19        A.    Has been replaced, yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  How many times has --
21        A.    Twice.
22        Q.    Okay.  How long after you moved in in 1961
23   was the original furnace removed?
24        A.    Maybe 20 years.
0138
 1        Q.    Okay.  So early '80s?
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And who actually removed the old
 4   furnace?
 5        A.    I did.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And what did that entail, which was
 7   removing the old furnace?
 8        A.    Basically, you took -- or I did -- as much
 9   of it as I could to make it as light as possible.
10        Q.    Uh-huh.
11        A.    And then it was a matter of a dolly and a
12   couple of good backs.
13        Q.    And I'm assuming, obviously, the furnace
14   is down in the basement?
15        A.    Right.
16        Q.    Right.  And --
17        A.    You had to go out through the bulkhead.
18        Q.    Okay.  When you say you "tried to make it
19   as light as possible," what did that entail?
20        A.    You'd take the burner out.
21        Q.    Uh-huh.
22        A.    And that was -- that was the biggest thing
23   that you couldn't strip down too much more.
24        Q.    Okay.  And how big was this furnace?  What
0139
 1   was the size of it?
 2        A.    I'm going to say 12 by 15.  Probably four
 3   feet high.
 4        Q.    Okay.  So you had to remove the burner?
 5   I'm assuming you disconnect the unit?
 6        A.    Right.
 7        Q.    Right.
 8        A.    Right.  Then it was just a matter of
 9   disconnecting several piles.
10        Q.    Uh-huh.
11        A.    Obviously, you had gaskets that had to be
12   cleaned before you put the new furnace in.
13        Q.    Right.
14        A.    And you connected that up.
15        Q.    Were any of the pipes in the basement
16   insulated in any way?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall the -- so did you --
19   I'm assuming if you remove an old one, you've got to
20   put a new furnace in?
21        A.    Right.
22        Q.    What was the brand of the furnace you put
23   in?
24        A.    The same.
0140
 1        Q.    Okay.  Was there a particular model number
 2   of the one you removed, if you can recall?
 3        A.    Not that I can recall, and I don't recall
 4   -- 180-something BTUs, but I don't want to be quoted
 5   for --
 6        Q.    Okay.  And what about the model that you
 7   had installed?
 8        A.    As close to the same as the one that was
 9   in there except newer.
10        Q.    Gotcha.  And where did you purchase the
11   replacement furnace from?
12        A.    I would have bought that at Fitchburg
13   Plumbing.  Fitchburg Heating & Plumbing.
14        Q.    And was that delivered to the home, or did
15   you go pick that up?
16        A.    We picked that up.
17        Q.    When you say "we," who did you go with?
18        A.    One of my nephews.
19        Q.    All right.  One of the ones with the good
20   backs, right?
21        A.    Yeah.
22        Q.    And then did you install that new furnace
23   yourself?
24        A.    Yes.
0141
 1        Q.    All right.  And walk me through that
 2   process.  What does it take to install the new
 3   furnace now?
 4        A.    Other than getting it downstairs, which
 5   then you -- I put it on blocks.
 6        Q.    Right.
 7        A.    You don't have to put it on blocks, but I
 8   did in case, God forbid, that I get water down in the
 9   cellar.
10        Q.    Oh, yeah.
11        A.    It gives it a little added protection.  So
12   then it's just a matter of getting that furnace up on
13   the blocks and lining it up with your old pipes and
14   connecting them.
15        Q.    Okay.
16        A.    That involved making sure that your
17   gaskets are clean.  They've been scraped out and
18   whatnot, and you put -- you connect those pipes up.
19        Q.    Okay.  And how long does that process
20   take, the -- from getting it to having it hooked up
21   and ready to go?
22        A.    Usually a day.
23        Q.    Okay.  And is the bulk part of the day
24   actually getting the furnace itself down the steps in
0142
 1   the bulkhead in proper position?
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    And then once you finely got everything
 4   kind of lined up, it's just a matter of hooking
 5   everything up, right?
 6        A.    Yeah.
 7        Q.    Other than that, any other work that you
 8   did on that particular furnace?
 9        A.    The big thing is your routine maintenance
10   of once a year taking the boiler apart.  You have to
11   clean your chambers.  That's done with a -- a large
12   brush that fits down through the tubes of the
13   chamber, and then after you have cleaned the tubes,
14   all that soot, you want to vacuum out as much as you
15   can.
16        Q.    Okay.
17        A.    And that -- then once a year, and then you
18   put the insulation back on the top of the boiler, and
19   you put your jacket -- the top jacket back on.
20   That's a dusty process because the boiler is hot,
21   and, obviously, you've got a hot object.  Heat rises,
22   and dust comes along with it.
23        Q.    Okay.  The furnace that you removed
24   initially, did you perform this -- this annual
0143
 1   maintenance yourself on that one?
 2        A.    Yes.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And then with the new one that you
 4   installed, again, did you continue yourself to
 5   perform this --
 6        A.    Yes, at that point in time.
 7        Q.    Okay.  At some point in time, did you stop
 8   performing the maintenance?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    All right.  And approximately when would
11   you say you kind of went, that's it, I'm hiring
12   somebody else to do it?
13        A.    Probably 10 years ago now.
14        Q.    Okay.  So --
15        A.    Yeah.
16        Q.    -- the 2008, 2007 time frame?
17        A.    Yeah.  Yeah.
18        Q.    Okay.  But up until that point, that was
19   something that you would do?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  You indicated that you -- the
22   furnace has been replaced twice?
23        A.    Yeah.
24        Q.    All right.  So we know that the first time
0144
 1   was in early 1980.  So you got about 20 years out of
 2   it?
 3        A.    Yeah.
 4        Q.    Is the life of one of these about the
 5   same?  So maybe another 20 years?
 6        A.    At that point in time, especially the
 7   first one --
 8        Q.    Yeah.
 9        A.    -- yeah.  They didn't last too long.
10        Q.    Okay.
11        A.    The newer ones do last a little longer.
12        Q.    So when did you have to replace the first
13   one that you replaced?  In other words, you had one.
14   Replaced it.  Put a second one in.  How long did that
15   second one last?
16        A.    It would have lasted longer, but I decided
17   I wanted to put in a wood boiler.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    So I wanted to give that a try.  So the
20   second one, I really didn't have to replace, but the
21   wood boiler was not the way to go.  So that one was
22   short-lived.
23        Q.    Okay.
24        A.    And that's why the third one -- I wasn't
0145
 1   going to put the second one back in again.
 2        Q.    Right.  I see.  Right.  Right.
 3        A.    So that's when I put in the third one.
 4        Q.    Gotcha.  When did you decide that you were
 5   going to give this wood boiler a try?  Do you know
 6   approximately when that was?
 7        A.    I'm going to say 20 years ago.
 8        Q.    Okay.  So maybe the late '90s?
 9        A.    Yeah.
10        Q.    All right.  And --
11        A.    I remember it was -- oil had really got
12   expensive, and people were looking into wood.
13        Q.    Yeah.
14        A.    And as I say, it didn't work out for me.
15        Q.    Did the wood boiler, was that insulated in
16   any way?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    Do you know the manufacturer of the wood
19   boiler?
20        A.    No, I do not.
21        Q.    How long did you have the wood boiler?
22        A.    Not long.
23        Q.    When you say "not long," is it more than a
24   couple of winters?
0146
 1        A.    A couple of years.
 2        Q.    Yeah.  Okay.
 3        A.    Maybe three at the most.
 4        Q.    And you talked about having to do
 5   maintenance work on your furnace, your boilers,
 6   during the year.  Did you have to do maintenance on
 7   this as well?
 8        A.    More so.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Did -- did any of the maintenance
10   on this wood boiler involve, again -- was it
11   jacketed?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    Okay.  And did the maintenance involve
14   having to take the jacket off to do the work?
15        A.    Not so much that as cleaning the inside of
16   the firebox.
17        Q.    Uh-huh.  Do you know what this wood boiler
18   was insulated with?
19        A.    All I know is insulation.
20        Q.    Okay.  Do you know the color of it?
21        A.    I'm going to say a yellowish color.
22        Q.    Did it have any gaskets that you had to
23   remove and install?
24        A.    No.
0147
 1        Q.    Okay.  So in the late 1990s, we installed
 2   this wood boiler.  It lasts a couple of years.  So
 3   maybe early 2000 you kind of go, this is not working?
 4        A.    Right.
 5        Q.    All right.  And so that's then removed,
 6   right?
 7        A.    Right.
 8        Q.    And did you remove it yourself or have
 9   someone help you?
10        A.    No.  I removed it myself.
11        Q.    Okay.  Where did you buy the wood boiler
12   that you installed?
13        A.    All I know now is one of those home shows
14   in Boston.
15        Q.    Oh, you were visiting one of the -- one of
16   those big home shows type deal?
17        A.    (Witness nodding)
18        Q.    Oh, okay.  I see, and you saw it there,
19   and you kind of --
20        A.    Yeah.
21        Q.    -- you give it a whirl?
22        A.    Not my smartest move.
23        Q.    Live and learn.  So then you decide we'll
24   take the wood boiler out, and then you're going to
0148
 1   put -- you're going to have to replace it, obviously,
 2   correct?
 3        A.    Yes.
 4        Q.    And what did you replace it with?
 5        A.    A Weil-McLain.
 6        Q.    And did you buy that one from Fitchburg?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    And you've talked about how you install a
 9   new furnace.  Was there anything different about this
10   one?
11        A.    Not really, no.
12        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall any sort of model
13   numbers or anything of the one that you installed in
14   the early 2000s?
15        A.    No.  All I know is that I tried to match
16   up the BTUs as close as possible.
17        Q.    Sure.  You talked about that on a yearly
18   basis you would perform the maintenance?
19        A.    Yeah.
20        Q.    And would you continue to do that up
21   until, like you said, like, what?  2008 or so?
22        A.    Yeah, roughly.
23        Q.    Okay.  And is that the furnace, boiler,
24   that's currently in your home now?
0149
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have to make any sort
 3   of repairs to any of these boilers, or was it mostly
 4   yearly maintenance?
 5        A.    Mostly yearly maintenance, except the
 6   circulating pump had to get replaced.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And what did that entail?  Just
 8   simply removing the old one and putting on a new
 9   circulating pump?
10        A.    Removing the old one.
11        Q.    Yeah.
12        A.    And you've got two gaskets involved.
13   You've got four nuts and bolts that hold to the
14   motor.
15        Q.    Right.
16        A.    Taking those off, cleaning the gaskets,
17   and putting the new one in, and wire up the new one.
18        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of the old
19   one that you removed?
20        A.    No, I don't.
21        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of the new
22   one you installed?  I got you on this.
23        A.    I'm drawing a blank here.  I'm drawing a
24   blank.
0150
 1        Q.    If it comes to you.  You know, I don't
 2   want you -- I mean, I don't want -- if you want a few
 3   minutes to try to think about it.  If not, if it
 4   comes to you whenever, you can just let me know.
 5   Does that sound fair or --
 6        A.    Yeah.  It was basically -- I believe it
 7   was a Cranes.
 8        Q.    Cranes, C-R-A-N-E-S?
 9        A.    Yeah.  A pump.
10        Q.    Okay.  The one you put on?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    Right.  Okay.  Other than the work that
13   we've talked about in terms of the new construction
14   that you assisted on, basically the electrical, the
15   water pump that you installed, and finishing up the
16   second floor, and then the work that you've done in
17   terms of the replacements of the furnace in the
18   house, is there any other home renovation work that
19   you have personally done that we've not talked about?
20        A.    That I've personally done?
21        Q.    Yeah.  I know you hired the outside folks
22   to do the roofing work?
23        A.    Yeah.  And windows.  I hired an -- outside
24   to put in new windows.
0151
 1        Q.    New windows, yeah.
 2        A.    That's the main -- that's the main part.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Okay.
 4              MR. HOOVER:  It's about 12:30 now.  Folks
 5   sometimes get a little antsy for food, like myself.
 6   I'm going to kind of shift gears and move into your
 7   employment.  It seems to be a nice stopping break if
 8   folks want to grab a bite to eat, and usually we take
 9   about an hour for lunch, if that works for you?  Is
10   that good?
11              THE WITNESS:  That's fine.
12              MR. HOOVER:  So it's 12:30 now.  We'll
13   come back at 1:30.
14              MR. BECERRA:  No problem.
15              MR. HOOVER:  No problem.  Folks on the
16   phone, we're going to be take a lunch break.  We'll
17   be back around 1:30.
18              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
19   approximately 12:24, and this is the end of media
20   number two.
21              (A lunch break was taken from 12:24 to
22              1:36 p.m.)
23              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are now on the
24   record.  The time is approximately 1:36, and this is
0152
 1   the beginning of media number three.  Counsel, you
 2   may proceed.
 3              MR. HOOVER:  Thank you.
 4   BY MR. HOOVER:
 5        Q.    Welcome back, sir.
 6        A.    Thank you.
 7        Q.    Are you all set to continue for a little
 8   while?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    Okay.  Excellent.  Real quick, sir, before
11   we get into your employment, did you ever serve in
12   the military?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    That takes care of that.  So far in terms
15   of your work history, we know that while you were in
16   high school, you mentioned you spent a couple of
17   summers working with your brother down at the paint
18   -- B & D Paint Company in West Palm Beach, Florida.
19   You worked for, during high school, Martin's Service
20   Station, correct?
21        A.    Correct.
22        Q.    And, obviously, you also started working
23   and helping your father out in Groton Refrigeration,
24   correct?
0153
 1        A.    Correct.
 2        Q.    Aside from those three entities, the paint
 3   place, the service station, and your father's
 4   business, during high school, sir, did you have any
 5   other jobs?
 6        A.    No.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And if we had to break them down in
 8   terms of chronologically, because 1950 around the age
 9   of 10 was when you started helping your father as
10   part of Groton Refrigeration.  I assume that one kind
11   of came first; is that fair to say?
12        A.    Yeah.
13        Q.    Okay.  And then when you were working at
14   Martin's Service Station, you had your license then.
15   So you would have been at least 16, right?
16        A.    Correct.
17        Q.    So is it fair to say it was those two
18   summers, then, before working at Martin's you went
19   down to Florida to do the paintwork?
20        A.    Yeah.
21        Q.    Okay.  And you graduated from high school
22   -- I'm sorry -- in 19 -- what year?
23        A.    1960.
24        Q.    1960.  Okay.  Did you ever -- have you
0154
 1   ever seen your Social Security printout, sir?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Let me show you something that has
 4   been produced by your attorney in this case.  I'll
 5   show you a copy of that.  Because I have a few
 6   questions about that, if I could.  He's got a chance
 7   to take a look at it.  He'll show you, and you might
 8   be able to kind of help us out.
 9       Okay.  First of all, what I'll do is I'll mark
10   this Exhibit Number 1.  I'm going to mark it as an
11   exhibit.
12              MR. HOOVER:  If we could mark the Social
13   Security printout as Exhibit Number 1.
14   
15              (Exhibit No. 1, Social Security Printout,
16              marked for identification)
17   
18   BY MR. HOOVER:
19        Q.    And then if you want to take a quick peek
20   through that, sir, and I'll ask one, have you ever
21   seen that document before, sir?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Okay.  This was something that was
24   produced in this case, and it essentially is a copy
0155
 1   of your what they call your itemized statement of
 2   earnings, and it has your various employers over the
 3   course of your lifetime.
 4        A.    Yup.
 5        Q.    Okay.  So I wanted to ask you just a
 6   couple of questions about a couple of entities up in
 7   the beginning.  So if you turn to page 1, sir, do you
 8   see there in 1957, it mentions The Groton Inn?
 9        A.    A dishwasher.
10        Q.    Dishwasher.  Okay.  And it doesn't look
11   like you spent much time there because only the first
12   quarter you made 29 bucks.
13        A.    Short-lived.
14        Q.    I was going to say.  So just washing
15   dishes, and for a short period of time at the Groton
16   Inn?
17        A.    Right.
18        Q.    Okay.  And then on that same year, in 1957
19   -- so this is going -- you would have been in high
20   school at the time, right?
21        A.    Yeah.
22        Q.    Okay.  There is -- again, now, we're into
23   the second quarter in '57.  There is an employer by
24   the name of Donald Priest?
0156
 1        A.    Right.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Who was Donald Priest?
 3        A.    He owned an apple orchard in Groton.
 4        Q.    Okay.
 5        A.    And my mother did housework for that
 6   family.
 7        Q.    Okay.
 8        A.    That's how I became involved.
 9        Q.    And what was your involvement with
10   Mr. Priest there in 1957?  It looks like $280?
11        A.    Obviously, it was something to do with --
12   whether taking boxes out to place them under trees.
13        Q.    Oh, okay.
14        A.    So people would pick and fill the boxes
15   up.
16        Q.    Gotcha.
17        A.    I took them out empty, and someone filled
18   them up.
19        Q.    Okay.  Was that the nature and extent of
20   your work for Mr. Priest?
21        A.    For Mr. Priest, yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  And then it looks like just below
23   that in 1960 -- so maybe that was your senior year --
24   it says the same thing $208, again, working for
0157
 1   Mr. Priest on Old Ayer Road.  Was that the same
 2   thing, in 1960?
 3        A.    Yeah, that's the same.
 4        Q.    Did you do anything in terms of any sort
 5   of work on any of the equipment that Mr. Priest owned
 6   to run the farm?
 7        A.    Yeah.  He had cold storage plant.
 8        Q.    A cold storage plant?
 9        A.    Yeah.  Where they -- after they pick the
10   apples, they put them in there for keeping.
11        Q.    Uh-huh.
12        A.    Just to store them.
13        Q.    Okay.  And were you involved at all in the
14   maintenance of the plant?
15        A.    My father took care of it.  So if there
16   was some project that he'd want me to do or something
17   like that.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    In other words, that was not my main
20   project.
21        Q.    Right.  As I understand, your main
22   employment with Mr. Priest was to place these empty
23   boxes near trees?
24        A.    Yeah.  Yeah, because it wasn't a full-time
0158
 1   thing.  You know, only certain times, obviously --
 2        Q.    Right.
 3        A.    -- you're doing that.
 4        Q.    What types of projects was your father
 5   doing for Mr. Priest?
 6        A.    He took care of the maintenance of the
 7   cold storage plant.
 8        Q.    And did you assist your father at all in
 9   terms of the maintenance of this plant?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    And what types of things was your father
12   doing as it pertains to the maintenance of the plant?
13        A.    Well, basically, it was a cold storage
14   plant.  So it was weekly that he would have to shut
15   it down and put it on a defrost cycle, and that would
16   take a period of time just waiting for it to fully
17   defrost before you could start everything back up.
18        Q.    Okay.  And was there any sort of machinery
19   or equipment that was involved with this particular
20   cold storage?
21        A.    Oh, yes.
22        Q.    Okay.  And did your father perform any
23   sort of maintenance on any of the machinery as part
24   of the cold storage?
0159
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    And what types of machinery was involved
 3   that your father worked on?
 4        A.    Well, it -- the main compressor had a
 5   series of two latch belts that had to be maintained
 6   and had to have belt dressing put on them, and the
 7   bearings had to be lubricated.
 8        Q.    So this was -- is this like a general
 9   maintenance of the machinery?
10        A.    General maintenance and make sure that the
11   gas was -- it was a cold storage, so it was a large
12   compressor.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    And it was -- it had large gas cylinders
15   that you had to make sure that the freon was up to --
16   was full.
17        Q.    Okay.  And were you ever involved in any
18   of this type of work with your father, or was this
19   kind of his job while yours was doing the empty boxes
20   type thing?
21        A.    As I say, if there was a project that he
22   wanted me to do, you know, I would do it.
23        Q.    And do you have any specific memory of a
24   specific project that he wanted you to do that
0160
 1   involved this particular compressor?
 2        A.    Well, basically, I would -- if I was going
 3   to be up there, I would start the defrosting process,
 4   and he wouldn't have to bother with it.
 5        Q.    Okay.
 6        A.    Because I could still do my other work
 7   while everything was shut down.
 8        Q.    And to start the defrosting process, what
 9   -- did that entail kind of switching things off?
10        A.    Basically, shutting the main compressor
11   down and turning on the water that went into the
12   condensers to defrost the condensers.
13        Q.    Do you recall the manufacturer of the --
14        A.    No.
15        Q.    -- the main compressor?
16        A.    No.
17        Q.    Okay.  Other than that, did your father
18   have any other sort of involvement with Mr. Priest?
19        A.    That was his main -- take care of the cold
20   storage unit.
21        Q.    Did your father have any involvement in
22   maintaining or repairing any of the vehicles or any
23   of the other equipment that Mr. Priest had?
24        A.    No.  No.
0161
 1        Q.    And as I understand, you were not involved
 2   in maintaining any of the equipment that he had other
 3   than what you talked about in terms of the defrosting
 4   process; is that fair to say?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  I'm going to kind of go through
 7   what we have here in terms of your Social Security
 8   because I noted on Exhibit 1 there is no Groton
 9   Refrigeration?
10        A.    Right.
11        Q.    Were you paid by your father for the work
12   that you did?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    Okay.  And was that under the table?
15        A.    I have no idea.
16        Q.    Okay.  You just got some money?
17        A.    That would have been between him and his
18   accountant.
19        Q.    Gotcha.
20        A.    I have no idea how I was paid except I got
21   paid.
22        Q.    There you go.  Now, your father -- you ran
23   the business for its final year, right, from, like,
24   '71 to '72?
0162
 1        A.    Yeah, basically doing what I had to do and
 2   to give the people sufficient time to find someone
 3   else to take our place.
 4        Q.    Okay.  So the customers could find a new
 5   place to get their service done and what have you?
 6        A.    Yeah.  There were a few that didn't want
 7   to let go, but, yeah.
 8        Q.    Okay.  When your father owned the
 9   business, did he have -- you talk about between him
10   and his accountant or his -- did he have a particular
11   person who kept the books for the company?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Okay.  Who was in charge of keeping the
14   books?
15        A.    Him.
16        Q.    Okay.  And when -- when the -- when you
17   ran the company or had the company and you were
18   winding it up, what happened to any sort of records
19   that he might have generated during the course of his
20   ownership of the business?
21        A.    Basically, I don't know.
22        Q.    Okay.  Today are you aware of any records
23   that remain from Groton Refrigeration?
24        A.    The only thing I happened to come across
0163
 1   was a book of bills that we used to write our bills
 2   out on.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Are these bills that have yet --
 4   you know, kind of like that book where you haven't
 5   had a chance to write them out yet?
 6        A.    Yeah, with a piece of carbon.
 7        Q.    Okay.  All right.  Do you have any old
 8   checks or any sort of old books or any sort of old
 9   records?
10        A.    No.  No old checks.  That's about the only
11   thing I do have from Groton Refrigeration.
12        Q.    Okay.  And as I understand it, those are
13   all blank?  In other words, they haven't been filled
14   in?
15        A.    Those are blank.
16        Q.    Okay.  Did your father also prepare the
17   tax returns for the company, or did he have somebody
18   do that for him?
19        A.    He had someone do it.  Ralph Bowmar was a
20   lawyer in Ayer.
21        Q.    I'm sorry.  What's his last name?
22        A.    I don't know.
23        Q.    Bowmar, did you say?
24        A.    Yes.
0164
 1        Q.    And he's out of Ayer?
 2        A.    He was out of Ayer.  He has since passed
 3   away, but I think the firm is still there, and it's
 4   Bowmar & Larkin or Larkin & Bowmar.  I'm not sure
 5   which.
 6        Q.    Okay.  All right.  As far as you know,
 7   they were the ones who was kind of responsible for
 8   filing the tax returns?
 9        A.    They took care of the -- I know that.
10        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  Do you know if your father
11   ever had the business incorporated?
12        A.    No.
13        Q.    Okay.  No, you don't know, or no, it never
14   was?
15        A.    It never was.  It seems to me I would have
16   known that.  No.  It was sort of low-key --
17        Q.    Gotcha.
18        A.    -- family, you know --
19        Q.    Yeah.  All right.  Well, then I'm going --
20   before I get to Groton Refrigeration, I kind of want
21   to go through at least what we have here on Exhibit
22   Number 1.
23        A.    Yeah.  Yeah.
24        Q.    So you graduate high school, and it looks
0165
 1   to me, if I'm looking at this correct on page 2, the
 2   first employer full-time -- and, again, it kind of
 3   cut off.  So if you go to page 2, which is the next
 4   one, I think.  You see up top there, it looks like
 5   it's cut off.  Is that Courier Westford, Inc.?
 6        A.    Yeah.  That's a company that -- it was
 7   Murray Printing Company.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    In Forge Village.  Courier Corporation
10   bought them out after I had left.
11        Q.    So when you worked there, they were Murray
12   Printing?
13        A.    They were Murray Printing Company in
14   Westford.
15        Q.    And is that your first full-time job after
16   high school?
17        A.    Yes.
18        Q.    Okay.  And by "full-time," were you
19   working five days week, 40 hours a week?
20        A.    I think we were working -- it was 35 hours
21   a week.
22        Q.    Okay.  And when you first joined Murray
23   Printing after high school, what was your position?
24        A.    A stripper.
0166
 1        Q.    I've got to ask.  What were you doing as a
 2   stripper for Murray Printing, sir?
 3        A.    Basically, it -- it's a process of dealing
 4   with negatives and taking those negatives and laying
 5   them down in position form.  So you could take and
 6   put together either 16 pages or 32 pages, and they
 7   would all go on one sheet of paper.  And they had to
 8   be in position form.  Meaning, so when it goes
 9   through the folder, they can fold this thing all the
10   way down, and it's going to come out page 1 to 16 or
11   page 1 to 32.
12        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.
13        A.    And, you know, to put the book together.
14        Q.    Okay.  And what -- and, again, I know the
15   name implies printing, but what type of work was
16   Murray Printing involved with?
17        A.    Book printing.
18        Q.    Okay.  And you had mentioned it earlier.
19   Is this -- is this at the old Abbot Mill?
20        A.    Yes.  Yup.
21        Q.    And that particular building, Abbot Mills,
22   that's still in existence today, correct?
23        A.    It's apartments.
24        Q.    Right.  They've kind of converted them all
0167
 1   into these semi high-end nice-looking apartments?
 2        A.    Yeah, because Courier went out of business
 3   several years ago, and everything was turned into
 4   apartments, I guess.
 5        Q.    Right.  Right.  But when you were there,
 6   it was, obviously, still a mill?
 7        A.    Yeah.
 8        Q.    And the building itself, do you know how
 9   old the building was when you first started working
10   in 1961?
11        A.    Well, it was old then.
12        Q.    Yeah.
13        A.    I don't know when.  I know it's -- the
14   year is on the building, but I can't tell you.
15        Q.    Can you describe for us what the building
16   -- the building that you worked in, describe that
17   building for us.
18        A.    A typical mill building.  I mean, brick
19   walls, windows, and a wood floor, and wood roof or
20   wood ceilings.
21        Q.    Was there any sort of piping that ran
22   through the facility?
23        A.    Oh, yes.
24        Q.    Okay.  And was that piping up in the
0168
 1   ceiling?
 2        A.    Yes.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And was that piping insulated?
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    How was the mill heated?
 6        A.    You know, I really don't know.  I don't
 7   know.  Obviously, there was a boiler somewhere, but I
 8   have no idea where.
 9        Q.    During your time -- as I understand, if I
10   look at the printout, it looks like you worked there
11   from '61 to '73.  Does that sound about right?
12        A.    That's about right.
13        Q.    Okay.  And from that time period, from '61
14   to '73, was that full-time the entire time?
15        A.    Full-time.
16        Q.    Okay.  Thirty-five hours, five days a
17   week?
18        A.    Yeah.
19        Q.    Okay.  So during that time frame, at no
20   time was your job ever -- or did your duties ever
21   take you to work in and around the boiler or any sort
22   of the heating company for that company?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have to work -- was
0169
 1   there a pump house in the mill?
 2        A.    I'm sure there was.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have to work in or
 4   around that building?
 5        A.    I had nothing to do with it.
 6        Q.    Was there any sort of ventilation or
 7   exhaust in the building itself that you worked in?
 8        A.    Yeah.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And what type of ventilation did
10   they have?
11        A.    Forced hot air.
12        Q.    Okay.  Were there any type of fans or
13   anything that were on the floors?
14        A.    They were up above.  There were fans.
15        Q.    Okay.  That hung from the ceiling?
16        A.    Yeah.
17        Q.    Okay.  The mill itself, was it more than
18   one story?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    And was it open from floor to ceiling --
21   to the top, or were there floors?
22        A.    Floors.
23        Q.    Okay.  And how many floors were there in
24   this building?
0170
 1        A.    I'm going to say it's three.
 2        Q.    Okay.
 3        A.    I'm pretty sure it was three.  You had the
 4   basement floor, the lower level, the cement floor.
 5        Q.    Yeah.
 6        A.    And then the other two floors were wood.
 7        Q.    Gotcha.
 8        A.    Yeah.  So it was three, I'm almost
 9   positive.
10        Q.    Okay.  And as a stripper for Murray
11   Printing, were you assigned to a particular floor?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    And what floor were you assigned to?
14        A.    Basically, it would have been the first
15   floor.  Well, no.  The second floor.  If you're
16   counting the cement floor, the basement, as one, then
17   I would have been on the second floor.
18        Q.    Okay.  And if you walked into the main
19   entrance at the mill, did you come in on the second
20   floor and have to go down to the basement or up to
21   the second floor, or do you come in on the basement
22   level?
23        A.    You could have done both.
24        Q.    Okay.
0171
 1        A.    We had a door that would come in to our
 2   level.
 3        Q.    Uh-huh.
 4        A.    Or if we packed out back, we would have
 5   come in the lower level and went up to the second
 6   floor or first floor.
 7        Q.    Gotcha.  On the first floor level, the
 8   basement level, what type of work was performed down
 9   there?
10        A.    Down there, it was mostly the pressroom
11   because it was the cement.
12        Q.    And then the second floor, which would be
13   the floor that you worked on, what other types of --
14   as I understand, you were kind of laying out sheets
15   to be eventually folded?
16        A.    Yeah.
17        Q.    What other type of work was being
18   performed on that second floor?
19        A.    Well, basically, that's where -- yeah.  We
20   did the negative assembly, whatever you want, and
21   once we put this in position form, we taped the
22   negatives down.
23        Q.    Yeah.
24        A.    From there, they took and opened up the
0172
 1   negatives so they could set these negatives on a
 2   plate, and pulled the vacuum so they could -- it
 3   would burn the negative right into the plate or the
 4   image.
 5        Q.    Yeah.
 6        A.    Then the plate would be taken from there.
 7   Taken down to the pressroom and put on the presses.
 8        Q.    Right.  Because then that's -- using that
 9   image, you can start to make the 16- or 32-page --
10        A.    Right.
11        Q.    -- book that you might be working on,
12   right?
13        A.    Yeah.
14        Q.    Okay.  But your involvement at this stage,
15   in your career anyway, is just to lay out the
16   negative assembly, right?
17        A.    Right.
18        Q.    All right.  And what types of materials
19   are you working with as part of this negative
20   assembly?
21        A.    Eighty-pound golden rod, which was sheets
22   of 25 by 38, 80-pound.  Obviously, Scotch tape.  A
23   tape dispenser.  That was the main -- we would lay
24   the negatives out on the golden rod.
0173
 1        Q.    Right.
 2        A.    Then from there, they would turn sheets
 3   over and cut out -- when I say "cut out," the image
 4   area of the negative.  So then they could put that on
 5   a plate and burn it.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Were you responsible --
 7        A.    And expose it.
 8        Q.    Were you responsible for the cutting out
 9   of the negative?
10        A.    No.  No.
11        Q.    And I assume you weren't responsible for
12   then getting the negative onto the plate to be
13   exposed?
14        A.    No.
15        Q.    So your involvement, at this stage anyway,
16   was simply -- and not to minimize it -- but simply to
17   kind of lay these negatives out in whatever order
18   they told you to and tape them down?
19        A.    Correct.
20        Q.    How long were you a stripper for Murray
21   Printing?
22        A.    Ever since -- for my 10 years I was there.
23        Q.    All right.  So during this 10 years from
24   '61 to '73, did you operate any of the machinery at
0174
 1   Murray Printing?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Okay.  On -- so other than coming into the
 4   first floor occasionally to work your way up to where
 5   you would work, were you ever involved in any of the
 6   machinery on the first floor?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    And on the first floor it was just kind
 9   of, you say a pressroom?
10        A.    Pressroom was the main -- well, obviously,
11   somewhere around there there was some boilers and
12   whatnot.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    I had no involvement.
15        Q.    Do you know the manufacturers of any of
16   the boilers that were there?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Were you ever -- were you ever present
19   when anyone was ever working on the boilers as you
20   passed through?
21        A.    No.  No.
22        Q.    Okay.  Because if you were on the first
23   floor, it was essentially just to walk through to get
24   the second floor; is that fair to say?
0175
 1        A.    Yeah.
 2        Q.    Okay.  Do you know the types of machines
 3   that were on the first floor other than -- were they
 4   called presses?
 5        A.    They were presses.
 6        Q.    Okay.
 7        A.    They --
 8        Q.    And you never operated any one of those
 9   presses?
10        A.    I didn't operate any.
11        Q.    And fair to say, obviously, if you didn't
12   operate them, you weren't performing sort of repairs
13   or maintenance on any of them?
14        A.    Correct.
15        Q.    Were any others performing maintenance or
16   repairs on them while you were walking through?
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Okay.  What was up on the third floor?
19        A.    Mostly storage.
20        Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have to go up to the
21   third floor?
22        A.    I did.  Maybe just to nose around.
23        Q.    Okay.  What kind of things were they
24   storing up on the third floor?
0176
 1        A.    You know, old lineup tables.  Stuff that
 2   wasn't used on their first or second floor.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  Your area where you would
 4   lay out the negative assemblies, was that -- was that
 5   its own separate area on the second floor?
 6        A.    Yes.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Was it an enclosed area, or was it
 8   open --
 9        A.    Open.
10        Q.    Okay.  So you could see kind of from one
11   end of the second floor all the way through?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    And in terms of these negatives going onto
14   a plate, that was all done on the second floor?
15        A.    Yeah.
16        Q.    Were they particular types of machines
17   that this function took place on?
18        A.    Yes.  Yeah.  They were platemakers, which
19   they called it, which was basically a vacuum frame
20   that held the 25 by 38 -- that sheets that had the
21   negatives on there.
22        Q.    Yeah.  And it's fair to say --
23        A.    And they would draw or vacuum so the
24   negatives got tight against the plate.
0177
 1        Q.    Right.
 2        A.    So when it was exposed with light, they
 3   wouldn't spread out or anything.  They would be as
 4   close to an exact duplicate.
 5        Q.    Right.
 6        A.    Except going from negative to positive.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And then, basically, it's
 8   transferred up onto the plate?
 9        A.    Yeah.
10        Q.    Okay.  With respect to the negative
11   assemblies that you had created, was it your
12   responsibility to get it over to the platemaker, or
13   did someone come take it from your area and bring it
14   over there?
15        A.    No.  It was the individuals when they
16   finished the job.  Depending on how many pages was in
17   that book would depend on how many sheets --
18        Q.    Yeah.
19        A.    -- that you had, and if you had a half a
20   dozen, well, you'd -- when you were all said and
21   done, you took the half a dozen, and in my case where
22   I was at, you take them down back and put them on a
23   shelf, and the girls would take them from there, and
24   they would cut the golden rod out around the image
0178
 1   area.
 2        Q.    Gotcha.  So you would create your 25-by-38
 3   sheet?
 4        A.    Yeah.
 5        Q.    Once it was done or if you needed a dozen
 6   or whatever the number was --
 7        A.    Yeah.
 8        Q.    -- you then took those sheets and walked
 9   them back and put them on a particular shelf?
10        A.    Yeah.
11        Q.    And then another employee at Murray
12   Printing would come and say, oh, these ones are done.
13   I can then take them over to the platemaker?
14        A.    Correct.
15        Q.    Okay.  So fair to say that you never
16   operated, then, a platemaker machine?
17        A.    Not there.
18        Q.    Did you ever perform any sort of
19   maintenance or repairs on any platemaker machine
20   between '61 and '73 at Murray Printing?
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    Okay.  Were there any other sorts of
23   trades or professions working at Murray Printing in
24   terms of, like, maintenance guys or anything like
0179
 1   that?
 2        A.    No.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Was there more than one shift?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And what shift did you work?
 6        A.    First.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And what would the hours have been
 8   on first shift?
 9        A.    I believe it was, like, 8:00 to 4:00.
10        Q.    Okay.  And did you remain on first shift
11   for the entire time from '61 to '73?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    Why did you leave Murray Printing in 1973?
14        A.    I basically got bored.
15        Q.    Okay.
16        A.    And I had an opportunity to go to a
17   smaller company where I would do different functions.
18        Q.    Okay.  Before we move on to the different
19   company, when you worked at Murray Company for these
20   about 12 years or so, did you wear any sort of
21   breathing protection?
22        A.    No.
23        Q.    Okay.  Were you a member of a union?
24        A.    No.
0180
 1        Q.    Did -- did Murray Printing have any type
 2   of safety department?
 3        A.    Safety?
 4        Q.    Yeah.
 5        A.    Not that I'm aware of.  I'm sure they had
 6   something.
 7        Q.    Okay.  So fair to say -- do you recall any
 8   safety meetings being held at Murray Printing?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Do you have any memory when you worked
11   there up through 1973 of Murray Printing posting any
12   warnings or instructions?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    Okay.  Do you have any memory of OSHA ever
15   having to visit the mill?
16        A.    No.
17        Q.    Do you have any memory of any sort of
18   instructions or warnings being posted about the use
19   of asbestos prior to leaving?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Okay.  So you got a little bored with
22   making 25-by-38 sheets 35 hours a week?
23        A.    Doing the same thing day in and day out,
24   right.
0181
 1        Q.    Okay.  So where did you then next go in
 2   1973?
 3        A.    Basically, that was -- well, it said GV
 4   Moore Lumber Company, which was Hale Moore Printing
 5   Company.  George Moore was a partner in Hale Moore
 6   Printing Company.
 7        Q.    Okay.  So if we look at the Exhibit Number
 8   1, because it says here in 1973 you started working
 9   for JV Moore Lumber Co., (sic) but you were still
10   doing the printing work, right?
11        A.    I was -- GV Moore Lumber, or George Moore,
12   was the partner -- the money partner in Hale Moore
13   Printing Company.
14        Q.    Gotcha.
15        A.    How they did their books, I don't know.
16        Q.    Okay.  Is this JV Moore Lumber the same
17   one you referenced where you purchased some product?
18        A.    The same one.
19        Q.    Okay.  But when you worked there, you were
20   not working there as a salesman of product, correct?
21   You were still working -- you were doing the
22   printing?
23        A.    I was doing printing.
24        Q.    Okay.  And where was Hale Moore Printing
0182
 1   located when you went to work there in 1973?
 2        A.    In Ayer, Mass.
 3        Q.    Do you recall the street that it was
 4   located on?
 5        A.    No, I do not.
 6        Q.    Do you know if it's still there?
 7        A.    I know the building is still there.
 8        Q.    Do you know if Mr. -- if Hale Moore
 9   Printing is still in existence?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    No, you don't know, or no, it's not?
12        A.    No, it's not.
13        Q.    Okay.  Do you know when it went out of
14   business?
15        A.    I can give you an approximate date.  I
16   don't know the exact date.
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    That was not long after I had left.
19        Q.    Okay.  And when did you --
20        A.    And not because I left they went out of
21   business.
22        Q.    Don't sell yourself short.  That might
23   have been the reason.
24        A.    That's one of the reasons I left there,
0183
 1   but that's a long story.
 2        Q.    When did you leave Hale Moore then?
 3        A.    1985.
 4        Q.    Okay.  So from 1973 to 1985, you were
 5   working full-time at Hale Moore Printing, correct?
 6        A.    Hale Moore Printing.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And when we're talking full-time,
 8   what were your hours per week from '73 to '85?
 9        A.    Because I was production manager, they
10   were flexible.  I was basically salary at 40 hours a
11   week.
12        Q.    And when you joined Hale Moore Printing in
13   1973, did you join as a production manager?
14        A.    Yes.
15        Q.    Okay.  And as a production manager, what
16   were your duties and responsibilities?
17        A.    Basically, to coordinate the work.  To
18   make sure that everything got done in a timely
19   fashion.
20        Q.    Okay.  Let me back up a little bit to
21   Murray Printing.  How big of a company was that?  How
22   many employees were there?
23        A.    Murray Printing Company?
24        Q.    Yeah.  When you worked there from '61 to
0184
 1   '73.
 2        A.    Yeah, you know, it was a large company.
 3   It was three shifts.
 4        Q.    Oh, okay.  Per shift?
 5        A.    You know, I really never knew exactly how
 6   many employees they had.
 7        Q.    Uh-huh.
 8        A.    But it was a large -- that's all I can
 9   say.  A large company.
10        Q.    Okay.  And you go to Hale Moore.  How does
11   that compare in size to Murray Printing?
12        A.    There was no comparison.  Hale Moore was a
13   lot smaller company.
14        Q.    Okay.  When you started there in '73, do
15   you have an approximate idea of how many employees
16   were there?
17        A.    Yeah.  Basically, I'm going to say 12.
18        Q.    Okay.  And how did you come to hear of the
19   opening for a production manager at Hale Moore?
20        A.    I believe I seen an ad in the newspaper
21   for a production manager.
22        Q.    Okay.  Did -- you felt you had enough
23   experience from Murray Printing to be a production
24   manager?
0185
 1        A.    No, but I had some thoughts about it.
 2        Q.    All right.  And so you went over,
 3   interviewed, and got the job?
 4        A.    Yeah.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And when you worked at Hale Moore
 6   from '73 to '85, were you a production manager the
 7   entire time?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And did your responsibilities of
10   coordinating the work to ensure that it got done on a
11   timely matter, did those duties and responsibilities
12   essentially ever change?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    Okay.  So tell me -- you know, if you can
15   kind of elaborate, on what does it take to coordinate
16   the work as a production manager?
17        A.    Try to solve any bottlenecks, you might
18   say.  If jobs got hung up and for what reason and how
19   could I make things work smoother.
20              (Someone speaks on speakerphone)
21              MR. HOOVER:  Oh, I get to do it for the
22   first time.  Somebody, just make sure you keep your
23   phone on mute.  Because you never know what they're
24   going to say.  There it goes.  Okay.
0186
 1   BY MR. HOOVER:
 2        Q.    And Murray Printing was kind of in the
 3   business of printing and creating books.  What about
 4   Hale and Moore?  Did they have a specialty?
 5        A.    They were more on the commercial end of
 6   it.  Meaning, they did many different things.  They
 7   did a lot of colored brochures for furniture
 8   companies in Gardner, Mass.  Nichols & Stones happens
 9   to be one that I can remember.
10        Q.    Right.
11        A.    Anyway, that's just one, but there were
12   advertisement brochures, too.
13        Q.    So not quite as much at the book end?
14   More on the smaller --
15        A.    Right.
16        Q.    -- brochure-type thing?
17        A.    Right.  And more on the -- Murray Printing
18   Company were black and white work, and Hale Moore got
19   into the four-color process a lot more in depth and a
20   lot more quality involved in the printing industry.
21        Q.    And what kind of building in Ayer was
22   Moore & Hale located in?  What did it look like?
23        A.    What kind of building?
24        Q.    Yeah.
0187
 1        A.    It was a single-story building.  How many
 2   square feet?  I'm going to say 8,000 square feet.
 3        Q.    And was the entire printing process kind
 4   of like from the beginning to end all located on this
 5   single floor?
 6        A.    But it was -- excuse me -- divided so we
 7   still had, like, what I call the prep area.
 8        Q.    Uh-huh.
 9        A.    And we had the pressroom.
10        Q.    Yeah.
11        A.    And then we had the bindery and then paper
12   storage.  So it was divided up into four -- four
13   sections.
14        Q.    Okay.  So would the prep area here at
15   Moore & Hale be kind of like generally the area like
16   you had worked at at Murray Printing, right?  Kind of
17   setting up the sheets or the brochure to start the
18   process?
19        A.    Yeah.
20        Q.    Okay.  And did you as a production manager
21   ever work in the prep area?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    Okay.  And what types work would you have
24   done as production manager in the prep area?
0188
 1        A.    Well, basically, whatever had to get
 2   picked up, whether it was camera work or the
 3   stripping end of it or platemaking.  I floated, in
 4   other words.
 5        Q.    And I guess maybe the -- I want to know
 6   kind of as a production manager, are you kind of,
 7   like, helping out in these four areas as needed?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    And like you said, so you're kind of,
10   like, overseeing the entire process --
11        A.    Right.
12        Q.    -- to make sure that you can get from the
13   prep area basically through the bindery and get the
14   product out --
15        A.    Correct.
16        Q.    -- in a timely manner, right?
17        A.    Yeah.
18        Q.    And so if someone in the pressroom, if
19   something gets kind of snagged or slowed down, you
20   might be called in to figure out how to unblock it
21   and get the process moving?
22        A.    Correct.
23        Q.    Is that fair to say?
24        A.    Yes.
0189
 1        Q.    Okay.  With respect to the prep area, were
 2   there a certain number of employees assigned
 3   specifically to the prep area?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And they would have been
 6   responsible essentially for the day-to-day prep, but
 7   if they needed extra help, that's when you might step
 8   in?
 9        A.    That's correct.
10        Q.    Okay.  And would the same be held true,
11   then, for, like, the press area?  You have a certain
12   number of employees dedicated to the press area?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    And if they needed help, kind of the same
15   thing, you'd be called in to help?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    And the same thing with the bindery,
18   right?  Correct?
19        A.    That's correct.
20        Q.    Okay.  In terms of the press area, then,
21   on this single-story building, how big of an area is
22   that, and what types of machinery is in the press
23   area?
24        A.    Basically, at Hale Moore, they had
0190
 1   Heidelbergs.
 2        Q.    And these are presses?
 3        A.    And they had Mealy.
 4        Q.    Do you want to spell that?
 5        A.    And then they had Harris.
 6        Q.    Harris.  Okay.  And when you say they had
 7   Heidelbergs -- is it Mealy with an "M"?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    -- and Harris, these are manufacturers of
10   pieces of equipment?
11        A.    Those are manufacturers.
12        Q.    Okay.  And Heidelbergs, what type of
13   equipment is that?
14        A.    It was a printing press.
15        Q.    Okay.
16        A.    That was a single-color.
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    And they also had what they call a die
19   cutter, which was a Heidelberg.
20        Q.    Okay.  Mealy, what kind of piece of
21   equipment was that?
22        A.    That was a printing press also.
23        Q.    And is Harris also a type of printing
24   press?
0191
 1        A.    Yes.
 2        Q.    Okay.  So in the pressroom, how many total
 3   presses were there?
 4        A.    Basically, there were four.
 5        Q.    Okay.  The two Heidelbergs, you mentioned
 6   one was a single-color, and the other one was the dye
 7   color?
 8        A.    Yeah.
 9        Q.    The one Mealy and the Harris?
10        A.    Yeah.
11        Q.    Okay.  And when you started there in 1973,
12   were those pieces of equipment already in place?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    Okay.  Do you know when any one of those
15   presses were originally installed at Moore & Harris?
16   I'm sorry.  Moore & Hale.
17        A.    No.
18        Q.    Okay.  And before you started working
19   there in 1973, is it fair to say that if you don't
20   know when they were originally installed, you
21   wouldn't know any sort of prior maintenance or repair
22   history on any one of those pieces of equipment,
23   right?  Try that one again?
24        A.    Yeah.  Repeat that again.
0192
 1        Q.    Sure.  Before you started in 1973 --
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    -- is it fair to say you would not know
 4   anything about any sort of prior maintenance or
 5   repair histories on any one of those presses?
 6        A.    Correct.
 7        Q.    Okay.  Were you involved at all in the
 8   operation of any of these presses?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    All right.  And I don't know if -- again,
11   not having much, you know, involvement in the
12   printing industry, do these presses in general,
13   whether they be whatever brand name, do they operate
14   essentially the same?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  And what would your involvement be
17   if called into the pressroom to help out?
18        A.    Most of the time the job would already be
19   set up.
20        Q.    Okay.
21        A.    I would be more or less watching the piece
22   of equipment operate.
23        Q.    Okay.  So your involvement would be more
24   of a visual to make sure that everything is, again,
0193
 1   flowing smoothly?
 2        A.    Yes.
 3        Q.    Did it involve any sort of hands-on work?
 4        A.    Yes.
 5        Q.    And what sort of hands-on work would you
 6   have to do to make sure the equipment was operating
 7   properly?
 8        A.    Well, obviously, you would have to load in
 9   sheets of paper to be printed.
10        Q.    Uh-huh.
11        A.    Because you could only fit in X amount of
12   sheets.  When those sheets were printed, then you had
13   to load in more blank paper.
14        Q.    Right.
15        A.    And start the process again.
16        Q.    Okay.  And the occasions that you might
17   have to do it again would be if whoever was --
18   whoever else was working in the pressroom might have
19   had something else to do, and you're trying to get
20   the job finished?
21        A.    Right.
22        Q.    Okay.  Other than loading the sheets and
23   watching the equipment, what other sort of hands-on
24   work did you have to do on these presses in this
0194
 1   area?
 2        A.    Basically, because being a small company,
 3   we took care of as much of the maintenance as we
 4   could.
 5        Q.    Okay.
 6        A.    I got involved on that a fair amount.
 7        Q.    Did Moore & Hale have a maintenance
 8   department?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    Okay.  So there would be occasions where
11   you might need to perform some sort of maintenance in
12   the pressroom?
13        A.    Correct.
14        Q.    Do you have a specific memory of
15   performing maintenance on any one of these presses in
16   the pressroom?
17        A.    Yes.  They had a braking system and a
18   clutching system, and these had to be cleaned and
19   adjusted occasionally.  I'm going to say at least
20   once a year.
21        Q.    Okay.
22        A.    Some of them were a little more, and,
23   again, you take it apart, and then you use compressed
24   air to blow them out, clean the -- whether it was the
0195
 1   brakes or the clutch, lubricate it, and readjust it,
 2   and put it back together.
 3        Q.    Okay.  And when you were to do this yearly
 4   routine maintenance, how long would that take?
 5        A.    With good luck, about an hour.
 6        Q.    Okay.  Because you want to try to get that
 7   machine back up and running?
 8        A.    Yes.
 9        Q.    Because a machine down, that's lost money?
10   That's lost time?
11        A.    Right.
12        Q.    Okay.  So once a year for about an hour
13   you might help out somebody clean the braking system
14   or the clutching systems of the presses, right?
15              MR. BECERRA:  Objection.  Form.
16        A.    Right.
17        Q.    When you talk about having to readjust,
18   what type of work had to be done to readjust a
19   system?
20        A.    Basically, it's like anything.  Whether
21   it's brake shoes in a car or -- they wear down.  If
22   they wear down, you've got more space.  You've got to
23   take up that space and readjust the gap to -- if that
24   space gets too big, it won't operate properly.
0196
 1        Q.    And how did you learn how to -- maybe
 2   we'll talk about the braking system.  How did you
 3   learn how to perform this yearly maintenance work?
 4        A.    Manual.
 5        Q.    Okay.  And as between the four presses in
 6   the pressroom, did you have to perform this yearly
 7   maintenance on all of them?
 8        A.    The die cutter took very little because
 9   that was an older machine, and there was a lot of
10   mechanics involved.  Obviously, they did have a brake
11   system, but it didn't take as much maintenance.  It
12   ran much slower and didn't wear out the pads, so it
13   took a lot less.
14        Q.    As part of the work on your maintenance,
15   would you ever remove and replace the pads, or were
16   they -- or was there just an adjustment?
17        A.    Just adjustments.
18        Q.    Okay.  The hour that you talked about that
19   it would roughly take to do the maintenance, is that
20   for the braking system and the clutching system?
21        A.    You'd do one or the other, and that's to
22   do one.
23        Q.    And would you do, like, the braking system
24   one year and the clutching system the next year, or
0197
 1   would you do them both within one year?
 2        A.    No.  You'd do them separate times.
 3        Q.    Okay.  Again, because you don't want the
 4   system down that long?
 5        A.    Well, basically, they didn't both need
 6   work or repair at the same time.
 7        Q.    Do you differentiate maintenance versus
 8   repair?  Like, In other words, I know the
 9   maintenance, you need, for example, you talk about
10   having to once a year clean out the systems of the
11   presses.  I consider that to be maintenance because
12   it's something you're going to do at a scheduled
13   time, for example.  "Repair" means if something
14   breaks.  Did you ever perform any sort of repairs on
15   any of these presses?
16        A.    Most of them were repairs, meaning the
17   system was giving you trouble --
18        Q.    Yeah.
19        A.    -- and you knew you were going to have to
20   do it.
21        Q.    Okay.  So when you did a repair, is that
22   different at all from a maintenance?  I mean, in
23   other words --
24        A.    No, not really.
0198
 1        Q.    So if the machine is giving you trouble,
 2   it's generally kind of take it apart, clean it up,
 3   lubricate it, whatever adjustments you might need,
 4   and put it back together?
 5        A.    Yes.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And those were done, again,
 7   maintenance-wise once a year, and then on an
 8   as-needed basis, right?
 9        A.    I'm saying the year as a rough estimate.
10        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.
11        A.    It was not you did it every December
12   1st --
13        Q.    Right.
14        A.    -- type of situation.
15        Q.    Okay.  And it would only happen if the
16   machine was acting up?
17        A.    Right.
18        Q.    Gotcha.  And the only time you would be
19   doing it is if someone else in the pressroom couldn't
20   get to it?
21        A.    Correct.
22        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall the names of any of
23   the other folks that worked in the pressroom?
24        A.    Obviously, there was Bob Godfrey.  Richard
0199
 1   Cushing.
 2        Q.    Are either one of those gentlemen alive?
 3        A.    I think both of them are.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Do you know where they live?
 5        A.    Lunenburg, Rick Cushing.  Bob Godfrey,
 6   he's moved on to other companies.  So he used to live
 7   in Shirley, but I know he doesn't anymore.
 8        Q.    Do you ever keep in touch with either one
 9   of these guys?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    Other than the work that you just
12   described on the machinery in the pressroom, do you
13   have a memory of personally performing any other type
14   of maintenance or repairs on those pieces of
15   machinery during your time there from '73 to what,
16   '85?
17        A.    Not those.  I did some work in the
18   bindery.
19        Q.    Okay.  Well, I'm kind of going down the
20   system, right.
21        A.    Yeah.
22        Q.    So kind of the way we're making a
23   brochure, we're going to prep it?
24        A.    Yeah.
0200
 1        Q.    We're going to press it?
 2        A.    Yeah.
 3        Q.    And then, actually, my wife, when she was
 4   in high school, worked in a bindery.  Because I know
 5   that's kind of like the end process of putting it all
 6   together.  What types of machinery was in the
 7   bindery?
 8        A.    They had a Rosback.  They had a
 9   Stahlfolder.  They had a Baumfolder.  They had a
10   Challenge drill, three-hole.  And they had
11   shrink-wrap equipment.  Pretty -- oh, a paper cutter.
12        Q.    Right.  It's kind of hard to bind it
13   without it.  And there were certain employees, kind
14   of like with the prep area and with the press area,
15   that were assigned specifically to the bindery?
16        A.    Correct.
17        Q.    And, again, you'd be called in if there
18   was something going on in the bindery that needed
19   your assistance?
20        A.    Yeah.
21        Q.    Did you operate any of these particular
22   pieces of machinery?
23        A.    Yes.
24        Q.    Okay.  And was there any one of them that
0201
 1   you operated more than the other, or at some juncture
 2   you might operate all of them?
 3        A.    Wherever it was needed.
 4        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  Did you ever have to
 5   conduct any sort of -- we talked about this
 6   maintenance and repair work that might be done in the
 7   pressroom.  Did you ever perform any of that type of
 8   work in the bindery?
 9        A.    Yes.  Yes.
10        Q.    And what type of work, and on what pieces
11   of equipment?
12        A.    Basically, the folders had filters, which
13   the filters had to be cleaned because it would pick
14   up dust from the paper that it would run through.
15        Q.    Uh-huh.
16        A.    So -- and then the same with the Rosback,
17   it had filters that you had to clean.  Rosback had a
18   three-knife trimmer that you had to change the blades
19   every once in a while and readjust them.  And then
20   also the larger paper cutter, you had to change that
21   blade almost on a monthly basis depending on how much
22   use it got.
23        Q.    Right.  Do you know who manufactured the
24   paper cutter?
0202
 1        A.    Heidelberg.  I can't think of the -- the
 2   brand name.  I can't think of it, but it was -- that
 3   was made by Heidelberg.  I know that.
 4        Q.    And this particular paper cutter, your
 5   involvement in terms of maintenance and repair would
 6   essentially have been to change out the blades as
 7   needed, right?
 8        A.    Right.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And you talked about Rosback?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    All right.  Again, my wife might know
12   this.  I don't know exactly.  What is a Rosback?
13        A.    Basically, that would take the signatures.
14   It would gather the signatures.  It would stitch the
15   book, and then it would go through a three-knife
16   trimmer.  So at the end of the Rosback, you would
17   come out with a finished product.
18        Q.    Okay.  Do you know who manufactured the
19   Rosback?
20        A.    That was -- that was -- I know that was
21   United States, but I don't know who manufactured it.
22        Q.    When you say you know it was the United
23   States, was that just the name you remember seeing
24   or --
0203
 1        A.    No.  It was American-made.
 2        Q.    Oh, I see.  Okay.  Okay.  I got you.
 3   Yeah.  But in terms of actually who in the U.S. made
 4   it --
 5        A.    Right.  Like, Heidelberg, you know, that's
 6   Germany.  I know the Rosback was United States.
 7        Q.    Okay.  But the only work that you would
 8   have done in terms of on that machinery is to clean
 9   out those -- the filters?
10        A.    The filters, and you would have to change
11   those blades as well.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    Those were small blades.
14        Q.    Do you know who made the blades that you
15   had to swap out?
16        A.    No.
17        Q.    You talked about Baumfolders and
18   Stahlfolders, and the work that you did involving
19   those in terms of the maintenance would have been,
20   again, cleaning out the filters, right?
21        A.    Correct.  Yeah.
22        Q.    I guess what kind of filters were they?
23   How big were they?  What did they look like?
24        A.    They were basically a canister filter.
0204
 1        Q.    Yeah.
 2        A.    I don't know if you'd know what the size
 3   of a spray paint can.
 4        Q.    Sure.
 5        A.    Like, a quart.
 6        Q.    Yeah.
 7        A.    It had a filter in it, and that was also
 8   attached to the vacuum hose.  You know, as the vacuum
 9   sucked the air through, it went through the filter
10   and cleaned the air and blew it up.
11        Q.    Gotcha.  And so part of the maintenance
12   would be to remove those filters and replace them
13   with new ones?
14        A.    Basically, just take the air because we
15   have the hose with compressed air, and we'd blow
16   those filters out.
17        Q.    Gotcha.
18        A.    So they got used many, many times.
19        Q.    Okay.  What -- I know you mentioned the
20   company made a lot of colored brochures, but do you
21   have a memory of the types of paper that these
22   brochures were printed on and where they got their
23   paper from?
24        A.    The Mead Paper Company.
0205
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    It's been so long, but they -- Mead was
 3   one of the big ones, and there's been so many paper
 4   companies that have gone out, I really don't.  But
 5   Mead, you know, rings a bell, and we used a lot of
 6   that product.
 7        Q.    The Stahlfolder and Baumfolder, do you
 8   know who manufactured the Stahlfolder?
 9        A.    No.  The Stahl -- actually, I think
10   Heidelberg did, but I'm not a hundred percent sure on
11   that.
12        Q.    Right.  Okay.  And what about the
13   Baumfolder?
14        A.    I don't know.
15        Q.    Okay.  And, again, with either one of
16   these folders, though, your only real involvement in
17   terms of any sort of maintenance would be to use the
18   air to clean out those filters?
19        A.    Clean out the filters with a -- obviously,
20   you had some grease fittings and some oil fittings or
21   routine maintenance.
22        Q.    Okay.  Were there ever times that you
23   would perform, or did you perform any sort of more
24   sophisticated repairs on any of these pieces of
0206
 1   machinery in the bindery?
 2        A.    Yes.  On the Stahlfolder, it was replacing
 3   the rollers because you had a series of rollers that
 4   made the fold in the paper, and depending -- you had
 5   up to four racks, meaning you could make four folds,
 6   and you had three different sections of rollers like
 7   that.  Each one would have -- on that particular
 8   floor, four racks on each system.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    And, yes, I -- in other words, that's
11   rebuild.  You buy new rollers.  It comes with new
12   bushings, bearings, and the whole shebang to put in a
13   whole set of new rollers.
14        Q.    What are the rollers made of?  What type
15   of material?
16        A.    Steel and a fiber.
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    I don't know what the fiber was.
19        Q.    And the fiber, where was this located?
20        A.    In between.  They were, like, sleeves to
21   hold the paper and keep it from sliding one way or
22   the other.
23        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.
24        A.    So it took the sheet of paper and held it
0207
 1   square so your fold didn't come out over the place.
 2        Q.    So you had steel rollers with, like, this
 3   type of fiber just on the outside, thin, to just kind
 4   of make -- hold the sheet of paper in place?
 5        A.    Yeah.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And when you were replacing the old
 7   rollers, does it come out as one complete unit, the
 8   roller itself?
 9        A.    No.
10        Q.    How does it come out?
11        A.    They came out single rollers.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    There was bushings that held the rollers
14   in, and they would slide out either one side or the
15   other depending on the folder.
16        Q.    All right.  So you'd remove the old
17   roller, throw them away?
18        A.    Yup.
19        Q.    And then you'd take the new rollers and
20   just basically slide it right back on?
21        A.    After you put in your new bushings and
22   whether it was bushings, bearings, and some of them
23   were actually wood.
24        Q.    Oh, really?
0208
 1        A.    Yeah.
 2        Q.    Okay.  But was this more kind of a
 3   maintenance thing, again, when they would kind of
 4   wear out?
 5        A.    Yeah, they wear out.
 6        Q.    Yeah.
 7        A.    But it was -- they last years.
 8        Q.    Sure.
 9        A.    So in other words, you were not doing this
10   -- I only did it several times.
11        Q.    Okay.  Do you have any memory of being
12   around anyone else doing any other type of
13   maintenance or repairs other than what we've talked
14   about in the bindery?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    Okay.  The building itself, do you recall
17   how that was heated?
18        A.    Forced hot air.
19        Q.    Okay.  Was there any sort of insulated
20   piping at all anywhere within the facility?
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    Were you ever responsible at all for any
23   sort of work on any sort of heating system at Moore &
24   Hale?
0209
 1        A.    No.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And as I understand, it looks like
 3   from your records here you worked there through '85.
 4   Does that sound about right?
 5        A.    That's correct.
 6        Q.    Okay.  And why did you leave Hale -- Moore
 7   & Hale in 1985?
 8        A.    Because I seen the writing on the wall.
 9        Q.    Writing on the wall.
10        A.    That was number one.
11        Q.    Yeah.
12        A.    And the other reason is at that point in
13   time, I was 40-something years old, and I realized
14   that if I was ever going to do it, and the kids were
15   just getting out of college, so it was either do it
16   and go on my own, which I did.
17        Q.    Okay.  Now, if you flip to the next page
18   on your -- on Exhibit Number 1, you see up top there
19   it says something blank Tech Graphics.  It looks you
20   just did some -- maybe some part-time work in '80 and
21   '81.  I can't make out what that -- it's something
22   blank Tech Graphics.  Does that ring a bell there on
23   Crawford Street in Fitchburg?
24        A.    Yeah, Crawford Street.  Yes.  I went to
0210
 1   work there.  I was going to leave Hale & Moore
 2   Printing, and I could see that wasn't going to work
 3   out.  So I went back to Hale & Moore Printing.
 4        Q.    Okay.  Yeah.  Because if you flip back to
 5   the Hale & Moore, in 1980, it looks like you only
 6   made about $7,000, and then in 1980 here at -- and
 7   what was the name of the company, because it looks
 8   like something was cut off?
 9        A.    Yeah.  Well, there is.
10        Q.    Yeah.
11        A.    I -- no, I know -- I don't know.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    Yeah.  I don't remember.
14        Q.    Okay.  And what kind of work in 1980 did
15   you go do for this graphic company in Fitchburg?
16        A.    It was a funny situation.  They thought
17   they were going to buy out Hale & Moore Printing
18   Company.
19        Q.    Okay.
20        A.    Or at that time it was The Hale Company.
21        Q.    Uh-huh.
22        A.    That sort of fell through, and I was sort
23   of in the middle of this whole mess.  So it was just
24   a very short period of time.
0211
 1        Q.    And what was -- were you still production
 2   manager for this graphics company?
 3        A.    Yeah.  As I say, I wasn't there long
 4   enough.
 5        Q.    Did you operate any types of machinery at
 6   this graphics place?
 7        A.    Not as much as I did at Hale & Moore
 8   Printing Company.
 9        Q.    What about maintenance or repair of any
10   pieces of equipment?
11        A.    I didn't get into it.  I wasn't there long
12   enough.
13        Q.    And so it looks like at some point, then,
14   you go back to Hale because, what?  The deal fell
15   through or something like that, right?
16        A.    Yeah.  Basically, I've seen that situation
17   was not getting better.
18        Q.    Yeah.
19        A.    And I had not made a good selection.
20        Q.    Gotcha.  But they took you back?
21        A.    Yup.
22        Q.    There you go.  And then just below that,
23   for graphics, it says -- there's two periods of
24   self-employment in 1983 for $600.  What were you
0212
 1   doing in 1983 for self-employment?
 2        A.    Basically, I was getting ready to start my
 3   own business.
 4        Q.    Okay.
 5        A.    I was not -- I was living on savings.
 6        Q.    Gotcha.  And then is '84 the same thing?
 7        A.    Yeah.  Yeah.
 8        Q.    All right.  So you go back to Hale Company
 9   through '85.  There appears to be, then, your next
10   employer is WTC Printing, Inc. (sic)?
11        A.    Yeah.
12        Q.    Is that your place?
13        A.    Yes.
14        Q.    Okay.  So the first year reported there is
15   1988.  So I guess my question is between '85 and '88,
16   what were you doing?
17        A.    Living off my savings.
18        Q.    Gotcha.  Okay.  All right.  So there was
19   no employment --
20        A.    So there was no Social Security or
21   anything like that.
22        Q.    Gotcha.  And then 1988 is when you open up
23   your own business, correct?
24        A.    '85, actually, but '88, I started taking a
0213
 1   paycheck.
 2        Q.    Okay.  And the name of the company was --
 3        A.    MTC Printing.
 4        Q.    -- MTC?  And what does that -- what does
 5   "MTC" stand for?
 6        A.    The three original people.
 7        Q.    So Morton?
 8        A.    Morton, Toma, and Cushing.
 9        Q.    Oh, so is that the same Cushing from --
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    -- from beforehand at --
12        A.    Yeah.
13        Q.    -- at Hale?  And what was the second name?
14        A.    Toma.
15        Q.    T-O-M-A?
16        A.    Yeah.
17        Q.    And Cushing.  Are either -- I know
18   Mr. Cushing is still alive and in Lunenburg?
19        A.    He's still alive.  Robin, I really have no
20   idea where she is.
21        Q.    Okay.  And so her first name is Robin?
22        A.    Yeah.
23        Q.    Okay.  And were you guys -- was the
24   facility located on 41 Tyler Road?
0214
 1        A.    No.  That's where we ended up just before
 2   we closed.  That's how Tyler Road came in.  My
 3   daughter used to take care of the books, so --
 4   anyway, we were located in 43 Nashua Street in
 5   Leominster.
 6        Q.    And when the business -- did the business
 7   close in 2008?
 8        A.    Basically, 2014.
 9        Q.    Okay.  I look at this particular statement
10   that we got --
11        A.    Oh, yeah, because Social Security -- I
12   started taking that one out at 65.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    So that's why it would show 2008.
15        Q.    But the business was still operating until
16   2014?
17        A.    It was still operating.
18        Q.    Okay.  Gotcha.  And I see here that MTC
19   was incorporated here in Massachusetts?
20        A.    Correct.
21        Q.    Aside from yourself, Miss Toma, and
22   Mr. Cushing, were there any other officers of the
23   company?
24        A.    They really weren't officers.
0215
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    They were people that the three of us got
 3   together.  You know, I needed a pressman, and I
 4   needed a prep person.  That was Robin and Ricky.  So
 5   just in name-wise were they involved.
 6        Q.    Gotcha.
 7        A.    If that makes sense?
 8        Q.    Yeah.  Yeah.  Was there anyone else
 9   besides yourself who was an officer in the company?
10        A.    My wife and my daughter.
11        Q.    Okay.  What was your wife's role in the
12   company?
13        A.    Really, other than name?
14        Q.    Name.  Yeah.
15        A.    My daughter took care of the books.
16        Q.    Right.  Okay.
17        A.    And all that kind of stuff.
18        Q.    Were there any other employees besides
19   yourself, Miss Toma, and Mr. Cushing for MTC?
20        A.    Oh, yes.
21        Q.    Okay.
22        A.    Yeah.
23        Q.    When you first started on 43 Nashua
24   Street, how many employees did you start with?
0216
 1        A.    That was as many as eight employees.  Some
 2   of those were part-time.  I'm going to say probably
 3   five were full-time.
 4        Q.    Okay.  And what type of business -- I know
 5   the name suggests, but what type of business was MTC
 6   Printing?
 7        A.    Basically, commercial printing.  We did
 8   basically the same type of work that Hale Moore
 9   Printing did.  We did, like, ski brochures.  We did
10   all the mountain work.  Simonds Saw & Steel.
11        Q.    When you say "mountain work," what do you
12   mean by that?  For the ski areas?
13        A.    Ski areas.  Mount Wachusett.
14        Q.    Yeah.  So you were kind of making more of,
15   again, those colored brochures that you talked about?
16        A.    Yes.
17        Q.    Okay.
18        A.    Yes.
19        Q.    And 43 Nashua Street, what type of
20   location was that?  What type of building was that?
21        A.    That was an 8,000-square-foot building.
22        Q.    Was it a single-story?
23        A.    Two-story.
24        Q.    Two-story.  Okay.
0217
 1        A.    Sort of like -- when I say "two stories,"
 2   the basement was a floor.
 3        Q.    Yeah.
 4        A.    And then the main -- the main story
 5   building.
 6        Q.    What was housed in the basement of MTC
 7   Printing?
 8        A.    Basically, it was the pressroom.
 9        Q.    Uh-huh.
10        A.    The bindery.  That was the lower level.
11        Q.    Okay.  And then on the main floor?
12        A.    And shipping and receiving was on that
13   level.
14        Q.    Yeah.  And so on the main floor was
15   shipping and receiving?
16        A.    No.
17        Q.    No.  That was on the first floor.  So what
18   was on the main floor, then?
19        A.    The main floor was the office, prep area.
20        Q.    Okay.  When you -- and did you own the
21   property at 43 Nashua Street?
22        A.    Yes.
23        Q.    And when you purchased it, did you buy it
24   from a prior printing company?
0218
 1        A.    No.  It was a prior refrigeration company.
 2        Q.    All right.
 3        A.    They made chillers.
 4        Q.    Okay.
 5        A.    Cooling towers.
 6        Q.    And they've gone out of business, or they
 7   have moved on?
 8        A.    No.  They're still in business.
 9        Q.    Okay.
10        A.    They're located on Nashua Street, and
11   they're -- they have a building just before my
12   building.
13        Q.    And do you still own the Nashua Street
14   address?
15        A.    No.
16        Q.    When you purchased the 43 Nashua Street
17   address, did you have to, obviously, equip it in
18   order to run your business?
19        A.    Well, I had the equipment.
20        Q.    Okay.  Where did you acquire the equipment
21   from?
22        A.    Basically, it was on Culley Street in
23   Fitchburg.  We moved from there.  That's where the
24   business started.
0219
 1        Q.    Okay.  So --
 2        A.    So we were operating when I bought this
 3   new building.
 4        Q.    Okay.  So when MTC first started in '85,
 5   did you start physically at Culley Street?
 6        A.    Culley Street in Fitchburg.
 7        Q.    How long were you at Culley Street before
 8   you moved to the Nashua Street address?
 9        A.    Not long.  Two, three years.
10        Q.    When -- and did you originally purchase
11   the Culley Street address, or were you renting --
12        A.    No.  We rented that.
13        Q.    And from whom did you rent that address
14   from?
15        A.    I do not remember the name.
16        Q.    Okay.  Was it a printing facility?
17        A.    No.  It was an auto body.
18        Q.    So at the Culley Street address, is that
19   where you then initially installed the equipment?
20        A.    That's where my start -- the start.
21        Q.    Right.
22        A.    Okay.  I added since then.
23        Q.    All right.  So let's start with the Culley
24   Street.  What type of equipment did you own at Culley
0220
 1   Street?
 2        A.    At Culley Street?
 3        Q.    Yeah.
 4        A.    It was a Mealy press and a Heidelberg.
 5   The Heidelberg was 23-by-35 sheet-fed press.
 6        Q.    So you owned two presses?
 7        A.    Two presses there.
 8        Q.    All right.  Any other pieces of equipment
 9   at the Culley Street facility that you owned?
10        A.    I had a folder.
11        Q.    Okay.
12        A.    I had a camera, and I had prep equipment.
13   Meaning, a light table.
14        Q.    Okay.  And is the folder, would that be
15   kind of like the bindery aspect of the end of the
16   business?
17        A.    Yeah.  There was -- yeah.
18        Q.    Do you know who manufactured the folder
19   that you had at the Culley Street?
20        A.    That was a Stahlfolder.
21        Q.    S-T-A-L-L?
22        A.    No.  Excuse me.  That was a Baumfolder.
23        Q.    Okay.  And is "Baum" a brand name, or is
24   that the type of folder?
0221
 1        A.    That's a brand name.
 2        Q.    Brand name.  Okay.  So you owned a
 3   Baumfolder, a Heidelberg press, and a Mealy press?
 4        A.    Yeah.
 5        Q.    And were those three pieces of equipment,
 6   were they purchased somewhere?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Do you know where you purchased the
 9   presses, for example?
10        A.    Yeah, I do, but you're looking for names?
11   I can't give them to you.
12        Q.    Okay.  Was it a local place somewhere in
13   the Fitchburg/Leominster area or --
14        A.    No.  One came from Greenfield.
15        Q.    Okay.
16        A.    Out in the western part of Massachusetts.
17        Q.    Uh-huh.
18        A.    The other one was Boston.  And the folder
19   was from Boston.
20        Q.    Were any of these pieces of equipment new?
21        A.    No.
22        Q.    The Mealy press, do you know its model
23   number?
24        A.    No.
0222
 1        Q.    Do you know what year it was originally --
 2        A.    It was, like, a 19-by-25 sheet-fed press.
 3        Q.    Do you know what year it was built?
 4        A.    No.
 5        Q.    What about the Heidelberg press?  Do you
 6   know what year that was built?
 7        A.    No.
 8        Q.    Do you know, did it have any sort of model
 9   number or anything along those lines?
10        A.    No.  The only -- as I say 23-by-35
11   sheet-fed.
12        Q.    And the -- this Baumfolder, do you know
13   when it was originally manufactured?
14        A.    All I know is -- no, I do not know when.
15        Q.    And, again, is it fair to say that prior
16   to -- and you would have purchased these in
17   approximately, what, like, 1985 when you started your
18   business?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  Prior to 1985, would you know any
21   maintenance or repair histories of any of the pieces
22   of equipment that you purchased for original
23   installation in the Culley Street address?
24        A.    No.
0223
 1        Q.    So you were at Culley Street for a couple
 2   of years.  You then moved to Nashua Street, correct?
 3        A.    Correct.
 4        Q.    And what's the reason for moving from
 5   Culley to Nashua Street?
 6        A.    Space.
 7        Q.    Okay.  A bigger address?  Bigger -- more
 8   room at Nashua?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    When you moved to Nashua, I'm assuming you
11   then took the equipment that you had at Culley
12   Street?
13        A.    Correct.  Yes.
14        Q.    And zipped on over to Nashua Street?
15        A.    Yup.
16        Q.    When you get there, do you add any new
17   pieces of equipment?  And by "new," I mean ones that
18   you didn't bring with you, to the Nashua Street
19   address?
20        A.    Yes.
21        Q.    Okay.  What types of equipment did you add
22   once you moved to Nashua Street?
23        A.    Two four-color presses.  Not both at the
24   same time.
0224
 1        Q.    Uh-huh.
 2        A.    One was a KOMORI, and one was a
 3   Mitsubishi.  They were both -- one was a six-color,
 4   and one was a four-color.
 5        Q.    Okay.  Anything else that you bought?  You
 6   bought the two color presses at different times?
 7        A.    Yeah.
 8        Q.    When -- do you recall which one you bought
 9   first, whether it's the KOMORI or the Mitsubishi?
10        A.    The KOMORI I bought first.
11        Q.    Okay.  And then how long after you
12   purchased the KOMORI did you purchase the second one?
13        A.    A year or two.
14        Q.    Okay.  And did the second one replace the
15   KOMORI, or was it in addition to?
16        A.    Existing.  I mean, add.
17        Q.    Okay.  So now you had the two working
18   simultaneously?
19        A.    Right.
20        Q.    Anything else that you've purchased since
21   you moved over to Nashua Street?
22        A.    Yeah.  On this one -- yeah.  I made a
23   large computer-to-plate where it did away with the
24   camera, the stripping end of it.  There was no more
0225
 1   negatives involved.  No more platemaking involved.
 2   It went directly from computer to plate.
 3        Q.    Okay.  So you've kind of eliminated the
 4   prep work, so to say?
 5        A.    It eliminated the prep work, yes.  That
 6   was the beginning of major changes in the printing
 7   industry.
 8        Q.    Sure.  And approximately when was that
 9   purchase made?
10        A.    Times go back.  I couldn't believe how
11   long I did have it.
12        Q.    Yeah.
13        A.    Ten years at least, if not more.
14        Q.    So sometime prior to 2007?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  Do you recall who manufactured that
17   computer-to-plate?
18        A.    No.  I can't even think of the trade --
19   the name on the thing.  I'm sorry.
20        Q.    That's okay.  So anything else that you
21   have purchased in terms of equipment -- major pieces
22   of equipment, aside from the presses that we had --
23   that you brought with you, the two color presses that
24   you bought once you opened up in Nashua, and then the
0226
 1   computer-to-plate piece of equipment, has there been
 2   anything else that MTC has purchased as part of major
 3   equipment for its printing industry?
 4        A.    There was one more piece of equipment,
 5   which was a colored proofer.
 6        Q.    What does a colored proofer do?
 7        A.    It was made by Epson.
 8        Q.    Uh-huh.
 9        A.    And it took a roll of material, and it
10   would give you a colored proof of everything that was
11   going to wind up being on the plate.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    So it was a proofing system.
14        Q.    Do you recall when you purchased that?
15        A.    That was just about in the same time.
16        Q.    About '07?
17        A.    2006, '07.
18        Q.    Okay.  Any other pieces -- major pieces of
19   equipment or investment, that you can recall?
20        A.    No.
21              MR. HOOVER:  We've been going about an
22   hour and a half, an hour and change.  Are you up for
23   a quick break or --
24              THE WITNESS:  Yes.
0227
 1              MR. HOOVER:  Yeah, I don't blame you.  Me,
 2   too.
 3              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
 4   approximately 3:04, and this is the end of media
 5   number 3.
 6              (A break was taken from 3:04 to 3:19 p.m.)
 7              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on the
 8   record.  The time is approximately 3:19, and this is
 9   the beginning of media number 4.  Counsel, you may
10   proceed.
11              MR. HOOVER:  Thank you.
12   BY MR. HOOVER:
13        Q.    Mr. Morton, are you all set to continue
14   for just a little bit more today?
15        A.    Yes.
16        Q.    Okay.  We're just going to kind of wrap up
17   for the day.  We're going to talk a -- finish up with
18   the MTC Printing, and then we're going to call it a
19   day and come back and finish with Groton
20   Refrigeration on Thursday.
21        A.    That sounds good to me.
22        Q.    Sounds good?  Especially since it's a nice
23   afternoon out there.  We might as well go out and
24   enjoy it, right?
0228
 1        A.    Get a few minutes out there.
 2        Q.    We're sitting here with no windows.  I
 3   want to go back and ask you just about a couple of
 4   pieces of equipment that you first got for the Culley
 5   Street address of MTC.  One was -- was the Mealy
 6   press?
 7        A.    Right.
 8        Q.    And, again, that was a used piece of
 9   equipment that you purchased for your new company.
10   Did you yourself ever have to operate that piece of
11   machinery?
12        A.    Yes, I did.
13        Q.    Okay.  And what sort of operation would
14   you be responsible for with that particular press?
15   Like, in other words, how would you personally
16   operate that?
17        A.    From start to finish.  In other words, my
18   -- I only had one pressman.
19        Q.    Right.
20        A.    So he was out.
21        Q.    Yup.
22        A.    I had no choice.
23        Q.    Okay.
24        A.    And I would have to do it from ground
0229
 1   zero, set the press up.
 2        Q.    Uh-huh.
 3        A.    Adjust the ink fountains properly and do
 4   the actual printing of the piece.
 5        Q.    And, again, for someone who is not
 6   familiar with the process, just in general and
 7   briefly can you kind of describe what a pressman
 8   does?
 9        A.    Well, basically, you -- first of all,
10   you've got to put the paper in the press.
11        Q.    Yeah.
12        A.    Then a press has what they call a blanket,
13   and after every job you've got to clean that blanket
14   because it's got residue on it from the job before.
15   Then you would have to adjust the ink fountains to
16   get the proper amount of ink in different areas.
17   Where you've got real solids, you've got to open the
18   fountain more.  Where you don't have too much
19   coverage, you've got to cut the fountains down so
20   there's very little ink going in that area.
21        Q.    Right.
22        A.    So that's a timely thing that you've got
23   to get just right to wind up with the proper colors
24   that you want.
0230
 1        Q.    Okay.
 2        A.    Then it's a matter of making sure that
 3   you've got your plate on straight.  You've got to do
 4   -- depending on how difficult it is to how many tests
 5   you pulled because each test you run about 15, 20
 6   sheets.
 7        Q.    Uh-huh.
 8        A.    You check your -- make sure your -- you've
 9   got the image on the sheet straight and there's no
10   other mistakes that you can find.
11        Q.    Right.
12        A.    And when you get that all said and done,
13   you run the job.
14        Q.    Okay.  And so, obviously, each job is
15   going to be slightly different in terms of the amount
16   of ink that is needed?
17        A.    Every one is a different setting.
18        Q.    Okay.  And then, like you said, you kind
19   of make -- you do little test runs and adjustments
20   are made here and there?
21        A.    Right.
22        Q.    And then once you've got it set exactly
23   how you want it --
24        A.    Then --
0231
 1        Q.    -- then you run the job?
 2        A.    Then you run the job.
 3        Q.    Okay.  You mentioned there's this blanket
 4   inside the press itself?
 5        A.    Basically, you've got to transfer the
 6   image from the plate --
 7        Q.    Uh-huh.
 8        A.    -- which is a positive form.  It goes to
 9   the blanket.  Now it's a negative form.
10        Q.    Okay.
11        A.    Now, it goes to the paper, and you're back
12   to --
13        Q.    Back to positive?
14        A.    -- positive.
15        Q.    What is this blanket made out of?
16        A.    It's made out of a rubber material --
17        Q.    Uh-huh.
18        A.    -- with a -- like, a canvas backing.
19        Q.    And between each job -- so if you do a
20   different job, does that blanket have to come out and
21   be cleaned?
22        A.    No.  You wash it right on the press.
23        Q.    Gotcha.  And do you wash the rubber
24   portion and the canvas portion?
0232
 1        A.    You wash the rubber portion of the
 2   blanket.  That's what accepts the ink, is the rubber
 3   portion of the blanket.
 4        Q.    And this canvas portion, do you know what
 5   that was made of?  The material?
 6        A.    All I know is it's canvas material.
 7        Q.    Okay.
 8        A.    It was just the backing, I guess, to hold
 9   the rubber.
10        Q.    Was this canvas material affixed to the
11   rubber?
12        A.    Yes.
13        Q.    And so did you ever have to change the
14   rubber blankets?
15        A.    No.  You changed -- it was all one piece.
16        Q.    Okay.
17        A.    In other words, when they manufactured it,
18   somehow they bond.
19        Q.    Okay.
20        A.    Which I don't know.
21        Q.    And then during the course of the
22   operation of this press, through wear and tear, would
23   you ever have to put in a new rubber mat?  A new
24   rubber blanket?
0233
 1        A.    A new rubber blanket, yes, you do.
 2        Q.    And how -- what's the average life span,
 3   you know, barring, you know, it ripping or something
 4   like that, of a rubber blanket?
 5        A.    It's hard to say.  As long -- because
 6   every once in a while there would be a foreign object
 7   in the paper in between the paper --
 8        Q.    Yeah.
 9        A.    -- which you would never see.  And once
10   that ran through, it smashed the blanket.  We call it
11   smash the blanket.  It made a low point in the
12   blanket, and that would not accept the ink from the
13   plate.
14        Q.    Right.
15        A.    So naturally it wouldn't transfer to the
16   paper.
17        Q.    Right.  So any subsequent plates would
18   have, like, some sort of hole, or there would be some
19   sort of --
20        A.    Yeah.  And then you'd have to change that
21   blanket.
22        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  In terms of maintenance or
23   repairs on either one of the press that you brought
24   -- well, when they were at Culley Street, did you
0234
 1   ever personally do any sort of maintenance or repairs
 2   on either one of the presses that were there?
 3        A.    Yes.  Yes.
 4        Q.    Okay.  What kind of -- and, again, I'm
 5   kind of differentiating between maintenance, which
 6   is, you know, kind of a yearly thing that you might
 7   need to make adjustments versus something broke.
 8   That would be a repair.
 9        A.    Culley Street, there wasn't that much
10   because we were not there that long.
11        Q.    Okay.
12        A.    You're looking at maybe a two-year span.
13        Q.    Uh-huh.
14        A.    So there was not a lot of maintenance done
15   there.
16        Q.    Okay.
17        A.    Other than your routine greasing and
18   lubricating, that was about it.
19        Q.    And is that something that you yourself
20   performed, this greasing and lubrication of either
21   one of these presses?
22        A.    Usually not.
23        Q.    Okay.
24        A.    That would be done by the pressman.
0235
 1        Q.    Yeah.
 2        A.    And that's something he would do when the
 3   next job wasn't ready.
 4        Q.    Gotcha.  The Baumfolder at -- while still
 5   at Culley Street, do you remember performing any sort
 6   of maintenance or repairs on that particular piece of
 7   equipment?
 8        A.    Not there.
 9        Q.    Okay.  You're there at Culley Street for a
10   couple of years, and then those three pieces of
11   equipment, the two presses and the folder, come with
12   you to the Nashua Street address, correct?
13        A.    Correct.
14        Q.    All right.  And, again, there's just more
15   room at Nashua Street.  So the prep room is a little
16   bit -- there's a little bit more prep room.  There's
17   a little bit more pressroom, and there's a little bit
18   more bindery room, right?
19        A.    Correct.
20        Q.    Okay.  And so the two presses go into,
21   obviously, the pressroom.  The folder goes into the
22   new bindery, and at some point we also add in the two
23   color presses, right?
24        A.    Yup.
0236
 1        Q.    Okay.  But while we're now at Nashua
 2   Street looking just at the two presses, the Mealy and
 3   the Heidelberg press, did you perform -- you yourself
 4   perform any kind of maintenance or repairs on those
 5   presses while they were at Nashua Street address?
 6        A.    At Nashua Street --
 7        Q.    Yeah.
 8        A.    -- yes.
 9        Q.    What kind -- and, again, do you
10   differentiate repairs versus maintenance, or is it
11   all kind of together in your mind?
12        A.    It all sort of comes together.
13        Q.    Okay.
14        A.    As I say, what you call repairs and
15   maintenance, usually you get to the point where you
16   are having trouble, and then you would do -- you can
17   say maintenance or repair.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    But we did not have a set list --
20        Q.    Right.
21        A.    -- of when certain things had to get done.
22        Q.    Okay.  Was there ever an instance, for
23   example, that either one of these presses might be
24   operating just swimmingly, and you go, oh, it's been
0237
 1   a couple years.  Let's make some adjustments.  Or was
 2   this just one of those, we're leaving it be unless
 3   something goes wrong?
 4        A.    Most of it was leave it be, but -- yes,
 5   most of it was leave it be, and as long as it's
 6   working well --
 7        Q.    Don't mess with it?
 8        A.    Right.
 9        Q.    So if you were to conduct some sort of
10   repairs, slash, maintenance on either one of these
11   presses, what would that type of work entail?
12        A.    The biggest part was the adjustment of the
13   brakes and clutches because they got the most use.
14        Q.    And when you say "adjustment," what would
15   you do to adjust the brakes and clutches of the
16   presses?
17        A.    Basically, you would expose the clutch or
18   brake depending on -- when I say "expose," you take
19   the jacket off the steel plate so you can get at the
20   clutch or brake.
21        Q.    Uh-huh.
22        A.    And you would blow them out with a
23   compressed air hose, and you would lubricate them and
24   readjust your either clutch or brake depending on
0238
 1   which it was.
 2        Q.    In terms of their location on these pieces
 3   of equipment, is the brake and clutch in the same
 4   area, or are they on different areas of the machines?
 5        A.    Basically, one is in back of the press,
 6   and one is in front of the press.
 7        Q.    Okay.
 8        A.    These clutches or brakes raises the feed
 9   pile.  If the paper is fed into the press, obviously,
10   that paper has got to come up, but it's got to come
11   up at a slow pace.
12        Q.    Right.
13        A.    That's where the clutch comes in and out
14   all the time.
15        Q.    Okay.
16        A.    So that's why that part of it gets the
17   most wear.
18        Q.    Uh-huh.
19        A.    Because, as I say, the thing is kicking in
20   and out like a rachet type of situation, and there's
21   one on both ends of the press.
22        Q.    And are there clutches on both ends of the
23   press?
24        A.    On both ends of the press.
0239
 1        Q.    And where are the brakes located?
 2        A.    The brake, it goes to the main motor, and
 3   it's connected to the main motor because when you hit
 4   the stop switch, it shuts everything down.
 5        Q.    Okay.  All right.
 6        A.    So that's got to stop the whole press.
 7        Q.    Okay.  And is there just one brake for the
 8   whole press?
 9        A.    Yes.
10        Q.    And that's connected to the stop mechanism
11   so if there's something going on that the operator of
12   the press needs to stop the process, he or she will
13   just hit a button, and the whole thing just ceases?
14        A.    The whole thing shuts down.
15        Q.    Okay.  And so if there was -- if you were
16   having issues with the way that the paper was fed in
17   or removed from the machine, that would be a clutch
18   issue to work on?
19        A.    The clutch, yes.
20        Q.    Okay.  And if you were having trouble with
21   the machine stopping, obviously, then that's the
22   brake?
23        A.    That's the brake, and because that was not
24   used like the two at the end of the press --
0240
 1        Q.    Right.
 2        A.    -- and the feeding of it.
 3        Q.    Yeah.
 4        A.    So you were not constantly dealing with
 5   that as much.
 6        Q.    That was going to be my question.  It
 7   seems to me that if anything, there was more movement
 8   of the machine versus stopping of the machine?
 9        A.    Right.  Right.
10        Q.    Okay.  And in terms of the adjustments
11   that you would have to make, whether it be to the
12   clutch or the brakes of these machines, is -- what
13   I'm hearing is essentially you take the jacket or the
14   plate off to expose the particular component?
15        A.    Yeah.
16        Q.    You blow it out with air.  You might make
17   some lubrication to it?
18        A.    Right.
19        Q.    And some sort of adjustments?
20        A.    Correct.
21        Q.    And those adjustments -- where would those
22   adjustments be made?
23        A.    They would be made on the clutch.
24        Q.    Okay.
0241
 1        A.    Usually to pull the clutch in closer.
 2        Q.    All right.  Was there ever an occasion
 3   when you had to remove or replace either the brakes
 4   or the clutches on either one of these machines?
 5        A.    We did not.
 6        Q.    Okay.  So any work that you or anyone
 7   might have performed on these would have been these
 8   adjustments that you talked about, correct?
 9        A.    Right.
10        Q.    Okay.  And, again, the only time that that
11   work would have been done was if the machine was kind
12   of acting up, right?
13        A.    Right.
14        Q.    All right.  And is it possible to give us
15   an estimate on how often these adjustments had to be
16   made?
17        A.    All -- at least once a year.
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    As I say, we didn't have a particular
20   time, but I think to answer your question, I'm going
21   to say about a year.
22        Q.    All right.  And if the brake was operated
23   less --
24        A.    Right.
0242
 1        Q.    -- would it be less than once a year for
 2   -- to work on the brake?
 3        A.    Oh, yeah.  The brake, two years or better.
 4        Q.    Okay.  So that might go for a while?
 5        A.    Yeah.  That was not a thing that you did
 6   that often.
 7        Q.    Okay.
 8        A.    Put it that way.
 9        Q.    Okay.  Aside from that type of maintenance
10   or repair on the presses, any other types of
11   maintenance or repair that you recall performing on
12   those pieces of equipment while they were at MTC?
13        A.    No.
14        Q.    Okay.  With respect to the folder, did you
15   have to perform any sort of maintenance or repairs on
16   the folder that was in the bindery?
17        A.    At MTC, yes.
18        Q.    At MTC.
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    What types of work was done to the
21   Baumfolder?
22        A.    I put in a new set of rollers.
23        Q.    Okay.  And those were kind of like those
24   steel rollers we talked about?
0243
 1        A.    Yeah.  Steel and rubber.
 2        Q.    Yeah.  Were they -- okay.
 3        A.    A combination.
 4        Q.    Did they have that felt covering?
 5        A.    No, not a felt covering.  It was like a
 6   sleeve.  It was probably an inch and a half.  A
 7   groove was cut in the steel, and the rubber would be
 8   embedded into that groove.
 9        Q.    Okay.  And so the rubber would be what was
10   then basically holding that paper square, straight?
11        A.    Yes.
12        Q.    Okay.
13        A.    The rubber actually stuck up just a little
14   higher than the steel.
15        Q.    Uh-huh.  Okay.  And other than changing
16   out the rollers, then, on the folding machine -- on
17   the folder, any other repairs or maintenance work you
18   recall?
19        A.    Basically, it was just the routine filters
20   that had to be cleaned out --
21        Q.    Right.
22        A.    -- occasionally.
23        Q.    Yeah.
24        A.    And --
0244
 1        Q.    Right.  We talked about that at the other
 2   place.  You kind of air them out?
 3        A.    Yes.  Yup.  Blow them out.
 4        Q.    These -- the two color presses, the KOMORI
 5   and the Mitsubishi --
 6        A.    Yeah.  Those were one.  One was a
 7   six-color.
 8        Q.    Yeah.
 9        A.    And one is a four-color.
10        Q.    Right.  And I apologize if I asked.  When
11   you bought these, you had already moved to Nashua
12   Street; is that correct?
13        A.    I already moved to Nashua Street.  That's
14   correct.
15        Q.    And how long after you moved to Nashua
16   Street would you think that you purchased the first
17   of the two colors?
18        A.    The first was a KOMORI.
19        Q.    Yeah.
20        A.    That was only several years afterwards.
21   That was shortly after we moved.
22        Q.    Okay.  So if you started your business in
23   '85, you moved to Nashua Street in '87, '88 --
24        A.    Yeah.  So you're looking close to 2000.
0245
 1        Q.    Oh, okay.  Okay.  And then the Mitsubishi
 2   was purchased after that?
 3        A.    That was purchased after that.
 4        Q.    Okay.  And then we had the colored proofer
 5   in about '06 and the computer-to-plate in about '07,
 6   right?
 7        A.    Yes.
 8        Q.    Okay.
 9        A.    And the Mitsubishi was right in around
10   that time range.
11        Q.    Okay.  Okay.  You indicated that the
12   business closed in 2014; is that correct?
13        A.    That's -- yup.
14        Q.    All right.
15        A.    That's when I sold the business and closed
16   the doors.
17        Q.    And were you still at Nashua Street when
18   you closed the business?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    And is there any particular reason why in
21   2014 that you decided to close up shop?
22        A.    Basically, business in the commercial
23   printing had changed so much, I was either going to
24   have to invest in newer and more color proofing that
0246
 1   replaced these presses, so I was just too old.
 2        Q.    So did you wind up selling -- is the
 3   business still in existence?
 4        A.    What's that?
 5        Q.    MTC is no longer in existence, right?
 6        A.    Right.
 7        Q.    Okay.  What did you do with the equipment
 8   that you had acquired over the course of -- you know,
 9   from '85 to 2014?
10        A.    I sold it.
11        Q.    Okay.  And it was still operating at the
12   time that you closed shop?
13        A.    It was operating at the time, yeah.
14        Q.    It was good, solid equipment.  We're --
15   we're going to wrap up for the day, and on Thursday
16   I'm going to ask you about Groton Refrigeration.
17        A.    Yeah.
18        Q.    But what I want to do is before we get
19   into that on Thursday, aside from Groton
20   Refrigeration and all of the places we've talked
21   about so far today, has there been any other places
22   that you've worked at for pay?  We went through your
23   Social Security records, which was Exhibit Number 1.
24        A.    Yeah.
0247
 1        Q.    We talked about, you know, obviously,
 2   Martin's Service Station, your brother down in
 3   Florida.  We've got Groton Refrigeration to go.
 4   Leaving that one aside, are there any other places
 5   that you've worked at that we've not talked about
 6   today?
 7        A.    No.  No.
 8        Q.    Perfect.
 9        A.    I'm pretty confident that, you know --
10        Q.    We've covered it?
11        A.    -- I've got them all covered.
12        Q.    Okay.  Good.
13        A.    Yeah.
14        Q.    Okay.
15        A.    I couldn't work too many more places.
16        Q.    Well, we're right up to 2014, which was
17   great.
18              MR. HOOVER:  So, sir, so what we're going
19   to do is conclude -- or just suspend for today.
20   We'll come back, and I'll finish up with Groton
21   Refrigeration on Thursday.  Some of the other folks
22   here might have some more specific questions for you,
23   but we should be able to finish up on Thursday.
24   Okay?
0248
 1              THE WITNESS:  That sounds good.
 2              MR. HOOVER:  All righty.
 3              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is
 4   approximately 3:41, and this is the end of media
 5   number four.

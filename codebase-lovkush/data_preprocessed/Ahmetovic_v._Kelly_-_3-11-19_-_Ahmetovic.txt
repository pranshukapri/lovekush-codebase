         1                  THE REPORTER:  Usual stipulations?

         2                  MR. ABELS:  Sounds good.  We're just going

         3   to reserve our right to read and sign.

         4   Thereupon:

         6   Wethersfield, Connecticut, being first duly sworn, as

         7   hereinafter certified, was examined and testified as

         8   follows:

         9   DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. FRARE:

        10        Q    Good morning, Ms. Ahmetovic.  Is that how you say

        11   your name?

        12        A    Yes.  Ahmetovic.  But Ahmetovic is close enough.

        13        Q    Thank you.

        14             My name is Suzanne Frare and I'm an attorney.  I

        15   represent Paul Thomas Kelly in this lawsuit brought by you

        16   regarding an accident back on March 17, 2017.  I'm going to

        17   ask you some questions related to that.

        18             Now, have you ever testified before in a

        19   deposition?

        20        A    No.

        21        Q    Okay.  Well, first, some ground rules.  As you can

        22   see, there's a court reporter in the room that's going to

        23   take down what's said.  So we need to try and avoid speaking

        24   at the same time.  So even if you know what I'm going to

        25   say, wait for me to finish my question before you begin your

                                                                        5


         1   answer.  And I'll try to do the same.  All right?

         2        A    (Witness gestures.)

         3        Q    And please answer verbally because if you just nod

         4   your head, the reporter can't take down that response.

         5        A    Yes.

         6        Q    Okay.  Also, if I ask you something you don't

         7   understand, please let me know.  Okay?  I'll try to rephrase

         8   the question or ask it another way.  Otherwise, I'll assume

         9   that you understand.  Okay?

        10        A    Yes.

        11        Q    If for some reason you need to take a break, that

        12   shouldn't be a problem as long as there's not a pending

        13   question.  All right?

        14        A    Yes.

        15        Q    Okay.  Now, what is your date of birth?

        16        A    February 12, 1987.

        22        A    Yes, I do.

        23        Q    Okay.  Just for the record, if you can tell me

        24   what that is; but she's only going to take down the last

        25   four digits.

        15        Q    Okay.  Is there a particular reason you switched

        16   jobs?

        17        A    Yes.  The reason I switched jobs, I couldn't

        18   perform as I did before, the volume of patients I would see

        19   a day.  And, first, I only did it for three days a week, and

        20   two days I would do front desk.  My boss worked with me to

        21   kind of alleviate it.

        22             Due to my issue with my shoulder and blood

        23   pressures and rooming in patients, I couldn't do as much; so

        24   they gave me two days to do front desk, which is registering

        25   patients, answering phone calls, scheduling, and so on.  But

                                                                       11


         1   after number of months, I couldn't do it anymore; and I

         2   switched to Arrhythmia Consultants, which basically I do

         3   very much administrative and only a day of medical

         4   assisting.

         5        Q    Okay.  So your job at Pounds Medical, that

         6   required more patient interaction?

         7        A    Yes.  And they had more patients volumewise.

         8   They -- you know, I would see anywhere between 30 to 40

         9   patients a day that I have to room in and make sure that

        10   they are ready for our providers and our dietitians.  So,

        11   you know, 30 blood pressures, 30 weights, 30 labs, 30

        12   everything.  It became a lot for me, considering that I was

        13   in so much pain.  And it's a manual blood pressure, so you

        14   have to pump yourself all day long.

        15        Q    So it wasn't the electrical one?

        16        A    No.

        17        Q    Okay.

        18        A    This office also has the manual.  There is no

        19   machine.

        20        Q    Okay.  But at your old -- at Pounds Medical, you

        21   were seeing 30 to 40 patients every day?

        22        A    Every day.  That's a medical weight-loss clinic,

        23   so appointments are anywhere between 20 to 25 minutes.  And

        24   we had two doctors and three dietitians, full schedules

        25   every day.  So they all had full schedules.  So they all

                                                                       12


         1   had -- you know, sometimes they would have ten patients a

         2   day each, and it was myself and the other medical assistant

         3   that had to bring all of them.  So she does half; I do half.

         4        Q    Okay.  Now, this new job that you have, how many

         5   patients a day are you seeing?

         6        A    Much less.  About 10 to 12.  12 is like a busy day

         7   at Arrhythmia Consultants.

         8        Q    And now, at Pounds, you were -- before the

         9   accident -- at the time of the accident, before it happened,

        10   you were also doing administrative work?

        11        A    No.  This was couple of months after the accident

        12   because I would be in so much pain and I wouldn't be able to

        13   pump all day and to be bringing in patients.  So my boss at

        14   the time -- to alleviate it, she let me do two days of

        15   administrative, which is kind of -- it would help me with my

        16   hand.  Like, I would do medical assisting Monday, Wednesday,

        17   Friday.  So Tuesday and Thursday it would be kind of

        18   alleviation days between that.

        19        Q    Okay.  So she tried to make accommodations?

        20        A    I apologize.  I interrupted you.

        21             Yes.  She tried accommodating because I think I

        22   was a good employee and she wanted to keep me.

        23        Q    Okay.  But then you switched positions.  And how

        24   is that working out?

        25        A    That is working out just fine.  I do mostly

                                                                       13


         1   administrative, which is scheduling, which is obtaining

         2   records for the new patients, entering medications, making

         3   sure, you know, I collect co-pays, check-ins, check-outs,

         4   getting labs from Collaborative or Quest, so having pretty

         5   much all the paperwork ready before the patient comes.  And

         6   when the patient comes, you know, they check in.

         7        Q    And a lot less patients?

         8        A    Many, many less patients.

         9        Q    Now, did you end up missing time from work at

        10   Pounds Medical because of the accident?

        11        A    Not really.

        12                  MR. ABELS:  Why don't we go off the record

        13   just for one second.

        14                  (Whereupon, a discussion was held off the

        15   record.)

        16                  MS. FRARE:  Back on the record.

        17   BY MS. FRARE:

        18        Q    So, Ms. Ahmetovic, are you claiming lost wages

        19   related to this accident?

        20        A    No, ma'am.

        21        Q    Are you claiming any impairment to your ability to

        22   do your job other than what you've told us, that you were

        23   having trouble seeing so many patients?

        24        A    Yes.  I'm missing all the interaction I had with

        25   patients.  Actually, being at Pounds, I mean, I met a lot of

                                                                       14


         1   people there.  And these are the patients that would come

         2   back constantly, I mean, to the point they knew about my

         3   children.  They asked about the pictures on the walls.  Some

         4   of them even knew when was my children's birthday because

         5   they would be there weekly, on a weekly basis.  And then

         6   that went down gradually, especially after being front desk.

         7   There is no interaction no more that I had in the room with

         8   them, which is actually having a conversation.

         9        Q    So your job has changed?

        10        A    It has.  And I actually miss working for Pounds.

        11   It was -- I mean, it was the first job in medical assisting

        12   field, and I just loved being there.  I loved people coming

        13   there.

        14        Q    Now, your job at the other place, the Arrhythmia

        15   Consulting, are you able to perform your job there?

        16        A    Like I said, I only do it on Fridays.  So I only

        17   see patients on Fridays.  So I do see patients.  I do room

        18   in patients, but it's different.  It's different than what

        19   it used to be at my previous job.  My job here now, it's

        20   mostly behind a desk, phone calls, picking up pharmacy phone

        21   calls, patient phone calls, and stuff like that.

        22        Q    Okay.  So you're able to perform your duties at

        23   this new position; correct?

        24        A    I am, ma'am.

        25        Q    So back to the accident.  What's the exact date of

                                                                       15


         1   the accident?

         2        A    Saint Patrick's Day.  March 17, 2017.

         3        Q    And what time did the accident take place?

         4        A    Late afternoon.

         5        Q    And where did the accident take place?

         6        A    On Berlin Turnpike.

         7        Q    Was it near any cross streets or --

         8        A    I wouldn't be able to tell you about the cross

         9   streets, but I know the landmarks.  There is a gas station,

        10   and then there is, like, a plaza with a lot of stores and

        11   restaurants.  That's where we were going to, to Elaine's

        12   Restaurant.

        13        Q    So at the time of the accident, you were going to

        14   Elaine's Restaurant?

        15        A    Correct.

        16        Q    And where were you coming from?

        17        A    We were coming from my house.

        18        Q    And who were you with?

        19        A    I was with my sister-in-law, who was driving.  I

        20   had my daughter in the backseat, and a friend, Mirela.

        21        Q    What's your sister-in-law's name?

        22        A    Melissa.

        23        Q    And her last name?

        24        A    It's M-e-h-m-e-d-l-v-i-c.

        25        Q    And what kind of vehicle were you in?

                                                                       16


         1        A    That was Altima, black Altima, Nissan Altima.  No.

         2   Nissan Maxima.  I apologize.  I confused it.  It's a Maxima.

         3        Q    And that was her vehicle?

         4        A    Yes, ma'am.

         5        Q    Any problems with that vehicle that you were aware

         6   of before the accident?

         7        A    No, ma'am.  Not to my knowledge.

         8        Q    Okay.  And where were you seated in the vehicle?

         9        A    I was a passenger in front.

        10        Q    And where was your daughter?

        11        A    Behind me.  So on the right side backseat.

        12        Q    And you said there was a friend?

        13        A    Yes.

        14        Q    And who was the friend?

        15        A    Mirela, M-i-r-e-l-a.  That's my sister-in-law's

        16   friend.

        17        Q    And where was she seated?

        18        A    She was sitting next to my daughter, Lily.

        19        Q    Now, do you have a driver's license?

        20        A    I do.

        21        Q    Is it a Connecticut license?

        22        A    Yes, ma'am.

        23        Q    And how long have you had that approximately?

        24        A    I don't know.  Maybe eight years, nine years.

        25        Q    Okay.  Is there a particular reason you were going

                                                                       17


         1   two Elaine's Restaurant?

         2        A    Yes.  We were going to book it for my

         3   sister-in-law's birthday -- my sister-in-law's baby shower.

         4   She was seven months pregnant at the time.

         5        Q    This is your sister-in-law that was driving the

         6   car?

         7        A    Correct.

         8        Q    Okay.  Now, this accident, did it involve one

         9   other vehicle other than the vehicle you were in or more

        10   than one?

        11        A    So us and the person that hit us.

        12        Q    And what kind of vehicle was that?

        13        A    Ours was Nissan Maxima.

        14        Q    Right.  The other vehicle?

        15        A    Black.

        16        Q    Was it a car or an SUV?

        17        A    A car.

        18        Q    Do you know the make or model or the car?

        19        A    I think -- I think -- I know it was Dodge, but I

        20   don't know if it was Dodge Stratus or Dodge Charger.  I'm

        21   not sure between those two.

        22        Q    Okay.  And did you notice this vehicle at all

        23   before the accident occurred?

        24        A    Absolutely not, ma'am.

        25        Q    And the vehicle you were in, was it moving or

                                                                       18


         1   stopped at the time of the accident?

         2        A    So at the time of the accident, we were stopped,

         3   turning into -- trying to turn into the parking for

         4   Elaine's.

         5        Q    So why don't you tell me what happened.

         6        A    So we were traveling down Berlin Turnpike.  So

         7   here is the gas station.  Here is Elaine's.  So Melissa was

         8   trying to turn in, and we were just talking.  And next thing

         9   you know, boom, and she was just like, "We were just hit."

        10             So when the collision happened, I don't know -- I

        11   just went flying forward.  And coming back, I hit the door.

        12   And I immediately -- I had my daughter in the back.  Like, I

        13   immediately, like, jumped back looking at Lily.  And I just

        14   had that feeling -- oh, my God.  Like, it seems like it's

        15   coming back.  But that feeling of not being able to breathe,

        16   like somebody has their hands on, like, your neck and kind

        17   of, like, pressing and you just can't.

        18             So I really had hard time in the car.  So I got

        19   out of the car and I felt -- I was just, like, gasping for

        20   air literally.  I don't know how to explain it.  It felt

        21   like somebody throws you in a pool and, like, you're under

        22   water and you're like (descriptive sound), that type of

        23   feeling.

        24             And then I don't know who called the cops.  I

        25   don't know was it Melissa.  I don't know was it the other

                                                                       19


         1   guy.  Somebody called the cops.

         2        Q    Okay.  So let me just get back to the accident.

         3        A    Sorry.

         4        Q    No, no.  Thank you.  That's good.

         5             Berlin Turnpike, that was the road that you were

         6   traveling on; correct?

         7        A    Yes, ma'am.

         8        Q    And is it a two-way road?

         9        A    No.  The direction we were going, it's one way.

        10   You have two lines -- two lanes to go that direction, and

        11   then there is the barrier.  That's for the opposite traffic.

        12        Q    Okay.  So there is traffic that goes in the

        13   opposite way?

        14        A    Mm-hmm.

        15        Q    And there is a barrier in the middle?

        16        A    Yes, ma'am.

        17        Q    Okay.  In the direction you were headed, there

        18   were two traveling lanes?

        19        A    Correct.

        20        Q    And which lane were you in?

        21        A    All the way to the right lane.

        22        Q    And was Elaine's Restaurant to the right?

        23        A    Yes, ma'am.

        24        Q    How long had you been in the right lane before the

        25   accident?

                                                                       20


         1        A    Well, if I travel from my house, which is

         2   McMullen, you go up to Jordan Lane to where the Stop & Shop

         3   is and that's when -- Berlin Turnpike begins at that light.

         4   So we would need to turn left and keep going.  So there's a

         5   light there -- a couple of lights, at least three lights to

         6   Elaine's.

         7        Q    Okay.  Can you estimate how far in terms of

         8   distance?

         9        A    I don't know if I really could in miles, but I

        10   would say at least 3 miles from where the Jordan Lane ends

        11   to, like, the beginning and all the way down the Berlin

        12   Turnpike.

        13        Q    Now, do you know if your sister-in-law had her

        14   blinker on to turn?

        15        A    I -- yes.  That's definitely.

        16        Q    And how do you know that?

        17        A    I know this because she is a frantic person.

        18        Q    Okay.

        19        A    When other people don't blink, she gets upset.  So

        20   trust me, she blinks.

        21        Q    Okay.  So you're basing it on her personality and

        22   habits?

        23        A    And I've driven with her many, many other times.

        24        Q    Okay.  Did you hear the blinker or --

        25        A    No.  I haven't heard the blinker.

                                                                       21


         1        Q    Okay.  Do you have any idea how long the blinker

         2   was on before the accident?

         3        A    Timewise?

         4        Q    Yeah.

         5        A    I don't know.  I mean, we were going and then she

         6   started slowing down.  And then, like, when she was, like,

         7   stopped really to turn in, that's when the accident

         8   happened, so gotta be at least a minute -- at least a minute

         9   that she put her blinker on before actually stopping and,

        10   like, trying to go in.

        11        Q    All right.  And I know you said when the accident

        12   occurred, the vehicle was at a complete stop?

        13        A    Absolutely.  We were stopped and -- but then boom.

        14   That's what happened.

        15        Q    Can you estimate approximately how long the

        16   vehicle was at a complete stop?

        17        A    I would say a couple of seconds.

        18        Q    And the manner in which she slowed down her

        19   vehicle, was that gradual or sudden?

        20        A    Gradual.  This is a seven-months-pregnant woman

        21   that looks three times before she walks to her car.  Trust

        22   me.  It was her first child.  We just wanted her to have

        23   this baby already, all of us.

        24        Q    She was very cautious; right?

        25        A    Yes.  You can say cautious.

                                                                       22


         1        Q    Okay.  Now, what part of the vehicle you were in

         2   was impacted by this other vehicle?

         3        A    Back.  The bumper, the trunk area, the rear.

         4        Q    Could you say whether the impact to the back

         5   bumper -- was it to, like, the middle back or more towards

         6   the passenger side or the driver's side?

         7        A    I really can't say, but I think -- I think it was

         8   somewhere kind of in the middle, maybe to the -- more to the

         9   driver's side.

        10        Q    And when the impact occurred, was your vehicle

        11   straight or had it started to turn?  Was it at an angle?

        12        A    Straight.  It was straight because when we were

        13   hit, we were pushed in the entrance of the parking lot.

        14        Q    So how far was your vehicle -- it was -- was it

        15   pushed forward or pushed to the side?

        16        A    Pushed -- pushed -- so this is the entry.  So we

        17   were trying to go in here.  And the way he hit, we were,

        18   like, pushed like that, in.

        19        Q    So pushed --

        20        A    So forward.

        21        Q    And how far did the vehicle go after the impact?

        22        A    Our vehicle or --

        23        Q    Your vehicle.

        24        A    Just into the parking.  We were pushed into the

        25   parking.

                                                                       23


         1        Q    Okay.  In terms of inches, feet, something else,

         2   can you say how far the vehicle traveled after the impact?

         3        A    Maybe from here to that wall.  Like, not -- I

         4   don't know.  What's that?  Maybe 5 feet, 6 feet.  I don't

         5   know what that is.

         6        Q    Sounds about right.  About approximately 5 to

         7   6 feet; correct?

         8        A    Yes, ma'am.

         9        Q    Now, this other vehicle, what part of this vehicle

        10   had contact with yours?

        11        A    The front.  The gentleman, like, went in our rear

        12   but hit his front.

        13        Q    Okay.  Now, before -- was it -- I'm sorry.  Was it

        14   just one impact?

        15        A    Mm-hmm.  Yes, ma'am.

        16        Q    And how would you describe this impact, the force

        17   of the impact?

        18        A    We're talking, you know, just talking, and then

        19   you hear (descriptive sound) kind of just out of nowhere.

        20   It felt like something, like, just jumped out of you -- I

        21   mean jumped out of me type of feeling, you know, when this

        22   big noise just, like, boom.  It's, like, this collision out

        23   of absolutely nowhere.

        24        Q    So there was nothing that led you to anticipate

        25   this happening?

                                                                       24


         1        A    Absolutely not, ma'am.  Not at all.

         2        Q    Okay.  Now, were you wearing your seat belt at the

         3   time of the accident?

         4        A    Yes, I have.

         5        Q    And was this seat belt the kind that goes across

         6   your chest and across your waist?

         7        A    Yes.  Like this.

         8        Q    Now, was the vehicle equipped with airbags?  Do

         9   you know?

        10        A    I'm sure it was.  But, like, they didn't break.

        11        Q    Okay.  They didn't go off?

        12        A    No.

        13        Q    And as best you can -- I know you told me a little

        14   already, but can you describe what happened to your body

        15   when the impact occurred?

        16        A    So like I said, out of nowhere we get hit and I

        17   went flying to the dashboard and coming back.  Like, it just

        18   felt like matter of seconds that it happened, like forward,

        19   boom, like this.  And then right away I'm thinking baby is

        20   in the back, so I right away, like, go to look to the back.

        21   Like, where is she?  Like, what's going on?  That's the best

        22   I can demonstrate.

        23        Q    That's very good.

        24             So when you go forward, do you brace yourself

        25   against the dashboard?

                                                                       25


         1        A    No.  I actually -- I actually -- I don't think I

         2   even figured to brace myself.  I hit -- I kind of hit with

         3   my chest, like, going like that.  I kind of, like, jumped

         4   and then back.  And, like, when coming back, like, this is

         5   the door and the window on the car.  Like, I hit with my

         6   shoulder and my right side.

         7        Q    Right side?  Right shoulder?

         8        A    Yes, ma'am.  And then I turned and I was like

         9   Lily, you know.  She was like 20 months at the time.

        10        Q    Okay.  And so your right shoulder and right side,

        11   did that hit the window or the frame of the door?

        12        A    That hit both.  That hit the window and, you know,

        13   where you put your hand, where you can -- that part of the

        14   door where you can have the hand.

        15        Q    The armrest?

        16        A    Yes.

        17        Q    So you hit that.  Okay.  And the dashboard?  You

        18   said your chest hit the dashboard?

        19        A    I went forward in that dashboard.

        20        Q    Okay.  And then immediately you turned towards

        21   your left to check on your daughter?

        22        A    Correct.  Immediately I swang (ph) left to look at

        23   her and see what's going on with her.

        24        Q    Did you take your seat belt off at that time?

        25        A    At that time, no.  But then, like, immediately

                                                                       26


         1   right after I took it off and I was, like, trying -- I was

         2   actually trying to climb between the two seats to climb in

         3   the back because at this point I actually wasn't even

         4   thinking that anything happened to me.  I'm thinking she's

         5   in the back.  Like, she's in the car seat.  Like, I need to

         6   get to her.  But surprisingly, like, nothing happened to

         7   her, thank God.

         8        Q    I was going to ask you.  Yeah, thank God.  20

         9   months.  Was she in a car seat?

        10        A    Correct.  With the harness.

        11        Q    And she was okay?  No injuries?

        12        A    She was okay.  No injuries.  Not a scratch.

        13        Q    Thank God.

        14        A    Thank God, yes.

        15        Q    Now, you said -- did you immediately get out of

        16   the car?

        17        A    So not immediately.  Like I said, I was trying to

        18   get in the back to Lily.  And then I just had that feeling

        19   of, like, somebody is -- feeling like somebody is almost

        20   choking me.  I felt I couldn't breathe in there.  I felt

        21   like I'm just gasping for air and nothing is happening, so I

        22   got out.  I opened my door and I got out.  I was trying to

        23   catch my breath, and I was trying to catch my breath.  I

        24   opened her door and, like, I'm unbuckling everything,

        25   picking her up, twisting her, turning her.  She's just fine.

                                                                       27


         1   I mean, she --

         2        Q    Was she upset?

         3        A    I don't know if she was asleep when it happened.

         4   Like, I don't understand, but she was absolutely calm.

         5   Like, she wasn't crying.  She was just like, okay, mom.  So

         6   I sit her back down because I still had that feeling of not

         7   being able to breathe correctly.  My sister-in-law was just

         8   sitting in her seat.  And I was like, "Are you okay?  What's

         9   going on?  Are you fine?"

        10             She was on the phone.  I don't even know.  I think

        11   she was on the phone with the police.  She was like, "Okay,

        12   okay, just calm down."

        13             And next thing you know in a little bit -- I

        14   didn't go back in the car, but next thing you know, the

        15   police officer pulled in.

        16        Q    So how long did it take for the police to get

        17   there?

        18        A    At least a good 15 minutes.

        19        Q    Okay.  And what did you do during the 15 minutes?

        20        A    Outside.  I was just trying to breathe, to be

        21   honest with you.  And at that point I'm like I understand

        22   I'm scared.  Like, I know I just got frightened, but I just

        23   couldn't calm myself.  I don't know if I'm explaining this

        24   correctly.  But I just couldn't get rid of that feeling that

        25   somebody is, like, almost choking me and I cannot breathe.

                                                                       28


         1        Q    Okay.

         2        A    So I don't know if I was having an anxiety attack

         3   or whatever was going on, but I just couldn't shake it off.

         4        Q    And how long did that last, that feeling of not

         5   being able to breathe?

         6        A    It felt forever, honest to God.  It felt forever.

         7   But, I mean, even when the police got there, I had a hard

         8   time.  I kept holding myself because I felt like if I keep

         9   doing this, it gets better.  But I don't know.  At least

        10   15 minutes.

        11        Q    Okay.  So when the police got there, was this

        12   feeling a little bit better or --

        13        A    A little bit better, but not gone, absolutely not

        14   gone.  I think I was just in shock, too.  I mean, I think

        15   everything kind of bunched in together, so I just couldn't

        16   calm down.

        17        Q    Did anyone help you?

        18        A    No.  I think they were all shocked.  My

        19   sister-in-law did not move from her car.  Mirela was just

        20   sitting there, and Lily -- you know, she was in her car seat

        21   and that's it.  And then the police officer came, and he

        22   took -- when the police officer came, that's when the

        23   gentleman that hit us -- that's when he came over.

        24        Q    Did he come over at all within the 15 minutes?

        25        A    No.  He came over to the window after the police

                                                                       29


         1   showed up.  That's when he came.

         2        Q    Can you describe him?

         3        A    Nice looking.  He was on, like, a skinnier side,

         4   definitely blond, short haircut.

         5        Q    White man?

         6        A    White man definitely.

         7        Q    How old?

         8        A    I would say -- I don't know.  I didn't take, like,

         9   the best glance of him; but I would say early thirties, not

        10   more than that, because he did not look old.

        11        Q    And do you know what he was doing during the

        12   15 minutes before the police arrived?

        13        A    Yes.  He kept walking frantically around his car

        14   and he looked upset looking at his car and then he had the

        15   kids.  He took the kids at one point from the car and put

        16   them back in the car.

        17        Q    Did he have kids in his car?

        18        A    He had three kids.

        19        Q    How old were the kids?

        20        A    I don't know.  Maybe my son's age at the time.

        21   Maybe like 9, 10, 8, like in that range.  They were not

        22   small, small children.

        23        Q    Okay.  And you saw him take the kids out of the

        24   car?

        25        A    Yeah.  The kids.  He opened the door for the kids.

                                                                       30


         1   He opened the door for the kids, and all three came out and

         2   went back in.  I believe it was a boy and two girls, but I'm

         3   not absolutely sure.

         4        Q    Okay.  Is it fair to say that before the police

         5   arrived, he was tending to his kids?

         6        A    Well, he was tending more to his car, to be honest

         7   with you, because that's where he was looking.  He was

         8   looking at the front of his car and kind of, like, looking

         9   kind of under and his grille area.  He was looking at that a

        10   lot.

        11        Q    Okay.  Now, your sister-in-law, did she sustain

        12   any injury in this accident?

        13        A    Yes.  So that night she did go to ER to get

        14   herself checked out because she was pregnant, but the

        15   back -- she's still having issues with that, back pain.

        16   That's all I know of.

        17        Q    Did she make a claim related to this accident?  Do

        18   you know?

        19        A    Yes.

        20        Q    Okay.  Does she have a lawsuit pending?

        21        A    I am not sure of that.  I know she does have a

        22   lawyer.

        23        Q    Do you happen to know who her lawyer is?

        24        A    No.

        25        Q    Okay.  Just if you know.

                                                                       31


         1             And what about the passenger in the car?  Did she

         2   sustain any injury?

         3        A    Mirela, no.  She never said that she -- anything.

         4   She never said that she hurts at all, and she never started

         5   any sort of claim.

         6        Q    Okay.  Now, immediately after the accident -- and

         7   I know you described that feeling of not being able to

         8   breathe and all of that.  Other than that feeling, were you

         9   feeling any pain or aware of any injury immediately after?

        10        A    Immediately after, I felt sharp pain in my chest.

        11   That was through the time that I felt I can't breathe.  And,

        12   like, I felt, like, sharp pains coming through my chest; but

        13   besides that, no.

        14        Q    Okay.  And at any point after the accident, did

        15   you have any visible injury?

        16        A    Visible?  What do you mean?

        17        Q    Let me ask it a different way.  Were you bleeding

        18   from any part of your body?

        19        A    No, ma'am.

        20        Q    Did you develop any bruising?

        21        A    No, ma'am.

        22        Q    Any red marks like from the seat belt or anything?

        23        A    Just here, but not all the way, but just here.

        24   But that was probably because I went forward and that's

        25   where it stretched to.

                                                                       32


         1        Q    Okay.

         2        A    But nothing big.

         3        Q    So just for the record, you're pointing to your

         4   right shoulder area?

         5        A    Yes.

         6        Q    Okay.  And what was there?

         7        A    That was the line of the seat belt.

         8        Q    Like a red mark?

         9        A    Yes, ma'am.  It didn't stick around.  It went

        10   away.

        11        Q    Any medical treatment for that?

        12        A    For the mark, no.  I'm sorry.

        13        Q    No, no, no.  Silly question.  I'm just trying to

        14   get my report here.

        15                  MR. ABELS:  Off the record.

        16                  (Whereupon, a discussion was held off the

        17   record.)

        18                  MS. FRARE:  Back on the record.

        19   BY MS. FRARE:

        20        Q    Any swelling to any part of your body related to

        21   the accident?

        22        A    Yes, ma'am.

        23        Q    What's that?

        24        A    The whole right side here, my neck here, my back.

        25        Q    And that actually swelled?

                                                                       33


         1        A    That actually was swollen for -- this part right

         2   here was swollen for weeks.

         3        Q    Between your neck and your shoulder on the right

         4   side?

         5        A    Yes.

         6        Q    And your back?  What part of your back?

         7        A    What do you call this?  The trapezius?  This whole

         8   side was swollen.

         9        Q    Your upper back?

        10        A    Yes, ma'am.

        11        Q    Any other part of your body?

        12        A    That was hurting or that was swollen?

        13        Q    I'm asking swollen.

        14        A    No.

        15        Q    Now, did you speak to the police officer?

        16        A    Yes.

        17        Q    And can you tell me the sum and substance of what

        18   was said with the police officer?

        19        A    He asked us for our documentation, which we gave.

        20   He also asked me -- because I was in distress, he asked me

        21   if I wanted to go to the hospital.

        22        Q    What did you say?

        23        A    I was just out of it.  I was like, "No, no.  I'm

        24   good.  I'm good.  I just can't breathe."

        25             And I don't know what else.  He told us to wait in

                                                                       34


         1   the car.

         2        Q    Okay.  So he asked if you wanted to go to the

         3   hospital?

         4        A    Mm-hmm.

         5        Q    And you declined medical attention?

         6        A    Yes.

         7        Q    Is there a reason?

         8        A    I just didn't -- didn't feel like I was hurt, like

         9   I had injuries, to be honest with you.

        10        Q    Okay.  Any witnesses to the accident other than

        11   the occupants of the vehicle?

        12        A    Not that I know.

        13        Q    Any photographs of the accident scene or the

        14   vehicles involved?

        15        A    Not on my part.

        16        Q    Now, was there damage to the vehicle that you were

        17   in?

        18        A    Mm-hmm.  Yes.

        19        Q    Can you describe that damage?

        20        A    Well, the bumper area was hit with, like, visible

        21   damage and the trunk area.

        22        Q    Now, visible damage, was it denting or scratched?

        23        A    Like denting.

        24        Q    Can you just describe what you recall as far as

        25   the damage?

                                                                       35


         1        A    Like going in, like bent in.

         2        Q    Okay.  And what about the other vehicle?

         3        A    His front.  Like I mentioned before, his front was

         4   in damage.

         5        Q    And was that dented and pushed in?

         6        A    No.  I don't know.  I feel like that was, like,

         7   broken.  I didn't go over.  But from the way it looked and

         8   the way he was, like, going around it, I felt like that was

         9   damaged a lot.

        10                  (Whereupon, a discussion was held off the

        11   record.)

        12                  (Exhibit 1 was marked for identification.)

        13                  (Exhibit 2 was marked for identification.)

        14                  (Exhibit 3 was marked for identification.)

        15   BY MS. FRARE:

        16        Q    If you just take a minute and look at those three

        17   pages, what's been marked as Defendant's 1, 2, and 3.

        18        A    (Witness complies.)

        19        Q    Do you recognize what's shown in those three

        20   photos?

        21        A    Yes.  That's Melissa's car.

        22        Q    And let's take Defendant's Exhibit 1.  Is that

        23   photo of the back of Melissa's car?

        24        A    Mm-hmm.  Yes.

        25        Q    Do you know who took the photos?

                                                                       36


         1        A    No.

         2        Q    Have you ever seen these photos before?

         3        A    No.

         4        Q    Is there any damage shown in Defendant's 1 there?

         5        A    Yes.

         6        Q    Can you just describe the damage for the record?

         7        A    So it's white.  It's scratched up.  I don't know

         8   if I -- I don't know if I'm seeing it correctly, but I feel

         9   like that's a dent.

        10        Q    A little dent on what would be the driver's side

        11   of that vehicle on the back?

        12        A    Yes, ma'am.

        13        Q    And let's take Defendant's 2.  Is that also

        14   showing the back of Melissa's car?

        15        A    Yes.

        16        Q    And Defendant's 3, is that a closer-up picture of

        17   the back bumper of the car?

        18        A    Yes.  That is a closer picture than these.

        19        Q    Okay.  Do these three pictures fairly and

        20   accurately show the way the back of Melissa's car looked

        21   after the accident?

        22        A    Yes.

        23        Q    Is there any damage that you recall that's not

        24   shown in those three photos?

        25        A    Not that I recall, ma'am, no.

                                                                       37


         1        Q    And there was no damage to the side of the vehicle

         2   or the front; correct?

         3        A    No, ma'am.

         4        Q    Now, how did you leave the accident scene?

         5        A    In that car.

         6        Q    Okay.  Any -- was there any problems driving that

         7   vehicle?  Do you know?

         8        A    Nothing she said.

         9        Q    Did she get the vehicle repaired?

        10        A    She sold the vehicle.

        11        Q    And when did she sell it in relation to the

        12   accident?

        13        A    Shortly after.  So the accident happened in March.

        14   She had Bella beginning of May, first week of May.  She had

        15   already sold the car, because she had a different car.

        16        Q    Did she sell it because of the accident?

        17        A    I believe so.  I'm not absolutely sure.

        18        Q    Okay.

        19        A    She felt like it wasn't safe anymore, so she gave

        20   it up and got a new car.

        21        Q    Okay.  But you were able to drive in it leaving

        22   the accident?

        23        A    Yes, ma'am.

        24        Q    Okay.  Did you go to Elaine's Restaurant?

        25        A    No.  No.  That was a mess.  But we did call, and

                                                                       38


         1   we explained what happened because we had a scheduled

         2   appointment for this baby shower.  And I was the one doing

         3   it for her, so the deposit is under my name and everything.

         4   So Elaine's Restaurant happened later.  I kind of just went

         5   in, gave my debit card -- not the same day, but a couple

         6   days after went in, gave my debit card, and, you know, put

         7   the deposit in and said how many people.  But believe it or

         8   not, the best part is she ended up having the baby the day

         9   of the baby shower, so there was never a baby shower.  So

        10   all the decorations, cake, everything kind of went down the

        11   road.  And I didn't get my deposit back.

        12        Q    And I just want to be clear.  So the day of this

        13   accident, you were looking at the restaurant?

        14        A    We were going to pay up for the deposit because we

        15   already agreed on everything online.  They have a website,

        16   and then you pick -- you pick what you want for drinks, you

        17   pick what you want for food, and it's kind of like a price

        18   per person.  So you can get a drink, they get food, and you

        19   get their room, their back room, where they, like, make

        20   everything.  And then it's, like, a certain price after you

        21   tell them how many people.

        22        Q    Okay.  So the baby shower wasn't the day of the

        23   accident?

        24        A    No, no, no, it wasn't.

        25        Q    And where did you go after the accident?

                                                                       39


         1        A    Home.

         2        Q    And when did you first seek medical attention?

         3        A    The next morning.  It was a Saturday.

         4        Q    Did you bring your daughter in to have any kind of

         5   medical attention?

         6        A    I called her pediatrician, and she wanted me to

         7   bring her in.  I brought her in, but she had no visible --

         8   nothing wrong with her.

         9        Q    And when did you bring your daughter in?

        10        A    That Monday.

        11        Q    What day of the week did the accident happen?

        12        A    It was Friday.

        13        Q    So the next day, Saturday --

        14        A    Correct.

        15        Q    -- is that when you first sought medical

        16   attention?

        17        A    Yes, ma'am.

        18        Q    And where did you go?

        19        A    I went to Kathy's Urgent Care.

        20        Q    Had you ever been there before?

        21        A    No.  I brought relatives there before.

        22        Q    And when you went there the next day, what were

        23   your complaints at the time?

        24        A    I'm dying.  I was sore all over.  Like, I felt

        25   like I couldn't get up.  I was hurting everywhere.

                                                                       40


         1        Q    Okay.

         2        A    So they -- you know, I told them that I'm here, I

         3   got in a car accident yesterday, and I'm hurting.  So they

         4   took a couple of X-rays, said I didn't break anything.  They

         5   said I was just probably sore from the impact.  I was sent

         6   home on muscle relaxers and ibuprofen.

         7        Q    Okay.  Were you making complaints of pain to any

         8   specific area?

         9        A    Yes.  So my head, back of my head was hurting, my

        10   neck, and this whole right side.  And then I had a pain in

        11   my lower back, like right in the middle, that's like

        12   traveling to outside of my back.  I felt I couldn't sit.  I

        13   felt I couldn't lay down type of pain.

        14        Q    And this is that next day?

        15        A    This is Saturday, correct.

        16        Q    All right.  So the pain in your lower back, it

        17   traveled down?  It radiated?

        18        A    Yes, ma'am.

        19        Q    To what part of your body?

        20        A    Just in my lower back and just to the sides of the

        21   back.

        22        Q    Not down your legs?

        23        A    No.  I had a lot of tingling to my legs, but no

        24   pain.

        25        Q    Okay.  Tingling to what part of your leg?

                                                                       41


         1        A    Going down to my feet.

         2        Q    In the front of your legs or side or back?

         3        A    The side of my leg, going down to my foot.

         4        Q    Your right leg?

         5        A    Yes.

         6        Q    Not your left leg; correct?

         7        A    No.  Left side, surprisingly, is fine.

         8        Q    And what part of your body did they take the

         9   X-rays?

        10        A    Up here.  The back, the shoulder, the neck.

        11        Q    Your neck and your right shoulder?

        12        A    Mm-hmm.

        13        Q    Did they prescribe medication?

        14        A    They gave me muscle relaxer, and they gave me

        15   ibuprofen for pain.

        16        Q    And how long did you take the muscle relaxer?

        17        A    For as long as I had it.

        18        Q    Was that days?

        19        A    I think that's -- they give you a week.  So it's

        20   three a day, every eight hours.

        21        Q    And you took that, three a day for a week?

        22        A    Yes, ma'am.  And ibuprofen, two.

        23        Q    A day?

        24        A    Mm-hmm.

        25        Q    And how long did you take that?

                                                                       42


         1        A    For as long as I had the prescription.  So I don't

         2   know what they gave me.  I don't know if they gave me a week

         3   or a month's supply, but I took that till the end.

         4        Q    And did you go back to Kathy's Urgent Care at all

         5   for injuries related to the accident?

         6        A    No, ma'am.

         7        Q    And did you go somewhere else for medical

         8   attention?

         9        A    Yes, ma'am.

        10        Q    And where was that?

        11        A    I started going to the physical therapy on

        12   Franklin Avenue.

        13        Q    Do you know the name of that?

        14        A    Physicians.

        15        Q    Is it Hartford --

        16        A    Hartford Physicians or Hartford Physical.  I'm not

        17   sure the name, but I -- the reason why I know of that place

        18   is my mother-in-law used to go there.

        19        Q    Had you ever gone for treatment there before the

        20   accident?

        21        A    No, ma'am.

        22        Q    Did any doctor recommend you go there, or you just

        23   decided to go?

        24        A    I just went there.

        25        Q    And when did you go?

                                                                       43


         1        A    April.  Shortly after.  I don't know which day

         2   exactly, but shortly after.

         3        Q    From the records I have, it's April 7, 2017.  Does

         4   that sound right?

         5        A    Yes.  Beginning of April.

         6        Q    And how long did you go for?

         7        A    So I was there for a couple of months.  I was

         8   going first weekly, and then it was biweekly.  Then it was

         9   monthly.

        10        Q    Okay.  I have that you went until April 18, 2017.

        11   Does that sound about right?

        12        A    I was going to that place longer than April 18th.

        13        Q    Did I miss something?  It's possible.

        14                  MR. ABELS:  You should have that whole --

        15                  MS. FRARE:  April 18.

        16                  MR. ABELS:  August.

        17                  MS. FRARE:  I'm sorry.  It's Monday.

        18   BY MS. FRARE:

        19        Q    August 18, 2017, is what I meant to say.

        20        A    Yes, ma'am.

        21        Q    So you went from April 7th to August 17th.  Okay.

        22   Sorry about that.

        23                  MS. FRARE:  Off the record.

        24                  (Whereupon, a discussion was held off the

        25   record.)

                                                                       44


         1                  MS. FRARE:  Back on the record.

         2   BY MS. FRARE:

         3        Q    So when you went in April, what were your

         4   complaints at that time?

         5        A    Same.  Headaches, my head, my neck, shoulder,

         6   back.

         7        Q    Okay.  And what kind of treatment did they do for

         8   you?

         9        A    So I met with a couple of different doctors.  I

        10   had Dr. Richardson and Dr. Cherry.  So what they did -- they

        11   did electroshock therapy almost.  It's where they put these

        12   stickies on you, and then you're under -- at the same time,

        13   you're under very hot towels or blankets.  I don't know what

        14   was on top of me.  But that is to kind of break down and

        15   relax the muscles.  I did adjustments with them.

        16             I did stretching exercises, which I do till this

        17   day.  I have a small electric machine that they gave me

        18   during that time that I still use till this day, which is --

        19   you have -- it's battery operated; but you have these

        20   stickies that you put to where it hurts, and then you're

        21   adjusting for as much as you can take.

        22        Q    Okay.  Of that electric stimulation?

        23        A    Correct.

        24        Q    And were they doing this to your shoulder -- your

        25   right shoulder/neck area?

                                                                       45


         1        A    They were doing it all over.  They were doing it

         2   to the shoulder.  They were doing it to the neck.  They were

         3   doing it to the back.

         4        Q    Okay.  And did that help?

         5        A    My back is great.  It helped absolutely.  But

         6   shoulder and my neck is an ongoing thing.  It did help, but

         7   it hasn't taken it away.

         8        Q    So your back pain, you said, is great?

         9        A    It's gone.

        10        Q    Okay.  So it's resolved?

        11        A    That is.

        12        Q    And when did that resolve?

        13        A    A couple months into these treatments it got

        14   better.  And I had horrible, horrible headaches for a period

        15   of time.  So I really lived on Aleve day/night.  But that

        16   had gotten better over time.  A cup months in, that got

        17   better and that's awesome.

        18        Q    And the Aleve you can get over the counter;

        19   correct?

        20        A    Correct.  I should be on their ad really.

        21        Q    So how long did you end up having the horrible

        22   headaches approximately?

        23        A    At least couple months in.  But then they started

        24   gradually going down, less days per week headaches and then

        25   less headaches.  And now, like, I barely ever get a headache

                                                                       46


         1   now, which thank God.

         2        Q    Did you seek any specific medical treatment for

         3   the headaches other than taking the Aleve?

         4        A    Other than taking the Aleve, no.

         5        Q    Okay.  And I know you told me there was a period

         6   of time you were going once a week to the therapy?

         7        A    Yes, ma'am.

         8        Q    And for how long did you go once a week?

         9        A    Oh, my goodness.  I think it's a month that I went

        10   every week.

        11        Q    And then it changed biweekly?

        12        A    And then it changed biweekly.

        13        Q    For how long?

        14        A    If you can refer to the dates.  I'm really not

        15   sure how long.

        16        Q    Okay.  And the last time you went was in August of

        17   2017?

        18        A    No.  I actually -- I actually saw a different

        19   doctor after.  I saw a surgeon, Dr. Rubin, for after August.

        20        Q    Okay.  But before we get to Dr. Rubin, the

        21   physical therapy -- was it physical therapy that you had?

        22        A    Mm-hmm.  Correct.

        23        Q    Did you also see a chiropractor there?

        24        A    That's Dr. Cherry.  He would adjust me.

        25        Q    Okay.  So you had physical therapy and

                                                                       47


         1   chiropractic treatment?

         2        A    Yes.  Yes.  I apologize.  Yes.

         3        Q    You're doing great.

         4             How long would these sessions last?

         5        A    Timewise?

         6        Q    Yeah.  When you would go.

         7        A    Maybe half an hour.  Not more than half an hour

         8   definitely, since they bring you in the room and they lay

         9   you down and they set you up.  Half an hour, I would say.

        10        Q    Had you ever had this type of treatment before?

        11        A    No.

        12        Q    So this is the first time you had physical therapy

        13   or chiropractic?

        14        A    Yes, ma'am.

        15        Q    And is there a reason that you stopped going?

        16        A    Well, I was told that they can't do any more for

        17   me.

        18        Q    So they told you that?  It wasn't a decision you

        19   made?

        20        A    Exactly.

        21        Q    And then you saw Dr. Rubin.  Is he an orthopedist?

        22        A    Yes, ma'am.

        23        Q    And when did you see Dr. Rubin?

        24        A    Right after I saw Dr. Cherry, in that period.

        25   They were the ones that did all the appointments and

                                                                       48


         1   scheduling.  It's the same practice, same place.

         2        Q    And did Dr. Cherry recommend you see Dr. Rubin?

         3        A    Yes.  That's their practice.

         4        Q    And do you recall when you first saw Dr. Rubin?

         5        A    Oh, my God.  I can't recall a date.  I'm sorry.

         6        Q    That's okay.

         7             How often would you see him?

         8        A    I saw him frequently -- more frequently at the

         9   beginning, but then I saw him -- like, towards the end, I

        10   saw him once a month.

        11        Q    When was the last time you saw him?

        12        A    Last time I was there.  I'm sorry.  I don't know

        13   the date.

        14        Q    Was it March of 2018?

        15        A    March.  Correct.  It was March.

        16        Q    March 20, 2018?

        17        A    I'm not sure of the date, but I think it was

        18   March.  But I don't know which day.

        19        Q    Okay.  And did he send you for any type of

        20   testing?

        21        A    He did order an MRI.

        22        Q    To what part of your body?

        23        A    To my neck and my shoulder.

        24        Q    Had you ever had an MRI before?

        25        A    Not that I remember, no.

                                                                       49


         1        Q    Did he discuss the results of the MRI with you?

         2        A    Yes.

         3        Q    And what did he say?

         4        A    I really don't understand that much; but pretty

         5   much what he said is I'm not a candidate for surgery from

         6   the MRI and, basically, that's all he could do for me.

         7        Q    Did he give you any type of diagnosis or anything

         8   like that?

         9        A    He did say that there was some percentage of

        10   damage, but I don't know the diagnosis for any of that.

        11        Q    Did he recommend any further treatment or going to

        12   any other doctors or anything like that?

        13        A    No, he has not.

        14        Q    Do you plan to continue to see him, Dr. Rubin?

        15        A    I would like to; but Dr. Rubin, I believe, you

        16   know, is done with my treatment.  There is not too much that

        17   he can help me with anymore.  I am not to that point where I

        18   would require surgery.  The practice pretty much did as much

        19   as they could for me.  Also, you know, I couldn't get the

        20   cortisone shots because they literally target a specific

        21   portion, but mine is all over.  So he said it would be

        22   useless to get the shots because they really don't know

        23   where it is.

        24        Q    So you had no type of injections?

        25        A    No.

                                                                       50


         1        Q    Did you go to any other doctors or any other

         2   medical facilities related to this accident?

         3        A    So, no, I have not been under any other doctors;

         4   but what I have been doing would be getting massages.

         5        Q    Where do you have that?

         6        A    Everywhere.  I usually get them off Groupon.  And

         7   it would just be to really concentrate on my neck and the

         8   arm area.  I had them pretty much everywhere, from Oasis to

         9   Envy to another massage place right on Silas Deane, which is

        10   close by my house.  I still do the exercises in the showers,

        11   the stretching that they showed me.  I still use the machine

        12   that they gave me, the electrical current.  I do that twice

        13   a week.

        14        Q    And did the physical therapist or chiropractor

        15   give you that?

        16        A    Yes.  Dr. Cherry did.

        17        Q    And did they give you exercises to do at home?

        18        A    Yes.  I had the whole book.

        19        Q    And you do those at home?

        20        A    Yes, ma'am.  Majority of them are to be done in

        21   the shower while, you know, the hot water is hitting you so

        22   it helps your muscles relax.  So when you're stretching and

        23   pulling, it's actually good for you.  And the shower head is

        24   to kind of hit you to the spot.  And the hotter it is, like,

        25   it's easier to, like, relax.

                                                                       51


         1        Q    And how often do you do that?

         2        A    Every time I shower.

         3        Q    So every day?

         4        A    Daily.  Yes, ma'am.

         5        Q    So can you describe your current condition related

         6   to your injuries from the accident?

         7        A    So these two last years have been anything but

         8   easy, considering I do have three kids.  I have a household

         9   to run, and I have a full-time job.  It affects my every

        10   day, absolutely every day.  From home point, I can't do as

        11   much as I could.  I can't clean.  Where I come from, we do a

        12   lot of dough, a lot of dough making.  So I bake

        13   bread basically -- well, I should say I used to bake bread

        14   every day.  But I can't do that anymore because it requires

        15   so much of, you know, making the dough.

        16        Q    Using your arm?

        17        A    And I am a righty, so I do everything with my

        18   right hand.  I can't even brush with my left hand.

        19             Cleaning.  I have hardwood floors inside the

        20   house.  Mopping, vacuuming, all of that is an issue.

        21   Literally providing for my children is an issue.  I can't

        22   even bring the groceries from the car because as little as a

        23   gallon of milk might seem, it's an issue carrying it in my

        24   right arm.  If I grab it from my left, I have no issues

        25   whatsoever.  But my brain doesn't always think.  I always

                                                                       52


         1   reach out for the right from everything.  I use my sons a

         2   lot to take care of that part.

         3        Q    Now, is there anything -- so I understand these

         4   are things that you still do, but they're very difficult?

         5        A    Yes, ma'am.

         6        Q    Is there anything you used to do on a regular

         7   basis that you just can't do at all because of your injuries

         8   from the accident?

         9        A    I can still do a little bit, which is my

        10   gardening, but not as I used to.  I just kind of let go of

        11   that.

        12        Q    Okay.  And I'm going to get into more details

        13   about those restrictions you have, but is there any activity

        14   that you don't do at all?

        15        A    Not at all?

        16        Q    Right.

        17        A    No.

        18        Q    So the things that -- you said you have difficulty

        19   cleaning, vacuuming, and mopping?

        20        A    And wiping and cleaning the bathrooms.

        21        Q    So these are all things that you do, but you have

        22   trouble doing it?

        23        A    Yes, ma'am.

        24        Q    Okay.  And the trouble is what exactly?

        25        A    So anytime I do anything like that, it's worse.

                                                                       53


         1   My pain with my shoulder, it's continuous.  It doesn't stop.

         2   But the more I stretch myself to do things, the worse it

         3   gets.  So I try not to really do much unless I really have

         4   to.  If I have to clean the floors, then I have to clean the

         5   floors, but I don't clean it as I used to.  I don't know if

         6   I explained myself correctly.  I do what I have to do, not

         7   what I want to do.

         8        Q    All right.  So you did more cleaning before?

         9        A    I have.  I have.

        10        Q    And now do you have anyone that helps you do it?

        11        A    No.

        12        Q    And can you tell me specifically where the pain

        13   is?

        14        A    Right here.  This is the pain in this whole

        15   shoulder area where I'm touching.

        16        Q    So the back of your shoulder?

        17        A    Yes.  And this whole area here.  It's always in

        18   pain, always, always, especially this part right here that

        19   I'm grabbing.

        20        Q    So between -- just so I can get it for the record,

        21   so between your neck area and your right shoulder on the top

        22   part?

        23        A    Yes.

        24        Q    And the back?

        25        A    And the back of my shoulder, yes.

                                                                       54


         1        Q    On your upper shoulder blade area?

         2        A    Correct.  This area right here that I'm holing.

         3        Q    Now, is this like a sharp pain or a dull pain?

         4   How would you describe it?

         5        A    This is a stiff pain that's kind of -- that's

         6   almost like something's pressing and just grabbed you and

         7   stays there.  It doesn't go anywhere.  There's better days,

         8   yes, but there's much worse days.

         9        Q    Is it like a knot?

        10        A    It is.  It is grabbed and stays there.  Like, I

        11   don't know if I'm explaining myself correctly.  It seems

        12   like somebody grabbed and just, like, holds type of pain.

        13        Q    Now, is this something that comes and goes?

        14        A    This doesn't come and go.  This is always there,

        15   but then there is days that are better than others.

        16        Q    And this has been since the accident?

        17        A    This has been since the accident, ma'am.

        18        Q    Did you ever have anything like this before the

        19   accident?

        20        A    No.  Not with the shoulder, no.

        21        Q    So just to be clear, so before this accident, did

        22   you ever have an injury or an accident or injury involving

        23   your shoulder?

        24        A    No, ma'am.

        25        Q    And before this accident, did you ever have an

                                                                       55


         1   accident or injury involving your neck?

         2        A    No, ma'am.

         3        Q    And before this accident, did you ever have an

         4   accident or injury involving your back?

         5        A    No, ma'am.

         6        Q    Okay.  And since this accident, have you reinjured

         7   your neck, your back, or your right shoulder?

         8        A    No, ma'am.

         9        Q    So, now, other than this pain that you were

        10   describing in your shoulder/neck area, are there any other

        11   pain that you're still having related to the accident?

        12        A    No, ma'am.  No, ma'am.  I had the headaches.  I

        13   had the back pain.  I had those issues.  Those are gone.

        14   This is my issue.  This is my constant issue, which is this

        15   part right here and this part right here.

        16             I mean, Dr. Rubin -- at the time of the treatment,

        17   he had me try something different.  He had me take the

        18   biggest towel I have in my house and you keep folding it,

        19   keep folding it, till you're done.  And then you keep

        20   folding it this way so you kind of make a block.  You tape

        21   it up, and that's what you try sleeping on.  He was wrong.

        22   That didn't help.

        23             I thought if I buy more expensive, better

        24   mattresses, that's going to help.  It has not helped.

        25        Q    Did you get a new mattress?

                                                                       56


         1        A    I have.  I got new pillows.  I got Tempur-Pedic

         2   pillows.  I got Tempur-Pedic mattresses.  It doesn't help.

         3   We're almost two years into this, and I sleep like a crazy

         4   person.  I -- I'm sorry.  I just have to say it.  I sleep

         5   literally on my chest next to my -- and that's my side.

         6   Nobody can sleep on that side.  I have my nightstand, which

         7   is right here.  This is my bed.  This is my nightstand.  I

         8   put a pillow over from the bed to the nightstand, and that's

         9   how I sleep.  I cannot sleep on my back, nor I can find a

        10   way to sleep.  I bought body pillows.  I mean, I bought

        11   every pillow out there; but I haven't figured it out yet.

        12        Q    I take it this is a different way of sleeping than

        13   you did before the accident?

        14        A    Yes, ma'am.  I used to sleep on my back.  I'm a

        15   back sleeper.  That doesn't happen anymore.  Now I literally

        16   sleep on my chest, my stomach.

        17        Q    Okay.  When did you get the new mattress?

        18        A    So the accident happened in -- so the following

        19   year.  The following year.

        20        Q    Do you remember when and where?

        21        A    My birthday, February 12th.

        22        Q    Okay.  Was it a birthday present?

        23        A    That was a birthday present.  I have family -- my

        24   husband's family usually asks each other what would you like

        25   for birthdays, pretty much what do you need.  I said all of

                                                                       57


         1   you put your money together and then we'll pay the rest to

         2   buy the mattress and that's exactly what happened.

         3        Q    That's a good family.  I don't get stuff like

         4   that.

         5        A    You know, whatever you want to give me, instead of

         6   getting me a perfume, just give me money to help pay for

         7   this.  And that's exactly what happened.

         8        Q    So that was in --

         9        A    In 2018, February.

        10        Q    In 2018?

        11        A    Yes, ma'am.

        12        Q    The bed didn't make any difference at all?

        13        A    No.  Absolutely.  It helps all the difference to

        14   my husband, but not to me.  And I even got the softer --

        15   because you can get a firmer and, like, a softer side and I

        16   got a softer side.  No.  It's a lot of money, though.

        17        Q    And baking?  You said it's been affecting how you

        18   work with the dough; correct?

        19        A    Yes, ma'am.

        20        Q    And how often were you baking before the accident?

        21        A    Daily.  I cook every day for my family.  That's

        22   how I was raised.

        23        Q    Okay.

        24        A    Do I cook all the stuff I used to do with the

        25   dough?  No, because it requires much more strength and

                                                                       58


         1   requires to go through that dough making.  You have to -- in

         2   order to make the bread or any type of, like, Bosnia thing,

         3   because we do a lot with dough, a lot with fillings, you

         4   have to get it to the certain consistency.  So if you don't

         5   really work your dough, the taste is different, like if you

         6   don't really put your hands in it, if I'm saying correctly.

         7        Q    Yeah.

         8        A    Now my mother-in-law does the bread.  I don't

         9   touch that just because it's so much strength and working

        10   it.

        11        Q    And these questions, I'm trying to get an idea how

        12   your life has changed and how the activities have changed.

        13             So is baking something you still do, but you don't

        14   do it as much?

        15        A    Yes, ma'am.

        16        Q    And can you tell me, like, has it changed what

        17   you've made or how has it changed?

        18        A    Yes.  It changed in what I used to make.  I mean,

        19   I -- my husband and I used to entertain a lot.  So I would

        20   cook for a couple of couples, you know, when they come for

        21   dinner, so a lot of dough, a lot of potatoes, a lot of

        22   peeling, a lot of cutting.  All of that is hard.  It's hard

        23   to even cut, like, drumsticks.  You know how they come?

        24   Like, you have the drumstick, and then you have the other

        25   part?  I used to do that with no issues.  Now I have my

                                                                       59


         1   husband cut them, like separate it by the bone, because,

         2   like, pressing on that with the knife is just hard.  It

         3   really is.

         4             Even, like, washing dishes.  Unfortunately, I

         5   don't have a dishwasher yet.  It will happen one day.  But,

         6   like, washing dishes, it becomes so stiff and becomes so

         7   uncomfortable that sometimes I just leave the dishes for the

         8   next day.  I just don't feel my -- don't see myself doing it

         9   because, like, it becomes so much.

        10        Q    Okay.  And the grocery shopping you still do?

        11        A    I do.

        12        Q    You were telling us it's difficult lifting gallons

        13   of milk and stuff like that?

        14        A    Yes, ma'am.  I have my army.  I have my two sons

        15   that I make bring everything in and, you know, stock

        16   everything.  This goes here.  You put this here.  You put

        17   this here.  I take care of the frozen stuff, put it in the

        18   fridge and stuff like that.  But, I mean, bringing the

        19   groceries in, that's their new job.

        20        Q    Okay.  And gardening you said?

        21        A    Now, that is my very, very nice love that I have.

        22   I love roses.  I love outdoors.  So the house we bought, it

        23   has a lot of -- like, it has enough portion of land.  Right?

        24   So I bought so many rose -- I had so many rose bushes that

        25   I'm the one taking care of.  We have a raised garden that I

                                                                       60


         1   had all the vegetables in it.  Now I really just have, like,

         2   the scallions and tomatoes and peppers because those you

         3   really don't have to do much work.  You put them, plant

         4   them, they start growing, you water them, and that's it.  I

         5   can't really do so much.  That takes time and --

         6        Q    So what don't you have now?

         7        A    I don't have majority.  I don't have -- I did

         8   potatoes.  I don't do potatoes no more because those require

         9   you to do more with them.  I don't do corn because it's,

        10   like, so much harder, like, when you're cleaning it up,

        11   like, to take everything out because their roots grow so

        12   much down.  So the scallions are so much easier.  You just

        13   put them in, water them, and they grow.  And I do tomatoes

        14   and I do peppers.  I still do that, yes.

        15        Q    But you used to do potatoes and corn?

        16        A    I used to do everything.  Correct.

        17        Q    And you don't do that anymore?

        18        A    Mm-hmm.

        19        Q    And the roses?  Do you still have the roses?

        20        A    Majority of them has been dying because I -- it

        21   takes so much work.  You know, it just looks like a bush,

        22   but it takes a lot of work trimming it down, making sure

        23   that you have the correct plant food for them.  Like, when

        24   autumn comes, you need to protect them for the next year.  I

        25   just -- it's so much harder to do that because it takes time

                                                                       61


         1   and it takes strength to be doing that.  And I kind of

         2   pretty much not gave up on it but all -- it's still there,

         3   but not as much.

         4        Q    Okay.  So you've given me a lot of examples.  Is

         5   there anything else that you think has been affected by your

         6   injuries from the accident?

         7        A    No.  Basically, my every day is affected, to be

         8   honest with you, from providing for my family to a job that

         9   I literally had to switch because I couldn't perform as much

        10   as I used to.

        11        Q    Have you had to pay anyone to help you?

        12        A    I don't make enough money like that.

        13        Q    In the records I have, you last went to Dr. Rubin

        14   in March of 2018, last year.

        15        A    Yes, ma'am.

        16        Q    Have you had any medical treatment within the last

        17   year related to the accident?

        18        A    Not -- like I said before, I have not been under

        19   any physician's care, but I have been getting massages.  I

        20   have been doing at home stretching and using two times a

        21   week my electrical current machine that they gave me, but

        22   not to any doctors.

        23        Q    Okay.  And how often do you get massages?

        24        A    Usually, once a month.

        25        Q    And how much is it to get a massage?

                                                                       62


         1        A    Well, if I get it from the Groupon, it's like $30,

         2   $40.  If you don't get it from the Groupon, then it's $100

         3   usually for an hour.

         4        Q    For an hour?

         5        A    Yes.  It's 60 minutes usually everywhere you go.

         6        Q    Is that usually what you get?

         7        A    I try to get it off Groupon, to be honest; but if

         8   I don't find it on Groupon, then, you know, I pay the $100

         9   and get it over with because I feel -- you know, them just

        10   working that area out, like, I feel it has helped me.

        11        Q    Does it alleviate it?

        12        A    That alleviates definitely.  It makes it feel

        13   better for me.  And then that's why I'm getting it monthly,

        14   because I feel like I feel different after being worked in

        15   that specific spot.  It alleviates it.  It doesn't take it

        16   away, but it definitely helps.

        17        Q    All right.  Are you taking any medication?

        18        A    Prescriptions, no.  Aleve, all the time.

        19        Q    How often?

        20        A    So I get up in the morning.  I'm from eastern

        21   Europe, so we make our coffee different.  We really don't

        22   use Keurig.

        23                  MR. ABELS:  Off the record.

        24                  (Whereupon, a discussion was held off the

        25   record.)

                                                                       63


         1                  THE WITNESS:  So, basically, we use Turkish

         2   coffee, which is ground beans.  So you boil your pot of

         3   coffee.  Then you take two scoops of the grounds and then

         4   you pour it with, like, the hot coffee and that's how you

         5   drink it.  It's stronger coffee.

         6                  But I get up in the morning.  I'm putting my

         7   water on my stove.  I'm taking my two Aleve.  That's, like,

         8   my -- no missed days.  That's every morning.  Coming from

         9   work, you take two more.

        10   BY MS. FRARE:

        11        Q    So you're taking four a day?

        12        A    Every day.  Sometimes when it's really bad, like,

        13   I take four at a time.  But usually it's two in the

        14   mornings, two at nights.

        15        Q    And this has been since the accident?

        16        A    Yes, ma'am.

        17        Q    I don't think I asked you.  At the time of the

        18   accident, within 24 hours, had you taken any medication?

        19        A    When the Kathy's gave me the ibuprofen.

        20        Q    Like, before the accident occurred, the day --

        21   within the day of the accident, was there any type of

        22   medication that you were taking?

        23        A    Not that I know.  I'm not on any medication.

        24        Q    Okay.  Did any doctors give you any prescriptions

        25   other than at Kathy's originally?

                                                                       64


         1        A    Dr. Rubin did later.

         2        Q    And what did Dr. Rubin give you?

         3        A    It was a pain medication.  I don't recall what it

         4   was.  It started with "M," but it didn't really alleviate.

         5   It didn't help me.  So I just keep taking my Aleve.

         6        Q    How long a period of time did you try this

         7   medication?

         8        A    For a month.  And I still had Aleve in between.

         9        Q    Did they give you any type of, like, support

        10   device, a back brace or neck brace or anything like that?

        11        A    No.  I didn't get anything like that.

        12                  MS. FRARE:  All right.  I think I'm getting

        13   through this.  Let me just check my cheat sheet here.  Even

        14   when I check this, there's always something.

        15                  MR. ABELS:  Of course.

        16                  THE WITNESS:  Would you mind if I just took

        17   a break to let my boss know how much longer?

        18                  MS. FRARE:  Absolutely.

        19                  (Whereupon, a discussion was held off the

        20   record.)

        21   BY MS. FRARE:

        22        Q    Have you had any out-of-pocket expenses related to

        23   the accident?

        24        A    Just for my massages and my Aleve.  Besides that,

        25   no.

                                                                       65


         1        Q    And have you ever been convicted of a crime?

         2        A    Oh, no, ma'am.

         3                  MS. FRARE:  I have to ask this question.

         4   Okay.  I think I am done.

         5                  MR. ABELS:  I don't have any either.  I

         6   think we're all good.

         7                  MS. FRARE:  Thank you.

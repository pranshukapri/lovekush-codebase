                 1                       STIPULATION

                 2            IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED by and

                 3  between counsel and the deponent that the

                 4  examination, reading and signature by the deponent

                 5  to the above and foregoing deposition is expressly

                 6  waived.

                 8            (The deposition commenced at 1:32 p.m.)

                 9                      LaRON GREEN,

                10  the witness, being first duly sworn, testified under

                11  oath as follows:

                12                       EXAMINATION

                13  BY MR. HUFFT:

                14       Q.   Can you do me a favor and state your name

                15  for the record?

                16       A.   My name is LaRon Green.

                17       Q.   LaRon?

                18       A.   LaRon.

                19       Q.   Did I misspell it?

                20       A.   It's L-a capital R-o-n, Green like the

                21  color.

                22       Q.   What we're doing today is taking your

                23  deposition, and by that I mean we have a court

                24  reporter who has sworn you in, and she's going to

                25  take down on her machine every word you say and


                                                                       4





                 1  every word I say, all right?

                 2       A.   Okay.

                 3       Q.   And in order to make it easy for her, I'll

                 4  try not speaking when you're speaking if you'll try

                 5  not speaking when I'm speaking.  That way she

                 6  doesn't have to do two conversations at once.

                 7       A.   Confirmed.

                 8       Q.   And also, nodding your head -- which

                 9  everyone does -- yes or no, that means she's got to

                10  interpret what we're doing, so if we just articulate

                11  yes or no as opposed to nodding the head.

                12       A.   Confirmed.

                13       Q.   The other thing is what I'm trying to do

                14  is get a record here that when I ask you a question,

                15  I get an answer, I want to make sure that the answer

                16  is -- you were answering my question.  So basically

                17  if I ask you a stupid question or one that doesn't

                18  make sense to you, just tell me that; we'll get a

                19  new question.

                20       A.   Okay.

                21       Q.   Okay.  So I've asked you to come here

                22  today because you've been identified as a witness by

                23  Victor Franklin to what he says was an injury, okay?

                24       A.   Okay.

                25       Q.   All right.  Mr. Franklin said that he was


                                                                       5





                 1  at a bar with you and a gentleman named Michael

                 2  Franklin and a gentleman from Africa.  He didn't

                 3  know the name of him.  Do you recall -- and this

                 4  would have happened in 2013.  Do you recall being at

                 5  a bar with those three other gentlemen?

                 6       A.   That sounds -- like I said before, it's

                 7  been several years, and thinking of this after you

                 8  guys contacted me, I can only recall it being my

                 9  cousin Mikey Franklin from LA and his cousin who I

                10  thought was of African descent, or I knew it was

                11  somebody that had some vague accident.

                12            Now, you're saying that there was a third

                13  person that was there.  Oh man, like I said, my

                14  recollection of this is very fuzzy --

                15       Q.   Okay.

                16       A.   -- very fuzzy.

                17       Q.   Let me ask you this:  Do you know Victor

                18  Franklin?

                19       A.   No.  I know my cousin Mikey Franklin.

                20       Q.   All right.  So when you say you don't --

                21  let's just kind of work it this way:  Victor

                22  Franklin, you say you don't know him?

                23       A.   Can I explain the situation?

                24       Q.   Sure.

                25       A.   My cousin Mikey Franklin, he lives in LA,


                                                                       6





                 1  and I see him rarely, maybe once every three or four

                 2  years.  And this trip he said, "Hey, cuz, let's hang

                 3  out and meet up."  He called me, and I said, "Okay,

                 4  I have a client that's playing down at the Czar Bar,

                 5  and we can go, kill two birds with one stone.  I can

                 6  go support my client, listen to them play music, and

                 7  we can visit at the same time."

                 8            He said, "Fine."

                 9            I picked him up.  I picked Michael

                10  Franklin up in my vehicle, and he said that his

                11  cousin was going to meet us down there; so we pulled

                12  up to the Czar Bar, and I remember a gentleman of, I

                13  believe, indigenous African descent whom I thought

                14  to this point was his cousin, showed up.  And I

                15  could be totally mistaken on the fourth person.  I

                16  just don't have a clear memory of that, but now that

                17  you guys say that, it's a definite possibility.

                18       Q.   Let's put it this way:  Do you feel

                19  comfortable that Mikey Franklin and an indigenous

                20  African person were there?

                21       A.   There, yes.

                22       Q.   And if there was a fourth person, you're

                23  not clear about that?

                24       A.   I'm not 100 percent clear about that, but

                25  now that you guys say that, that could have been the


                                                                       7





                 1  case.

                 2       Q.   Okay.

                 3       A.   My cousin Mikey Franklin in LA would be

                 4  the universal person would know who would have known

                 5  everybody that was there.

                 6       Q.   You said you had a client, and for the

                 7  record, if the jury wants to know, you're a hair

                 8  stylist?

                 9       A.   I am a hair stylist.

                10       Q.   So your client would be someone whose hair

                11  you style their hair for?

                12       A.   Yes.

                13       Q.   And this client, do you recall their name?

                14       A.   Yes.

                15       Q.   What is the name?

                16       A.   Her name is Vicky Harris.

                17       Q.   Vicky Harris?

                18       A.   Yes.

                19       Q.   And she was the musician or is the

                20  musician?

                21       A.   No.  Her husband is a musician, and he was

                22  playing down at the Czar Bar.

                23       Q.   And the husband, do you know the husband's

                24  name?

                25       A.   Yes.


                                                                       8





                 1       Q.   What is his name?

                 2       A.   Charlie Harris.

                 3       Q.   Was he a solo performer?

                 4       A.   No.  He was playing with a few other

                 5  gentlemen, two other gentlemen maybe.

                 6       Q.   Okay.  Were they playing when you were

                 7  there?

                 8       A.   They were playing.

                 9       Q.   What time did you get there?

                10       A.   I don't know the time.

                11       Q.   When you got there, was the band already

                12  playing?  I say "band," Charlie Harris and two other

                13  gentlemen?

                14       A.   I believe so.

                15       Q.   What sort of music were they playing?

                16       A.   Jazz infusion.

                17       Q.   And what is their instruments they were

                18  playing?

                19       A.   Well, I know Charlie plays the bass

                20  guitar.  The other gentlemen, I'm not for sure of

                21  their instruments.

                22       Q.   And so have you ever been to this bar

                23  before?

                24       A.   No.

                25       Q.   Can you tell me where it's located?  Do


                                                                       9





                 1  you recall where it's located?

                 2       A.   Vaguely.  Main Street downtown.  I guess

                 3  it would be in the area of around 15th and Main

                 4  would be my guess.

                 5       Q.   And can you describe the bar?  Was it in a

                 6  standalone building or --

                 7       A.   No.  It was inside of a -- it was not in a

                 8  standalone building that I can recall.  It was in a

                 9  storefront.  It appeared to kind have been a shotgun

                10  setup, a straight front-to-back setup.  The stage

                11  area where the musicians were performing were at the

                12  four opposite ends of the establishment, and where

                13  we were sitting was very close to the front door.

                14       Q.   Okay.  And "we" would be?

                15       A.   Mikey Franklin and the other gentleman.

                16       Q.   And maybe a fourth person?

                17       A.   Maybe a fourth person.

                18       Q.   Okay.  How long -- did you stay there for

                19  the entire performance?

                20       A.   No.

                21       Q.   Okay.

                22       A.   I don't remember exactly how long I was

                23  there.

                24       Q.   Did you leave with Mikey, or did you leave

                25  by yourself?


                                                                       10





                 1       A.   Yeah, I left with Mikey Franklin.

                 2       Q.   Okay.  And the performance may have been

                 3  ended; it may still have been still going on?  You

                 4  don't recall?

                 5       A.   I don't recall.  I recall them maybe

                 6  finishing up a set when we walked in, and then

                 7  through the intermission, I went over to the front

                 8  area, greeted them, and then went back to the

                 9  seating area.

                10       Q.   Okay.  Now, if they were a -- you say a

                11  shotgun.

                12       A.   They were at the far end.

                13       Q.   The far end and you were at the front of

                14  the bar?

                15       A.   Right, yeah, the opposite.

                16       Q.   And was there any people in between the

                17  bandstand and where you were sitting?

                18       A.   There were seats in the sitting area in

                19  between.  I don't know who or how many people were

                20  sitting in between us.  I can guess and say maybe a

                21  handful, less than 10 people.

                22       Q.   Okay.

                23       A.   But I'm not for sure.

                24       Q.   And they were sitting at booths and

                25  tables?  Do you recall what they were --


                                                                       11





                 1       A.   I believe it would be cabaret style from

                 2  my recollection of the layout.

                 3       Q.   And what would that be?

                 4       A.   That would be table top with maybe three

                 5  to four chairs surrounding.

                 6       Q.   Okay.  And did you notice anything about

                 7  the chairs they were sitting in?

                 8       A.   No.

                 9       Q.   Did you notice anything about -- were you

                10  sitting in a chair, or were you sitting in a booth?

                11       A.   I was sitting in a chair.

                12       Q.   Do you recall anything about that chair?

                13       A.   No.

                14       Q.   Okay.  So at some point you and Mikey

                15  Franklin got up and left.  How about the indigenous

                16  African?

                17       A.   I don't know exactly.  We all probably

                18  left around the same time since we all commonly were

                19  there visiting my cousin Mikey Franklin.

                20       Q.   Okay.  So the indigenous person didn't

                21  come with you, but he may have left with you?

                22       A.   No.  Well, he did not come with us.  He

                23  showed up at the same -- we all walked through the

                24  front door together.

                25       Q.   Okay.  And when you left, for sure Mikey


                                                                       12





                 1  Franklin left with you because you drove --

                 2       A.   I was his ride.

                 3       Q.   And then when you left, did you give him a

                 4  ride somewhere else?

                 5       A.   If I did, I don't remember exactly where

                 6  we went afterwards.  Maybe dropped him off over at

                 7  his family's house.

                 8       Q.   Do you recall where you went ultimately

                 9  that night?

                10       A.   No, I don't.

                11       Q.   All right.  So you have a rough estimate

                12  of how long you may have been at the bar that night?

                13       A.   A rough estimate would be an hour.

                14       Q.   Okay.  And is Charlie Harris still -- is

                15  he still in Kansas City?

                16       A.   Yes.

                17       Q.   Do you know how to get ahold of him?

                18       A.   I can attempt to get ahold of him.  I

                19  don't know for sure, but I can make an attempt to

                20  get ahold of him.

                21       Q.   How about Vicky Harris, the same thing?

                22       A.   Yes, I can make an attempt.

                23       Q.   All right.  So while you were there, you

                24  have never -- was there a name for this band?  Do

                25  you recall that?


                                                                       13





                 1       A.   Chilliott.

                 2       Q.   Chilliott?

                 3       A.   I don't know how to spell it.

                 4       Q.   Chilliott?

                 5       A.   Yes.

                 6       Q.   Okay.  And then infusion jazz being what?

                 7  How do you define "infusion jazz"?

                 8       A.   Kind of a modern jazz.

                 9       Q.   Not discordic or dysphonic.  It's more of

                10  a smooth jazz?

                11       A.   I would say on the smooth -- I don't know

                12  how to describe it, I'm sorry.

                13       Q.   Okay.  But a three-person group?

                14       A.   From my recollection, yes.

                15       Q.   Okay.  And during the time you were there,

                16  were you guys having any drinks or anything?

                17       A.   I may have had a beer.

                18       Q.   And do you recall if anyone else drank?

                19       A.   No, I don't.

                20       Q.   Okay.  So the period of time you were

                21  there, you first got there and you went up front and

                22  said hi to your -- to Charlie Harris --

                23       A.   What happened, when we first got there --

                24  and I'm not 100 percent clear on the timeline of

                25  events -- but when we first got there, we sat down


                                                                       14





                 1  up front, the band was playing at that time.  I mean

                 2  we sat down in the back of the room because the band

                 3  was playing at that time, and from my recollection

                 4  five minutes after we got there is when the -- I do

                 5  remember a chair collapsing when we first got there.

                 6       Q.   Um-hum.

                 7       A.   It was early on when we got there the

                 8  chair collapsed.

                 9       Q.   Okay.  Tell me about that.

                10       A.   We were just sitting there talking.  We

                11  hadn't ordered any drinks yet.  We had just sat

                12  down, and the chair, I believe, collapsed, within

                13  like the first five minutes of us being there.

                14       Q.   What chair collapsed?

                15       A.   It would have been to the left of me.

                16       Q.   And who was sitting in that chair?

                17       A.   I believe it was Victor -- Mikey

                18  Franklin's cousin.

                19       Q.   Okay.  I thought you didn't know if there

                20  was a third or a fourth person there?

                21       A.   I was recollecting -- I was under the

                22  influence that the gentleman who may have been

                23  indigenous African, because of his accent, was

                24  Mikey's cousin; but like I said, this has been six

                25  years ago plus to me.  It was not an event that I'm


                                                                       15





                 1  very clear on; so let me be clear with that.

                 2       Q.   And I appreciate that.  This lawsuit was

                 3  just filed, you know, last year; so we're trying to

                 4  find some facts now.

                 5            So let's go back.  You recall a chair

                 6  collapsing?

                 7       A.   Yes.

                 8       Q.   You recall a person who was in that chair

                 9  when it collapsed?

                10       A.   Correct.

                11       Q.   Do you know who that person --

                12       A.   That person was a cousin of my cousin

                13  Mikey Franklin.

                14       Q.   Okay.  Can you describe him?

                15       A.   No.  I could not pick him out of a lineup,

                16  nor the indigenous African person, I wouldn't be

                17  able to pick him out of a lineup either.

                18       Q.   When you say the chair collapsed, did you

                19  see it collapse?

                20       A.   Yes.

                21       Q.   What did you see?

                22       A.   I seen someone sitting next to me, and the

                23  next thing you know they are on the floor.

                24       Q.   Okay.  And did you get up and do anything?

                25       A.   I didn't think anything of it when it


                                                                       16





                 1  happened, you know.  It -- if my chair would have

                 2  collapsed, I would have just got back up and got in

                 3  the next chair.  No problem at all.  It wasn't a

                 4  great distance of a fall, and he seemed to be an

                 5  able-bodied young man.  So it's not like it was an

                 6  elderly woman who fell.

                 7       Q.   When you say the chair collapsed, did you

                 8  examine the chair?

                 9       A.   No.

                10       Q.   So did you see the chair itself collapse,

                11  or did you see a person go to the ground?

                12       A.   I saw a person go to the ground.

                13       Q.   Did you see anyone examine the chair?

                14       A.   No, not that I'm aware of.

                15       Q.   Did you talk to anyone while you were

                16  there about this person that was on the ground?

                17       A.   No.

                18       Q.   Okay.  And you didn't examine the chair?

                19       A.   No.

                20       Q.   Did you see anyone examine the chair?

                21       A.   Not that I paid any attention to.

                22       Q.   Did you see anyone remove the chair?

                23       A.   I'm sure someone came from the bar area

                24  and I believe brung over another chair and possibly,

                25  most likely, removed that chair.


                                                                       17





                 1       Q.   Okay.  When you say "most likely," you're

                 2  assuming that happened or do you recall that

                 3  happening?

                 4       A.   Well, I'm recalling us continuing to sit

                 5  there and enjoy the evening and not being encumbered

                 6  by a broken chair in our way.

                 7       Q.   Okay.  You keep saying "broken chair."

                 8  You did not observe the chair to be broken; you just

                 9  observed a person falling to the ground?

                10       A.   I observed the person falling to the

                11  ground.

                12       Q.   Okay.

                13       A.   I did not physically go over and inspect

                14  the chair, but I'm pretty sure that that chair was

                15  broken.

                16       Q.   Okay.

                17       A.   How it broke?  I don't know.

                18       Q.   When you say "pretty sure it was broken"

                19  that's based upon --

                20       A.   I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm assuming

                21  that that chair was inoperable from that point

                22  forward from the manner of it disappeared out of my

                23  vision --

                24       Q.   Okay.

                25       A.   -- to where you were not able to see a


                                                                       18





                 1  chair anymore.

                 2       Q.   But I guess -- because all this ends up

                 3  being something that people want to hear -- what

                 4  happened to cause the gentleman to go to the ground

                 5  is based upon you assume happened, not based upon

                 6  your examining the chair to see if it actually

                 7  collapsed or not; is that true?

                 8       A.   Could you please rephrase that for me?

                 9       Q.   Okay.  A person that was sitting in the

                10  chair fell to the ground.  You made an assumption

                11  that the chair collapsed which caused him to fall to

                12  the ground; is that true?

                13       A.   Yes, that assumption is true because I did

                14  not see him making any awkward motions or leaning

                15  forward or back in the chair.

                16       Q.   Okay.  And after he fell to the ground,

                17  you didn't examine the chair nor look at the chair

                18  to determine if the chair, in fact, had fallen or

                19  had broken?

                20       A.   I did not lift up and physically examine

                21  the chair, but from the state that the chair was no

                22  longer in my site of vision, the chair most likely

                23  was damaged beyond anyone else sitting back in the

                24  chair.

                25       Q.   And that's because the table was on the


                                                                       19





                 1  ground?

                 2       A.   Correct.

                 3       Q.   But you didn't see it on the ground?

                 4       A.   The chair?

                 5       Q.   Right.

                 6       A.   He was sitting next to me.  I'm sure I

                 7  looked at the chair and seen it out of my field of

                 8  vision.  As to how it broke or why it broke,

                 9  honestly, I don't know.

                10       Q.   I understand.  And again, you're assuming

                11  it broke.  I guess that's what I'm trying to get to.

                12  I want to make sure that -- if you say it broke, I

                13  want to know how it broke, what you saw, all of that

                14  stuff; and if you don't recall any of this, then

                15  that's where we are.

                16       A.   Correct, I don't recall how it broke or

                17  what condition the chair was in after the incident

                18  happened.

                19       Q.   Okay.  All you can say, in fact, a person

                20  fell to the ground, and your assumption is the chair

                21  broke which caused him to fall to the ground?

                22       A.   Correct.

                23       Q.   This person was sitting right next to you?

                24       A.   Correct.

                25       Q.   So the chair -- someone moved the chair,


                                                                       20





                 1  removed that chair, and another chair was brought up

                 2  for this gentleman to sit in?

                 3       A.   Correct.

                 4       Q.   And this gentleman -- you're comfortable

                 5  this gentleman is a cousin of Mikey Franklin, but

                 6  you don't recall his name?

                 7       A.   Correct.

                 8       Q.   After this happened, was there any other

                 9  incidences?

                10       A.   No.

                11       Q.   Did you have a conversation with this

                12  person who was sitting in the chair about what

                13  happened?

                14       A.   Not that I can recollect.

                15       Q.   Do you recall him indicating he had been

                16  hurt or felt like he hurt or acting like he had been

                17  hurt?

                18       A.   Not -- no, not that I can recall.  We

                19  continued to enjoy the rest of the evening.  If

                20  someone in my party was hurt, we would have

                21  immediately sought medical help for it, you know --

                22       Q.   Okay.

                23       A.   -- for that person.

                24       Q.   And when you say for "the rest of the

                25  evening," you know, did you stay until Chilliott


                                                                       21





                 1  completed their performance for the evening?

                 2       A.   I don't know how long their performance

                 3  was.  I know there was an intermission to where I

                 4  got a chance to go up front and say hello to the

                 5  entertainers and listen to them play maybe a few

                 6  more songs.  I don't know if that was the end of

                 7  their set or if we just left at that time.

                 8       Q.   Okay.  And the cousin of Mikey Franklin,

                 9  did you take him home that night?

                10       A.   I don't remember taking him home.

                11       Q.   Now, I called you, I guess, last week or

                12  maybe the week before that to ask you if there was a

                13  date we could do this deposition --

                14       A.   Correct.

                15       Q.   -- and then after that, I spoke to you, I

                16  think, on Friday just to remind you, and then today

                17  you called to get a good address?

                18       A.   Correct.

                19       Q.   Other than that, have you and I had any

                20  conversations about this case?

                21       A.   No.

                22       Q.   Have you had any conversations with Mikey

                23  Franklin about this case?

                24       A.   Not this year.  He called me maybe two --

                25  maybe two or three years ago and said that some


                                                                       22





                 1  attorney may be calling me about a deposition or

                 2  calling me asking questions about the case.

                 3       Q.   Okay.

                 4       A.   And I told him at the time, "I don't

                 5  remember much."

                 6       Q.   Did anyone call you?

                 7       A.   Someone -- a woman did call.  She asked me

                 8  questions over the phone.  What those questions were

                 9  at this point, I don't know.  What law firm she was

                10  representing, I don't know, but I believe she would

                11  have possibly been the attorneys for his cousin

                12  Victor Franklin, I believe.

                13       Q.   And do you recall, was this conversation

                14  recorded?

                15       A.   No that I know of.  I remember that I was

                16  on my cell phone about to go inside of a grocery

                17  store; so it was a short conversation.

                18       Q.   Okay.  So your cousin called you two or

                19  three years ago and said, "An attorney may be

                20  calling you."  You got a phone call from an

                21  attorney, female attorney, and you had a brief call

                22  on the cell phone?

                23       A.   Yeah, I'm assuming she was an attorney.

                24       Q.   And is that about it?

                25       A.   Yes.


                                                                       23





                 1       Q.   Okay.  Have you had any other

                 2  conversations about this case?

                 3       A.   None that I can think of now.

                 4       Q.   Okay.  Was there a cover charge that

                 5  night; do you recall?

                 6       A.   I don't recall.

                 7       Q.   Do you recall any of the people that were

                 8  working there or appeared to be working there?

                 9       A.   No.

                10       Q.   Have you had any conversations with --

                11  have you gone to Charlie Harris' performance since

                12  then?

                13       A.   No, I have not been to a Chilliott

                14  performance since then.

                15       Q.   Do you know if they're still a group?

                16       A.   I don't think so.  He probably still does

                17  music, but I don't think they still have a group

                18  because the other gentlemen that were in the group

                19  were not from Kansas City.  They're from other

                20  cities, other states.

                21       Q.   When this person fell, was the band

                22  playing at that time?

                23       A.   I believe so.

                24       Q.   Was there a lot of noise when that

                25  happened?


                                                                       24





                 1       A.   Not to where it would have stopped the

                 2  music or if they would have noticed it up front.

                 3       Q.   Okay.  So basically, a person went to the

                 4  ground, chairs were placed --

                 5       A.   Life went on.

                 6       Q.   Life went on.

                 7            Okay.  All right.  So let me just -- I

                 8  have your address as -- not Belton.  It's Peculiar,

                 9  right?

                10       A.   No.  You have my address as 404 East

                11  Gregory Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri.

                12       Q.   That's your work address, right?

                13       A.   Correct.

                14       Q.   All right.  That's all the questions I

                15  have for now.  This gentleman may have a few.

                16       A.   Okay.

                17                       EXAMINATION

                18  BY MR. BOSLER:

                19       Q.   Mr. Green, do you remember who worked at

                20  the bar saying anything to Victor after he fell?

                21       A.   I don't remember any conversation, no.

                22  I'm not saying that there was not a conversation,

                23  but I can't recall any conversation.

                24       Q.   Anybody that worked at the bar say

                25  anything to Mikey at the time that Victor fell?


                                                                       25





                 1       A.   Possibly there was probably -- with Mikey

                 2  being a comedian, I'm sure he was cracking jokes; so

                 3  if so, he may have made a wisecrack to a staff

                 4  member.  What?  I don't remember or wouldn't know.

                 5       Q.   Do you remember, was the staff people that

                 6  came and replaced the chair, do you remember what

                 7  they looked like?

                 8       A.   No.  Caucasian male but I can't recall --

                 9  I wouldn't be able to pick them out of a lineup.

                10       Q.   This Caucasian male didn't say anything to

                11  you, correct?

                12       A.   Correct.

                13       Q.   Do you remember if that Caucasian male

                14  provided the group any sort of benefit because the

                15  chair fell at the table, meaning, like, "Here's free

                16  drinks"; "Cover charge is free tonight"?  Anything

                17  like that?

                18       A.   I'm not sure.  I don't recall.  I don't --

                19  I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't know.

                20       Q.   Did you talk to Victor later on in the

                21  evening about the chair falling?

                22       A.   Not that I remember.

                23       Q.   Did you say anything to Mikey about the

                24  chair falling later on in the evening?

                25       A.   Again, because he's a comedian, I'm sure


                                                                       26





                 1  he made a quip about it, and maybe we chuckled,

                 2  laughed, or bantered, but no in-depth conversation

                 3  about the chair falling that I can recall.

                 4       Q.   Do you have any knowledge about what

                 5  injuries Victor may have suffered as a result of

                 6  this fall?

                 7       A.   No.

                 8       Q.   Have you talked to any of Victor's doctors

                 9  or health care providers about what injuries he

                10  suffered as a result of this fall?

                11       A.   No.

                12       Q.   And have you spoken to anybody that works

                13  for the Czar Bar about Victor's injuries as a result

                14  of this fall?

                15       A.   No.

                16       Q.   Have you talked to anybody at the Czar Bar

                17  about whether the chair was safe or not?

                18       A.   No.

                19       Q.   Have you talked to anybody at the Czar Bar

                20  about whether they knew the chair was unsafe or not?

                21       A.   No.

                22       Q.   Have you talked to anybody else other than

                23  Mikey and the female attorney about this case?

                24       A.   No, I have not.

                25       Q.   Excuse me, you also spoken to Mr. Hufft


                                                                       27





                 1  about this case, but those three people -- the

                 2  female attorney, Mr. Hufft, and Mikey -- are those

                 3  the only three people you have talked to about this

                 4  case?

                 5       A.   In detail, yes.  I mentioned to my wife

                 6  that I had a deposition today and it's regarding

                 7  something that happened several years ago.

                 8       Q.   But other than that, you haven't spoke to

                 9  anybody else about the specifics of the case?

                10       A.   No, I have not.

                11       Q.   I don't think I have any other questions.

                12  Thank you, Mr. Green.

                13                      REEXAMINATION

                14  BY MR. HUFFT:

                15       Q.   I just want to make sure.  The location of

                16  the bar that you went to that night, you and Mikey

                17  and this indigenous African went to, you said it was

                18  15th and Main or thereabouts?

                19       A.   That's the general recollection that I

                20  would be able to surmise, but I don't know the exact

                21  address at all.

                22       Q.   Do you remember -- and I asked you this

                23  and I meant to follow-up again -- it was not a

                24  standalone building?

                25       A.   It was a storefront.


                                                                       28





                 1       Q.   When you say "a storefront," more than

                 2  one --

                 3       A.   More than one retail opportunity.

                 4       Q.   And do you recall where in this storefront

                 5  the bar was located?

                 6       A.   Lower level, ground -- street level.

                 7       Q.   Okay.  Was there any other establishments

                 8  to either side of it, or was it the only one at that

                 9  lower level?

                10       A.   I don't know.

                11       Q.   Okay.  Have you been there since then?

                12       A.   No.

                13       Q.   Okay.  Have you been -- I mean, have you

                14  ever gone back and looked at this place --

                15       A.   No.

                16       Q.   This place that you say is the Czar Bar,

                17  where do you get that name?

                18       A.   I believe from the name being on the front

                19  of the establishment, and then it's a pretty unique

                20  name, and I'm sure other people have referenced the

                21  Czar Bar as a popular hangout.

                22       Q.   Okay.  So you saw the name Czar Bar on the

                23  front when you were there?

                24       A.   I believe I did.

                25       Q.   All right.  And has anyone else told you


                                                                       29





                 1  that's where you were that night?

                 2       A.   I don't think anybody told me that's where

                 3  I was.  I think maybe that's where they said they

                 4  were playing at that night.

                 5       Q.   So Charlie Harris would have told you,

                 6  "That's where we're playing"?

                 7       A.   If my memory serves my correctly, yes, but

                 8  I'm not 100 percent sure.

                 9       Q.   Okay.  I think that's all the questions I

                10  have.  Now, let me tell you the next part of this

                11  game.  The court reporter is going to type up the

                12  deposition.  It will be in a little booklet form

                13  like this (indicating).  You've got a couple of

                14  choices.  Let me go through them so she knows what

                15  she needs to do.  So she can mail this to you.  And

                16  then you then have an option:  You can read it.

                17  There will be a page at the back for -- like this

                18  (indicating) --

                19       A.   Okay.

                20       Q.   -- where you can make -- if you think

                21  there's something that's been taken down correctly,

                22  you can put your changes there, and then also

                23  there's a place to sign and say that you agree with

                24  the contents, okay?

                25       A.   Okay.


                                                                       30





                 1       Q.   Or you can waive that.  You can assume

                 2  she's going to take it down correctly.  So it's your

                 3  choice what you want to do.

                 4       A.   Okay.  Do I have to make a choice now?

                 5       Q.   Sorry.

                 6       A.   I assume that she's going to do a good job

                 7  taking notes; so no further action on my behalf is

                 8  required.

                 9            THE REPORTER:  Thank you.

                10            Electronic versions again like we did

                11  before?

                12            MR. HUFFT:  Yes.

                13            MR. BOSLER:  Yes.

                14            (The deposition concluded at 2:04 p.m. and

                15  the witness was excused.)

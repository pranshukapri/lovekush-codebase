           12                   MR. MILEWSKI:  Good afternoon.

           13          For the record, my name is Michael

           14          Milewski, and I represent the claimant in

           15          the matter of Sicilia Saimesier versus

           16          Abramson Center for Jewish Life pending

           17          in Workers' Compensation Court before the

           18          honorable Steven Harline.

           19                   We are here today in

           20          Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to take the

           21          trial deposition of the claimant in

           22          connection with the pending petitions for

           23          review of VRO concerning her treatment

           24          with Dr. Neil Anand.  Present today are

           25          myself, Ms. Saimesier, counsel for the

                                                               6



            1          employer, and Louis who is acting as

            2          translator.

            3                   Because this is a trial

            4          deposition, all objections must be placed

            5          on the record with the basis for the same

            6          or be deemed waived.  Ms. Saimesier will

            7          be permitted to answer over any

            8          objections with the judge to rule on such

            9          objections at a later time.  Signing,

           10          sealing, and certification will be deemed

           11          waived.  These terms acceptable, counsel?

           12                   MR. DAVIS:  They are.

           13    BY MR. MILEWSKI:

           14          Q.       Ms. Saimesier, could you please

           15    state your full name and current address,

           16    please.

           17          A.       My name is Sicilia Saimesier.  I

           18    live at 1330 West Spencer Street in

           19    Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19141.

           20          Q.       And were you employed prior to

           21    October 9th of 2018?

           22          A.       I was working with Genesis.  Now

           23    I'm working with Abramson Center, and it's been

           24    ten years.

           25          Q.       Okay.  So you were working for

                                                               7



            1    Abramson prior to October 9th of 2018?

            2          A.       Abramson.

            3          Q.       What was your job with Abramson?

            4          A.       CNA.

            5          Q.       What were your duties as a CNA?

            6          A.       Lift, push.  I did pulling as

            7    well.  Like, you have a device called a sling

            8    that you attach to machines so you can lift the

            9    patient.

           10          Q.       So it involved lifting of

           11    patients?

           12          A.       Some patients you have to get a

           13    second person to help you lift them with both

           14    hands.

           15          Q.       Were you injured on October 9,

           16    2018?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       And how specifically were you

           19    injured?

           20          A.       Was it when I was pushing the

           21    person?

           22          Q.       That's what I'm asking.  How

           23    were you injured on October 9th?

           24          A.       I was using a machine to lift

           25    the person, and I pulled the sling because the

                                                               8



            1    person was very heavy.  She could not bend her

            2    knee so you had to push the machine to help her

            3    move and that's how I hit my shoulder.

            4          Q.       So you injured your shoulder

            5    while lifting a patient?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       Where specifically in your

            8    shoulder?

            9          A.       The right side and my neck.

           10          Q.       Did you continue working after

           11    your injury?

           12          A.       No.  I had another patient to

           13    work with and somebody else came and give me

           14    assistance.

           15          Q.       Were you out of work for any

           16    period of time?

           17          A.       Yes.

           18          Q.       When was that?

           19          A.       After the injury.  I don't

           20    remember exactly the date, but it was, like,

           21    three or four months.

           22          Q.       Then you returned to work?

           23          A.       Yes.  I returned to work, but

           24    since I was in a lot of pain the doctor

           25    restricted me to light-duty.

                                                               9



            1          Q.       Are you still working light-duty

            2    now?

            3          A.       No.  They sent me back to the

            4    floor and they still send me to very hard

            5    places.

            6          Q.       When did you go back to working

            7    in that capacity?

            8          A.       I don't remember exactly, but I

            9    believe it was in the month of May or something

           10    like that.

           11          Q.       Did you receive treatment for

           12    your injuries after October 9th of 2018?

           13          A.       Yes.  And I'm still receiving

           14    treatment now.

           15          Q.       Who have you received treatment

           16    from?

           17          A.       I went to therapy and I was

           18    referred to Dr. Anand.

           19          Q.       Are you seeing anyone else

           20    besides Dr. Anand?

           21          A.       No.  I don't think so.

           22          Q.       Are you also seeing Dr. McNodi?

           23          A.       Yes.

           24          Q.       What treatment is he providing

           25    for you?

                                                               10



            1          A.       The treatment consist of patches

            2    that they put on my arm.  They give me

            3    acupuncture, and they want to give me needles

            4    too.

            5          Q.       Is this Dr. McNodi or Dr. Anand?

            6          A.       Dr. Anand.

            7          Q.       How long have you been treating

            8    with Dr. Anand?

            9          A.       After the therapy sessions that

           10    were referred by my company, then I started

           11    doing therapy with Dr. Anand.

           12          Q.       Do you recall if that --

           13          A.       I went to therapy to see Dr.

           14    Mark and Dr. Mark send me to Dr. Anand.

           15          Q.       What body part is Dr. Anand

           17          A.       My arm, my shoulder.

           18          Q.       And you started telling us

           19    already, what treatment is he giving to you?

           20          A.       He was going to give me

           21    injections.  He was going to do another nerve

           22    treatment, but I don't like the injection

           23    because it didn't help.

           24          Q.       Is he prescribing you any

           25    medications?

            4          Q.       And I believe you also said

            5    earlier that he's giving you acupuncture?

            6          A.       Yes.  Acupuncture.

            7          Q.       Is the acupuncture helpful to

            8    you at all?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       How so?

           11          A.       When he does it, I don't feel a

           12    lot of pain.

           13          Q.       And how long does that relief

           14    last?

           15          A.       A week.

           16          Q.       Does it affect your ability to

           17    function at all?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       Do the medications help you?

           20          A.       Yes.  Some of them.

           21          Q.       How so?

           22          A.       Some of them such as the

           23    tramadol, it keeps me from sleeping.  I cannot

           24    sleep.

           25                   MR. DAVIS:  Did you say it keeps

                                                               12



            1          you from sleeping?

            2                   THE WITNESS:  I feel sleepy, but

            3          I cannot sleep.

            4    BY MR. MILEWSKI:

            5          Q.       Okay.  You said some of the

            6    medications are helpful to you.  In what way

            7    are the medications helpful?

            8          A.       Some of them are useful because

            9    after work I can take them, and I don't feel

           10    the pain and that helps me get some sleep too.

           11          Q.       Do you perform any chores at

           12    your house?

           13          A.       Yes.  Because I don't have any

           14    children and, you know, children here in the

           15    U.S., they don't help at all.  But when I was

           16    first injured, I was not able to do any chores

           17    because I was in pain.

           18          Q.       And are you able to do them now?

           19          A.       Now I can do them a little bit

           20    better.

           21          Q.       Is there any specific ones that

           22    you could not do when you were first injured?

           23          A.       Yes.  I could not even clean

           24    myself.  I could not take a shower.

           25          Q.       Do you believe that you would be

                                                               13



            1    able to do these activities without Dr. Anand's

            2    treatment?

            3          A.       I don't know.

            4          Q.       Are you working currently?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       Do you believe you would be able

            7    to continue to work without Dr. Anand's

            8    treatment?

            9          A.       No.

           10          Q.       Would you like to continue

           11    treating with Dr. Anand?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       How do you feel your pain level

           14    would be without his treatment?

           15          A.       I would say without his

           16    treatment, it would be seven.

           17          Q.       And how is your pain as we sit

           18    here right now with his treatment?

           19          A.       I would say five now.

           20          Q.       Ma'am, I'm handing you a

           21    document.  This is a copy of our contingent fee

           22    agreement.

           23          A.       Uh-uh.

           24          Q.       Do you understand this document

           25    calls for us to represent you in this matter?

            1          A.       Okay.

            2          Q.       Is that your signature there at

            3    the bottom?

            4          A.       Yes.

            5          Q.       This is an Act 109 Affidavit.

            6    Can you please confirm that the information in

            7    paragraphs one through five is correct.

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       And you've indicated in

           10    paragraph 6A that you have no outstanding child

           11    support liens against you, correct?

           12          A.       Yeah.

           13          Q.       Is that your signature there at

           14    the bottom?

           15          A.       Yes.

           16                   MR. MILEWSKI:  Counsel, I'm just

           17          going to move for the admission for those

           13          A.       I have one actually right now.

           14          Q.       What do you mean?  You're

           15    wearing a patch?

            1          Q.       All right.  So Dr. Anand

            2    prescribes all these medications for you in the

            3    beginning of March.  Do you still continue to

            4    take all of those medications or have you

            5    discontinued any of them?

            6          A.       I still take them.

            7          Q.       You still take them all?

            8          A.       Yes.

            9          Q.       Do you still take them at the

           11    today?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       So you haven't increased or

           14    decreased the medication in any way since

           15    March; is that fair?

           16          A.       No.

           17          Q.       No I'm wrong or no I'm correct?

           18          A.       What you said is correct.

           19          Q.       All right.  Now, you were out of

           20    work for several months due to your work

           21    injury; is that true?

           22          A.       Yes.

           23          Q.       Then you were released to go to

           24    work and then you went back to the Abramson

           25    Center working light-duty; is that correct?

                                                               20



            1          A.       But they did not really give me

            2    light-duty.

            3          Q.       When you went back light-duty,

            4    were you working full-time, the same hours as

            5    you had before the work injury?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       All right.  And you continue to

            8    work for Abramson today; is that correct?

            9          A.       Yes.

           10          Q.       You continue to work full-time

           11    for Abramson as of today; is that fair?

           12          A.       Yes.

           13          Q.       And you also said that you were

           14    switched from light-duty to full-duty or the

           15    light-duty was no longer -- strike that.  You

           16    said at some point you started working

           17    full-duty; is that true?

           18          A.       Yes.

           19          Q.       That was roughly May of 2019?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21          Q.       And so you've worked full-duty

           22    May, June, July, and August.  About four months

           23    now; is that correct?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       All right.  When your attorney

                                                               21



            1    was asking you questions, you talked about that

            2    some of the medications were helping you.  I

            3    assume that some of the medications were not

            4    helping you.  Do you remember that?

            5          A.       Yes.

            6          Q.       Which medications are not

            7    helping you in your opinion?

            8          A.       The tramadol.

            9          Q.       The tramadol?

           10          A.       Yes.

           11          Q.       Any other one of them?

           12          A.       No.

           13          Q.       Do you continue to take the

           14    tramadol?

           15          A.       No.

           16          Q.       When was the last time that you

           17    took the tramadol?

           18          A.       The last time I took it twice.

           19    It kept me from sleeping so I told the doctor

           20    the issue and I stopped taking it.

           21          Q.       Do you remember when that was?

           22          A.       I believe July.  I don't know.

           23          Q.       Okay.  July of 2019?

           24          A.       Yes.

           25          Q.       All right.  Has Dr. Anand sent

                                                               22



            1    you to any other doctors?

            2          A.       Sometimes they would refer me to

            3    Bensalem and also to the doctor over in

            4    Frankford.

            5          Q.       Have you seen either of those

            6    doctors in the last three months?

            7          A.       Dr. Anand.

            8          Q.       You said that Dr. Anand sent you

            9    to other doctors; is that true?

           10          A.       They were going to do the same

           11    treatment so I didn't go.

           12          Q.       Okay.  So Dr. Anand referred you

           13    to other doctors, but you declined going.  Is

           14    that your testimony?

           15          A.       I did not decline to go.  I

           16    don't know the place where it's located, and I

           17    cannot go by myself.  If that's the case, you

           18    can always come when the doctor is present to

           19    see the doctor.

           20          Q.       Okay.  The treatment that Dr.

           21    Anand gives you, does it involve -- do you know

           22    what strapping is?

           23          A.       It's not -- what they do for me

           24    is not strapping.  They tape the arm when I go

           25    see him.

                                                               23



            1          Q.       Right.  Do they tape the arm

            2    every time that you go there?

            3          A.       Not every time.

            4          Q.       And does taping of the arm give

            5    you any benefit?

            6          A.       Yes.

            7          Q.       How does it help you?

            8          A.       With pain feels better.  I feel

            9    better.

           10          Q.       Okay.  And as I understand it,

           11    as we sit here today, your pain complaints are

           12    five out of ten.  Is that what you would call

           13    it?

           14          A.       Yes.

           15          Q.       And going back in time, how long

           16    has it been at five out of ten?

           17          A.       Ever since I started taking the

           18    medications and I started wearing the patch.

           19          Q.       So around March of 2019?

           20          A.       Yes.

           21                   MR. DAVIS:  No further

           22          questions.

           23                   MR. MILEWSKI:  Nothing further.

            6    pursuant to notice, at the time and place

            7    indicated; that said deponent was by me duly

            8    sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and

            9    nothing but the truth; that the testimony of

           10    said deponent was correctly recorded in machine

           11    shorthand by me, to the best of my ability, and

           12    thereafter transcribed under my supervision

           13    with computer-aided transcription; that the

           14    deposition is a true and correct record of the

           15    testimony given by the witness; and that I am

           16    neither of counsel nor kin to any party in said

           17    action, nor interested in the outcome thereof.

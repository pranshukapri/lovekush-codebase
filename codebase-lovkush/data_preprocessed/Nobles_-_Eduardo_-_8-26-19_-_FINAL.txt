            2                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Today's date is

            3  August 26, 2019.  The time is 9:09.  We are on the

            4  record beginning the video deposition of Eduardo Robles.

            5                Will counsel please state their appearance

            6  for the record.

            7                MR. GARVIN:  Greg Garvin for the plaintiff

            8  side.

            9                MR. NEWTON:  Frank Newton for the

           11                       EDUARDO ROBLES,

           12  having been first duly sworn, testified through the duly

           13  sworn interpreter as follows:

           14                         EXAMINATION

           15  BY MR. NEWTON:

           16       Q.  Good morning, sir.

           17       A.  Good morning.

           18       Q.  Would you state your complete name for the

           19  record, please.

           20       A.  Eduardo Pedroza Robles -- Robles.

           21       Q.  Could you spell the middle name, please.

           22       A.  P-E-D-R-O-Z-A.

           23       Q.  How old are you, sir?

           24       A.  54.

           25       Q.  Okay.  Mr. Robles, my name is Frank Newton.  I

                                                                       5



            1  represent Kuraray in this deposition and in this lawsuit

            2  that you have brought against Kuraray.  Do you

            3  understand who I am and who I represent?

            4       A.  Yes.  Yes, I do understand, sir.

            5       Q.  Do you understand that I'm on the opposite side

            6  of this lawsuit from you and your attorney here

            7  representing you?

            8       A.  Yes, sir.

            9       Q.  Have you ever given a deposition before?

           10       A.  No.

           11       Q.  Let me cover a few basic ground rules since

           12  this is -- this is your first time to be deposed.  First

           13  of all, it's important you understand that you've been

           14  placed under oath.  This is the same oath you'd be under

           15  if you were testifying in open court.

           16                Do you understand that?

           17       A.  Yes.  I understand.

           18       Q.  It carries with it the same pains and penalties

           19  for perjury as if you were testifying in open court.

           20                Do you understand that?

           21       A.  I do understand.

           22       Q.  Your attorney, Mr. Garvin, may have had a

           23  chance to meet with you before the deposition and

           24  explain to you what to expect.  Let me cover a few

           25  additional ground rules.  First of all --

                                                                       6



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  -- it's important that you give audible

            3  responses like yes, no, I don't know, as opposed to

            4  uh-huh, uh-uh, or shrugging your shoulders or nodding

            5  your head.  Okay?

            6       A.  Yes.  I understand.

            7       Q.  That way we will be able to get your intended

            8  testimony as opposed to me just assuming I know what you

            9  mean or intend to say.  Okay?

           10       A.  That's fine.

           11       Q.  So from time to time, I say, is that a "yes"?

           12  Or is that a "no"?  I'm not being rude.  I'm just making

           13  sure we have your intended testimony on the record.

           14       A.  That's fine.

           15       Q.  Also, if you'll remember to wait until I have

           16  completed my question before you begin your answer, I'll

           17  return the courtesy and wait for you to complete your

           18  answer before I ask another question.  Okay?

           19       A.  That's fine.

           20       Q.  That way we're not talking over each other, and

           21  the court reporter will be able to write down accurately

           22  what your testimony is and what the questions are.

           23       A.  That's fine.

           24       Q.  Also, if there are any questions that I ask you

           25  today that you don't understand or would like to have

                                                                       7



            1  phrased differently or just repeated, you're certainly

            2  free to do so.  Okay?

            3       A.  That's fine.

            4       Q.  And since you have that opportunity, may we

            5  have this understanding that any question you answer you

            6  have understood?  Fair enough?

            7       A.  That's fine.

            8       Q.  Have you ever given deposition or testimony of

            9  any kind in a deposition, hearing, courtroom, tribunal,

           10  anything of that sort before today?

           11       A.  No.

           12       Q.  Have you ever filed suit other than the lawsuit

           13  against Kuraray?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  Tell me about that.

           16       A.  How so?  What do you want me to tell you?  What

           17  happened?

           18       Q.  Right.  Did you file suit against somebody for

           19  something that happened to you?

           20       A.  Yes.  I was -- it was related to an acid burn.

           21       Q.  An acid burn?

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  Okay.  And when did this occur?

           24       A.  Maybe '91, '92.

           25       Q.  Was this an on-the-job accident?

                                                                       8



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  Did you file a Workers' Compensation claim for

            3  that?

            4       A.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.

            5       Q.  When you say you filed suit, who did you sue?

            6       A.  The plant.

            7       Q.  And what was the name of that plant?

            8       A.  Rohm and Haas.

            9       Q.  And where did this accident occur?

           10       A.  In Deer Park.

           11       Q.  What part of your body was burned by the acid?

           12       A.  My face a little and my left leg.

           13       Q.  Who was your lawyer in that lawsuit?

           14       A.  I don't remember.

           15       Q.  Did you settle that case, or did it go to

           16  trial?

           17       A.  We -- there was a settlement.  We didn't go to

           18  court.

           19       Q.  Did you give a deposition before it settled?

           20       A.  No.

           21       Q.  And have you ever filed any other lawsuits

           22  besides that one against the Rohm and Haas and this one

           23  against Kuraray?

           24       A.  No, sir.

           25       Q.  Have you ever been sued before?

                                                                       9

            5       Q.  Besides the acid burn in '91 and '92, have you

            6  ever been hurt on the job before?

            7                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  What states have you lived in besides Texas?

            7       A.  None other.

            8       Q.  Have you ever been arrested for a criminal

            9  offense?

           10       A.  No.

           11       Q.  In this state or in any country?

           12       A.  No, sir.

           13       Q.  What countries have you lived in besides Mexico

           14  and the United States?

           15       A.  I lived for a very short while in Canada for

           16  work, but we're talking about a few months.

           17       Q.  When was that?

           18       A.  Last time was in 2009.

           19       Q.  How many times have you worked in Canada?

           20       A.  Twice.

           21       Q.  And who did you work for in Canada?

           22       A.  The company name?

           23       Q.  Yes.

           24       A.  Transfill.  That's the last company.

           25       Q.  Okay.  And what was it before then?

                                                                      11



            1       A.  I don't remember.

            2       Q.  Do you have a driver's license?

            3       A.  Yes, sir.

            4       Q.  Do you have it with you?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  May I see it, please?

            7                MR. GARVIN:  Objection.  The witness -- the

            8  deponent will not produce his driver's license at this

            9  time.

           10                MR. NEWTON:  What's your basis for that,

           11  Counselor?  We have gotten driver licenses for every

           12  witness here at this law firm and in this lawsuit.

           13                MR. GARVIN:  That could be produced at a

           14  later date through a request for production, but this is

           15  deposition.

           16                MR. NEWTON:  I understand that.

           17                MR. GARVIN:  We're in a deposition.

           18                MR. NEWTON:  I understand that.  I want to

           19  see his driver's license and make sure this -- this is

           20  who we're supposed to be talking to.

           21                MR. GARVIN:  We can discuss it more after a

           22  break, but at this point, I'm not going to have him

           23  produce any documents that haven't already been

           24  requested.

           25                MR. NEWTON:  We requested his driver's

                                                                      12



            1  license.  Yes.

            2                MR. GARVIN:  And you have a copy of it.

            3                MR. NEWTON:  And the one that we -- the one

            4  that we have is expired; so I want to see if he has a

            5  current driver's license.  And I'm entitled to ask that.

            6  If you want to check with one of your superiors here, I

            7  certainly encourage you to do so.  But if you get in the

            8  way of the deposition of this question, seek relief.

            9                MR. GARVIN:  Well, if you want to ask him

           10  if he's updated his license, feel free, Counselor.  But

           11  to ask him to produce something, that's not the purpose

           12  of a deposition.

           13                MR. NEWTON:  Every witness has produced his

           14  driver's license.  Have you done very many of these

           15  depositions?

           16                MR. GARVIN:  That's not a logical argument,

           17  Counselor.

           18                MR. NEWTON:  Have you done -- I've

           19  practiced 30 years.  Don't tell me how to practice law.

           20  I won't tell you how to practice medicine.  Okay?  Let's

           21  make this deal.  Have you done very many of these

           22  depositions?

           23                MR. GARVIN:  I've done quite a few.

           24                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  Well, this is a first

           25  time I've ever heard anybody object to someone producing

                                                                      13



            1  their driver's license.  This is a first.  So you can

            2  take some pride in that I guess.  On what possible basis

            3  are you refusing the witness to provide to me during

            4  this deposition a copy of his driver's license so we can

            5  confirm his identity?  On what possible basis, legal or

            6  otherwise?

            7                MR. GARVIN:  Because producing documents is

            8  not the purpose of a deposition.

            9                MR. NEWTON:  It's not a document.  I'm

           10  asking him to show me his current driver's license.

           11                MR. GARVIN:  Exactly.

           12                MR. NEWTON:  I'm asking him to show me his

           13  current driver's license.  Would you check with one of

           14  your folks on a break and see if they tell you

           15  otherwise?  Because we've gotten it from -- I mean

           16  everybody.  Mo, Benny, Ajay, everybody.  Has anybody

           17  told you different?  That you're not supposed to let the

           18  witness provide his driver's license?

           19                MR. GARVIN:  Counselor, if we're done with

           20  the verbal harassment of me --

           21                MR. NEWTON:  No one's harassing you.

           22  You're harassing me --

           23                MR. GARVIN:  I --

           24                MR. NEWTON:  -- in getting in the way of

           25  this deposition by telling him -- or telling me he can't

                                                                      14



            1  produce his driver's license.  That's ridiculous.

            2                MR. GARVIN:  I will check with Benny, but

            3  in my opinion is you've got his driver's license.

            4                MR. NEWTON:  It's expired.  I want to see

            5  if his current driver's license is otherwise.

            6                MR. GARVIN:  Why don't you --

            7                MR. NEWTON:  I'm entitled to ask that and

            8  get --

            9                MR. GARVIN:  -- ask the deponent?

           10                MR. NEWTON:  Don't you tell me --

           11                MR. GARVIN:  Ask him the question.

           12                MR. NEWTON:  -- how to ask questions.

           13  Don't tell on me getting how to take my deposition.

           14  You're getting in the way of this deposition, and

           15  it's -- it's ridiculous.  This is not exactly a major

           16  case.

           17                MR. GARVIN:  We can resolve this.

           18                MR. NEWTON:  You're acting like it is.

           19                MR. GARVIN:  This is not a major issue.  We

           20  can resolve --

           21                MR. NEWTON:  It is a major issue.  I want

           22  to see his current driver's license.  The other day we

           23  took a deposition in this building of someone who hadn't

           24  had a driver's license current for three to four years.

           25  And guess how he got to the deposition?  He drove here.

                                                                      15



            1  So this is all relevant to our inquiries.  We are

            2  entitled to ask.  If you want to take the position that

            3  we're -- you're not somehow required -- he's not

            4  required to produce his driver's license, we'll take it

            5  up with the Court.  Is that your position?

            6                MR. GARVIN:  My position is he's not

            7  required to produce his driver's license during a

            8  deposition.

            9                MR. NEWTON:  That's nonsense.  Do you have

           10  any basis for that other than that's what you think?

           11       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Do you have a current driver's

           12  license, Mr. Robles?

           13       A.  Yes.  Yes, sir.

           14       Q.  When did you renew it, sir?

           15                MR. NEWTON:  Let the record reflect the

           16  witness is reaching into his billfold to check his

           17  driver's license, which his attorney does not allow him

           18  to show me across the table.  Unprecedented.

           19                THE WITNESS:  3/9/19.

           20       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  When does it -- is that when

           21  you renewed it?

           22       A.  Yes, sir.

           23       Q.  When does it expire?

           24       A.  4/13/25.

           25       Q.  What's the number on your driver's license

                                                                      16



            1  before you put it away?

            2       A.  09783584.

            3       Q.  And what -- what is your current address, sir?

            4       A.  It's 10606 Pillot Street, P-E-L-L-O-T [sic], in

            5  Houston, Texas 77029.

            6       Q.  How long have you lived there sir?

            7       A.  30 years I think.

            8       Q.  And is that the -- is that the address on your

            9  driver's license?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Would you hold the license up for the

           12  videographer just to show that you do have it on you?

           13  Just hold the license up.

           14                MR. GARVIN:  Instruct him not to comply.

           15                MR. NEWTON:  You're not going to allow him

           16  to hold his license up to show we have it -- he has it?

           17  Really?

           18                MR. GARVIN:  No, I'm not.

           19                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.

           20                MR. GARVIN:  That's essentially asking him

           21  to produce it.  It's just not the --

           22                MR. NEWTON:  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.

           23                MR. GARVIN:  You already know that he was

           24  reading from it.

           25                MR. NEWTON:  Okay.  Let -- let the

                                                                      17



            1  record -- well, reading from something.  We don't know

            2  what it was.  He got something out of his billfold and

            3  counsel will not allow us to see his driver's license

            4  under some notion that that's somehow incorrect or

            5  improper.

            6       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  What kind of driver's license

            7  do you have, sir?

            8                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  What type of driver's license

           10  do you have, sir?  I'm over here.

           11       A.  A class C regular.

           12       Q.  Have you ever had a commercial driver's

           13  license?

           14       A.  No.

           15       Q.  Have you ever gone by any other name besides

           16  Eduardo Pedroza Robles?

           17       A.  No.

           18       Q.  Do you have any other licenses or

           19  certifications or certificates in the State of Texas

           20  besides your driver's license?

           21       A.  No.

           22       Q.  Have you ever had your license suspended,

           23  revoked, or terminated?

           24       A.  No.

           25                MR. NEWTON:  What's our next?  1032?

                                                                      18



            1                (Exhibit 1032 marked.)

            2       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Robles, let me show you

            3  what's been marked Exhibit 1032 to your deposition.

            4  Will you confirm that that is a copy of your expired

            5  driver's license, now expired driver's license?  This --

            6  this one we have expired 4/13/2019.

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  Do you speak English, Mr. Robles?

            9                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           10                MR. NEWTON:  I'm not going to ask -- have

           11  the patience for what that is.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Do you speak English,

           13  Mr. Robles?

           14       A.  Not enough.

           15       Q.  I'm sorry?  Not --

           16       A.  Not enough.

           17       Q.  Not enough for what?

           18       A.  To have a long conversation.

           19       Q.  And we're doing this deposition here today

           20  through a translator, correct?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Can you read English?

           23       A.  A little.

           24       Q.  How far did you go in school?

           25       A.  To a technical school in Mexico.

                                                                      19



            1       Q.  What did you learn in Mexico at this technical

            2  school?

            3       A.  Industrial maintenance.

            4       Q.  Other than that, how many years of formal

            5  education did you undergo in Mexico?

            6       A.  After that?  Nothing.

            7       Q.  Before that.  How many years of formal

            8  education did you undergo in Mexico before you went to

            9  technical school?

           10       A.  Nine.

           11       Q.  Nine years?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  How many years did you go to technical school

           14  in Mexico?

           15       A.  Three and a half years.

           16       Q.  And what did you learn at this technical school

            1       Q.  And you see that it says it verifies that the

            2  answers to your interrogatories are true and correct

            3  according to your personal knowledge?

            4       A.  Yes.

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  Now in your answers to interrogatories, it says

            9  you started for Force Corporation -- started working for

           10  them on October 30, 2017.  Does that sound about right

           11  to you?

           12       A.  No.

           13       Q.  It does not sound correct?

           17  You see at the top of page 4 it says employer, Force

           18  Corporation; dates, October 30, 2017, to present.

           19                Did I read that correctly?

           20       A.  It's just that they're -- they give me layoff,

           21  and I go back.  So that's just the last time they hired

           22  me.

           23       Q.  Okay.  So you've been working with Force

           24  Corporation since October 30, 2017 until today; is that

                                                                      34



            1       A.  No.  Because if we go to the other pages, you

            2  see how it talks about 2013.

            3       Q.  Yeah.  I see that.  I'm just asking, at the

            4  time of the accident, how long had you been working for

            5  Force Corporation?  And you said that you were working

            6  for Force.  I'm just trying to determine how long you'd

            7  been working for them at the time of the accident.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Look at the top of page 4

           10  again.  I see you've worked for Force on multiple

           11  occasions.

           12       A.  Yes.  But this is correct.

           13       Q.  And other companies, right?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  Okay.  So the most recent time that you started

           16  with Force Corporation up to the time of the accident

           17  would have been about seven months; is that correct?

           18       A.  Correct.

           19       Q.  Okay.  And you worked as a welder, right?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  And what were you getting paid then?

           22       A.  48.

           23       Q.  Okay.  You started at 45 an hour, and you were

           24  increased to 48 an hour on 1/21/18.  Is that what it

           25  says on your answers?

            6  instructions from when you worked out at the Kuraray

            1                THE WITNESS:  I never saw the plant plats;

            2  so I don't know.

            3       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  I understand.  But do you

            4  recognize looking at the maps there before you, do you

            5  recognize the area of the Kuraray plant, the work areas?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  Okay.  Can you identify for us on either map

            8  where you were working at the time of the accident?  And

            9  you can look at either map.  I don't want you to guess.

           10  If you can identify where you were working, that's fine.

           11  If you can't, that's also.  Okay?

           12       A.  I don't see the units' numbers.

           13       Q.  On either map?

           14       A.  No.  Because I was at the 1400, and it's around

           15  here, but --

           16       Q.  You don't see the 1400 building on -- yeah,

           17  this is 1036.  You don't see the 1400 building on 1036?

           18       A.  Here.

           19       Q.  Okay.  So you have found it?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  Okay.  Is that the area where you were working

           22  at -- on the day of the accident?

           23                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

            4  that was.  Write it pretty good size.

            5                Okay.  Now can you indicate where you were

            6  when the accident happened?  Precisely where you were.

            7  And if you can, I want you to write a capital letter I.

            8       A.  I don't see the stairs.  I was near the stairs.

            9       Q.  Okay.  Best you can, just mark where you were

           10  working at the time of the accident or where you were

           11  actually physically at the time of the accident with a

           12  capital I, please.

           13                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           21  unit.  And his letter -- written the letter I, capital I

           22  to indicate where he was at the time of the accident.

           23       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Now did you ever see

           24  the fire that occurred out there?

           25       A.  No.

                                                                      44



            1       Q.  Okay.  So you don't know where the fire was in

            2  relationship to where you were?

            3       A.  No.

            4       Q.  Okay.  That's fine.

            5                Now you said that you were going to get

            6  water at the time the accident happened.  Is that right?

            7                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

            8                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  And were you going to get

           10  water for yourself or for your coworkers or both?

           11       A.  For the group.  For all of us.

           12       Q.  And how are you going to get water?  Were you

           13  carrying a bucket or were you carrying a water bottle or

           14  what?

           15       A.  I got a 5-gallon container, and I was going to

           16  get some bottles.

           17       Q.  And where were you going to go to get water?

           18       A.  On the ground level.

           19       Q.  Okay.  And what level were you on at the time

           20  of the accident?

           21       A.  Seventh floor.

           22                THE INTERPRETER:  Sorry.  Second -- second

           23  floor.

                                                                      45



            1       Q.  So you were heading to the stairs to go

            2  downstairs to get water for you and the crew; is that

            3  right?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  And what was the first thing that you remember

            6  that indicated to you something was wrong, something was

            7  going on?

            8       A.  When I was on the stairs going down, I heard a

            9  noise, and I saw everybody running.

           10       Q.  What kind of noise did you hear?  Can you

           11  describe it for us?

           12       A.  A very loud noise like a whistling, really loud

           13  whistling.

           14       Q.  Any other noise?

           15       A.  After a moment, you -- an explosion was heard.

           16       Q.  And then you said you saw people running?

           17       A.  So -- so -- so, yes.  Before the explosion when

           18  the -- when the whistling was happening, I was -- to go

           19  down, I had to be on the north side, and I was facing

           20  the south side.  And it happened on the south side.  And

           21  I saw everybody run.

           22       Q.  Okay.  Now you said you were coming down the

           23  stairs to go get water at the time that you heard this

           24  whistling?

           25                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

                                                                      46



            1                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

            2       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  How far down the stairs were

            3  you?

            4                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

            5                THE WITNESS:  I was about to start going

            6  down.

            7       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  All right.  And then what

            8  happened?

            9                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           10       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  What did you do next?

           11       A.  Run.  Run for my life.

           12       Q.  Did you run down the stairs?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  And then what did you do once you got to the

           15  ground?

           16       A.  I kept on running.

           17       Q.  And where did you run to?

           18       A.  To Gate 4, which is the muster point.

           19       Q.  So you knew where the muster point was before

           20  the event occurred; is that right?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Okay.  Can you take that red pen and mark on

           23  the map where you ended up?

           24                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           25       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  You said you ran to the muster

                                                                      47



            1  point.  Can you mark where you ended up when you came to

            2  a stop there on the map?  And I want you to indicate

            3  with an E letter -- capital letter E to indicate where

            4  you ended up.

            5                Have you done so?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  Is that the muster point where you were

            8  assigned?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  Or was it different?

           11       A.  No.

           12       Q.  So where you ended up that you've marked on the

           13  map with an E was also your muster point; is that

           14  correct?

           15                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           16                THE WITNESS:  We should have stayed on

           17  the -- on this side, on this side of the plant, on this

           18  side of the fence.  But since there was a big danger,

           19  they put us on the parking lot side.

           20       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  So my question is,

           21  where you ended up, was that different than your muster

           22  point?

           23                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           24                THE WITNESS:  No.  This was the area where

           25  we should have arrived.

                                                                      48



            1       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  And once you got there,

            2  how long did you stay there?

            3       A.  When -- when we got there, they kept us there a

            4  while outside.

            5       Q.  How long?

            6       A.  About 30, 40 minutes.  And then after that,

            7  they put us inside a sheltering place.  Like that's what

            8  they called it.  So we wouldn't breathe the fumes and

            9  whatever was there, they put us inside there.

           10       Q.  And where was that?  Can you identify that on

           11  the map?

           12       A.  Here.

           13       Q.  Okay.  I want you to mark with an S and a P,

           14  capital S and capital P, for shelter point.

           15                And how long did you stay at the shelter

           16  point?

           17       A.  I don't -- I don't remember exactly, but it was

           18  a good while, like hours.

           19       Q.  Several hours, three or four hours?

           20       A.  Three.

           21       Q.  Okay.  And then did you go home?

           22       A.  No.  I had to get inside the plant to get my

           23  truck.

           24       Q.  And someone escorted you to where your truck

            2  see -- October of 2017, leading up to the day of the

            3  accident, how many days a week would you work?

            4       A.  I was working at another plant.  In the other

            5  plant, we worked like 50 hours a week.

           12       Q.  Okay.  Like shutdowns, turnarounds, things like

           13  that where they needed extra hours, extra manpower?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  Now 50 hours a week, you're already -- you're

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  Now in the months that you've been working at

           20                When did you start working at the Kuraray

           21  plant?

           22       A.  Towards the end of February, 2018.

           23       Q.  And how many days a week were you working then

            2       Q.  Okay.  And when did the shutdown start?

            3       A.  I don't remember the date exactly.

            5  May of 2018 did the shutdown start?

            7                THE WITNESS:  It was going on for a month

            8  and a half I think.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  And how many days a

           17       A.  Ten-and-a-half hours.

           18       Q.  Okay.  So you would work ten-and-a-half hours a

           19  day, seven days a week; is that right?

           20       A.  Correct.

           21       Q.  Now the shutdown continued for a period of time

           22  after the accident, correct?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  How long did the shutdown continue after the

            8  days.

            9       Q.  Okay.  Ten hour -- ten-and-a-half-hour days,

           10  seven days a week, right?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  And you continued working that -- those hours

           13  and those days after the accident until when?

           14       A.  As I said for another -- for during the length

           15  of the shutdown, a month and a half, and they brought us

           16  to 40 hours.

           18       Q.  Have you paid any medical expenses out of your

           19  own pocket?

           20       A.  No.

           21       Q.  Do you know who's paying your medical expenses

           22  that you've had or have accrued since the accident?

           23       A.  I'm going to pay them.

           24       Q.  Have you gotten bills, medical bills?

           25       A.  No, no.  I haven't checked in my mail.  No, I

                                                                      69



            1  haven't.

            2       Q.  So you have not received any medical bills for

            3  any treatment you've received since the accident at

            4  Kuraray; is that correct?

            5       A.  I might have received them.  I just haven't

            6  checked my mail.  I'm really bad for that.  I've got a

            7  lot I need to check.

            8       Q.  Do you know if your attorney is paying any

            9  medical bills for you or guaranteeing their payment?

           10                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form on both of the

           11  questions.

           14                MR. GARVIN:  I'm just telling the court

           15  reporter I'm objecting to both of the questions since

           16  there wasn't time.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Have you received any money

           18  from your attorneys?

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  When you're between jobs, do you apply for and

           21  receive unemployment benefits?

           22       A.  Yes.  I've -- I've applied, but I haven't

           23  received anything.  There hasn't been enough time

           24  between jobs.

           25       Q.  Have you ever received unemployment benefits?

                                                                      70

            9       A.  Tradition.

           10       Q.  Tradition?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  How long have you worn a copper bracelet on

           13  your wrist?

           14       A.  For years.

           15       Q.  Some people believe that wearing a copper

           16  bracelet helps with arthritis.  Have you ever heard

           17  that?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  Do you wear it for arthritis?

           20       A.  As I said, it's a tradition in our family.

           21       Q.  Okay.  But if -- do you wear the copper

           22  bracelet to prevent arthritis or to help you with

           23  arthritis?

           24       A.  I did not know about that.

           25       Q.  Well, you told me a minute ago that you heard

                                                                      71



            1  that some people wear copper bracelets or believe that

            2  copper bracelets can help them with arthritis.  You told

            3  me that you've heard that yourself.

            4       A.  I use it because mom told me to do it.

            5       Q.  Okay.  Your mother told you to do it?

            6       A.  Yes.  It's a tradition in our family.

            7       Q.  Does everyone in your family wear copper

            8  bracelets?

            9       A.  My brother who lives in Mexico.

           10       Q.  Did she -- your mother tell you why to wear a

           11  copper bracelet?

           12       A.  No.  We just -- we've just always used it.

           13       Q.  Did she tell you that it could help you with

           14  arthritis or prevent arthritis?

           15                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.  Counselor, I

           16  think he's answered those questions and then some.  This

           17  is getting harassing.

           18                MR. NEWTON:  It's not.  I'm asking what his

           19  mother told him, and I have not asked that question

           20  before.  But let him answer it, please, and we'll move

           21  on.

           22                THE WITNESS:  No.  She never said that.

           23  She just said, you know, as I said, it's just family

           24  tradition.

           25       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Does she wear a copper

                                                                      72



            1  bracelet?

            2       A.  She used to.

            3       Q.  Why did she stop?

            4                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

            5                THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

            6       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Is your father still alive?

            7       A.  No.

            8       Q.  When did he pass?

            9       A.  Last year.

           10       Q.  I'm sorry.

           12       A.  80.

           13       Q.  And what did he die of?

           14       A.  Kidney failure.

           15       Q.  Have you ever applied for disability benefits?

           16       A.  As I said before, in the '91, '92 accident I

           17  don't remember whether I applied.  That's -- that would

           18  have been the only time.

           19       Q.  And by "disability," I mean like with the

           20  Social Security administration.

           21       A.  No.

           22       Q.  Now throughout the years that you've worked for

           23  Force, have you worked as a welder?

           24                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           25                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

                                                                      73



            1       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  And since the accident, you

            2  continued working for Force as a welder; is that

            3  correct?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  Any other companies you mentioned in your

            6  discovery responses have -- has that been work as a

            7  welder as well?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  What are you being paid now per hour?

           10       A.  49 per hour.

           11       Q.  $49 an hour?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  Does that include the rental of your welding

           14  rig, or do you get extra money for that?

           15       A.  It's included.

           16       Q.  How much do you get for your work as opposed to

           17  what you get paid for your rig?

           18       A.  It's $32 for me and 17 for the machine.

           19       Q.  $32 an hour for you and $17 for your rig

           20  rental?

           21       A.  Correct.

           22       Q.  And you keep all of this.  You don't have to

           23  pay anybody anything else?  Like you're not renting the

           24  rig or anything of that sort, correct?

           25       A.  Correct.

            1                MR. NEWTON:  Let's take a break.  Just

            2  about done.

            3                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record at

            4  11:38.

            5                (Break taken from 11:38 a.m. to 11:51 a.m.)

            6                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the record

            7  at 11:51.

            8       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Mr. Robles, we had a chance to

            9  take a break.  Are you ready to proceed?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  You understand, sir, you're, still under oath?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  Do you recall the name of anyone that was

           14  working near you at the time of the incident at Kuraray?

           15       A.  The supervisor, Obaye.

           16       Q.  By the way, I'm looking at your answers to

           17  interrogatories.  And it has a different Obaye than what

           18  you gave us earlier.  I want to find out which is

           19  correct.  Turn to page 9 on your answers to

           20  interrogatories, please, sir.  It's underneath the map.

           21  Look in the middle of the page it's actually page 11.

           22  I'm sorry.  It's an answer to number 9.

           23                Do you see that under 9C it spells Hector

           24  Obaye, O-B-A-Y-E?  I thought that's -- that's different

           25  than what we got earlier.

                                                                      75



            1       A.  This is the correct one.  That's it.

            2       Q.  Okay.  So O-B-A-Y-E is the correct spelling?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  Okay.  Do you recall the name of anyone else

            5  who was working near you at the time of the incident?

            6       A.  Just their nicknames.

            7       Q.  And what was their nickname?

            8       A.  One of them is Tiny.

            9       Q.  He probably isn't tiny, either.  He's probably

           10  really big.

           11       A.  Yes.

           12                There were others, but I don't remember

           13  their names because since I don't -- didn't work with

           14  them on a daily basis.

           15       Q.  Did you ever find out what happened to cause

           16  the accident out there at the Kuraray plant?

           17       A.  No.

           18       Q.  Have you ever talked to anybody, like the EPA

           19  or OSHA or anyone like that about the accident?

           20       A.  No.

           21       Q.  Do you have any photographs of anything to do

           22  with the Kuraray plant on the day of the accident?

           23       A.  No.

           24       Q.  Did you ever get anyone a witness statement as

           25  to what you saw on the day of the accident, other than

                                                                      76



            1  to your attorneys?

            2       A.  No.

            3                (Exhibit 1037 marked.)

            4       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  What's the most you've ever

            5  made in a year from your employment?

            6       A.  I don't remember but maybe 100,000.

            7       Q.  How many years have you made $100,000 a year?

            8       A.  Maybe one.

            9       Q.  I want to show you what's been marked Exhibit

           10  No. 1037 to your deposition.  Can you identify those

           11  documents for us?

           12                MR. GARVIN:  May I see that first?  Thank

           13  you.

           14                MR. NEWTON:  Here's a spare copy if you

           15  want it.

           16                MR. GARVIN:  Okay.  Thank you.

           17                MR. NEWTON:  And our exhibit is 1037.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Take a look, please, at

           19  the two pages that are Exhibit No. 1037 to your

           20  deposition, please.  And these are tax documents that

           21  were produced to us in the course of your lawsuit for

           22  2018.  You recognize them?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  One of them is a W-2, and the other one is a

           25  1099.  Do you agree?

                                                                      77



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  And you filed these with your tax return?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  And when you add these two together, the W-2

            5  amount and the 1099 amount for 2018, it totals $117,780.

            6                MR. GARVIN:  Is that a question, Counselor?

            7                MR. NEWTON:  Yes.

            8       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Is that right?  Do you agree

            9  with that if you add those two amounts together?

           10                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           11                THE WITNESS:  I can't add them.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Well, I'll add -- I've

           13  added them for you, and they come up to $117,789.  I can

           14  go through the math again on my phone, if you like.

           15       A.  That's fine.

           16       Q.  Okay.  Assume with me that I've done the math

           17  correctly.  I've added those two amounts together, and

           18  it shows a total of $117,789.  Does that sound about

           19  right for what you made in 2018?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  Have you made more than that since 2018?

           22                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           23                THE WITNESS:  I don't remember.

           24       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  It's possible you have.  You

           25  just don't remember either way?

                                                                      78



            1                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.  Counselor,

            2  we're only part way through 2019.

            3                MR. NEWTON:  I'm just asking.

            4                MR. GARVIN:  It makes the question

            5  impossible to answer.

            6                MR. NEWTON:  I assume he keeps track of how

            7  much he makes.

            8       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Do you know how much you've

            9  made so far in 2019?

           10       A.  No.

           11       Q.  Is it about what you made in 2018 or more so

           12  far?

           13                MR. GARVIN:  Objection; form.

           14                THE WITNESS:  I think about the same.

           15       Q.  (BY MR. NEWTON)  Okay.  Do you file your own

           16  tax returns, or do you use a CPA?

           17       A.  I use somebody.

           18       Q.  Who do you use?

           19       A.  It's an accountant near where I live.

           20       Q.  And what's that person's name?

           21       A.  I don't remember.

           22       Q.  Have you ever worked for Kuraray where they

           23  were your actual employer?

           24       A.  No.

           25                MR. NEWTON:  I'll pass the witness.  Thank

          11   BY MS. ETTL:

          12   Q.     Good morning, Mr. Switken.  My name is Lindsay

          13   Ettl.  I am the attorney that represents Paul Duncan in

          14   this case.  Can you please state your full name for the

          15   record.

          16   A.     It's Francis Switken.

          17   Q.     Do you have a middle name?

          18   A.     Joseph.

          19   Q.     Have you ever gone by any names other than Francis

          20   Joseph Switken?

          21   A.     Frank.

          22   Q.     Have you ever had your deposition taken before?

          23   A.     I have had depositions taken before, yes.

          24   Q.     When was that?

          25   A.     I do not remember.
                                                                      5



           1   Q.     Was it within the last five years?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     And why did you have your deposition taken before?

           4   A.     It was for a workmans' comp issue.

           5   Q.     And who was the -- who was your employer at that

           6   time?

           7   A.     I was unemployed at that time.

           8   Q.     So who was your employer that you had the Workers'

           9   Compensation through?

          10   A.     Brinker International.

          11   Q.     And we'll talk about that a little bit later, okay?

          12   Do you remember the date of the accident that we're here

          13   for today?

          14   A.     That was December 12th of 2016.

          15   Q.     So going forward in the deposition, if I say "the

          16   accident" or "this accident," that's gonna be the date

          17   that I'm referring to, okay?

          18   A.     Okay.

          19   Q.     If I refer to another accident or something like

          20   that, I'll talk about that other date specifically, okay?

          21   A.     Okay.

          22   Q.     Are you under the influence today of any

          23   medications or substances which would prevent you from

          24   understanding my questions and answering them truthfully?

          25   A.     No.
                                                                      6



           1   Q.     I'm gonna go over some ground rules for the

           2   deposition so that you know what to expect from me and

           3   what it is that I expect of you here today, okay?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     A deposition, as you know, is just a

           6   question-and-answer session.  I'll be asking you

           7   questions, a little bit about your history, a little bit

           8   about the accident, and you'll be giving me the answers,

           9   okay?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     All of your answers have to be verbal responses.

          12   The court -- the court reporter can't take down things

          13   like nods of the head or hand gestures or slang responses

          14   like "uh-huh" or "uh-uh," okay?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     So if I say to you, "Is that a 'yes'?" or "Is that

          17   a 'no'?" I'm not trying to be fresh.  I'm not trying to

          18   confuse you at all.  I'm just trying to make it clear for

          19   the record okay?

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     If you -- at the same time, we can't talk at the

          22   same time, so let me get my whole question out.  Even if

          23   you know what the question is that I'm going to ask, let

          24   me ask the whole thing, and then you'll have the

          25   opportunity to give your full response, okay?
                                                                      7



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     If you don't know the answer to a question, that's

           3   okay.  This isn't a test, and I don't want you to guess at

           4   anything.  However, if there's a circumstance where you

           5   can give me an estimate for something like time, distance,

           6   speed, or something along those -- along that nature, go

           7   head and just let me know that you're giving me an

           8   estimate, okay?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     If you don't understand the question that I'm

          11   asking you, stop me and let me know.  Whether it's the

          12   whole question that's confusing or whether there's just

          13   one word that I'm using that's odd, just say, "Wait.  I

          14   don't understand that," okay?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     And the reason for that is is that if you give me

          17   an answer to a question and you don't tell me that you

          18   don't understand it, I'm going to assume that you

          19   understood the question that I'm asking you and that

          20   you're answering it truthfully, okay?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     If you need to take any breaks or speak with your

          23   attorney at all, if you need to stand, use the bathroom,

          24   get a drink, you can do any of that during the deposition.

          25   Just stop me and let me know, all right?
                                                                      8



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     The only rule about taking a break is that if I've

           3   asked you a question, you have to answer that question

           4   before you take your break, okay?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     All right.  Your testimony today is the same as if

           7   you were in a courtroom, so it's equally important to be

           8   truthful and accurate, okay?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Do you understand all of the instructions that I've

          11   given you today?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     Do you have any questions for me about how a

          14   deposition works or what it is that I expect of you?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     In preparation for your deposition today, did you

          17   review any kind of documents such as a police report,

          18   medical records, personal notes, anything of that nature?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     What did you look at?

          21   A.     A personal record.

          22   Q.     And is that personal record something that you've

          23   maintained?

          24   A.     No.

          25   Q.     Explain to me what it is that your personal record
                                                                      9



           1   is.

           2   A.     It was a -- my narrative of the accident.

           3   Q.     And you produced that narrative to your attorney,

           4   correct?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6                  MS. ETTL:  I'm pretty sure I have that.

           7   Yup.  Yup.

           8                  MR. DALY:  Yeah.

           9   BY MS. ETTL:

          10   Q.     Other than talking to your attorney, did you talk

          11   to anybody else in preparation for your deposition today?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     Can you give me your Social Security Number off the

          14   record, please.

          15                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

                                                                     10



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     Can I take a look at it.

           3   A.     That does not reflect my current address.  That --

           4   Q.     Okay.

           5   A.     That update is in the car.

           6   Q.     That's fine.

           7                  MS. ETTL:  Let the record reflect that

          14   Q.     Any others?

          15   A.     I'm trying to remember.  Anything prior to that

          18   Q.     After the date of this accident -- and I'm not

          19   talking about the Workers' Compensation claim related to

          20   this accident -- have you had any other Workers'

          21   Compensation claims?

          22   A.     No.

           7   Q.     Yes.

           8   A.     Briefly, I was doing some driving, but I could not

           9   do that.

          10   Q.     When was that?

          11   A.     It was after I -- I left Avalon Limousine.

          12   Q.     How long did that last for?

          13   A.     Very brief.

          14                  MS. ETTL:  We can go off a second -- the

          15   record for a second.

          16                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

          17   BY MS. ETTL:

          18   Q.     So the accident -- or no.  We were talking about

          19   your -- your driving business.  Do you know about how long

          20   you did that driving for?

          21   A.     It was very brief.  It was -- it was six months, I

          22   tried.

          23   Q.     And did you -- was it like through Uber, or was it

          24   just your own business?

          25   A.     It was just I tried to help some people with --
                                                                     36



           1   with transportation.

           2   Q.     And the other question that I want to just talk to

           3   you about really quick is:  Your interrogatory responses

           4   indicated that you were terminated from Maggiano's in

           5   January of 2018.  You had told me before it was 2017?

           6   A.     '17.

           7   Q.     So '17 is the correct year?

           8   A.     '17.

           9   Q.     So you were terminated about a month after this

          10   accident?

          11   A.     Correct.

          12   Q.     All right.  Talking about the date of the accident

          13   that we're actually here for today, about what time did

          14   the accident occur?

          15   A.     Between 10:00 and 11:00.

          16   Q.     A.m. or p.m.?

          19   A.     From the Wegmans Market.

          20   Q.     Had you consumed any alcohol, medication, or drugs

          21   within the 24 hours before the accident?

          22   A.     No.

          23   Q.     What was the weather like on the date of the

          24   accident?

          25   A.     Drizzling.
                                                                     37



           1   Q.     Did the weather play any role in how the accident

           2   occurred?

           3   A.     I do not know.

           4   Q.     Tell me a little bit, just in your own words, how

           5   the accident happened.

           6   A.     I had parked in front of the Maggiano's restaurant,

           7   parallel to the building, and this other driver backed up

           8   into the front of my car.

           9   Q.     Were you in the vehicle when the accident occurred?

          10   A.     I was.

          11   Q.     Were you completely seated in the vehicle, or were

          12   you partway in, partway out?

          13   A.     I believe still seated in the vehicle.

          14   Q.     How long had you been parked in front of Maggiano's

          15   for before the accident occurred?

          16   A.     I -- to my recollection, I had just arrived.

          17   Q.     So were you parked there for minutes or seconds

          18   or --

          19   A.     Seconds.

          20   Q.     Were you wearing your seat belt when the accident

          21   occurred?

          22   A.     I have gone over this in my head.  I cannot recall.

          23   Q.     All right.  So I'm gonna -- we're gonna look at

          24   some pictures.  And I'll tell you that these are just

          25   pictures that I have printed off of Google, okay?  So take
                                                                     38



           1   a look at those and tell me if any of these show where the

           2   accident occurred.

           3   A.     Yes.  The accident would have occurred -- would

           4   have occurred at the front of the Maggiano's Little Italy

           5   restaurant.

           6   Q.     So this first one that we're looking at here, this

           7   is an overhead view of Maggiano's, right?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     And do you recognize this as being the Maggiano's

          10   Little Italy that was in King of Prussia?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     So we'll start with this one.

          13                  MS. ETTL:  And we'll mark this one as

          14   Switken-1.

          15                  (Exhibit Switken-1 marked for

          16   identification.)

          17   BY MS. ETTL:

          18   Q.     Now, I've got three other photographs here.  And do

          19   these three photographs show the front of Maggiano's where

          20   the accident occurred?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Is there any photograph that better shows where the

          23   accident occurred than others?  I tried to take some

          24   different angles here.

          25   A.     No.  You've captured the front of the restaurant.
                                                                     39



           1   Q.     So we'll work off of -- does this one work, then,

           2   to show where the accident occurred?  Is that a "yes"?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4                  MS. ETTL:  We'll mark this one, then, as

           5   Switken-2.

           6   BY MS. ETTL:

           7   Q.     And then we'll start drawing on these, okay?

           8   A.     Before you ask a question, would it be okay if we

           9   could take a break?

          10                  MR. DALY:  Yeah.  If you want to use the

          11   bathroom or --

          12                  MS. ETTL:  Do you want to take a break now?

          13   It's 9:58, so --

          14                  THE WITNESS:  It's up to you.

          15                  MS. ETTL:  Yeah.

          16                  (Exhibit Switken-2 marked for

          17   identification.)

          18                  (Recess was taken from 9:58 a.m. to 10:05

          19   a.m.)

          20   BY MS. ETTL:

          21   Q.     So talking about how the accident happened, I'm

          22   gonna give you the marker, and we'll start with the

          23   Switken-1 first.  Can you draw for me a rectangle where

          24   your car was parked.  Like if it was parked along the

          25   sidewalk in front of Maggiano's, just draw a rectangle
                                                                     40



           1   about where your car was parked, okay?

           2                  Okay.  And I didn't say this before, but if

           3   you have to draw over any of the other things pictured in

           4   here, just feel free to do it.  Now, can you draw another

           5   rectangle representing where the -- my client's car was at

           6   before the accident occurred.

           7   A.     Before the accident?

           8   Q.     Yes.

           9   A.     Well, it was backing into a space in -- in front of

          10   me.

          11   Q.     So let me ask you this:  Did you see his car before

          12   the accident occurred?

          13   A.     I don't recall that.

          14   Q.     Why don't you put the cap on the marker for a

          15   second.

          16   A.     Okay.

          17   Q.     We'll go through a couple more questions.

          18   A.     Okay.

          19   Q.     I always tell people to cap the marker, 'cause some

          20   people get a little dangerous with starting to draw all

          21   over the exhibit.  It gets hard.  All right.

          22                  So you can't recall if you saw my client's

          23   vehicle before the accident?

          24   A.     There was another van parked perpendicular to the

          25   sidewalk.  I came up and parked.  I don't know where your
                                                                     41



           1   client came from, but he started to back up into the

           2   space.

           3   Q.     When you say "he started to back up into the

           4   space," do you mean next to the van that was parked

           5   perpendicular?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Was my client also trying to park perpendicular to

           8   the sidewalk?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Can you draw another rectangle where the van was

          11   parked perpendicular.  And just to differentiate these,

          12   put an X over the -- or inside of the rectangle that

          13   represents your car.  Okay.

          14                  What part of my client's vehicle impacted

          15   what part of your vehicle?

          16   A.     His left rear.

          17   Q.     What kind of vehicle was my client driving at the

          18   time of the accident?

          19   A.     I don't recall.

          20   Q.     And you can cap the marker.

          21   A.     I'm sorry.

          22                  MS. ETTL:  Off the record.

          23                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

          24   BY MS. ETTL:

          25   Q.     What kind of vehicle were you driving at the time
                                                                     42



           1   of the accident?

           2   A.     It was a Volkswagen Touareg.

           3   Q.     What made you park in front of Maggiano's in the

           4   way that you did before the accident occurred?

           5   A.     I had the sandwiches that I'd picked up at Wegmans

           6   in the back of my vehicle.  I was to take them into the

           7   restaurant before I -- I pulled up into a regular space.

           8   But we load and unload in front of the restaurant.

           9   Q.     And is loading and unloading in front of the

          10   restaurant a common occurrence?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Was my client driving a vehicle that was the same

          13   as the van that was already parked here?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     Was it like a regular car or a truck or SUV?

          16   A.     It was a little, regular car.

          17   Q.     Can you draw an arrow representing where my client

          18   was backing up to park.

          19                  And prior to the accident at all, did you

          20   see him -- see his vehicle at all before the accident?

          21   A.     I'm not -- I can't remember.

          22   Q.     Can you describe the impact for me.  What did it

          23   feel like?

          24   A.     It was a jarring jolt.

          25   Q.     When the -- and which part of your vehicle did you
                                                                     43



           1   say was impacted?

           2   A.     The front.

           3   Q.     Across the whole front or the front on a particular

           4   side of the vehicle?

           5   A.     I would say front left, from halfway to...

           6   Q.     All right.  I'm gonna give you two more pictures.

           7                  MS. ETTL:  And we'll mark these as

           8   Switken-3 and -4, not in any particular order.

           9                  (Exhibits Switken-3 and Switken-4 marked

          10   for identification.)

          11   BY MS. ETTL:

          12   Q.     Do these photographs show the area of your vehicle

          13   that was damaged as a result of this accident?

          14   A.     The front of the vehicle, yes.

          15   Q.     Do they show the damage from this accident?

          16   A.     Not very well.

          17   Q.     We're gonna try and get some color photographs so

          18   we can all look at them better, but can you take this

          19   marker and circle where on these photographs the damage

          20   was actually located.

          21   A.     It's -- it's very hard on these -- on these

          22   pictures.

          23   Q.     Do you know where the damage was located?

          24   A.     It was across the front of the vehicle.

          25   Q.     What did the damage look like?
                                                                     44



           1   A.     Can I review a picture?  I -- I mean this is hard

           2   to --

           3   Q.     Do you have photographs of the damage on your

           4   phone?

           5   A.     I think I did.

           6   Q.     All right.  We'll take a minute off the record and

           7   let you see if you can find some of the photographs.

           8                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

           9                  (Recess was taken from 10:15 a.m. to 11:05

          10   a.m.)

          11                  (The court reporter read back the record as

          12   requested.)

          13   BY MS. ETTL:

          14   Q.     Mr. Switken, just to kind of clear up the record

          15   for us in the future when we're looking at this, you had

          16   the opportunity during our break here to take a look at

          17   some of the photographs on your phone that showed some

          18   damage to the car, right?

          19   A.     I had the one photograph, yes.

          20   Q.     And you were able to show that to me, and I

          21   appreciate that.  And can you provide that to your

          22   attorney, then, as well, if you haven't already.

          23                  MR. DALY:  I'll have you send it to me.

          24   BY MS. ETTL:

          25   Q.     Just -- you don't have to do it right now, just in
                                                                     45



           1   the future.  Just after the deposition --

           2                  THE WITNESS:  I believe I emailed the --

           3                  MR. DALY:  We'll do it again to make sure.

           4                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

           5                  MS. ETTL:  Yeah.

           6   BY MS. ETTL:

           7   Q.     Just after the deposition, just send that to him,

           8   and then he can send that to me, okay?

           9   A.     Okay.

          10   Q.     All right.  So did you, before the accident,

          11   happen -- have the opportunity to beep your horn, yell,

          12   say or do anything to alert my client, who was backing up,

          13   that you were behind him?

          14   A.     It was drizzling, so I had my windows closed.  I

          15   might have yelled, but I don't --

          16   Q.     Did you beep your horn at all?

          17   A.     I don't recall.

          18   Q.     After the accident happens, talk me through what

          19   happens next.  What were your next steps?

          20   A.     The person who hit me pulled forward and then

          21   backed up into the space, as there was enough room between

          22   my vehicle and the van for someone to park.

          23   Q.     You said, "There was enough room there"?

          24   A.     There was enough room.

          25   Q.     Did you intentionally leave space in between your
                                                                     46



           1   vehicle and the van so somebody else could park there, or

           2   is that just kind of how it happened?

           3   A.     I don't know that I intentionally left it, but

           4   there was enough space for him to back up into that space

           5   next to the van without hitting me.

           6   Q.     So he backs forward and then backs up into the

           7   space, and then what happens next?

           8   A.     We both exited our vehicles.  He said, "I didn't

           9   see you."  I probably asked for some identification.  He

          10   seemed to be having difficulty locating insurance

          11   information.  So at that point, I requested someone in the

          12   restaurant call for police to come to make a police report

          13   on the accident.

          14   Q.     Did you, yourself call for the police, or did

          15   somebody else call them?

          16   A.     I believe I asked someone else to call.

          17   Q.     Aside from the -- my client saying that he didn't

          18   see you, did you have any other conversations with him

          19   after the accident?

          20   A.     Not that I recall.

          21   Q.     How long did it take the police to get there?

          22   A.     Approximately, 30 minutes.

          23   Q.     When the police got there, did you have a

          24   conversation with the police?

          25   A.     I believe I was -- probably explained what had
                                                                     47



           1   happened, that I had parked and the gentleman had hit my

           2   vehicle.

           3   Q.     Did the police ask you if you were injured as a

           4   result of the accident?

           5   A.     I don't recall.

           6   Q.     Did you tell the police that you were injured?

           7   A.     I don't recall.

           8   Q.     How long had you been stopped or parked before the

           9   impact occurred?

          10   A.     I'd say less than a minute.

          11   Q.     And I believe I might have asked you this already,

          12   but would -- would you say it's like in terms of minutes

          13   or in terms of seconds that you were stopped?

          14   A.     I would -- I would say less than a minute, but I

          15   don't recall exactly how long.

          16   Q.     When you came to a stop, you said that you were

          17   gonna take the sandwiches inside, right?

          18   A.     Correct.

          19   Q.     Was there anything that was making you wait inside

          20   the vehicle to get out before you took the sandwiches in?

          21   A.     I could have looked at my -- my phone.  I don't

          22   recall the actual...

          23   Q.     Okay.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to figure out, you

          24   know, if you were a man on a mission, trying to get those

          25   sandwiches inside or if you parked your car and waited
                                                                     48



           1   there for a period of time, and then what you were doing

           2   in your car while you were waiting.

           3   A.     That, I don't recall.

           4   Q.     Did you talk to anybody other than the police at

           5   the scene of the accident?

           6   A.     I believe it's -- the gentleman who hit me, I

           7   believe it was his employer who came out and said to me,

           8   "What did he do now?"

           9   Q.     And he came out of Maggiano's?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     And what did you tell him?

          12   A.     I said, "He hit my" -- "the front of my vehicle."

          13   Q.     Did he say anything in response to that?

          14   A.     I don't recall.

          15   Q.     Was there any debris at the scene of the accident

          16   from either of the vehicles?

          17   A.     I don't recall.

          18   Q.     Did you go and look and see if there was any damage

          19   on my client's vehicle?

          20   A.     The only thing I remember about your client's

          21   vehicle was his right rear lens was red duct tape.

          22   Q.     His rear, I guess, brake light?

          23   A.     His right rear brake light was red duct tape.

          24   Q.     After the accident, did you take the sandwiches

          25   into the Maggiano's?
                                                                     49



           1   A.     No.  I believe someone else came out and took the

           2   sandwiches in.

           3   Q.     When you were waiting for the police to arrive,

           4   were you waiting inside or outside?

           5   A.     Both.

           6   Q.     Did you move your car before the police arrived?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     And aside from talking to the police and that other

           9   gentleman, did you tell any of the other people at

          10   Maggiano's what happened?

          11   A.     You don't want me to guess, but I'll say I probably

          12   did tell people inside at the host stand that my car had

          13   been hit.  "Please call the police."

          14   Q.     Did you have any coworkers that you were friendly

          15   with that you might have told them about how the accident

          16   happened?

          17   A.     I -- I -- as I said, it's -- at that point, I

          18   probably said my car had been hit outside.  "I'll be

          19   dealing with that for a while."

          20   Q.     Were there any tickets issued as a result of the

          21   accident?

          22   A.     I do not know.

          23   Q.     Did the police speak to my client at all?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     Did you overhear their conversation?
                                                                     50



           1   A.     Only that he was having difficulty locating his

           2   insurance information.

           3   Q.     Did anybody call an ambulance to the scene?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     Did you request that an ambulance be called?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     Was there any part of your body, when the impact

           8   happened, that made contact with something inside the

           9   vehicle?  Did you hit something inside the vehicle?

          10   A.     I don't believe so.

          11   Q.     Can you tell me each part of your body where you've

          12   experienced pain or discomfort as a result of this

          13   accident.

          14   A.     The original pain was the lower right back and the

          15   hip.

          16   Q.     And then, there was additional pain someplace else?

          17   A.     Lower -- lower right back, and -- and the hip.

          18   Q.     And your right hip?

          19   A.     Right hip.

          20   Q.     You said that was the original pain.  What was not

          21   --

          22   A.     That's the pain.

          23   Q.     Okay.  That's it?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     Okay.  When did you first start experiencing the
                                                                     51



           1   pain in your lower right back and right hip?

           2   A.     The next morning, when I woke up.

           3   Q.     Had you ever suffered from pain in your lower right

           4   back or right hip prior to the date of the accident?

           5   A.     Not in those locations, no.

           6   Q.     Where had you suffered from pain prior to the date

           7   of the accident?

           8   A.     I do not know the exact year, but I had strained my

           9   back.  And again, I don't remember the exact year, but I

          10   had strained my back -- middle of my back when I was

          11   either opening or closing our pool.

          12   Q.     Did you suffer from chronic back pain prior to the

          13   date of the accident?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     When you first started experiencing the pain in

          16   your lower right back and right hip, could you describe

          17   what it is that it felt like to you.

          18   A.     In the lower right back was fairly excruciating.

          19   The hip, I was having difficulty walking.

          20   Q.     Had you ever experienced any numbness or tingling

          21   in any of your extremities related to this accident?

          22   A.     No.

          23   Q.     When did you first seek medical treatment after the

          24   accident?

          25   A.     I believe my original meeting with Dr. Dua was the
                                                                     52



           1   beginning of January.

           2   Q.     How did you find out about Dr. Duo?

           3   A.     Main Line Spine was recommended to me by Mr. Daly.

           4   Q.     And is it -- is it Duo or Dua?

           5   A.     D-U-A.

           6   Q.     D-U-A, okay.  Did you go and treat with your

           7   primary care doctor, Dr. Weber, at all for any injuries

           8   related to this accident?

           9   A.     I did not.

          10   Q.     And why is that?

          11   A.     I don't know.

          12   Q.     When you saw Dr. Dua for the first time, what were

          13   your complaints that you had?

          14   A.     The pain in the lower right back and the hip.

          15   Q.     And what did Dr. Dua do for you?

          16   A.     At that time, she ordered me to have an MRI.  And I

          17   believe at that time, she prescribed the stronger dose of

          18   ibuprofen and the -- I believe it's called Flexeril.

          19   Q.     And you said you never -- you never ended up taking

          20   the Flexeril?

          21   A.     She explained to me that the Flexeril could

          22   possibly make me dopey, so I chose not to take that.

          23   Q.     After you saw Dr. Dua, what did you do for any kind

          24   of medical treatment after that?

          25   A.     I made an appointment for the MRI with the -- I
                                                                     53



           1   believe it's University of Pennsylvania in Radnor.

           2   Q.     What part of your body did they take the MRI of?

           3   A.     They put me on a slate, on my back, and they pulled

           4   me back into a tunnel and --

           5                  MR. DALY:  She means what part of your

           6   body.

           7                  THE WITNESS:  Huh?

           8                  MR. DALY:  What were they examining?

           9   BY MS. ETTL:

          10   Q.     Do you know what part of your body they were

          11   looking for, trying to see --

          12   A.     Well, I guess she had written the prescription for

          13   it --

          14   Q.     Right.

          15   A.     -- so I'm taking it they were going -- I -- I don't

          16   know.  I guess they were going for the back and the hip

          17   areas, but I don't know.

          18   Q.     And again, if it's something that you just don't

          19   know, then that's fine.  I'm just trying to see what it is

          20   you do or don't know about what your medical treatment

          21   was, okay?

          22   A.     I would -- I would say, from my description of pain

          23   to Dr. Dua, that she probably prescribed the MRI for the

          24   back and hip.

          25   Q.     Got you.  And do you know what the results of your
                                                                     54



           1   MRI were?

           2   A.     I don't know the exact results.

           3   Q.     Did any doctor explain to you what they were like

           4   and say -- you said you don't know the exact results.  Did

           5   somebody give you an understanding of what the results

           6   were?

           7   A.     After the MRI, I took -- took the MRI back to

           8   Dr. Dua, and -- and she reviewed those.  If she did

           9   exactly explain it, I'm not a medical person, and I don't

          10   know the exact terminologies.

          11   Q.     Did you have any other kind of treatment related to

          12   this accident other than seeing Dr. Dua and having the MRI

          13   performed?

          14   A.     As far -- as far as?

          15   Q.     Any kind of treatment at all.

          16   A.     After seeing Dr. Dua after the MRI?

          17   Q.     Yes.

          18   A.     Okay.  Dr. Dua said that I had three options.  The

          19   least invasive would have been physical therapy.  The next

          20   would be injections.  The third, I don't remember exactly,

          21   but it would have been the most critical of the three

          22   choices.  I...

          23   Q.     And you don't know what that choice was?

          24   A.     I don't know if she was saying an -- an operation

          25   or if it was -- I don't know exactly.  But it didn't sound
                                                                     55



           1   like something I wanted to do.

           2   Q.     So then, what did you choose to do?

           3   A.     We started with the least invasive, the physical

           4   therapy.

           5   Q.     How long did you do physical therapy for?

           6   A.     Six weeks.

           7   Q.     And where did you do physical therapy at?

           8   A.     It's in that same building where Main Line Spine is

           9   in King of Prussia.

          10   Q.     How many times a week did you go to physical

          11   therapy?

          12   A.     I believe it was either two or three times a week,

          13   based on openings they had.

          14   Q.     Were you discharged from physical therapy at some

          15   point?

          16   A.     After six weeks, the hip pain had been relieved.

          17   The back pain was still persistent.  And Dr. Dua had asked

          18   me to come in after the six weeks to see her again.

          19   Q.     And did you go back to see her?

          20   A.     I did.

          21   Q.     What did she do when you went back?

          22   A.     I explained that the hip pain had been relieved by

          23   the physical therapy, but the back pain continued.  At

          24   that time, I believe she gave me the first set of

          25   injections and recommended that I continue with the
                                                                     56



           1   physical therapy as home exercise.

           2                  And she gave me a sheet.  I basically knew

           3   what the exercises were from spending six weeks at the

           4   physical therapy, but she kind -- I guess she felt that it

           5   was just as well that I do the exercises at home as going

           6   to the office.

           7   Q.     Did you end up having injections?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     How many times did you have injections performed?

          10   A.     How many times?  I believe during the first year,

          11   it was every three months.  I don't remember the exact

          12   number of times.  But Dr. Dua also had told me that if I'd

          13   continued receiving them on a regular basis, I would

          14   probably be lowering the relief that the injections were

          15   giving me.  So she asked that I spread them out a little

          16   further than every three months.

          17   Q.     When you got the injections, did the injections

          18   help?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     What part -- what part of your body did you get the

          21   injections in?

          22   A.     The lower right back.

          23   Q.     When you had the injections performed, were they

          24   performed at Dr. Dua's office or at a hospital?

          25   A.     At Dr. Dua's office.
                                                                     57



           1   Q.     Did you have to be put under anesthesia to have the

           2   injections performed?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     What did they feel like when they were performed?

           5   A.     They sting.

           6   Q.     Is it like stinging like when you get a shot

           7   stinging, or is it something different?

           8   A.     It's like a -- the doctor looks for points of pain,

           9   and then she'll mark those and then do a needle injection,

          10   so it's kind of a stinging injection.

          11   Q.     Better or worse than your flu shot or the same?

          12   A.     I would say worse.  You know when that needle is

          13   going in your back.

          14   Q.     I should have asked you, "Better or worse than a

          15   tetanus?" 'cause they're worse, but...

          16                  When's the last time you had an injection

          17   performed?

          18   A.     The last series of injections was approximately

          19   nine months ago.

          20   Q.     Do you have any injections currently scheduled?

          21   A.     Prior to the holidays, maybe October.

          22   Q.     Is it scheduled -- it's scheduled?

          23   A.     It is not scheduled.

          24   Q.     You just intend to schedule it?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     58



           1   Q.     Have you received any other treatment for your

           2   injuries related to this accident?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     Do you have any -- oh, I guess, does Dr. Dua

           5   perform the injections herself?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     When you were treating with Dr. -- or, actually,

           8   when you were doing the physical therapy, did they place

           9   you on any kind of restrictions?

          10   A.     Any kind of --

          11   Q.     Physical restrictions, like how you -- you can do

          12   this or you can't do that.

          13   A.     No.

          14   Q.     Has Dr. Dua ever suggested that you go back to

          15   physical therapy?

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.     Did physical therapy improve your lower back pain?

          18   A.     It -- it helped the hip pain.  I felt that you were

          19   basically on your own at physical therapy.  They would

          20   give you the exercises to do.  I believe it started

          21   with -- with an ice pack.  He would have a series of

          22   exercises to do.

          23                  And then, the physical therapist would come

          24   in and kind of stretch my leg, my right leg.  And then,

          25   they put me on a bicycle for as long as I could ride a
                                                                     59



           1   bicycle.  And then, I believe they'd give me a heat pad

           2   and send me on my way.

           3   Q.     Did they do anything else with you at physical

           4   therapy?

           5   A.     Not really, no.

           6   Q.     So what -- what exercises did they give you to do

           7   at home, then?

           8   A.     There are like tummy tucks.  There are leg

           9   stretches, pull your legs in.  There's one where you have

          10   to be on all fours and you throw out your opposite arm and

          11   leg, throw out your opposite arm and leg.  Basically,

          12   stretching.

          13   Q.     And did they ever have you perform those

          14   stretching -- those stretches when you were at physical

          15   therapy?

          16   A.     Yes.  Yeah.  They showed me how to do them all.

          17   Q.     How often do you do your home exercises?

          18   A.     I try for every other day.

          19   Q.     Had you ever had an MRI performed prior to the date

          20   of this accident?

          21   A.     Not to my recollection, no.

          22   Q.     Had you ever had physical therapy prior to the date

          23   of this accident?

          24   A.     No.

          25   Q.     Has anybody ever recommended that you need to go
                                                                     60



           1   see an orthopedist or an -- an orthopedic surgeon?

           2   A.     No.

           3   Q.     Were you involved in a motor vehicle accident on

           4   January 11th, 2016?

           5   A.     I'm sorry?

           6   Q.     I said, "Were you involved with a motor vehicle

           7   accident on January 11th, 2016?"

           8   A.     I don't recall.

           9   Q.     The vehicle that you were driving on the date of

          10   the accident is a Volkswagen Touareg, correct?

          11   A.     Uh-huh.

          12                  MR. DALY:  Is that a "yes"?

          13                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yes.

          14   BY MS. ETTL:

          15   Q.     Is this registered in your name or in your wife's

          16   name?

          17   A.     I believe this is registered in my name.

          18   Q.     Could it be registered to you jointly?

          19   A.     I don't think so.

          20                  MS. ETTL:  I was trying to see on there if

          21   it said --

          22                  MR. DALY:  Just says him --

          23                  MS. ETTL:  Okay.

          24                  MR. DALY:  -- on the police --

          25                  THE WITNESS:  I believe I'm the sole owner.
                                                                     61



           1   BY MS. ETTL:

           2   Q.     And looking at some of the photographs of the

           3   vehicle, I noticed that there's a handicap license plate

           4   on the vehicle.

           5   A.     Those were issued to both of the vehicles because

           6   of my wife's handicap.

           7   Q.     And do you have to like submit -- did she have to

           8   submit like something to the state to get those issued

           9   that way or --

          10   A.     She did, yes.

          11   Q.     What is her disability?

          12   A.     Everything.

          13   Q.     Did you have to pay anything out of pocket for the

          14   property damage to your car?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     Did you have the damage repaired?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Do you still have the car?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Does it still have the damage to the front of the

          21   grill?

          22   A.     No.

          23   Q.     No?

          24   A.     It has been repaired.

          25   Q.     Oh.  It has been repaired now.  When did that
                                                                     62



           1   happen?

           2   A.     I don't remember the exact date that it was

           3   repaired.

           4   Q.     Was it like right after the accident?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     Who did the repairs on the vehicle?

           7   A.     Matus Brothers.

           8   Q.     And did your insurance company pay for those

           9   repairs to be done?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     Had your vehicle had any damage on it prior to the

          12   date of this accident?

          13   A.     Not to my knowledge.

          14   Q.     Can you tell me:  Do you have any hobbies or

          15   interests that have been affected by this accident?

          16   A.     Do I have any --

          17   Q.     Hobbies or interests?

          18   A.     Such as?

          19   Q.     Well, I don't know.  I mean I obviously don't know

          20   your life or what you do, so what is it that you do and

          21   how has your life been affected by the accident?  We've

          22   talked about your work, but I'm wondering:  Is there any

          23   other part of your life that's been affected?

          24   A.     I'm -- I'm limited.  After the three days of

          25   working for Samuels and Son, I kind of rest for four days

           1   to get prepared to go back to work for three days.

           2   Q.     Prior to the date of the accident, did you

           3   participate in any kind of hobbies, or did you have a

           4   hobby that you liked to do regularly before the accident

           5   happened?

           6   A.     Basically, took care of my home property.

           7   Q.     Anything else?

           8   A.     I'm trying to think.  You've got me on the spot.

           9   We're very boring people.  We have eleven grandchildren

          10   that keep us very busy.

          11   Q.     And those grandchildren are --

          12   A.     My wife's.

          13   Q.     Your wife's children's, okay.  Do you still fill

          14   the role of grandfather for them?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     Your grandchildren -- has your relationship with

          17   your grandchildren been impacted by the accident at all?

          18   A.     I don't know that it's been impacted.  I don't show

          19   any impact to them.

          20   Q.     Does it affect what you do with your grandchildren

          21   at all?

          22   A.     I don't know.

          23   Q.     Has the accident impacted your relationship with

          24   your wife's children at all?

          25   A.     Not that I -- I let them have -- know that it
                                                                     64



           1   should be impacting our relationship, if you know what I

           2   mean.

           3   Q.     I'm not really sure I understand.  Can you explain

           4   that a little bit more.

           5   A.     Well, I don't -- I don't walk around crying about

           6   my accident.  They have their own issues in life, so I

           7   keep mine to myself.

           8   Q.     Has the accident affected your ability to take care

           9   of your property at all?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     Tell me how that -- how that's been affected.

          12   A.     I was unable to take care of the property on Hughes

          13   Road, so we decided to sell that property and move into

          14   this carriage home.

          15   Q.     But for the accident, would you have moved into the

          16   carriage home?

          17   A.     I think we liked our home on 190 Hughes Road.

          18   Q.     What were you unable to take care of on your

          19   property?

          20   A.     The landscaping, daily outside maintenance, leaves,

          21   snow.

          22   Q.     Had you ever hired somebody to do the landscaping

          23   on your property at Hughes Road either before or after the

          24   accident?

          25   A.     Funds did not permit that.
                                                                     65



           1   Q.     What about before the accident?  Did somebody do

           2   the landscaping on Hughes Road before the accident?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     Did you ever hire anybody to do any kind of the

           5   leaf-raking or the snow on the -- at the house on Hughes

           6   Road?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     And not before or after the accident?

           9   A.     No.

          10   Q.     And after the accident, the reason that you didn't

          11   hire anybody, is that because funds did not permit it?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     Did you do any kind of leaf-raking at your house

          14   after the date of the accident?

          15   A.     Raking?

          16   Q.     Yeah.

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     So who did the leaf-raking after the accident?

          19   A.     Well, it was a power machine.

          20   Q.     Oh.  You did like a -- a blowing --

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Is that how you would normally clear the leaves?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     So after the accident, were you still able to do

          25   the leaf-blowing?
                                                                     66



           1   A.     Well, I had to.

           2   Q.     So it -- it didn't prevent you from doing it

           3   altogether?

           4   A.     It limited the amount of time I could spend doing

           5   it, it would seem like.

           6   Q.     After the accident, who was responsible for

           7   shoveling the snow?

           8   A.     I am.

           9   Q.     Before and after the accident?

          10   A.     We -- we don't so much shovel, but it was a

          11   snowblower.

          12   Q.     And after the accident, you were still able to use

          13   the snowblower, right?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     Do you have any other -- any other things in your

          16   life that have been affected by the accident?  I mean I

          17   know we kind of talked about, obviously, your external

          18   home chores.  Anything else that you want to tell me about

          19   that's been affected by the accident?

          20   A.     My sleep.

          21   Q.     How's your sleep been affected?

          22   A.     It's usually, at best, two hours on one side.  I

          23   wake up and move.  At worst, an hour -- an hourly move.

          24   Q.     Anything else other than sleep?

          25   A.     I don't walk as fast.  Sleep is -- sleep kind of
                                                                     67



           1   goes along with the whole depression thing that we spoke

           2   of earlier, you know?  It's -- I wake up every 60 minutes

           3   to 120 minutes to move to try to relieve some pressure.

           4   Q.     Any other ways that this accident has affected you?

           5   A.     That's one of -- that's about the worst.

           6   Q.     Well, I'm not asking for just the worst.  I'm

           7   asking for any way that it's affected you.

           8   A.     Not off the top of my mind, no.

           9   Q.     Is there anything that you used to be able to do

          10   before the accident that you absolutely cannot do now?

          11   A.     Well, I carried my granddaughter through Disney

          12   World for five days, but I don't think I could do that

          13   now.

          14   Q.     When did you go to Disney with your granddaughter?

          15   A.     That would have been 2009.

          16   Q.     Have you been back to Disney at all since then?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Have you taken any vacations since the date of the

          19   accident?

          20   A.     Since the accident, no.

          21   Q.     What's the last vacation that you've taken?

          22   A.     I believe it was in 2016 that my wife and I went to

          23   Williamsburg with her sister.  She has a time-share in

          24   Williamsburg, and her husband had just passed away, so the

          25   three of us went there.
                                                                     68



           1   Q.     Has this accident in any way prevented you from

           2   taking vacations, or has it just not worked out?

           3   A.     My wife is kind of a full-time babysitter with the

           4   grandchildren, so...

           5   Q.     So not being able to take a vacation is not related

           6   to this accident?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     Have you had any problems with personal hygiene as

           9   a result of the accident?

          10   A.     No.

          11   Q.     Have you had any problems dressing yourself as a

          12   result of the accident?

          13   A.     It's a little tougher to put on socks and shoes

          14   some days, but as far as the rest, I'm pretty good.

          15   Q.     Has this accident impacted your relationship with

          16   your wife in any way?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Have you ever been a member of any kind of health

          19   club or gym?

          20   A.     If it was, it's a very, very, very long time ago.

          21   Q.     You didn't have like an active membership around

          22   the time of the accident?

          23   A.     No.  I'm -- I'm guilty because I have the

          24   SilverSneakers, and I need to take advantage of it.

          25   Q.     The house that you -- I guess we'll start with the
                                                                     69



           1   house on Hughes Road first.  The house on Hughes Road,

           2   were there stairs in that house?

           3   A.     It was split-level.

           4   Q.     Did the accident in any way impact your ability to

           5   go up and down the stairs?

           6   A.     I use the banister a lot more.

           7   Q.     Do you still have to use the banister, or have you

           8   kind of recovered from that?

           9   A.     No.  I still use the banister a lot more.

          10                  MS. ETTL:  We can go off the record for a

          11   second.

          12                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

          13                  MS. ETTL:  I do not have any other

          14   questions.  Or actually, hold on.

          15   BY MS. ETTL:

          16   Q.     Who was your primary care doctor before Dr. Weber?

          17   You don't remember?

          18   A.     I --

          19   Q.     Was it on Sproul Road in Broomall?

          20   A.     I -- I probably did not have a primary care doctor.

          21   Q.     Okay.

          22   A.     And then, through work, they give you like a list

          23   of doctors to choose from, and I chose Dr. Weber.

          24   Q.     Gotcha.

          25                  MS. ETTL:  Okay.  I have no other
                                                                     70



           1   questions, then.

           2                  MR. DALY:  Great.  I don't have anything.

           3                  (Witness excused.)

 1                    P R O C E E D I N G S

 2                 (Proceedings resumed at 1:39 p.m.)

 3                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on the

 4  record at 1:39 p.m.

 5                 MR. SIMONS:  When we left, I think there

 6  were a number of items that you were going to look at.

 7  Are we going to go back to those?

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Yes.

 9                 MR. SIMONS:  Okay.

10                 MR. SAMMI:  You had identified to us

11  items on our privilege log that you had further

12  questions on.  We, the lawyers, have gone back and tried

13  to look at those on our own, and so what we'll do is if

14  you'd like to go through them with the witness, you can

15  go through with the witness, and she can add any

16  non-privileged information that you may be entitled to.

17  Otherwise, she's not going to obviously provide --

18                 MR. SIMONS:  Sure.

19                 MR. SAMMI:  -- any attorney-client

20  privileged information.

21                 MR. SIMONS:  Not a problem.

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I think if you go back to

23  Exhibit 220.  And the next item that we were going to

24  look at was item 158, I believe, which was on page 25, I

25  believe.
                                                         160



 1       A    The first 25?

 2       Q    The first 25, 25A.

 3                 And the question is simply do you know

 4  which contract this refers to?

 5       A    That would have been -- actually, I'm not

 6  sure.

 7       Q    Okay.  What about number 209?  This is on page

 8  33, February 9th, 2018.

 9       A    That would have been the SOW --

10       Q    Okay.

11       A    -- with Zest.

12       Q    All right.

13                 MR. SAMMI:  2018?

14                 THE WITNESS:  2018.

15                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So if we go forward to number

17  297.  297 is on the 13th page, the second 13.  It looks

18  like 297 is -- actually, I --

19                 MR. SAMMI:  Yeah.

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  298 through 301.

21                 MR. SAMMI:  I --

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  297 is Mr. Bohling.

23                 MR. SAMMI:  Yeah.  Michael, I understood

24  you to mean 298 through 301.

25                 MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.  That is correct.
                                                         161



 1       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So these refer to a Deloitte

 2  contract.  Do you know which Deloitte this was?  Was it

 3  waste, speed?

 4       A    Speed.

 5       Q    Speed.  Okay.

 6                 All right.  And then going forward to

 7  326, page 17.  This is the one, I think, that we had

 8  spoken briefly about before.  I think, you said you have

 9  not -- you haven't sought to obtain a patent or file a

10  patent application that you can recall?

11       A    I can't recall that, no.

12       Q    Did this have to do with somebody else's

13  patent, not your own?

14       A    I don't remember.

15       Q    Okay.  What about No. 327 through 31, next

16  page, page 18?  These all just say regarding

17  intellectual property.  Do you have anymore detail on

18  what this relates to?

19       A    No.  I don't remember.

20       Q    Okay.  What about 358 and 59?  It's on page

21  23.  Business ventures, 1/18/2018.  Do you know what

22  that refers to?

23       A    That would have been the SOW.

24       Q    Okay.  All right.

25       A    Okay.  Go.
                                                         162



 1       Q    Yeah.  We'll get to it in a little bit, 221.

 2                  (Exhibit 221 was marked)

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Michael, this deposition is

 4  still under individual capacity?

 5                 MR. SIMONS:  Yes.

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Besides the exhibit, did you

 8  talk to Zest about the work that ATK was doing with you?

 9       A    I do not remember specific conversations.

10       Q    Okay.  So you don't recall telling them about

11  the ATK work?

12       A    Not right now.

13       Q    Okay.  Looking at 221, this is a series of

14  emails about an ATK proposal.  Your email is at the very

15  top there, 12/2/2016, correct?

16       A    Yes.

17       Q    And it looks like ATK sent a proposal back in

18  2015.  If you look at the --

19       A    Yep.

20       Q    -- first couple of emails.  And then that was

21  -- I guess, they did not do the work in 2015, correct?

22       A    I would -- was not employed.  I don't know

23  what they did.

24       Q    Okay.  Well, at the top, you say, This was the

25  ATK deck I referenced.  This is a proposal to do the
                                                         163



 1  work that we are looking to do.  Not the actual work.

 2  Just a proposal to do the work and the scope.  Correct?

 3       A    That's correct.

 4       Q    Okay.  So you're not aware of them having done

 5  the work in 2015, correct?

 6       A    I'm not aware of what they did in 2015.

 7       Q    Okay.  And it looks like you were sending the

 8  proposal around again in 2016.  Did you send it around

 9  because you were planning to have them do some work in

10  2016?

11       A    This -- no.

12       Q    Why did you send it around?

13       A    It just says it's a proposal of the work we're

14  looking to do.  It does not specifically say work that

15  I'm looking ATK to do.

16       Q    Got it.  Did you eventually ask ATK to do work

17  that was similar to the proposal that you circulated?

18       A    Massively different scope and not necessarily

19  even remotely related.

20       Q    Okay.  So the only connection, I guess, is it

21  was ATK?

22       A    Correct.

23                  (Exhibit 222 was marked)

24       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So I'm showing you what's

25  been marked as Exhibit 222.
                                                         164



 1       A    Yes.

 2       Q    This is an email from you to Mr. Cherian in

 3  April of 2017 with an attachment called, Architectural

 4  Design Considerations Overview.

 5       A    Correct.

 6       Q    Is this something that ATK helped you prepare

 7  or produce?

 8       A    This entire document?

 9       Q    Yes.  Did they help you prepare the entire

10  document?  And if not, did they help you prepare a

11  portion of it?

12       A    So this is not my document, as I recall.

13       Q    So whose is it?

14       A    I'm not sure where it would have originated.

15       Q    So if you look at the email just before your

16  email on the first page.

17       A    Uh-huh.

18       Q    It's from Lewis -- Justin Lewis at ATK.

19       A    Yes.

20       Q    It looks like he sent it to you, and then you

21  sent it to Mr. Cherian.

22       A    He sent it to a large group of people.

23       Q    Right.  You plus a number of people, correct?

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    And then you forwarded it on to Mr. Cherian.
                                                         165



 1  Why did you sent it to Mr. Cherian?

 2       A    I'm sure as an FYI.

 3       Q    So does that refresh your recollection at all

 4  as to whether ATK was involved in helping prepare this

 5  material?

 6       A    At least what I see here, they prepared this

 7  material.

 8       Q    Okay.  And did they prepare it at your request

 9  or at someone else's request?

10       A    This is when ATK was working and being paid

11  for by someone other than me.

12       Q    Okay.  Do you know who it was that was --

13       A    Rob Fasillo.

14       Q    Rob Fasillo.  And who is he?

15       A    He's the second person on the email list.

16       Q    Right.  And what is his role at Walmart?

17       A    He's a VP in technology.  His role at this

18  particular time, I'm not sure.

19       Q    Okay.  And did you work with Rob Fasillo after

20  this material was prepared?

21       A    During.  Current -- yeah.

22       Q    Okay.

23       A    Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24       Q    What role did you have in working with Rob

25  with regard to the exhibit in Exhibit 222?
                                                         166



 1       A    I was the business partner.

 2       Q    Okay.  And in connection with that, did ATK

 3  provide any other reports or deliverables associated

 4  with this project?

 5       A    Yes.

 6       Q    What were the other deliverables that they

 7  provided?

 8       A    There was the -- at the end of their contract

 9  or time, there was another larger deck.

10       Q    Okay.  And what was the -- was that an

11  expansion on this, the deck that's attached here or

12  something entirely different?

13       A    I would say this was a subset.

14       Q    Okay.  So it's just a bigger, more complete

15  set.

16       A    (Witness nods head.)

17       Q    And what was your understanding of what the

18  objective of this ATK work was?

19       A    As I mentioned earlier, evaluating the systems

20  that move our product.  They were inadequate.  And so we

21  did a full systems analysis of all the different domains

22  to see what was needed to have the correct digital

23  connection of moving product.

24       Q    And when you say product, is that -- you're

25  talking about fresh product because that's --
                                                         167



 1       A    Any -- any kind of product because -- in this

 2  world, it was fresh, but it sometimes is -- you know, it

 3  can be a can of something too.

 4       Q    But in this particular instance --

 5       A    It was fresh.

 6       Q    -- fresh --

 7       A    Correct.

 8       Q    -- because that's what you're responsible for?

 9       A    Yes.  That's correct.

10       Q    And in connection with this work, did you

11  provide ATK with any materials to assist them in their

12  analysis?

13       A    So yes.

14       Q    What materials did you provide them?

15       A    I am not sure to the extent.  I just remember

16  them needing information.

17       Q    Okay.

18                  (Exhibit 223 was marked)

19       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So I'm showing you what's

20  been marked as Exhibit 223.  Do you recall someone named

21  John Piatek at ATK?

22       A    I do.

23       Q    What was your working relationship with John?

24       A    I believe he was working on the project.

25       Q    Okay.  And it looks like at the top of this
                                                         168



 1  email, Mr. Piatek is sending you something that's called

 2  an External Perspective Summary.  Is this the larger

 3  deliverable that you referred to a moment ago?

 4       A    I don't know if this is the final but this is

 5  a larger version of the one before and it's later.

 6       Q    Okay.  So there was -- this may be the final.

 7  Maybe there's another one that's --

 8       A    Right.

 9       Q    -- the later.  Would the latest one, the last

10  date, be the one that would be the final?

11       A    I would assume so.

12       Q    And if you turn to the page that's Bates

13  labeled WM000021212.  It's kind of halfway through, my

14  best guess.

15       A    Yeah.

16       Q    Page 36.  Did you provide any information to

17  ATK related to this particular slide?

18       A    I would have absolutely no idea.

19       Q    Okay.

20       A    When we provided the information, it was

21  typically early on.  This was many months later.  I

22  don't know.

23       Q    Okay.  So you wouldn't be able to say how the

24  information you provided was ultimately integrated or

25  used?
                                                         169



 1       A    Me, personally?  I didn't personally --

 2       Q    Okay.

 3       A    -- provide information that I can recall.

 4       Q    Did your team provide information?

 5       A    May have.

 6       Q    Okay.

 7       A    That's what I was speaking to.

 8       Q    Got it.  And was there a meeting or some kind

 9  of presentation that was done at the end of this process

10  with ATK to talk about their conclusions?

11       A    I don't remember specifically.

12       Q    What do you remember about this work, the work

13  that they did and the conclusions that they reached?

14       A    They -- they validated the fact that our

15  systems were not good.

16       Q    Okay.  Anything else?  Did you need that kind

17  of -- did you need that validation?

18       A    We did actually.

19       Q    Okay.

20       A    They also specifically called out what needed

21  to happen to upgrade those systems, so that we could be

22  better at supply chain.

23       Q    Got it.

24                  (Exhibit 224 was marked)

25       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  This is 224.  This is an
                                                         170



 1  email from Tiffany Benitez to Mr. Cherian and then

 2  copying you and a few other people, correct?

 3       A    Hold on a minute.

 4       Q    Sure.

 5       A    I'm going to read this quickly.

 6       Q    Yep.

 7       A    Yes.

 8       Q    And in the first sentence of the email, it

 9  says, I have the most updated copy attached.  I believe

10  it was sent to me by Manish a week ago.  None of the

11  above charters that we have work in, except B1, have

12  anyone listed.  I did add Josh Bohling for B1.  He was

13  on that charter.

14                 And my question is what is a charter at

15  Walmart?

16       A    At this point in time, the way that we managed

17  projects is when a concept was being explored, it would

18  get a charter.

19       Q    And is -- what was the purpose of having a

20  charter?

21       A    To identify work that was being explored.

22       Q    And this suggests that you would have people

23  listed on the charter.  Is that your understanding?

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form and

25  foundation.
                                                         171



 1       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  It says, I did add Josh

 2  Bohling for B1.  He was on that charter.

 3       A    I don't know what she means by "on that

 4  charter."  I don't know if he was named in the charter

 5  or if he penned the charter.  I don't know.

 6       Q    Okay.  And typically, have you done a charter

 7  for some project?

 8       A    I have not, huh-uh.

 9       Q    Is this the way that things are still done now

10  or --

11       A    No.

12       Q    -- is there some difference?

13       A    Stage-Gate.

14       Q    So what's a State Gate?

15       A    A Stage-Gate zero would be similar to a

16  charter, where you would go and propose to work on

17  something, so that you know whether or not it's okay to

18  work on it.

19       Q    Okay.

20       A    It doesn't -- it doesn't mean you're working

21  on it.  It doesn't -- it's a -- it's a initial -- should

22  we -- should we be looking at this.

23       Q    So would it be accurate to say that the

24  charter would be -- at the time the charters were used

25  or the initial document that would say, hey, this is
                                                         172



 1  something we're looking at; it's okay for people to work

 2  on this?

 3       A    It does not assume okay to work on.  It just

 4  says we're looking at this.

 5       Q    Okay.  Is there anything that would come

 6  before a charter?

 7       A    Well, this process changed soon after this,

 8  and I was new to it, so I don't know officially.

 9       Q    Okay.  So your -- I guess a better question

10  for you is are you aware of anything that would come

11  before a charter?

12       A    No.

13       Q    And then -- so now, the process is Stage-Gate,

14  correct?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    And the first thing in the Stage-Gate process

17  is Stage-Gate 0?

18       A    That's correct.

19       Q    Which I think you said was equivalent to the

20  old charter, as far as you know.

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    And are there other Stage-Gates?

23       A    This is going to sound familiar.  Stage-Gate 1

24  is a POC.

25       Q    Okay.
                                                         173



 1       A    Stage-Gate 2 is a pilot.  Stage-Gate 3 is

 2  deployment.  And Stage-Gate 4 would be post-pilot and

 3  post-deployment analysis.

 4       Q    Post-pilot, post-deployment?

 5       A    Yes.  Analysis.  How did you do?

 6       Q    Got it.  So -- and is this process, does it

 7  have to be followed in every instance?

 8       A    Yes.

 9       Q    And when did this process get instituted,

10  Stage-Gate process?

11       A    It is something that Greg Smith brought to him

12  -- brought with him.  And so he came in December of '16,

13  I believe, so sometime after that.

14       Q    Is this a process that's only used in Greg

15  Smith's organization or is it used across Walmart?

16       A    It's used in other functions.  I don't believe

17  it's a standard.

18       Q    Okay.  And is a standard something specific at

19  Walmart?

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I'm just trying to

22  understand, you said it's not a standard.  I was

23  wondering are there some things at Walmart that are

24  called standards that are required to be used across the

25  organization, some official --
                                                         174



 1       A    When I said standard, I mean, like, you and I

 2  would use it.

 3       Q    Okay.  Nothing -- doesn't have a special

 4  meaning at Walmart?

 5       A    No.

 6       Q    Okay.  You're in Greg Smith's organization,

 7  right?

 8       A    Yes.

 9       Q    So this would apply to you?

10       A    Yes.

11       Q    And the projects that you do?

12       A    That's correct.

13       Q    Okay.  When you do Stage-Gate 0 for a

14  particular project, do you put together a document that

15  describes what you're working on and how it's -- you

16  know, sort of, what the proposal is?

17       A    That's correct.

18       Q    And is it --

19       A    It -- so remember, still, it's not what you're

20  working on because you wouldn't go to Stage-Gate 0 with

21  something you're already working on.

22       Q    Fair enough.

23       A    So you would say here's something we're

24  looking at.  Here's where we potentially see value.

25  Should we put resources against this.
                                                         175



 1       Q    Got it.  And so for any projects that are

 2  going on within your organization, we should see a

 3  Stage-Gate process for those projects?

 4       A    Any time after mid-2017.

 5       Q    Fair point.  And is there, sort of, a central

 6  repository for these types of document, the Stage-Gate

 7  documents?

 8       A    I have not seen it.

 9       Q    When you prepare -- well, let me step back.

10  Have you prepared documents related to the Stage-Gate

11  process?

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    Okay.  When you prepare them, what do you do

14  with them?

15       A    I present them in the supply chair SteerCo.

16       Q    Okay.  And after that, what happens to them?

17       A    The PMO, which is the project management

18  office or program management office, they organize those

19  meetings.  I have no idea if they keep them or what.  I

20  don't know what they do with them.

21       Q    Okay.  So when you bring them to the SteerCo,

22  they go to the PMO and PMO is responsible for the

23  Stage-Gate process?

24       A    No.

25       Q    Okay.
                                                         176



 1       A    I put -- I prepare the documents.  I send them

 2  to the PMO.  They put them on the screen while I'm

 3  speaking.  I get the approval or not, and we either move

 4  on or we ditch the idea.

 5       Q    Okay.  And if you get approval for Stage-Gate

 6  0, you have to come back to the SteerCo for Gate 1, Gate

 7  2, Gate 3, Gate 4 --

 8       A    Yes.

 9       Q    -- each time?

10       A    Yes.

11       Q    So each time there's some kind of a document

12  that would talk about the next Gate?

13       A    Yes.

14       Q    Okay.  And the same process is used for each

15  Gate?

16       A    In general, yes.

17       Q    Okay.  Do you have to go to another place,

18  like, you have to get go to the Legacy committee or

19  something like that for certain levels of Gating?  Or is

20  it all at the steering committee.

21       A    For the supply chain, you would need to go to

22  supply chain.

23       Q    Okay.  And if you wanted to find these Gate

24  documents, where would -- would you go to the PMO?

25  Would that be the first place that you would look if
                                                         177



 1  you're trying to find them?

 2       A    I would look in my emails and in my files.

 3       Q    Fair point.  But if you were looking for some

 4  that were supply chain-related maybe that you didn't

 5  prepare yourself.

 6       A    I'd have no idea where I would go, unless I

 7  knew the person who was running the project.  I would

 8  just go to them.  Like I said before, I do not know of a

 9  repository of where we keep everything.

10       Q    Who is in charge of the supply chain PMO

11  office or -- I don't know if it's an office or --

12       A    Jeff England.

13       Q    Okay.

14                  (Exhibit 225 was marked)

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Look at what's been marked

16  Exhibit 225.  An email from Terri Shiery to Yuri Castano

17  and -- probably going to butcher this name, Sreemoyee

18  Som, dated March 23rd, 2017.  Did you work with Terri

19  Shiery on ATK-related projects?

20       A    ATK-related project -- projects?

21       Q    Projects, yes.

22       A    Yes.

23       Q    Okay.  What was the working relationship

24  between you and Terri with respect to work that ATK was

25  doing?
                                                         178



 1       A    She -- so it was the body of work we talked

 2  about earlier.

 3       Q    Yes.

 4       A    She was on the ISD side and part of the

 5  project team.

 6       Q    Got it.  And you were, sort of -- you were on

 7  the --

 8       A    The business partner.

 9       Q    The business partner.  And did you ever ask

10  her to send information about Zest to ATK?

11       A    Nope.

12       Q    Do you know why she forwarded this information

13  on to ATK?

14       A    I do not.

15       Q    Okay.  Would she have -- in the -- in your

16  working relationship, would she have been the lead on

17  the ATK project or would you have been the lead or was

18  there some different kind of relationship?

19       A    Neither of us would have been the lead.  I was

20  the business partner and Rob Fasillo was hiring them.

21       Q    Okay.  So there's Rob Fasillo, you're the

22  business partner and then Terri Shiery was the --

23       A    One of many on the business team.

24       Q    Okay.

25       A    On the ISD team.
                                                         179



 1       Q    On the ISD -- Terri Shiery was on the ISD

 2  team?

 3       A    Yeah.  Yes.  Sorry.  I misspoke.

 4                  (Exhibit 226 was marked)

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I have what's been marked as

 6  Exhibit 226.  The top is another email from Terri Shiery

 7  to Yuri Castano, but if you go down to the bottom of the

 8  first page, there's --

 9       A    Let me -- can I read it right quick?

10       Q    Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Go ahead.

11       A    Thank you.  Okay.

12       Q    So if you go to the email at the bottom of the

13  first page, it's from Marsha David to you on

14  January 6th, 2017, correct?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    And it's attaching RFI responses from Emerson

17  Inteligistics, Intelliflex and Sensitech, right?

18       A    Correct.

19       Q    And I -- it's in response to an email that you

20  sent on the second page of Exhibit 226, right?

21       A    Correct.

22       Q    You're asking her to put together the details

23  of the four providers, right?

24       A    Correct.

25       Q    Were you asking her to put these together so
                                                         180



 1  they could be sent to ATK to be part of the analysis?

 2       A    No.

 3       Q    Okay.

 4       A    Not that I remember.

 5       Q    So -- but it looks like if you look up in the

 6  chain, that is what occurred, right?

 7       A    Hold on one second.

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.

 9       A    That may be what occurred, yes.

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  But you don't recall

11  any conversations with Terri Shiery or Marsha David

12  about sending these on to ATK?

13       A    I do not recall.

14       Q    Okay.  But it looks like they were sent to

15  ATK, correct?

16       A    Looks that way.

17       Q    Did you have any conversations with ATK about

18  these RFI responses?

19       A    Not that I can remember.

20       Q    Okay.  Do you remember any analysis that ATK

21  did related to these RFI responses?

22       A    I don't.

23       Q    Was ATK part of the process of reviewing these

24  RFI responses or making decisions about these RFI

25  responses?
                                                         181



 1       A    Not that I have any recollection.

 2       Q    Not that you're aware of?

 3       A    No.

 4       Q    Did you ever tell Zest that the RFI responses

 5  were being sent along to ATK?

 6       A    I didn't know they were.

 7       Q    Okay.  So naturally, you wouldn't have told

 8  them if you didn't know they were, correct?

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Is that a yes?

11       A    I don't know.  Was it a question?

12       Q    Yeah.  No.  The -- I guess if you didn't know

13  they were, you wouldn't -- certainly wouldn't have told

14  Zest that they were being sent along, right?

15                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

16       A    Correct.

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  If you can go back to

18  Exhibit 201, I guess we'll see how good we are with our

19  stacks here.

20                 THE WITNESS:  All right.  I'm going to

21  lift.  Can you pull that out?

22                 MR. SAMMI:  Yep.

23                 THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

24       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  See if I can find mine.  So

25  Exhibit 201 is a document that we looked at earlier
                                                         182



 1  today emailed between you and Jon Fox, Stephen Steele

 2  and Denise Sharpe, with the subject line:  Zest

 3  confidential.  Please do not forward.  Right?

 4       A    Correct.

 5       Q    And in the email at the bottom of the first

 6  page, which we looked at earlier, I want to focus on the

 7  first paragraph of that email.  It says in the third

 8  sentence, We will give them 50 percent of their Deloitte

 9  investment, and we will give them a small consulting

10  engagement for the first or second quarter, 25k-ish.  Do

11  you see that?

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    So the purpose of the statement of work in

14  2018 was to give them 50 percent of their Deloitte

15  investment back, right?

16       A    Are you talking -- referring to this email or

17  some other time?

18       Q    No.  This email.

19       A    So this email does not say that.

20       Q    Okay.  What does it say?

21       A    It just says we would give them money, and

22  that they would work for 250.

23       Q    Okay.  How much was 50 percent of the Deloitte

24  investment?

25       A    Approximately, one-and-a-half million.
                                                         183



 1       Q    Okay.  And that was the ultimate amount for

 2  the statement of work, right, was one-and-a-half

 3  million?

 4       A    That is correct.

 5       Q    Yeah.  There's a copy of it right there if you

 6  need to refer to it.

 7       A    Yep.

 8       Q    Yeah.

 9       A    That happened after this.

10       Q    Okay.  So at this particular point in time,

11  was it contemplated that there was going to be 1.75?

12       A    There were two things that we were talking

13  about.  One of them was a payment, one of them was work.

14       Q    Okay.  Or, at least, at this time, the payment

15  was 1.5, roughly, for half of the Deloitte investment,

16  right?

17       A    So I don't know the specifics on how much the

18  total was.  It could be that 50 percent was 1.5 and 250.

19  I don't know the specific math.  I could look at the

20  contract and tell you -- the original Deloitte contact

21  and tell you, but I know that in aggregate, I want part

22  of the negotiations.  This is what was, at this point in

23  time, I was told you were going to do.

24       Q    Got it.  And who told you that?

25       A    Ed Oldham.
                                                         184



 1       Q    Okay.  Was he the one who was responsible for

 2  making the decision regarding that --

 3       A    He did the negotiations.

 4       Q    Okay.  Do you know who -- what was Jon Fox's

 5  role, if any?

 6       A    He -- so after the negotiations, came to these

 7  conclusions.  We needed to -- let me back up.

 8  Negotiations came to these conclusions.  Zest had

 9  requested, instead of being just paid, to work.  So I

10  had to go and ask around for work that Zest could do, so

11  we could accommodate their request.

12       Q    And did Jon Fox have some role in that?

13       A    Uh-huh.

14       Q    What was his role?

15       A    He gave me some ideas.

16       Q    Okay.  So Ed Oldham did the negotiations.  Who

17  ultimately made the decision of proving the negotiations

18  that Ed Oldham, if there was somebody besides him?

19       A    So I would say that there was a recommendation

20  that came forward and it went through the hierarchy

21  beyond Ed.

22       Q    And --

23       A    So Kath, Greg, Greg.

24       Q    And when you say Kath, you're saying Kathryn

25  McLay?
                                                         185



 1       A    Correct.

 2       Q    Greg is Greg Smith?

 3       A    Correct.

 4       Q    And then Greg is Greg Foran?

 5       A    That's correct.

 6       Q    What about Ms. Sharpe, did she have any role

 7  in this process?

 8       A    The negotiation process?

 9       Q    The process related to the statement of work.

10                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to form.

11       A    Creating the statement of work?

12       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I -- I'm not sure.  Just the

13  whole -- she's copied on some of these emails.  I'm just

14  curious if she played some role in the process.

15       A    She was very engaged in Cold Chain, so I'm

16  sure I was communicating to her what was going on.

17       Q    Was it just to keep her up to speed?

18       A    It looks that way.

19       Q    What about Stephen Steele.  Is that the same?

20       A    He worked for Jon Fox.

21       Q    And what was his role in this process, if any?

22       A    He -- probably, just an FYI also.

23       Q    Can we go to Exhibit 227, which is in front of

24  you.

25       A    This one?
                                                         186



 1       Q    Yes.

 2       A    Yep.

 3                 (Exhibit 227 was marked)

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  This is the actual statement

 5  of work, correct?

 6       A    That's correct.

 7       Q    Now, if you take a look at the first paragraph

 8  of the statement of work, the second sentence says, This

 9  statement of work shall be governed by the master

10  services agreement effective as of September 28, 2016 as

11  amended the agreement.  Do you see that?

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    Have you seen a September 28, 2016 master

14  services agreement?

15       A    I have not.

16       Q    Okay.  Do you know if one exists?

17       A    I know we have a master services agreement.  I

18  do not know if one exists from that particular date.

19       Q    Okay.  Do you have any reason to believe that

20  one exists?  Besides having -- or you haven't seen it,

21  but do you have any reason to believe there is one that

22  has this date?

23       A    I don't understand the question.

24       Q    Right.  So --

25       A    I have no additional information other than
                                                         187



 1  that to tell me what the actual date is.  I do know we

 2  have a master services agreement.

 3       Q    Got it.  So you're -- but you're not aware of

 4  one dated September 28th, 2016?

 5       A    Not specifically.

 6       Q    Okay.  If you go to the bottom of the second

 7  page of Exhibit 227.

 8       A    Yes.

 9       Q    Under specifications, there is some

10  language --

11       A    Uh-huh.

12       Q    -- that's bold and all caps.  It says, Legal

13  needs the business to review and refine the highlighted

14  language as deemed appropriate to reflect the services.

15  Do you see that statement?

16       A    I do.

17       Q    Do you know what that statement refers to or

18  means?

19       A    It just looks like something that wasn't taken

20  out of one of the drafts.  I'm sure someone highlighted

21  something and said look at this and forgot to erase it

22  in the end.

23       Q    Who was responsible for actually drafting this

24  document?

25       A    There was several people involved.
                                                         188



 1       Q    Who were those people?

 2       A    Would have been Jon, myself.  I'm sure Ed took

 3  a look at it.  Legal clearly was very engaged.

 4       Q    Is there a particular person in legal who you

 5  were working with on this project?

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  You can answer that.

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yes.  Don't tell me the

 8  substance.  Just do you know their name.

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  And thank you for taking it

10  slow whenever you hear things about lawyers and legal.

11  I appreciate that.

12                 THE WITNESS:  You guys are special.

13       A    David Winfrey.

14       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  And did you work with him

15  just on this particular project, or did you work with

16  him on a lot of agreements or -- that you --

17       A    I don't remember anything beyond this

18  particular one, actually, for David.

19       Q    Okay.  If you look at the first page of

20  Exhibit 227, the total amounts listed here is

21  1.5 million, correct?

22       A    Oh, is that the first page?  Yeah.

23       Q    Yes.

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    The first page.  Actually, going back, was
                                                         189



 1  there -- you know, with the comments being left in, was

 2  the process of getting this finished a process where

 3  there was a rush or something that would have caused the

 4  comments to be left in or it's just a quick process, so

 5  you didn't have time to -- you or whoever else was

 6  supposed to review it didn't have time to look at it?

 7       A    I can't speak to who did the final.  And I did

 8  not sign this.  And so I had input.  I can't -- I have

 9  no idea.

10       Q    Okay.  And it looks like it was signed by

11  Kathryn McLay, right?

12       A    Correct.

13       Q    Were you the one who was actually shepherding

14  it through the process, if that's a good description?

15       A    I worked with legal and the team to make sure

16  that legal continued to move through the steps.

17       Q    So it -- is it reasonable to say that you were

18  kind of shepherding it through, even if you were not the

19  final reviewer or the final signer?

20       A    I don't know if shepherding -- I mean,

21  shepherding is, like, what does that mean?

22       Q    That's a fair point.  I'll just leave your

23  description.  You describe what you did.  I -- after I

24  asked the question, I thought, oh --

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Means holding a staff and
                                                         190



 1  wearing a robe.

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Were there sheep involved?

 3       A    Right.

 4       Q    It's fine.  We'll just do with your

 5  description of what you did.  So going back to the first

 6  page of Exhibit 227, 1.5 million is the total amount

 7  listed, right?

 8       A    That's correct.

 9       Q    Walmart didn't actually pay that full amount,

10  right?

11       A    I believe we withheld a payment, the last

12  payment, due to nondeliverables.

13       Q    Okay.  And that -- that was going to be my

14  next question.  Why -- first of all, were you involved

15  in the decision to not make the payment?

16       A    I was made aware.

17       Q    Who made you aware?

18       A    I don't think it was the person who didn't do

19  it, but I believe Chris Borrows is the person who told

20  me.

21       Q    Okay.  And what did Chris relate to you?  What

22  did he tell you?

23                 MR. SAMMI:  And Chris Borrows is part of

24  legal or was he --

25                 THE WITNESS:  No.
                                                         191



 1                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.  And he --

 2                 THE WITNESS:  He's ISD.

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.  You can answer this

 4  question to the extent your answer doesn't reveal any

 5  communications that Chris or anybody else might have

 6  been passing along to you from legal.  Do you understand

 7  that distinction?

 8                 THE WITNESS:  I do.

 9       A    So what's your question again?

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  My question is you

11  said that Chris Borrows is the one who told you that

12  payment had been stopped.  And I'm just asking you to

13  relate that conversation.  What did he say when you had

14  that conversation with him?

15       A    I literally think he just said to me, we're

16  withholding payment basis not getting the deliverable.

17       Q    And was there a specific deliverable that he

18  was referring to?

19       A    That, I do not remember.

20       Q    Okay.  And do you know if it was just one

21  payment that was withheld or two?

22       A    I don't know specifically.  The fact that

23  you're asking makes me wonder.

24       Q    Okay.  But you just had this one conversation

25  with Chris about that?
                                                         192



 1       A    I'm sure I'm -- I'm -- it's -- it's getting

 2  all tangled --

 3       Q    Okay.

 4       A    -- into what happened at that exact time.

 5       Q    Sure.

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  And -- and the witness is

 7  looking over at me and thank you for that because I'll

 8  just give you a cautionary instruction, based upon your

 9  feeling, which you're right about.  If it's difficult

10  for you to separate out what might be thoughts or

11  impressions or instructions of lawyers at Walmart, I

12  want you to leave that out of your answers and not

13  divulge that.  And if you can't separate it in your

14  answers, I'm going to tell you not to answer the

15  question but do your best.

16       Q    So yeah, obviously, I'm not asking for

17  communications that you had with lawyers.

18       A    Correct.

19       Q    Did you have other conversations, not with

20  lawyers, about this stopping payment and the

21  deliverables that Walmart felt were not provided?

22       A    Given the timing of what you're talking about,

23  I really -- I can't separate it.

24       Q    Okay.  You can't separate the conversations

25  that you had with --
                                                         193



 1       A    Because --

 2       Q    -- people from the ones you had with lawyers,

 3  nonlawyers?

 4       A    No, no, no, no, no, no.

 5       Q    Okay.

 6       A    I can't separate what I had with others that

 7  may have come from lawyers.

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Yes.

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So just so I can

10  understand, it sounds like you had a number or you had

11  some conversations around this time.  I'm not asking for

12  the detail, just you had conversations, it sounds like,

13  correct?

14       A    Yes.

15       Q    And it sounds like some of those conversations

16  were not with lawyers, correct?

17       A    That is correct.

18       Q    You're just concerned that maybe those people

19  were passing information from lawyers to you, right?

20       A    Correct.

21       Q    And all I want to know is why do you think

22  that they were passing information from lawyers?  Do you

23  have a sense of why you believe that?

24       A    Yes.  So in that -- in the time frame that

25  you're talking about, that that would have been
                                                         194



 1  withheld, if I can look at -- what is the date of the

 2  original --

 3       Q    Date of the statement of work.

 4                 THE WITNESS:  -- complaint?  Original

 5  complaint.

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  Date of the lawsuit was

 7  August .

 8                 MR. SIMONS:  1st?

 9                 THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

10                 MR. SAMMI:  -- 1st, 2018.

11       A    That's why.

12       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Oh, so it's your

13  understanding that it was around that time that the

14  payment was withheld?

15       A    Yes, I believe.  I haven't looked at the

16  documents, but I believe we were paying in equal

17  increments through July.  July would have come to an end

18  and August 1st came along.  And I'm pretty sure it got

19  all tangled into lawyers at that point.

20       Q    Did the conversation that you had that with

21  Chris Borrows happen before August 1st, before the

22  lawsuit was filed?

23       A    That's where I'm not sure.

24       Q    Okay.

25       A    We typically don't pay ahead of time.
                                                         195



 1       Q    Okay.

 2       A    If that make sense.

 3       Q    Is that a policy that you have?

 4       A    Well --

 5                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.

 6       A    I have no idea the policy.  I just know that,

 7  usually, the work is done and then we pay.

 8       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Do you have any other insight

 9  into what deliverables were not provided?

10       A    I don't have the specifics.

11       Q    Okay.  Do you know who would have that

12  information?  Is it Chris Borrows or somebody else?

13       A    My assumption would be Chris.  I don't know

14  for sure.

15       Q    What's your understanding of the -- what

16  happens with a statement of work when the

17  deliverables -- Walmart feels like the deliverables are

18  not provide and then Walmart doesn't pay?  What -- where

19  does that leave a statement of work?

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.  And

21  objection to the extent it calls for a legal conclusion.

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Once again, not asking for a

23  legal opinion.  Just asking for your understanding of

24  where that leaves a statement of work at that point.

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Any statement of work, this
                                                         196



 1  statement of work, whether that's happened before, if

 2  ever?

 3                 MR. SIMONS:  Let's talk about this one,

 4  since it's the one at issue.

 5       A    I would have to read this pretty thoroughly to

 6  tell you my opinion on that.

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So you don't --

 8       A    Do you want me to?

 9       Q    I guess, what I'm --

10                 MR. SAMMI:  I don't want you to interpret

11  a contract.  You're not a lawyer.

12       A    Right.  I mean, I just -- yeah.

13       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So what I'm interested in, do

14  you have an understanding -- separate and apart from

15  lawyers, do you have an understanding of where that

16  leaves a statement of work when Walmart doesn't make the

17  payments that are listed under the statement of work?

18       A    I don't really understand the question.

19       Q    Have you ever had a situation like this before

20  where there was a statement of work and there was a

21  certain amount that was supposed to be paid and that

22  amount was not paid or part of it was not paid?  Have

23  you had a situation like that before?

24       A    I've never had a situation where I did not get

25  a deliverable on an SOW, so I've never had a
                                                         197



 1  statement -- I mean, a situation where the payment

 2  wasn't made, that I am aware of.

 3       Q    Okay.  Is there something -- in the period

 4  that -- before this was signed on February 28th, 2018,

 5  that was the last day of February, there was a

 6  publication that came out March 1st of 2018, right?  Are

 7  you familiar with that publication?

 8       A    Any particular publication?

 9       Q    Yes.  The one related to Eden.

10       A    I am familiar.

11       Q    Okay.  You're aware that that came out the day

12  after this was signed, right?

13       A    It looks like it.

14       Q    Okay.  Were you aware that that publication

15  was being prepared for release when Exhibit 227 was

16  being finalized?

17       A    No.

18                  (Exhibit 228 was marked)

19                 MR. SAMMI:  228?

20                 MR. SIMONS:  228.

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So I'm showing you an exhibit

22  that's been marked Exhibit 228.  It's appears to be an

23  email from Kathryn McLay to you on February 27th, 2018,

24  correct?

25       A    Correct.
                                                         198



 1       Q    And it looks like she is attaching the Eden

 2  blog post that ended up being published on March 1st,

 3  right?

 4       A    Two days later, yeah.

 5       Q    So it looks like you were, in fact, aware of

 6  that blog post that was going to be published before the

 7  statement of work was signed, right?

 8       A    One second.

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  Let me object to the form of

10  the question.  Just for clarity of the record, the

11  signature dates vary on the statement of work.  And one

12  is the 26th of February, the other is the 28th of

13  February.  Just for clarity.

14                 Object to the form of the question.

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  And the question is you were

16  aware that the blog post was being prepared for

17  publication on the 27th before the final signature on

18  the statement of work, correct?

19       A    Before our final signature or before Zest's

20  final signature?

21       Q    Before Zest's signature.

22       A    Yes.  However, I wouldn't have known that they

23  didn't sign it when I sent it until I got it back.

24       Q    Well, you knew that it wasn't -- you knew that

25  it wasn't -- you knew you didn't have a signature until
                                                         199



 1  you received a signature back, right?

 2       A    The right.  It could have been a date and they

 3  emailed it to me.  We were done and we sent it to them

 4  on the 26th.  Or at least I thought it was being sent,

 5  right, because I knew it was signed by Kath.

 6       Q    But, in fact, it wasn't sign and returned to

 7  you until the 28th, right?

 8       A    Correct.

 9       Q    And it's dated the 28th on the first page,

10  right?

11       A    Correct.

12       Q    Did you put that date in?

13       A    No.

14       Q    Do you know who put it in?

15       A    I have no idea.

16       Q    Were you the last person to see this before it

17  went out the door to Zest asking for a signature?

18       A    I have no idea.

19       Q    Well, let me put it a different way.  You sent

20  it to Zest, right, for signature after Kathryn McLay

21  signed it?

22       A    I -- I'm -- I don't know.

23       Q    Okay.

24       A    If -- I might have.  I really don't know.  It

25  could have been Ed, it could have been me, it could have
                                                         200



 1  been Kath's assistant.  I have no idea.

 2       Q    Did you do any review or editing of the blog

 3  post listed in Exhibit 228?

 4       A    No, no.

 5       Q    Were you involved in providing any information

 6  that was ultimately used in the blog post in

 7  Exhibit 228?

 8       A    General, like, what does that mean?

 9       Q    Anything.  I don't know what it might be.  I'm

10  just curious as to whether you provided information,

11  edited the document, talked to someone who you provided

12  information to, to be used in this.  Could be a variety

13  of things.

14       A    Right.  So I'm not sure -- like, I didn't -- I

15  have never seen it until here.  And so what went into

16  it, you would have to ask who wrote it.

17       Q    Did you have a conversation with Mr. Musani

18  about this blog post?

19       A    I really do not remember any conversations on

20  the blog post.

21       Q    Okay.

22       A    I frankly remember being surprised by the blog

23  post.

24       Q    Do you know why it just happens that statement

25  of work was signed on the 28th and then the next day,
                                                         201



 1  the blog post came out?

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

 3       A    I have absolutely no idea.

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  In your view, is it just

 5  coincidence?

 6       A    I have absolutely no idea.

 7       Q    Okay.

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Can we go off?

 9                 MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.  This might be a good

10  time for a break.

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Great.

12                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off the

13  record at 2:40 p.m.

14                 (A break was taken from 2:40 p.m. to 2:56

15                 p.m., 14 minutes)

16                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on the

17  record at 2:56 p.m.

18       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just before we went off the

19  record for a break, I think you said that you were

20  surprised by the blog post.  Do you recall that?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    Why were you surprised?

23       A    I don't remember getting the information.

24       Q    But what about it did you find surprising?

25       A    No -- meaning I just didn't know it was
                                                         202



 1  coming.

 2       Q    Anything about the substance of it that you

 3  found surprising?

 4       A    No.

 5       Q    With the statement of work, what was your

 6  understanding of, kind of, the net relationship between

 7  Walmart and Zest?  Like, what --

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection.

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Like, what -- how did you

10  understand it?

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

12       A    Two questions.  You want something on the

13  statement of work, or do you want something on the

14  relationship?

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Well, let's do the

16  relationship overall.

17       A    Okay.

18       Q    What was your, sort of, net understanding of,

19  hey, this is what Zest is giving Walmart, this is what

20  Walmart is giving Zest?  What was your, sort of,

21  understanding of the net?

22       A    I still don't understand the question.

23       Q    Let me try to put it this way:  When two

24  parties are in -- have a, you know, business

25  relationship for a period of time, I'm trying to
                                                         203



 1  understand, you know, sort of, what did one side think

 2  they were get and what did the other side -- understand

 3  they were getting from the other side?  So from

 4  Walmart's perspective, I understand you were in --

 5  responsible for the relationship with Zest for a decent

 6  period of time.  What did you understand, sort of, the

 7  net arrangement was for Zest?

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.  We're still

 9  in the individual deposition, right.

10                 MR. SIMONS:  Yes, uh-huh.

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to form.  And object

12  to the extent it calls for any legal conclusion about

13  the arrangement between the parties that is governed by

14  contract.

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I'm not asking for a legal

16  conclusion.  I'm just asking you, like, your

17  understanding.  What was the arrangement?

18       A    As referenced to the SOW?

19       Q    To the extent that plays into it, yes.

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Same objections.

21       A    Over -- so at this particular time?

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Sure.  At this -- at that

23  time.  What was your understanding at that time?

24       A    Understanding at this time was the statement

25  of work was the result of the negotiations where Zest
                                                         204



 1  had requested to, instead of getting a lump sum, to do

 2  work over a period of time and be paid for it, and so we

 3  had created a situation where we could get services and

 4  deliverables for that money at their request.

 5       Q    And looking at the net relationship overall,

 6  statement of work, as well as, you know, the other part

 7  of the relationship, what did Walmart expect to get from

 8  Zest in that relationship?

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

10       A    I don't think we have any set expectations on

11  a relationship.

12       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So you're not aware of

13  anything that Walmart was supposed to get out of that

14  relationship from Zest?

15                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

16  Mischaracterizes testimony.

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just asking for your

18  understanding?

19                 MR. SAMMI:  Same objection.

20       A    I still am not understanding if I'm speaking

21  to the statement of work or, like, a phone call.  Like,

22  what -- I don't understand the definition of

23  relationship.

24       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  The whole -- you understand

25  that there was a period of time where Walmart and Zest
                                                         205



 1  worked together, right?

 2       A    Correct.

 3       Q    So that's what I mean by the relationship.

 4  Just the time that you worked together.  Does that make

 5  sense?

 6       A    Absolutely.

 7       Q    Okay.  And my question is, over that time, was

 8  there something that you understood Zest was supposed to

 9  provide to Walmart and something that Walmart was

10  supposed to provide to Zest, if anything?

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

12       A    The specifics of what we would have expected

13  would have been in the SOW.  When, you know -- or in an

14  RFI for the POC, I -- I can't speak to expectations

15  based on a relationship.

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So from -- as far as

17  you didn't have, I guess, just speaking for yourself

18  personally, you didn't have any expectations of things

19  that Zest was supposed to provide to you; is that right?

20       A    Me personally?

21       Q    Well, yes.  As a -- you know, you worked at

22  Walmart.  I know they weren't giving you things, you

23  know, at your house.  I'm saying --

24       A    I expected the deliverables that were in the

25  statement of work.
                                                         206



 1       Q    And what were those deliverables?

 2       A    It's a pretty lengthy list.

 3       Q    Okay.

 4       A    Do you want me to read them?

 5       Q    No, that's fine.  Just whatever's listed

 6  there, that's what you were looking for?

 7       A    Absolutely.

 8       Q    And were you the one who was responsible for

 9  monitoring that and making sure that those deliverables

10  were provided?

11       A    I was checking on it.  I was not.  Some of it

12  was technical, and I had Jon Fox involved with the

13  people who were part of this -- Chris was involved.

14  There's others involved that would have been able to be

15  much more capable of understanding if the deliverables

16  were being met than I.

17       Q    Got it.  And did you understand that Walmart

18  was going to own any IP related to the statement of

19  work?

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, to the

21  extent it calls for a legal conclusion or interpretation

22  of a legal document from a lay witness.

23       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just asking for your

24  understanding?

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Same objection.
                                                         207



 1       A    In general, my understanding is that we were

 2  going to be receiving an app or work towards an app.

 3       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  And did you have an

 4  understanding of when you didn't finish the payments,

 5  what the obligations, if any, of Zest were at that time?

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection.  Calls for a legal

 7  interpretation.

 8       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just your understanding, if

 9  you have one.

10                 MR. SAMMI:  Same objection.

11       A    And again, the nondeliverables, the nonpayment

12  and the lawsuit happened all at the same time, and I'm

13  not comfortable talking about that.

14       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  Outside of the context

15  of talking to lawyers, did you have any -- any

16  conversations with anybody just about what you expected

17  from Zest?

18                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

19       A    I mean, when we were creating the document, we

20  had discussions on what the deliverables should be.

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Right.  I mean, after the

22  nonpayment, did you have any conversation, non -- not

23  with lawyers or anybody else?

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Well, there was lawyers, the

25  same instruction, cautionary instruction applies that if
                                                         208



 1  you cannot separate information that maybe come from

 2  lawyers or the mental impressions of Walmart's legal

 3  team inside or outside, I instruct you not to answer the

 4  question.  If, otherwise, you have some sort of

 5  independent recollection that you can separate out from

 6  that, you can try to question if you know the answer.

 7       A    Lawyers got involved very quickly, and I can't

 8  separate.

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So you're not going to

10  answer the question?

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.  It's not

12  -- okay.  Go ahead.

13       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  No.  I just want to

14  clarify that you're not going to answer the question for

15  that reason; is that right?

16       A    For what reason?

17       Q    For the reason that you just described, that

18  -- you're following your lawyer's instructions not to

19  answer the question; is that correct?

20       A    Correct.

21       Q    Okay.  Just wanted to clarify.

22                 MR. SAMMI:  Thank you.  And -- and for

23  the record, I'm not -- I just -- just to be clear, I'm

24  not telling the witness not to answer the question full

25  stop.  I am instructing the witness that if we she
                                                         209



 1  cannot separate in her mind conversations with or

 2  without lawyers that may reflect legal advice or mental

 3  impressions of attorneys, that to that extent, she

 4  should not answer the question.

 5                 If she has an independent recollection

 6  that she can untangle, she could answer the question,

 7  but the witness has expressed the fact that she cannot

 8  untangle that, full stop.

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Bottom line is you're not

10  going to answer the question, correct?

11       A    Which question?

12       Q    The question -- go back to it and here we can

13  read it.

14                 MR. SAMMI:  I'll give you the same

15  cautionary instruction that to the extent you have any

16  independent recollections that you can clearly, in your

17  mind, separate from any conversations that reflect any

18  legal advice, you can answer that question.

19       A    I can't separate.

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So -- and that means

21  you're not going to answer question, correct?

22       A    That is correct.

23       Q    Got it.  Were you familiar with any other

24  agreements that -- were you familiar with the NDA with

25  Zest?
                                                         210



 1       A    I believe that I talked --

 2                 THE WITNESS:  If I talked to a lawyer,

 3  can I talk about this?

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  No.

 5                 THE WITNESS:  No?

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  No.  I don't want to know

 7  about conversations with lawyers, but if you were aware

 8  of the NDA, that's something that is separate from

 9  whether you had a discussion with the lawyers about it.

10  So were you aware of the NDA?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    Okay.  When did you become aware of it?

13       A    I don't remember.

14       Q    Was it around the time that the lawsuit was

15  filed?

16       A    No.

17       Q    Okay.  It was prior to that?  Can you give me

18  a sense of, you know, was it years before the lawsuit

19  was filed or shortly before?

20                 MR. SAMMI:  And to be clear, he's asking

21  about when --

22                 MR. SIMONS:  Just when, yeah.

23                 MR. SAMMI:  -- you may have first learned

24  of the existence of an NDA with Zest.  Not from who you

25  learned it, what you talked about or what did you didn't
                                                         211



 1  talk about.

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just when?

 3       A    Early that year, so 2017.

 4       Q    Early 2017?  You say "that year," are you

 5  talking about --

 6       A    Was it 2018?

 7       Q    The year the lawsuit was filed was 2018 so --

 8       A    Early 2018.

 9       Q    Okay.  And I take it from the conversations

10  that we have had, that you can't talk about any

11  discussions related to it because those discussions were

12  with lawyers; is that right?

13       A    Correct.

14       Q    Okay.  Did you actually read the NDA when you

15  became aware of it or -- or not?

16                 MR. SAMMI:  You can answer that yes or

17  no.

18       A    No.

19       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did you have a copy of it?

20                 MR. SAMMI:  You can answer that yes or no

21  or I don't recall.

22       A    I don't recall.

23       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  But -- did you ever

24  provide a copy of the NDA to somebody else?

25       A    I don't recall.
                                                         212



 1       Q    Did you ever talk to anybody else about it,

 2  not a lawyer, just to your -- anybody else in your

 3  organization, nonlawyers?

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  Same class -- same cautionary

 5  instruction.  Whenever Mr. Simons says other than a

 6  lawyer, I'm telling you that even if it's a nonlawyer,

 7  if the conversation reflected thoughts of lawyers that

 8  too is privileged and should not be revealed.

 9                 THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So I'm not asking about the

11  conversation.  I'm asking did you have a conversation

12  with somebody, a nonlawyer, about it.  And I'm not

13  asking for the substance, just did the conversation

14  happen or not.

15                 MR. SAMMI:  You can answer that question,

16  if you recall.

17       A    I don't remember.

18       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So you can't recall

19  having a conversation with a nonlawyer about the NDA; is

20  that accurate?

21       A    Not any specific conversation.

22       Q    Okay.  Were you involved in negotiating any

23  other agreements with Zest besides the statement of

24  work?

25       A    Not that I recall.
                                                         213



 1       Q    Okay.  Are you aware of any other agreements

 2  between Walmart and Zest?

 3       A    Yes.

 4       Q    What agreements?

 5       A    The Deloitte.

 6       Q    Okay.  Was there a specific agreement --

 7  obviously, there was an agreement with Deloitte, right?

 8       A    Right.

 9       Q    Was there another agreement about paying?

10       A    I don't know the specifics.

11       Q    Okay.

12       A    I wasn't involved.

13       Q    So when you say agreement, you're saying it,

14  sort of, in the general sense that there was an

15  agreement that that money was going to be reimbursed as

16  opposed to a written document that documented that

17  arrangement?

18       A    Right.  In late 2017, early 2018, yes.

19       Q    Okay.

20       A    Yes.

21       Q    Have you ever seen a document that

22  specifically talks about the reimbursement for the money

23  charged by Deloitte?

24       A    Other than what we've looked at today, like

25  emails, no.
                                                         214



 1       Q    But not an agreement, a formal, written

 2  agreement related to that?

 3       A    Like, a contract?

 4       Q    Yeah.

 5       A    No.

 6       Q    Okay.  Any other agreements that you're aware

 7  of?

 8       A    No, not aware of.

 9       Q    Okay.  Any agreements with a company called

10  EcoArk, Inc. that you are aware of?

11       A    Is that before or after Zest?

12       Q    It would be any time frame.  Not asking for a

13  specific time frame.  Any -- any time frame.  I'm just

14  asking what you're aware of.

15       A    So I don't remember.

16       Q    Okay.  What about EcoArk Holdings, Inc.?

17       A    I don't remember.

18       Q    Same answer?

19       A    I don't remember.

20       Q    Okay.

21                  (Exhibit 229 was marked)

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Give you what's been marked

23  Exhibit 229.  And I apologize.  For some reason we

24  accidentally did not make extra copies of this, so maybe

25  you can kind of share, if that's okay, just this one.  I
                                                         215



 1  feel like you're able to share with your -- especially

 2  with your own client, so....

 3                 And in all fairness, I don't have a copy

 4  myself, so....

 5                 MR. SAMMI:  Yep.  You can blame this on

 6  you've been playing this on Jonathan Hart.

 7                 MR. SIMONS:  Yes.  Let's do that.

 8       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  The Bates number is

 9  WM00014983; is that right?

10       A    Yes.

11       Q    Okay.  Now, this is an email --

12                 MR. SAMMI:  She doesn't have it yet.  I'm

13  perusing it.

14                 MR. SIMONS:  Okay.  Got it.

15                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.  Look through it.

16                 THE WITNESS:  Yep.

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So the October 13th, 2017

18  email at the top from you to Mr. Ed Oldham.

19       A    Yes.

20       Q    It appears to be attaching a May 9th, 2016

21  statement of work for Deloitte, right?

22       A    Correct.

23       Q    This, as I understand it, is the fist Deloitte

24  statement of work.  Is that your understanding as well,

25  in terms of the ones that you described earlier?
                                                         216



 1       A    What did I -- what did I say the second was?

 2       Q    So these are my notes.

 3       A    Yep.

 4       Q    Correct me if I'm wrong.  It says the first

 5  one was about waste in December of '16.  The second was

 6  speed, spring of 2017.  The third was speed deployment.

 7  Kind of had an A&B section, in 2018.  And then there was

 8  a Zest one, which you were, sort of, didn't have a

 9  specific date when I asked you.

10       A    That's what this is.

11       Q    That was the Zest one.

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    Okay.  And the date on that is --

14       A    2017, but it is not my agreement.

15       Q    Understood.  This happened before you took

16  over Zest, right?

17       A    Yes.

18       Q    And I think the date on the actual agreement

19  is May of 2016.  Feel free to take a look at the

20  attachment.

21       A    The effective date or the signed date?

22       Q    I believe it's the signed date but take a look

23  at it.  I apologize.  I don't have a copy.

24       A    The signed date is September 16th.

25       Q    Are both of the signatures the same day or is
                                                         217



 1  there --

 2       A    August 29th.

 3       Q    Okay.  And then what's the effective date?

 4       A    September 12th.

 5       Q    Okay.  Now, that attachment, I think it may

 6  attach a amendment and maybe -- I don't know if you're

 7  looking at the amendment that was in September.  Can you

 8  take a look at that and see if there's an agreement --

 9       A    There's a change order, is that correct?

10       Q    -- and then a change order?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    So the original agreement, do you have --

13       A    Yes.

14       Q    What date was it signed?

15       A    May 5th.

16       Q    Okay.

17                 MR. SAMMI:  Of what year.

18                 THE WITNESS:  2016.

19       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  All right.  So we have a

20  May 5th, 2016, and then a change order in September,

21  correct?

22       A    Correct.

23       Q    All right.  And if you look at the first page

24  of the original agreement, not the change order, it's

25  got the objectives for the engagement listed on that
                                                         218



 1  page, right?

 2       A    I'm sorry?

 3       Q    Yeah.  The first page of the primary

 4  agreement, the attachment to the email.

 5       A    Yeah.

 6       Q    Is it -- that listing of objectives consistent

 7  with your understanding of the objectives for the

 8  agreement?

 9       A    I will not be able to speak to this.  I was

10  not involved in it.

11       Q    Okay.

12       A    It was before me.  I have absolutely no idea.

13  I wasn't -- I was literally never engaged.

14       Q    Okay.  Then if you can then look at Exhibit 2,

15  which I think you have pulled aside there --

16       A    Uh-huh.

17       Q    -- conveniently.

18       A    Yes.

19       Q    Was that presentation --

20       A    Was that this one?

21       Q    Yes.

22       A    Uh-huh.

23       Q    Was that Exhibit 2 the work product that came

24  from the statement of work and change order in

25  Exhibit 229 that we just looked at?
                                                         219



 1       A    I believe, yes.

 2       Q    Okay.

 3       A    But I don't know completely.  I was not

 4  involved in this SOW.

 5       Q    Okay.  And then this one, where she copies.

 6  Okay.  Show you what's been marked as Exhibit 230.

 7                  (Exhibit 230 was marked)

 8       A    Yes.

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  This is another statement of

10  work.  And I think this one is waste statement of work,

11  right?

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    All right.  December of 2016.

14       A    Yes.

15       Q    This is one that you were responsible for?

16       A    I was very engaged.  I did not hire them or

17  pay them out of my budget, but I was the business

18  partner.

19       Q    You were the business partner.  And when you

20  say waste, can you give me a sense of what you mean?  Is

21  that sort of the title that you had for this statement

22  of work?

23       A    It was all encompassing on root causes of

24  fresh waste.

25       Q    Did it also include recommendations in terms
                                                         220



 1  of how to reduce that waste?

 2       A    Some.  Some.

 3       Q    What was your general feeling about the work

 4  that Deloitte did with respect to this particular

 5  statement of work?

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.

 7       A    I felt good.

 8       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Felt good.  Felt like they

 9  did a good job in identifying the causes of waste?

10       A    Yes.

11       Q    And did you have any complaints or issues of

12  problems with what they did?

13       A    No, not that I recall.

14       Q    Okay.  If you look at the next exhibit, 231.

15                  (Exhibit 231 was marked)

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  It's an email from Josh

17  Mellinger at Deloitte to you in May of 2017; is that

18  correct?

19       A    That is correct.

20       Q    And if you go down, there's an email on

21  May 5th from you to Josh Mellinger, sort of halfway down

22  the page?

23       A    Yeah.

24       Q    In this first paragraph of that email from

25  you, you say, I'm thinking about how to structure your
                                                         221



 1  work.  Our ultimate deliverable here is to be able to

 2  hand over to the organization a beautiful, fully-baked

 3  plan, that will, in the excruciating detail, explain how

 4  we scale the pilot.

 5       A    Correct.

 6       Q    Is that related to this waste statement of

 7  work that we just looked at in Exhibit 230?

 8       A    No.

 9       Q    Okay.  This is different?

10       A    Yes.

11       Q    And which one is Exhibit 231 related to?  Is

12  that speed?

13       A    Correct.

14       Q    All right.  So the first speed.

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    Got it.  Okay.

17                 And is it accurate to say that the pilot

18  that you're talking about in Exhibit 231 would have been

19  Gate 2?

20       A    Oh, no, one.

21       Q    Gate 1?

22       A    Actually, this was zero -- yeah, Gate 1, proof

23  of concept.

24       Q    Gate 1.  Okay.  And you would have considered

25  it Gate 1 on which initiative?
                                                         222



 1       A    Speed.

 2       Q    How does -- I've heard or we've talked about

 3  with various folks, you know, the Cold Chain project.

 4  Do you view the Cold Chain project and speed as being

 5  related?

 6       A    Completely separate.

 7       Q    Completely separate.  Okay.  So this is Gate 1

 8  on speed.

 9       A    Correct.

10       Q    And the POC -- or the pilot that is referred

11  to in Exhibit 231, which pilot is that?

12       A    Speed pilot.

13       Q    Okay.

14       A    It the -- as I said before, like, if you get

15  official, there's a Stage-Gate 1 that should be a proof

16  of concept.  And then -- and then you go into a pilot.

17  Those get hairy when you have to work with 4600 stores.

18  And so, sometimes, a big proof of concept can be

19  referred to as a pilot.

20       Q    Okay.  And in this particular case, were there

21  outside vendors involved in this particular pilot or was

22  it internal?

23       A    What are you referring to as outside vendors?

24       Q    What would you think of as an outside vendor?

25  Maybe a better way for me to ask this is who was
                                                         223



 1  involved in this -- in this pilot?

 2       A    Deloitte.

 3       Q    Deloitte was the only --

 4       A    That is correct.

 5       Q    Okay.  And what was Deloitte doing in the

 6  speed pilot?

 7       A    Helping us create a scalability plan as we did

 8  the proof of concept.

 9       Q    Was there anybody else outside of Walmart that

10  was involved in that pilot?

11       A    Suppliers.

12       Q    How many?

13       A    Probably, around -- at that point, probably

14  three.

15       Q    Do you remember who they were?

16       A    Naturipe, Driscoll's and probably one other.

17       Q    And what was the objective?  I mean, speed

18  suggestions fast, but was there something more detailed

19  than that that you can --

20       A    That is the objective.

21       Q    And so I'll try to give you my understanding

22  and see if it's correct.  And let me know if I'm wrong.

23  Does that just mean that you're trying to get product

24  from suppliers through to stores as fast as you could?

25       A    Yes.
                                                         224



 1       Q    How long did it last?

 2       A    The pilot lasted -- the proof of concept

 3  lasted about four months, but we never dismantled it.

 4  So it kept running on very small scale, became a pilot

 5  and then we scaled it.

 6       Q    So has this been implemented now?

 7       A    Correct.

 8       Q    So it's past Gate --

 9       A    Three.  It's past Gate 3.  It's went into Gate

10  4.  We've actually done all of the gates and we've done

11  a post-audit.

12       Q    Okay.  And is it -- has it been implemented in

13  all distribution centers or --

14       A    Good question.

15       Q    -- GDCs?

16       A    Yeah.  I can't -- I don't have the capacity in

17  my upstream nodes to get to all GDCs currently.  It has

18  been implemented to the extent that we have the

19  capacity.

20       Q    And one more question on this.  Was -- what

21  was the thing that allowed you to do it faster, if that

22  makes sense?  I might be asking the wrong question but

23  maybe you can help me.

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.  You can

25  answer.

 1                 THE WITNESS:  Can I?

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Yep.

 3       A    We took all the inventory out, and we

 4  increased the frequency of delivery.

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Smaller deliveries, more

 6  frequent, basically?

 7       A    With no inventory.

 8       Q    No inventory in --

 9       A    Anywhere.

10       Q    GD -- no inventory in the distribution center,

11  no inventory in the store?

12       A    There's an odd hand in the store, but no

13  inventory in the upstream node, no inventory in the

14  distribution center.

15       Q    And if you don't have any inventory in the

16  distribution center, what's the point of having the

17  distribution center?

18       A    It would be very difficult to have trucks

19  going by themselves with some strawberries to 4600

20  stores.

21       Q    Okay.

22       A    It's the door to the store.

23       Q    Got it.  So stuff comes -- I guess,

24  technically, in that scenario, it's in the distribution

25  center for a very brief period of time, right?
                                                         226



 1       A    It cross docks, yes.

 2       Q    Yeah.  Okay.

 3                  (Exhibit 232 was marked)

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Exhibit 232.  Exhibit 232 is

 5  an email from you to Greg Smith and Kathy Scott, copying

 6  Ed Oldham in July of 2017, correct?

 7       A    Correct.

 8       Q    Relates to another Deloitte statement of work.

 9  Can you tell me which one that this is?

10       A    The first speed one.

11       Q    Same one that we just were discussing --

12       A    Uh-huh.

13       Q    -- in Exhibit 231?

14       A    Uh-huh.

15       Q    So this is the statement of work for that

16  particular speed project?

17       A    Yes.

18       Q    And it looks like you -- it says here, hi,

19  Greg.  That Greg is Greg Smith, right?

20       A    Correct.

21       Q    Attached is the Deloitte Fresh Flow SOW.  It

22  is for 2.7 million.  Greg Foran is paying and will need

23  to sign also, correct?

24       A    Correct.

25       Q    And is that true, did Greg Foran sign this
                                                         227



 1  statement of work?

 2       A    I'm not sure.

 3       Q    Well, this particular copy is not signed,

 4  right, because you were sending it up --

 5       A    Right.

 6       Q    -- up the chain?  Do you know if Greg Foran

 7  actually signed this --

 8       A    I know that he reviewed it.  I don't know if

 9  we required his actual signature for that small amount

10  of money.

11       Q    Okay.

12       A    It was coming from his budget.

13       Q    Got it.  But from his perspective 2.7 million

14  would -- would be small.  He's dealing with numbers with

15  B's?

16       A    He is.  But he's also very particular about

17  money, so this would be something he would want to be

18  aware of.

19       Q    What do you mean very particular about money?

20       A    Yeah.  That's our mission at Walmart, is to be

21  very conscious of money.

22       Q    The speed deployment, I think you said it was

23  in A and B parts in 2018, right?

24       A    Yes.  It -- yes.

25       Q    And there was a separate statement of work
                                                         228



 1  with Deloitte for that?

 2       A    Yes.

 3                  (Exhibit 233 was marked)

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  In Exhibit 233 this is an

 5  email from Juan Gomez to you and Mike Swatsworth dated

 6  February 26th, 2018, correct?

 7       A    Yes.

 8       Q    Now, does this email and attachment have to do

 9  with one of the Deloitte statements of work?

10       A    No.

11       Q    Okay.

12       A    None of my Deloitte statements of work.

13       Q    Fair enough.  It talks about cost to serve.

14       A    Yes.

15       Q    Do you know what cost to serve means?

16       A    Yes.

17       Q    What does that mean?

18       A    It's a body of work that Juan Gomez leads that

19  is literally just what it says.  What -- how much does

20  it cost to service the business.

21       Q    And maybe if you can just put a little more

22  color on that.  When you say cost to service the

23  business, what business is this referring to?

24       A    So supply chain is a service to our retail

25  business.  If you don't understand how much your
                                                         229



 1  services are costing the business, it's very difficult

 2  to understand your impact, where do you get savings,

 3  where is there opportunity.  And as I stated before, our

 4  systems historically haven't been very accurate.  And so

 5  this is a large body of work to go after being more

 6  accurate on costs.

 7       Q    Got it.  So this is the cost of the supply

 8  chain to provide the supply chain services to Walmart

 9  overall; is that accurate?

10       A    Yes.  And I would -- I -- your definition of

11  supply chain?

12       Q    It's a great question.  I'm -- I was using

13  your word, so what would you -- is there a better, more

14  accurate description than supply chain to refer to the

15  costs to serve that are at issue in this email?

16       A    So without getting too complex, often, when a

17  silo within a business function operates not

18  holistically, it can make poor business decisions.  Cost

19  to serve really encompassed a fully landed cost across

20  multiple functions of moving product across the entire

21  network.  So in our world, some of those things might

22  not be referred to specifically as supply chain but it

23  would be moving the product.

24       Q    Fair enough.  And did this relate to fresh or

25  did it relate to a larger part of the business than just
                                                         230



 1  fresh?

 2       A    So cost to serve is for everything.  I believe

 3  this, as I read it, talks about maybe starting with

 4  Fresh because it's small.

 5       Q    Okay.  And the second -- actually, the third

 6  paragraph of this email talks about the $450 million

 7  opportunity to tackle.  Is that Fresh related?

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.

 9       A    Where are you seeing that, sir?

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  If you look at the

11  first email at the top of the page?

12       A    Yeah.

13       Q    It says Hi, Kelly.

14       A    Yeah.

15       Q    If you go to the third paragraph in the last

16  sentence.

17       A    All of Fresh, correct.

18       Q    Okay.  And when you say all of Fresh, is there

19  something specific that you mean by that, as opposed to

20  some particular part?

21       A    Anything temperature controlled.

22       Q    Anything temperature controlled?

23       A    That would be all in Fresh encompassing, so

24  it's not just produce.

25       Q    That would include meat --
                                                         231



 1       A    Meat, yeah.

 2       Q    -- frozen?

 3       A    Dairy.

 4       Q    Dairy?

 5       A    Yeah.

 6       Q    So that's what you mean when you say all of

 7  Fresh?

 8       A    Yeah.

 9       Q    And was all of that underneath the umbrella of

10  your organization, all of Fresh as opposed to produce?

11       A    So I really -- I'm a staff function that has

12  the ability to influence.  My only direct accountability

13  is that operational piece.  And then I develop

14  capabilities that are actually executed amongst all the

15  other functions, so that's a difficult question to

16  answer.

17       Q    I think I understand it.  When you say the

18  operational piece, does the operational piece relate

19  directly to Fresh produce or no?

20       A    It relates to -- no, it does not.

21       Q    Okay.  When you -- what do you mean by when

22  you say the operational piece?

23       A    So I have physical buildings that I'm

24  accountable for.  And all of those buildings don't just

25  deal with only produce.
                                                         232



 1       Q    Got it.  And are the physical buildings that

 2  you're responsible for the GDCs?

 3       A    No.

 4       Q    Okay.  Which physical buildings are they?

 5       A    I have GCCs, FSCs and import buildings.

 6       Q    And the GCCs are --

 7       A    Grocery Consolidation Center.

 8       Q    Uh-huh.  And --

 9       A    Fresh Solutions Center.

10       Q    Yep.

11       A    And import facilities.

12       Q    And the import facilities, are those importing

13  produce from outside the country?

14       A    Yes, that's correct.

15       Q    And those are the three operational parts of

16  the business that are under your realm of

17  responsibility?

18       A    Yes.

19       Q    But the $450 million relates to all of Fresh?

20       A    Marked down, yes.

21       Q    Include of -- including anything temperature

22  controlled?

23       A    I don't know specifically what time line he's

24  looking at there, so that's my assumption because it a

25  big number.
                                                         233



 1       Q    Okay.  Hold -- what is your assumption about

 2  the time line given the number?

 3       A    I don't know.

 4       Q    Okay.

 5       A    So I'm assuming.  I don't know his time line.

 6       Q    Got it.  Can we go back to Exhibit 216?  See

 7  how well I organize my pile here.

 8       A    I'm going to work really hard in keeping this

 9  straight here.

10       Q    This is a leadership working group meeting

11  notice and PowerPoint that we looked at before, correct?

12       A    Correct.

13       Q    One of the things -- if you look at page two

14  of the attachment, one of the items listed in this

15  attachment, one, two, three, four, five.  It's not a

16  bullet point.  There's sort of dashes.  It says,

17  Deloitte has developed a financial analysis model.  Do

18  you see that?

19       A    Yes.

20       Q    Are you familiar with the financial analysis

21  model that Deloitte put together?

22       A    Not specifically, no.

23       Q    Do you remember it being discussed at any of

24  the meetings that you attended?

25       A    I don't remember.
                                                         234



 1       Q    Okay.  Do you remember it being a financial

 2  analysis model to determine the ROI on implementation of

 3  Zest?

 4       A    I do not remember specifically.

 5       Q    At any time in your work with Deloitte, did

 6  you ever work on a financial model for ROI of

 7  implementation of Zest?

 8       A    I did not work on that, no.

 9       Q    Did you see a model prepared by Deloitte?

10       A    I do not remember it.

11       Q    Okay.

12                  (Exhibit 234 was marked)

13       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Showing you what's been

14  marked as Exhibit 234.  It's a November 2016 email chain

15  at the top.  It is an email from Todd Clayton to you and

16  --

17       A    I'm going to read it real quick.

18       Q    Oh, yeah, sure.  Go ahead.

19       A    Okay.  Thanks.

20       Q    Sure.  And the email that I want to focus on

21  is the second one on the first page.

22       A    Yes.

23       Q    It's from you to Todd Clayton, dated Tuesday,

24  November 22nd, 2016.  Do you see that email?

25       A    Yeah.
                                                         235



 1       Q    And subject line is Zest deliverables in the

 2  next five weeks.

 3       A    Uh-huh.

 4       Q    And you say, Thanks, Todd.  I do need

 5  short-term pricing also, so we can plug into the model.

 6  See that?

 7       A    Yes.

 8       Q    Do you understand the model to be the

 9  financeable model that Deloitte put together?

10       A    No.

11       Q    Okay.  Do you know what model that refers to?

12       A    In reading this, I would make the assumption

13  that it means the business case to continue the work.

14       Q    To continue the work --

15       A    On the -- in the deliverables.

16       Q    Okay.  What models are you aware of that

17  related to the business case to continue the work?

18                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

19       A    Say that again.

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  You said you thought

21  this was a model related to the business case for

22  continuing the work.  And what I'm asking you is what

23  kind of a model are you aware of that was for the

24  business case to continue the work?

25       A    So as it states in here, I need to provide a
                                                         236



 1  business case, I think it says, to the SteerCo, which

 2  would then explain to them how much money we're

 3  spending, what the value would be, based on the

 4  activities that we are proposing to do on the

 5  deliverables.

 6       Q    Got it.  So your understanding is this was

 7  just about the business case for continuing the work

 8  with Zest as opposed to the business case or a ROM model

 9  for implementing Zest?

10       A    Which is why I called it short-term pricing.

11       Q    Okay.  So you say, though, Jeff, I think the

12  business case will come as long as we know pricing both

13  short- and long-term.  Do you know what the long-term

14  pricing was for?

15       A    Well, yeah.  Once -- once you do the

16  short-term deliverables, if you're going to engage in

17  something longer than that, you're going to need both.

18       Q    Do you know if this analysis was actually

19  completed?

20       A    I don't, which is why I asked the question at

21  the end.  It may have.

22       Q    The question at the end is which one?

23       A    When I say both long-term yes, questions mark.

24       Q    Got it.

25       A    I'm kind of asking him.
                                                         237



 1       Q    And it looks like he responded and said thanks

 2  -- well, somebody responded.  Todd Clayton responded and

 3  said, Thanks, Kelly.  And we agree.

 4       A    Yes.

 5       Q    Did Jeff Kerbs respond, do you know?

 6       A    I don't know.

 7       Q    If you look back to Exhibit 2, which may --

 8  may be -- the --

 9       A    The big one.

10       Q    The big one.  And it's off to the side, so

11  it's easy to find.  If you look at page 45 of Exhibit 2,

12  there is something called a direct impact ROI model.  Do

13  you know if that is the model that's referred to in

14  either of the exhibits that we've just looked at?

15       A    I really don't know.

16       Q    Okay.

17       A    I -- I don't remember seeing this before I had

18  to produce it for publishing to Zest.

19       Q    Oh, for -- when you -- and when you're talking

20  about that, you're talking about when you were looking

21  at the Deloitte report to create a redacted version to

22  send to Zest, that's when you remember seeing this on

23  page 45?

24       A    This big document.

25       Q    Okay.  And at that point in time, did you
                                                         238



 1  specifically look at this, page 45, ROI model?

 2       A    I looked at this through the lens of what

 3  should we share or not share.

 4       Q    Uh-huh.

 5       A    Not with the lens of looking for a business

 6  case model.

 7       Q    And what was the guideline that you used in

 8  terms of thinking about what to share or not share?

 9       A    Anything that would be considered our data or

10  information.

11       Q    Anything else?

12       A    No, not that I can recall.

13       Q    And did you remove anything that you felt like

14  was your data or information?

15       A    I think that collectively, several people

16  suggested removing things.  I don't remember the

17  specifics of who and what were the removing.

18       Q    Fair enough.  I guess my question was a little

19  more narrow, which was in terms of what you specifically

20  recommended removing, was that stuff that you thought

21  was Walmart data?

22       A    Yes.

23       Q    Okay.  And do you remember how --

24       A    Or information.

25       Q    Data or information.  In you mind, what's the
                                                         239



 1  difference between data or -- and information?

 2       A    Data can be create -- can create information.

 3  Data is typically raw.  When you analyze it, multiply

 4  it, store it, govern it, it can create information.

 5       Q    Okay.

 6       A    That is my particular definition.

 7       Q    Understood.  So in your view, information is

 8  data that has been processed or manipulated in some way?

 9       A    It can also be a process.  It can be -- it can

10  be anything that's -- information is clearly more broad

11  than data.

12       Q    Okay.  And so the information that -- the data

13  or information that you -- you removed was things that

14  you considered to be Walmart data or information.

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    Why didn't you want Zest to have that?

17       A    Because -- why didn't I want Zest to have

18  that?  I guess I don't understand the question.  Like --

19       Q    Yeah.

20       A    -- it's our stuff.  I mean, it was prepared

21  for us.  It was paid for and prevent -- presented to us

22  as ours.  And so I guess it was -- as it was ours, it

23  was just an opinion.

24       Q    It was an opinion.  In other words, it was

25  your opinion or are you talking about --
                                                         240



 1       A    Yes, absolutely.

 2       Q    Okay.  Got it.  And in that -- you felt that

 3  was true even though the cost of producing this was

 4  actually paid for by somebody else?

 5       A    It was prepared for us.

 6       Q    And the fact that someone else paid for it to

 7  you doesn't change the calculation?

 8       A    Calculation --

 9       Q    It doesn't change your view about the

10  information or data?

11       A    It was provided to us as ours.  I would then

12  protect it as Walmart's information and data.

13       Q    Okay.  Right.  And, I guess, my question was

14  just the fact that somebody else paid for it doesn't

15  change your views on that?

16                 MR. SAMMI:  Asked and answered.

17       A    No.

18       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  This actually might be

19  a good time for a break, if that makes sense to

20  everybody.

21                 MR. SAMMI:  Sure.

22                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off the

23  record at 3:48.

24                 (A break was taken from 3:48 p.m. to 4:02

25                 p.m., 14 minutes)

 1                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on the

 2  record at 4:02 p.m.

 3                 (Exhibit 235 was marked)

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You have what's been marked

 5  as Exhibit 235.  At the top is an email from you to

 6  Scott Neal dated December 1st, 2016, correct?

 7       A    Yes.

 8       Q    If we go down to the bottom of this email

 9  chain, the original email is from Lamar Steiger,

10  correct?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    How do you know Mr. Steiger?

13       A    I had met him one time prior to -- at this

14  particular time, prior to this.

15       Q    And what circumstances did you meet him prior

16  to this email exchange?

17       A    I think -- I don't know the specifics, but I

18  think Jeff invited me to a meeting where Mr. Steiger was

19  informing us on things he was doing with meat, maybe.

20       Q    And who is Mr. Steiger?

21       A    I'm -- who is he?  He's a consultant, I

22  believe.

23       Q    A consultant for Walmart?

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    Okay.  And Jeff, you said, introduced you.  Is
                                                         242



 1  that Jeff Thorpe?

 2       A    No.  I believe -- it could have been Jeff

 3  Thorpe or Jeff Kerbs.

 4       Q    Okay.  One of the two?

 5       A    Yes.

 6       Q    Jeff Thorpe is the person on the email at the

 7  bottom?

 8       A    Yes.  So it could have been Jeff Thorpe.

 9       Q    And do you know why you were introduced to

10  him?

11       A    I'm going to read the email real quick.

12       Q    Sure.

13       A    So I don't know why but it looks like the

14  content of the meeting was applicable to supply chain

15  and food.

16       Q    Got it.  Now, in the middle of the first page

17  of this email, it looks like there's an email to -- from

18  Scott Neal to you, saying, Wow, not appropriate.

19       A    Correct.

20       Q    Do you have an understanding of what that

21  means?

22       A    I cannot interpret Scott's intentions there.

23       Q    Uh-huh.

24       A    But he was referring to the email, so....

25       Q    Why did you send this to Scott Neal?
                                                         243



 1       A    Because he is SEP of meat.

 2       Q    Okay.  And was your understanding that this

 3  was forwarded onto Mr. Foran?

 4       A    Mr. Foran is in the email.

 5       Q    Right.

 6       A    It wasn't forwarded to him.  It was written to

 7  him.

 8       Q    It was sent to him?

 9       A    Yes.

10       Q    So you were unhappy about the fact that it was

11  sent to Greg Foran, correct?

12       A    No.

13       Q    You weren't?

14       A    I was unhappy that he wrote the email.

15       Q    Okay.  Why were you unhappy that he wrote the

16  email?

17       A    My personal opinion is he didn't have -- he

18  spent a half an hour with me, and then wrote an email

19  judging the work that Jeff and I were doing without

20  details.

21       Q    Got it.  And what, specifically, in your -- in

22  his email did you consider judging the work that you

23  were doing?

24       A    When he inferred that we were moving slow and

25  we would miss another growing season.  How sad.
                                                         244



 1       Q    So that's the fourth paragraph in his email?

 2       A    Correct.

 3       Q    Where he says, Speed is the only competitive

 4  advantage?

 5       A    Correct.

 6       Q    Excuse me.  And he says, While Walmart

 7  continued to request studies and data, it'll also

 8  continue to throw away very large amounts, dash, dash,

 9  dash, very large amounts of food and will probably miss

10  another growing season.  Wow, how sad.

11                 That's what -- the part that made you

12  angry?

13       A    Yes.

14       Q    You felt like he was criticizing you and

15  saying you were slow?

16       A    I think he was making judgments with very

17  little information.

18       Q    Did you respond to him and let him know?

19       A    I did not because I thought Jeff did a great

20  job of responding to him.

21       Q    At the top of this email on the first page,

22  you say, Made me so angry, I couldn't see.

23       A    Yes.

24       Q    Is that an accurate description of how you

25  felt at the time.
                                                         245



 1       A    I was -- well, and the date.  You know, I

 2  wasn't even a year into the company.  So when someone

 3  would judge my work with 30 minutes of general

 4  information and copy leadership, it made me very angry.

 5       Q    Was this the first time that Lamar Steiger had

 6  made you so angry that you couldn't see?

 7       A    I only had met him one time for 30 minutes.

 8       Q    Okay.  Did he do anything in the future other

 9  times that had this similar -- made you angry like this

10  particular one did?

11       A    I have never interacted with him on a very

12  specific business.  I, since, have been on a plane with

13  him going to store visits.  And I've seen him out in

14  Bentonville.  But I've never been in a business

15  interaction with him after this.

16       Q    Okay.  And when you say you were on a plane

17  with him, was that a private plane where you were --

18       A    It was a Walmart store visit.

19       Q    Okay.  And are those visits that Greg Foran

20  does from time to time?

21       A    All of the executives do them.

22       Q    Okay.  That particular one was Greg Foran

23  doing the visit?

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    Okay.  And did you have a conversation with
                                                         246



 1  Mr. Steiger during that?

 2       A    Casual.

 3       Q    Was it friendly?

 4       A    Oh, yeah.

 5       Q    Did you --

 6       A    It had been, what, two years.

 7       Q    Got it.  So that was in 2018, late in 2018?

 8       A    I actually think it was -- might have been

 9  2019, early 2019.  It was just more recently.

10       Q    Recent?

11       A    Yeah.

12       Q    Did you talk to Mr. Steiger at all about this

13  exchange since that time?

14       A    I have never talked to him about this

15  exchange.

16       Q    If you look at the first page, still the email

17  at the top, you say in your email, I'm still new here

18  and getting trashed in an email to the CEO that doesn't

19  really know me.  That was great convo for the

20  Thanksgiving table but not a great career builder.

21                 Do you see that?

22       A    Yes.

23       Q    Is -- did you talk to anyone else about this?

24  Did you have this convo at the dinner table?

25       A    It was funny.  Pretty interesting.
                                                         247



 1                 My -- my dinner table.  I mean, you know,

 2  in general, Greg and Lamar have a very long

 3  relationship, so I'm sure I'm referring to that.

 4       Q    Got it.  So you were referring to the

 5  conversation that maybe Greg and Mr. Steiger were having

 6  at their dinner table, not conversation you had at

 7  yours?

 8       A    Yeah.  Yeah.  I was trying to forget it

 9  frankly.

10       Q    Why were you trying to forget it?

11       A    Because, as I stated, this man had 30 minutes

12  of general information and then chose to judge my work

13  and copy the CEO.

14       Q    Did you experience any negative consequences

15  from this email and the fact that Mr. Foran was copied

16  on it?

17       A    Not that I'm aware of.

18       Q    Did you have any conversations with Mr. Foran

19  about this email?

20       A    No.

21       Q    Did you have any conversations with anybody

22  else besides the folks in this email, Jeff Thorpe and

23  Scott Neal, about this email?

24       A    I may have talked to Kath about it, but I

25  don't know.

 1                  (Exhibit 236 was marked)

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Showing you what's been

 3  marked as Exhibit 236.

 4       A    Yep.

 5       Q    This appears to be another branch from the

 6  same email chain, right?

 7       A    Yes.

 8       Q    And in this particular branch, you forward

 9  this on to Mel -- that's Melanie, right?

10       A    It's just Mel.

11       Q    Just Mel?

12       A    Yep.

13       Q    Lisboa?

14       A    Yep.

15       Q    What is her title?

16       A    At this time, I really don't know.  She was

17  the senior director, though, in flow.  She was a peer of

18  mine.

19       Q    A peer.  Okay.  And friend of yours?

20       A    No.  Business associate.

21       Q    Okay.  You say in this email, We met the meat

22  man.

23       A    Yes.

24       Q    The meat man is Mr. Steiger, correct?

25       A    Correct.
                                                         249



 1       Q    Is that your -- is that how you usually refer

 2  to him is the meat man?

 3       A    He was the guy that is working with meat.

 4  He's the consultant.  He's the meat consultant.

 5       Q    Got it.  And this is the note he sent to Greg,

 6  right?

 7       A    Yes.

 8       Q    Then you say, He is just going to fire me.

 9  That he that you're referring to is Greg Foran, right?

10       A    I -- I don't know who I was referring to.  It

11  could have been just, like, this man is going to cause

12  me to be fired.  I don't know.

13       Q    Okay.  So could mean you're saying Mr. Steiger

14  is going to --

15       A    He's going to get me fired.

16       Q    -- cause you to be fired?

17       A    Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18       Q    Or it could mean Greg Foran is going to fire

19  you.  One of the two?

20       A    Could.

21       Q    And it says, This makes me so sad.  Why did it

22  make you sad?

23       A    I told you.

24       Q    Did you -- at this time, were you concerned

25  that this was going to happen, that you were going to
                                                         250



 1  get fired?

 2       A    This is probably -- is this -- when is this?

 3  When was the date?

 4       Q    November of 2016.

 5       A    Yeah.  So it's the same day.  I'm very sad.  I

 6  don't know.  I mean, this guy is -- has a relationship

 7  with the CEO.  And in my opinion, with very little

 8  information, judged my work incredibly inappropriately,

 9  which was agreed to by an SVP.

10       Q    The SVP being?

11       A    Scott Neal.

12       Q    Scott Neal.

13                  (Exhibit 237 was marked)

14       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  In Exhibit 237, which is

15  another, I guess an email between you and Brian Waters

16  and a variety of other people, correct?

17       A    Yes, yes.

18       Q    This is January 4th, 2017, right?

19       A    Correct.

20       Q    It says, Guys, here's what I'm thinking for

21  content for Greg as we start preparing for the

22  1/20 meeting.

23                 Is the Greg referred to here Greg Foran

24  or Greg Smith, do you know?

25       A    Hold on one second.
                                                         251



 1       Q    Sure.

 2       A    Foran.

 3       Q    And how do you know it's got Greg Foran?

 4       A    Because of the timing and the content of what

 5  is being asked for and the amount of time that the

 6  meeting is.

 7       Q    The amount of time?  Where do you see the

 8  amount of time that the meeting is?

 9       A    This may take us too much time and be out of

10  spoke right there.  And it also says that we have an

11  hour.

12       Q    Okay.  Okay.  I know that we already talked

13  about the Legacy steering committee meetings that you

14  attended and presented at.  Did you have other meetings

15  with Mr. Foran besides the Legacy meetings?

16       A    This was an extension of a Legacy meeting.

17  Greg, in a Legacy meeting, requested additional

18  information that would have taken too long in the Legacy

19  meeting, so it was a break-out basically.

20       Q    Did it happen just immediately after the

21  meeting?

22       A    No, no.  He doesn't have that kind of

23  flexibility in his schedule, so it was scheduled later.

24       Q    Is there a particular reason why -- well, let

25  me ask this.  Was that a common thing, where something
                                                         252



 1  would happen in a Legacy meeting, and then there would

 2  be another break-out meeting after that to discuss?

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to form.

 4       A    I'm never in a legacy meeting except for when

 5  I'm presenting.

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So in the ones that you

 7  attended, did that happen any other time?

 8       A    One other time that I'm aware of.

 9       Q    And what was the subject of the break-out if

10  this particular incident?

11       A    The operational strategy.

12       Q    Operational strategy for Fresh Flow?

13       A    For the upstream nodes of Fresh.  So my -- my

14  operations arm that I talked about.

15       Q    Uh-huh.

16       A    Where are we going with that.

17       Q    Got it.  Was there a specific focus related to

18  where you were going with that or just generally

19  speaking, what was the strategy for that?

20       A    So it was having an upstream node is a

21  requirement for the speed network.  Mr. Foran was very

22  interested in understanding the specifics of all of the

23  upstream nodes.  And what their -- the intents for use

24  was.

25       Q    The other time that there was a break-out,
                                                         253



 1  what was the topic of discussion?  A break-out after the

 2  Legacy meeting.

 3       A    This is kind of funny but exactly the same

 4  thing.

 5       Q    Okay.

 6       A    So about nine months later, they started

 7  asking questions.  Both Gregs were like, I don't

 8  understand what -- and so they requested an -- another

 9  break-out, and I re-provided basically the same

10  information about five minutes.  And they are like, oh,

11  we just did this.  So they had just forgotten.  But it

12  was literally almost the same information.

13       Q    Had anything changed between the two?  I

14  guess, if it was the same information, nine months, it

15  must have been --

16       A    Very little.  I mean, there was -- there was,

17  I'm sure, some additional information we had learned

18  that we would share but, in general, the strategy has

19  been pretty consistent.

20       Q    Other than the Legacy meetings where you

21  presented and these two break-out sessions that followed

22  on from Legacy meetings, have you had any other meetings

23  with Mr. Foran?

24       A    I have not had any other meetings.  I've been

25  in a small group that he's presented to.  These were

 1  really break-outs from the Legacy meeting.  I can't

 2  recall any other meetings that I would be in.

 3       Q    In this -- the small group meetings that you

 4  attended, what was the subject of those meetings?

 5       A    It was just a small group invite for him to

 6  come and share his perspectives on leadership.

 7       Q    Anything to do with Fresh Flow?

 8       A    No.

 9       Q    Anything to do with Zest?

10       A    No.

11       Q    How many people attended those sessions,

12  approximately?

13       A    On the phone, I believe there were over 20.

14  And I think in the room there were maybe 20, 30.

15                 (Exhibit 238 was marked)

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I'm giving you what's been

17  marked as Exhibit 238.

18                 Exhibit 238 is an email exchange between

19  Mr. Foran and Peter Mehring on March 26th that starts

20  with that, if you go to the second page, correct?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    And then there's a response from Mr. Foran on

23  the bottom of the first page or, really, the middle of

24  the first page, I guess, is the way to describe it.  Do

25  you see that, on Wednesday, March 22nd?
                                                         255



 1       A    Yeah.

 2       Q    Title, Interesting article.

 3       A    Yep.

 4       Q    For every spent (sic) on reducing food waste,

 5  company save for -- I think supposed to be for every

 6  dollar.

 7                 Mr. Foran says, We are so risk averse in

 8  the Fresh Food area.  I can't understand why, but

 9  possibly, it reflects a lack of talent and skill.  Do

10  you see that?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    And then he says, Between this and some

13  discussions on meat, it's apparent that we lack

14  intestinal fortitude.  Do you see that as well?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    And then he says, Assume Kelly is involved and

17  not supportive.  Do you understand the Kelly he's

18  referring to is you?

19                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to form and

20  foundation.

21       A    It says Kelly Boyle.

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Assumes Kelly Boyle is

23  involved, so it's pretty clear that it's you, correct?

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    It says here that he assumes you're not
                                                         256



 1  supportive, so it looks like he was aware of you and

 2  what you were doing and felt like you were not

 3  supportive of Zest.  Is that --

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form,

 5  foundation.

 6       A    It does not say that.

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  How do you read it?

 8       A    He says --

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form and

10  foundation.

11       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You can go ahead.

12       A    Assuming is a thought.  It's not a fact.

13       Q    Understood.  I understand that he was assuming

14  that.

15       A    And it's a question, which means he doesn't

16  know.

17       Q    Got it.  Did you follow up with either Peter

18  or Mr. Foran after this email?

19                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.  Lacks

20  foundation.  No evidence in the record that she ever

21  received this email.

22       A    First time I've seen it.

23       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did you have a conversation

24  with Mr. Foran in the March 2017 time frame?

25       A    Not that I'm recalling.
                                                         257



 1       Q    Were you supportive at this point in time?

 2       A    Of what?

 3       Q    Of Zest.

 4       A    I don't know what supportive means.

 5       Q    What do you understand supportive to mean?  I

 6  mean, what's your -- if you're supportive of something,

 7  how do you understand that?

 8       A    We were working with Zest.  I believe, at this

 9  time, I probably had -- is this the right timing?  Am I

10  getting Zest now?  I think this is around the right

11  timing.  I'm not sure.

12                 And from a supportive standpoint, that's

13  just too broad.  Like, I'm working on Fresh.  They are

14  one of the vendors.  I'm working on all kinds of stuff.

15  My big project is speed, so that's where most of --

16  during this time, most of my energy is going towards the

17  pilot that's coming up.  So I -- I don't know where he

18  got that assumption.

19       Q    In terms of do you agree with him that it

20  could reflect a lack of talent and skill?

21                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.

22       A    I have absolutely no idea.

23       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Do you agree with his

24  statement that it might be that you lack intestinal

25  fortitude?
                                                         258



 1                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form and

 2  foundation.

 3       A    Me?

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Well, between this and some

 5  discussions on meat.  You had a discussion with

 6  Mr. Steiger on meat, correct?

 7       A    Mr. Steiger was working on meat.  He talked to

 8  me about it.

 9       Q    Okay.  And he says, It's also apparent we lack

10  intestinal fortitude.

11                 Would you agree with that statement?

12                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.

13       A    Who's we?

14       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Walmart.

15                 MR. SAMMI:  Are you telling her that's

16  what "we" means in this exhibit for the purposes this

17  exhibit?  For the purposes of your question, objection,

18  form, foundation; mischaracterizes the evidence.

19       A    I have -- the CEO of the company may

20  understand what Walmart has fortitude for.  I'm probably

21  not qualified to judge that.

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  And he specifically talks

23  about you here.  Is he saying that you lack intestinal

24  fortitude?

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.
                                                         259



 1       A    That is not what it says.

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  The bottom line is you

 3  don't know?

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

 5       A    I don't know what?

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You don't know whether he's

 7  talking about you lacking intestinal fortitude in this

 8  particular email?

 9       A    Well, you told me the it was referring to

10  Walmart, and I'm part of Walmart.

11                 MR. SAMMI:  I'm sorry.  Just to be clear,

12  if he tells you something --

13                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.

14                 MR. SAMMI:  -- that doesn't mean it's so.

15  That's a question.

16                 THE WITNESS:  Okay.

17                 MR. SAMMI:  You have to understand the

18  document and the question as you understand it.

19       A    I -- the only thing I know is he's asking a

20  question about my support.

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.

22       A    That's the only thing that refers to me in

23  this email.

24       Q    You don't know if the other two statements

25  refer to you or not?
                                                         260



 1       A    I have absolutely no idea.  I'm --

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah?

 3       A    I'm wondering if this is the timing that he

 4  gave me the Caribiner Award.

 5       Q    What's the Caribiner Award?

 6       A    Legacy or Camp for Greg's -- Foran gives an

 7  award for performance.  And he gave me that award in a

 8  town hall, but I don't -- it might have been a little

 9  bit after this.  It was after this, but I don't know

10  when.

11       Q    And what was that for specifically?

12       A    My projects.

13       Q    And which --

14       A    My work in Fresh Flow.

15       Q    And you don't remember the timing of that?

16       A    I think it was Camp Four, so it might have

17  been after this.

18       Q    When you say Camp Four, what's Camp Four?

19       A    It's the new name for Legacy.

20       Q    So the Legacy steering committee is now

21  calling Camp Four?

22       A    Correct.

23       Q    And do you recall when that name change

24  occurred?

25       A    I want to say two years ago.  That's a guess.
                                                         261



 1       Q    And did the functioning of that organization

 2  or that committee change at all or is it just the name?

 3       A    Just the name.

 4       Q    Do you know why it's called Camp Four?

 5       A    It was the next phase of his leadership, and

 6  he titles them differently.

 7       Q    Got it.  So camp as in moving up the mountain?

 8       A    Camp Four is the last camp before you ascend

 9  to the top of Mount Everest.

10       Q    Oh.

11                  (Exhibit 239 was marked)

12       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I have what's been marked now

13  as Exhibit 239.  This is an email between you and

14  Kathryn McLay, correct?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    If we look at the third page, at the top, the

17  date is May 25th of 2017, right?

18       A    Correct.

19       Q    And then if we go back to the third page, it

20  looks like it's still the same day, just earlier in the

21  day, right?

22       A    Yep.

23       Q    And on this third page, Bates label M00012880,

24  there's an email in the middle of the page where you

25  write that you met with Zest and Zest -- I guess you
                                                         262



 1  told Zest don't run to Greg and say that we are slow and

 2  dumb again.  Do you see that?

 3       A    I let them know -- it does not say that I said

 4  that to them.  I let them know, so that's probably a

 5  summation of my communication.

 6       Q    Okay.  So that may not be a direct quote but

 7  that was the gist of what you were saying to Zest?

 8       A    Correct.

 9       Q    And who told Greg that you were slow and dumb?

10       A    Again, that's a summation of general

11  conversations around Zest's perspective of the work.

12       Q    So you're -- are you saying that no one

13  actually said you were slow and dumb?  That was just,

14  sort of, the gist?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    The gist of what people were saying to

17  Mr. Foran?

18       A    The conversation around the communication

19  between Zest and Walmart.

20       Q    Between Zest and Walmart or between Zest and

21  Mr. Foran?

22       A    This says it's Zest and Greg but, in general,

23  yes.

24       Q    Okay.  But here, you were specifically

25  concerned about them going to Greg --
                                                         263



 1       A    Yes.

 2       Q    -- and saying something negative about you.

 3       A    We, not me.

 4       Q    Okay.  We.  And "we" in this particular case

 5  is who?

 6       A    The broader sense of Fresh.

 7       Q    Are you aware of any conversation that took

 8  place between someone at Zest and Mr. Foran where

 9  someone said Fresh was slow and dumb?

10       A    Slow would have been the Lamar email.  Dumb

11  was word of mouth.  And I have never seen a

12  communication until you just showed it to me in

13  reference to lack of talent and Walmart.

14       Q    Now, that was Mr. Foran's words, right, not

15  somebody at Zest?

16       A    That is correct.

17       Q    So that wouldn't have been Zest going to

18  Mr. Foran and saying you were dumb, right?  That was an

19  email from Mr. Foran?

20       A    That is correct.

21       Q    Okay.  Did it make you angry that Zest had

22  this direct relationship with Mr. Foran?

23       A    No.

24       Q    Did it bother you?

25       A    It sometimes made things more difficult.
                                                         264



 1       Q    Okay.  So it did bother you?

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

 3  Mischaracterizes the testimony.

 4       A    A lot of things at work are difficult.  They

 5  don't bother me.

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Nothing bothers you?

 7       A    No.

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection.  Mischaracterizes

 9  the testimony.

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Let me put it this way.  The

11  communication -- for example, Mr. Steiger's

12  communication made you so angry, you couldn't see,

13  right?

14       A    Correct.

15       Q    So -- and that communication was also about

16  Zest, right?

17       A    That communication made me angry because it

18  was a personal attack.

19       Q    And was it all --

20       A    Based on --

21       Q    I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

22       A    Based on very little information.

23       Q    Did it also make you angry because it was sent

24  to Mr. Foran?

25       A    Foran, yes, but leadership in general.
                                                         265



 1       Q    Fair enough.  So somebody -- a personal attack

 2  by somebody to leadership at Walmart about you is

 3  something that would have made you angry?

 4       A    Yes.

 5       Q    Okay.

 6       A    Unfounded, correct.

 7       Q    The fact that Mr. Steiger made that statement

 8  and made you angry, did you associate him with Zest

 9  given that he was advocating for Zest in that same

10  email?

11       A    I was not aware of any direct relationship.

12       Q    Well, he certainly talks about Zest in his

13  email that made you angry, right?

14       A    He talks about it in the email.  It was not

15  what made me angry.

16       Q    Got it.  What made you angry was what we've

17  already talked about, personal attack with little

18  information going to other executives at Walmart?

19       A    That's correct.

20       Q    If folks at Zest were talking to Mr. Foran

21  about you in a negative way, that would also make you

22  angry, right?

23       A    If I --

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.

25       A    If I was made aware of those things, I mean,
                                                         266



 1  hypothetically.

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Yeah.  And you're fact

 3  witness.  You're not here to answer hypotheticals.

 4       A    Okay.

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So in this email that we're

 6  looking at here in Exhibit 239.  Sorry.  There it is.

 7  It appears that you had heard from someone that Zest was

 8  making negative comments to Mr. Foran, either about you

 9  or about people -- or your organization, right?

10       A    Where are you referring to here?

11       Q    The email that we just looked at, Exhibit 239,

12  on the third page.  So don't run to Greg and say we are

13  slow and dumb again.

14       A    And what is your question?

15       Q    Yeah, by saying don't do this again, it

16  appears that you believed it had happened before, right?

17       A    The general context and conversations were

18  that those things were happening.

19       Q    Right.  And had you heard that general context

20  and conversation from someone?

21       A    I don't remember the specifics.

22       Q    Someone had to have told you, right?

23  Otherwise, there'd be no way for you to know, correct?

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    You don't remember who told you?
                                                         267



 1       A    I don't.

 2       Q    Did this -- let's go to the first page of

 3  Exhibit 239.

 4       A    Yep.  239, first page, yep.

 5       Q    The top, there's an email from you to Kathryn

 6  McLay, correct?  And at the bottom of the first page,

 7  there's an email from Kathryn McLay to you.  Do you see

 8  that?

 9       A    Yes.

10       Q    In Kathryn's email to you on May 21st, she

11  says, The question in talent review from Greg was can

12  Kelly aim before shooting.  Do you see that?

13       A    Yep.

14       Q    Greg -- in this context, do you know which

15  Greg that is?

16       A    Smith.

17       Q    Okay.  And that was Kathryn's boss?

18       A    That is correct.

19       Q    And then he reported directly to Greg Foran?

20       A    Correct.

21       Q    And do you recall this talent review process?

22       A    Yes.

23       Q    Was there a formal written review that you

24  received that had this information about aiming before

25  shooting?
                                                         268



 1       A    There were -- no.  There's never any formal,

 2  written communication.

 3       Q    What is the talent -- what's the talent review

 4  process that this refers to?

 5       A    So each of the layers of management talked

 6  specifically about their teams, and it reports up and

 7  they review top talent, high potentials, senior

 8  directors, HR, talent objectives, et cetera.

 9       Q    And you said there's nothing in writing.  So

10  is this all verbal?

11       A    When it -- when you are talked about, it's

12  verbal.

13       Q    Okay.  So there may be a written --

14       A    Somewhere.

15       Q    -- aggregation of information?

16       A    Yeah.  I have no idea where it is.

17       Q    You don't actually receive the written part?

18       A    No.

19       Q    Okay.  It's just who sits down with you to

20  give you the review?

21       A    In this particular case, nobody.  Kath sent me

22  an email.

23       Q    Okay.  So this email here is actually the

24  review?

25       A    Correct.
                                                         269



 1       Q    Did Kathryn explain anymore what she meant by,

 2  Can Kelly aim before shooting?

 3       A    She didn't say that.  That was Greg's

 4  question.

 5       Q    Fair enough.  She is writing this email,

 6  right?

 7       A    Yeah.

 8       Q    She says it in the context of this email,

 9  correct?

10       A    She writes the email saying that's what Greg

11  said.

12       Q    Okay.  Did she explain to you anymore about

13  what Greg meant in your talent review?

14       A    Only what's in this email.

15       Q    Okay.  Is this the sum total of the entire

16  process here?  You didn't have any conversations with

17  her about this?

18       A    No.

19       Q    Based on this review process, what did you

20  understand, Can Kelly aim before shooting, to mean?

21       A    Yes.  So this is not even, probably, about

22  five months into Greg Smith's tenure.  We were on a trip

23  on the West Coast.  I had just been given perishable

24  consolidation, which is a project that is run out

25  Corinne.  I did not start it.  I did not establish it.
                                                         270



 1  I did not deploy it.  But it was a mess, and they gave

 2  it to me because it needed end-to-end management.

 3                 I took it on probably a couple of months

 4  before this.  Greg was new.  He wasn't aware of it.  We

 5  went to the DC.  It became a very contentious point.

 6  There were two VPs in the room that had initiated it and

 7  led it.  They did not speak up nor did they own what had

 8  happened previous to me getting it.  It was perceived in

 9  that meeting that the whole project had been a mess

10  because of my management.  There were three -- they

11  weren't VPs.  They were SVPs.  They do not work with

12  Walmart anymore.

13                 That was the situation.  It was not

14  appropriate for me to address it there given the level

15  of people that were there and leaving me hanging.  Kath

16  was very aware.  She understood it.  That's what this is

17  referring to.

18       Q    And in that situation, did you shoot before

19  you aimed, in some sense?

20       A    Not in this situation.  Because of where the

21  project was, it didn't have data.  It didn't have a

22  business case.  And he kept asking those questions,

23  which are very important for a well-run project.  And I

24  had to say no.  And the two gentlemen who had started

25  the project and didn't have that information were not
                                                         271



 1  forthright, given that six months in, that was their EVP

 2  and direct supervisor, and so I was left out to hung --

 3  hang.

 4       Q    And the EVP there was Greg Smith?

 5       A    That's correct.

 6       Q    Who were the SVPs that were there?

 7       A    Tracy Rosser and Brian -- it's a long

 8  spelling, Burdough, but I don't know how to spell it.

 9  And I don't even -- Burdough.  It's -- anyway, Brian

10  Burdough.  It's got some O's and U's and GH's.

11       Q    Did you have a conversation with Mr. Smith

12  about this issue --

13       A    No.

14       Q    -- after this?

15       A    I immediately left the room and conversed with

16  Kath, and she told me she would take care of it.

17       Q    Okay.

18       A    Which is what that paragraph speaks to.

19       Q    And so when there's discussion about the in

20  Corinne situation or the Corinne debacle, I think, as

21  it's called in certain emails, that is the situation

22  that that refers to?

23       A    That particular meeting, it does.  And if you

24  see here, it says, He asked who kicked it off.  I said

25  transport.  He said, ah-ha.  Hence, the gentleman
                                                         272



 1  doesn't work at Walmart anymore.

 2       Q    And that is -- the gentleman is Brian or Tracy

 3  or --

 4       A    That would be Tracy, who was the SVP of

 5  transportation.  Now, clearly, this is not the reason

 6  that he doesn't work at Walmart anymore but....

 7       Q    Why do you say clearly, this is not the

 8  reason?

 9       A    Because he's an SVP.  This is one project.

10       Q    You say here when you're responding at the top

11  of the page.

12       A    The top of what page?

13       Q    The top of this same page.

14       A    Yep.

15       Q    We're still in the same exhibit.  You respond

16  back to Ms. McLay, correct?

17       A    Yes.

18       Q    You say, I took that feedback that the Corinne

19  debacle can be avoided if we handle Zest correctly.  See

20  that?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    What was the connection between Corinne and

23  Zest?

24       A    There isn't --

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.
                                                         273



 1                 THE WITNESS:  Oops, sorry.

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Sorry.  It's my fault.  Go

 3  ahead.

 4       A    There isn't.

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  Why were they being

 6  discussed in this same email?

 7       A    Because the perspective of aiming before

 8  shooting came from Corinne.  And then we moved on to me

 9  talking about how I was handling other projects.

10       Q    You go on to say, I should have been in

11  command -- speaking about the Corinne situation, I

12  should have been in command and I let it go.  I will not

13  allow that to happen with the Zest thing.

14                 Do you see that?

15       A    Correct.  Was that a question?

16                 MR. SAMMI:  Yeah, he said, do you see

17  that?

18                 THE WITNESS:  Oh, okay.

19                 MR. SAMMI:  You said yes.

20                 THE WITNESS:  Okay.

21                 MR. SAMMI:  That's the question.

22                 THE WITNESS:  Okay.

23                 MR. SAMMI:  Whether you saw it.

24                  (Exhibit 240 was marked)

25       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  This is Exhibit 240.  This is
                                                         274



 1  a email from you to Gary Adams, as well as a number of

 2  people, on July 27th, 2017, right?

 3       A    Yes.

 4       Q    This particular email looks like it is talking

 5  about that break-out from a --

 6       A    The second one?

 7       Q    Yeah.  Break out from the Legacy Fresh

 8  meeting.

 9       A    Yes.  This is the one that I referred to

10  earlier where they didn't remember that they had done

11  something, and we had to go redo it.

12       Q    And that's why you say, He asked to do a

13  deeper dive in the Fresh network.  I chose not to tell

14  the CEO that he must have forgotten what I'd already --

15  forgotten that we already did that.  See that?

16       A    (Witness nods head.)

17       Q    And then you end it with "J".  What does "J"

18  mean at the end?

19       A    "J" is what happens when you put a smiley face

20  into a computer.

21       Q    Got it.  So that was supposed to be a smiley

22  face but it turned into a "J"?

23       A    No.  It was a smiley face.  The computer turns

24  it into a "J".

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Am I hip enough to say emoji?
                                                         275



 1  It's an emoji.

 2                 THE WITNESS:  Well, if my computer could

 3  do an emoji, it would have stayed a smiley face.

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  I see.

 5                 THE WITNESS:  That's just a colon and a

 6  parentheses.

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Do you remember talking to

 8  Kathryn McLay about getting the information and doing

 9  the evaluation of Zest based on testing versus

10  collusion?  Do you remember that conversation with

11  Ms. McLay?

12       A    I do not.

13       Q    The -- going back to Exhibit 240, you say that

14  you're going to take the slide that you had before and

15  redo them into a new presentation, right?  If you look

16  down at the bottom of the first paragraph.

17       A    Yes.

18       Q    Okay.  Overall, did you feel like this was a

19  meeting that went well?

20       A    Which meeting?

21       Q    The meeting that preceded the email in Exhibit

22  240.  In other words, you were at a meeting --

23       A    The Legacy meeting?

24       Q    Yeah.

25       A    Yeah.
                                                         276



 1       Q    Okay.  So you say, Hi, all.  Today in Legacy

 2  Fresh Flow, we talked about these things.  So that's the

 3  meeting I'm -- I'm referring to.

 4       A    When you say went well, what does that mean?

 5       Q    Did you think there was any problem or issue

 6  after this meeting?

 7       A    I didn't think so.  There was some tension in

 8  the room because they had forgotten what they knew.  And

 9  so there was a back and forth between Ed, my direct boss

10  and the EVP and potentially Greg Smith, where Greg Smith

11  was asked by Greg Foran, why didn't you talk to me about

12  this on Tuesday.  They didn't remember, and so there was

13  some tension in the room around why in Greg's -- both

14  Gregs' perceptions that this hadn't been talked about or

15  communicated.  I knew that it had, so I did not consider

16  that a problem.  I knew they would remember when we

17  showed it to them.

18       Q    And that didn't happen until a later meeting,

19  correct?

20       A    Correct.

21                  (Exhibit 241 was marked)

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Take a look at what's been

23  marked Exhibit 241.  I think this may be some of the

24  tension that you're referring to.  This is an email from

25  Ed Oldham, who was your boss at the time to Kathryn
                                                         277



 1  McLay, his boss, correct?

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to the question and

 3  the colloquy.

 4       A    Say that again.  I'm sorry.

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  This is from Ed Oldham

 6  to Kathryn McLay.

 7       A    Yes.

 8       Q    And at that time, Ed Oldham was your boss,

 9  correct?

10       A    That's correct.

11       Q    And then Kathryn McLay was his boss, correct?

12       A    That is correct.

13       Q    And he says in the second paragraph, Greg S.

14  came to see me after and was annoyed again.  See that?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    Is this the tension that you referred to a

17  moment ago?

18       A    Yes.

19                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, foundation.  Go

20  ahead that.

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  And it says, In the

23  discussion on scaling, Greg -- Greg F. Foran, asked if

24  we know where we want to the future FSCs.  Do you see

25  that?
                                                         278



 1       A    Yes.

 2       Q    FCSs are fresh consolidation centers?

 3       A    Fresh solution centers.

 4       Q    Fresh solution centers.  Sorry.

 5       A    Yes.

 6       Q    And he says, Kelly said, paraphrasing, yes, I

 7  know where I want them.  Five locations, cost a few

 8  million each.  Mostly for systems.  Use 3PL if we want

 9  to go fast.  Do you see that?

10       A    Yes.

11       Q    Is that a roughly accurate paraphrase of what

12  you said at the time.

13       A    Yes.

14       Q    3PL is?

15       A    Third-party logistics.

16       Q    Says, Greg S. was frustrated about that and

17  made it clear to me in private.

18                 So Greg Smith apparently was frustrated

19  by the fact that you had provided this information or

20  spoke up?

21                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to foundation and

22  form.

23       A    Yeah, I'm --

24       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  What was your understanding

25  of how why he was frustrated?
                                                         279



 1                 MR. SAMMI:  Are you withdrawing the last

 2  question?  Are you withdrawing the last question?

 3                 MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.  Can I have that one

 5  again?

 6       Q    (BY MR. SAMMI)  What was your understanding of

 7  why he was frustrated?

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

 9       A    I don't know what they talked about in

10  private.  What I watched happen in the meeting was Greg

11  Foran asked Greg Smith why -- why didn't you show it to

12  me on Tuesday.  I have no idea what happened on Tuesday.

13  I don't know what they talked about on Tuesday.  Greg

14  Smith said a few things.  I answered some questions and

15  we moved on.  I witnessed tension.

16       Q    Tension between Greg Smith and Greg Foran?

17       A    Just tension in the room.

18       Q    And it goes on to say, As we discussed course

19  correcting per my email yesterday, we will need to get

20  Kelly firmly controlled from GS's POV.

21       A    Uh-huh.

22       Q    GS is Greg Smith, right?

23       A    Yep.

24       Q    And his POV is his point of view, right?

25       A    Yep.
                                                         280



 1       Q    Do you understand why Greg Smith felt like you

 2  needed to be firmly controlled?

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.

 4       A    I -- I don't know the context exactly, but

 5  remember, this is under the situation where he didn't

 6  remember that he had had the extra information.

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did Kathryn have a

 8  conversation -- Ed or Kathryn have a conversation about

 9  you being more firmly controlled?

10       A    Absolutely not.

11       Q    And the last sentence in the paragraph is,

12  It's really antagonizing him.  That is Greg Smith,

13  right?

14                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.

15       A    I don't know.

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did you have any

17  conversations with Mr. Oldham or Mr. Smith or Kathryn

18  about this Mr. Smith feeling antagonized by you?

19       A    Ed and I talked about the fact that he was

20  frustrated with the meeting and that all -- and because

21  Ed was not also my boss when we had the first meeting or

22  at least wasn't in the first meeting that I remember.

23  Kath was there.  So I'm sure Ed would have communicated

24  to him remember this meeting, we had it.  You know this.

25  We've gone through it.  It's been -- you know, et
                                                         281



 1  cetera.  He didn't know at the time, so all of this

 2  frustration is based on Greg not remembering a meeting.

 3  And it -- it really wasn't needed to be addressed.

 4                 The only conversations I directly had

 5  with Ed was on my performance, which was exactly what he

 6  stated in that last, that I did very well in the

 7  meeting.

 8       Q    Did anyone in management at Walmart do

 9  anything to try and make sure that you were more firmly

10  controlled, in the words of this email?

11       A    Never.

12       Q    Nothing that you're aware of?

13       A    No.

14       Q    Did you feel like you needed to be firmly

15  controlled?

16       A    No, no.

17       Q    Is that -- is -- your current boss is -- I

18  can't remember her name.

19       A    Monique.

20       Q    If you can remind me.  Monique.  And her boss

21  is who?

22       A    Greg Smith.

23       Q    Okay.  So Greg Smith is still --

24       A    EVP.

25       Q    Still above you in the organization?
                                                         282



 1       A    Absolutely.

 2       Q    How's your relationship with Greg Smith

 3  currently?

 4       A    Great.

 5       Q    Have you had conversations with him since this

 6  email about this situation or other tension between the

 7  two of you?

 8       A    I've never had conversations with him about

 9  this situation, and I've never had conversations about

10  tension with Greg Smith.

11       Q    Fair enough.  Have you had conversations with

12  other people about tension, it sounds like, but not with

13  Greg Smith?

14       A    I spoke to, as I said earlier, Ed about the

15  tension in the room, that I was not worried about

16  because both executives had forgotten about the hour we

17  had spent on that particular topic nine months earlier

18  or seven months earlier.

19                  (Exhibit 242 was marked)

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  This is Exhibit 242.  This is

21  a October 24th, 2017 email between you and Ed Oldham,

22  correct?

23       A    Looks that way.  Let me review.

24       Q    Sure.

25       A    Yes.
                                                         283



 1       Q    And if you look at the second email in the

 2  chain here, it's an email from Denise Sharpe, to Ed

 3  Oldham and yourself copying Kathryn McLay, correct?

 4       A    Correct.

 5       Q    And she makes a comment, Kelly just told me

 6  that 3 million was for Deloitte, so I made a -- the

 7  correction in the deck.

 8       A    Correct.

 9       Q    What is she discussing here?  What deck is

10  this that she's talking about?

11       A    Oh, my God.  I have no idea particularly.

12       Q    It looks like, if you look back in this email,

13  this is the deck that was going to go to the Legacy team

14  related to Zest, correct?  If you look down at the very

15  first email in the chain, it says, If you make these

16  tweaks in the first 24 hours, we can probably grab all

17  the leaders X Greg F after 2:00 Thursday.  Legacy is

18  ending early.

19       A    This was not going to Legacy.

20       Q    Okay.  This was something that was going to

21  be -- go to Greg after the Legacy meeting it looks like?

22       A    Correct.  Maybe.

23       Q    If you could catch him.

24       A    If -- if Ed could catch him.

25       Q    Okay.

 1       A    I don't go to those meetings.

 2       Q    Got it.  And if you -- you can see the

 3  attachment, is a presentation that you were working on

 4  or that Ms. Sharpe was working on with you related to

 5  Zest, correct?

 6       A    That is correct.

 7       Q    So when she says, Kelly just told me that

 8  3 million was for Deloitte, so I made the correction in

 9  the deck, does that now refresh your recollection of

10  what this deck was that you were working on?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    Okay.  Do you know what she was talking about

13  here, that the 3 million was for Deloitte, the change

14  that she made?

15       A    I need to find it in the deck --

16       Q    Sure.

17       A    -- to see.

18       Q    I think, if you go to the one Bates labeled,

19  WM00062406, there's some discussion about Deloitte on

20  that slide.

21       A    I don't see 3 million.  Oh, there it is,

22  3 million.  Got it.

23       Q    Does that refresh your recollection where the

24  3 million related to Deloitte --

25       A    Yes.

 1       Q    -- came from?  Your response to Ed Oldham

 2  alone is, oh, my God.  She doesn't want to work with me.

 3       A    Right.

 4       Q    You're talking about Denise Sharpe, right?

 5       A    Yes.

 6       Q    What do you mean by oh, my God; she doesn't

 7  want to work with me?

 8       A    If you knew how many edits this poor woman

 9  did.  I mean, it's -- you know, it starts -- it's just a

10  deck-happy environment.  And so she had done several

11  edits, and I still had to tell her yet another one.  So

12  it was -- it was just me being funny.

13       Q    That she didn't -- because of the number of

14  edits?

15       A    Because -- right.  I mean, she just became a

16  deck editor.

17       Q    And there were many, many versions of this

18  presentation that were prepared in the October --

19       A    I don't know -- I don't know about final

20  versions.  I do know we made many edits.

21       Q    Right.  And when I say not many final

22  versions, I mean there were many versions because there

23  were lots of edits, right?

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

25       A    Some of the edits were done, we'd pop it on to
                                                         286



 1  my screen in my office.  Someone would come in.  We'd --

 2  like, edits aren't always -- we'd go to lunch, we'd come

 3  back, it would stay there.  I mean, like, there are many

 4  edits.  I don't know how many versions.

 5       Q    Fair enough.  And when you say people would

 6  come in your office and you'd look at it on the screen,

 7  who was there with you making edits?

 8       A    Ed, Denise, myself.

 9       Q    Anyone else?

10       A    That's all I can remember at that point.

11       Q    Do you remember any of the edits that you

12  contributed changes that you suggested besides 3 million

13  for Deloitte, which appears to be one that you

14  suggested?

15       A    I don't.  I'm not a big editor myself.  I

16  prefer --

17       Q    Although, it appears in this scenario, you

18  were, right?

19       A    I was just the last edit that could have been

20  the straw.

21       Q    Did Denise complain about the number of edits?

22       A    No.

23       Q    Or complain about --

24       A    No.  We were laughing together about the

25  amount of edits.
                                                         287



 1       Q    Why -- what was funny about the fact that

 2  there was so my edits?

 3       A    Because there were a lot of edits.

 4       Q    Is there a particular reason why there were so

 5  many in this instance compared to other instances?

 6       A    It's not just in this instance.  That's why

 7  it's funny.  It's a deck-happy culture.  Coming from

 8  outside the company, it's a deck-happy culture.

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  How long have we been going

10  since the last break?

11                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Hour and four minutes.

12                 MR. SAMMI:  Hour and four minutes.  Let's

13  take a break.

14                 MR. SIMONS:  All right.  Yeah.  We can

15  take a break.

16                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off the

17  record at 5:07 p.m.

18                 (A break was taken from 5:07 p.m. to 5:22

19                 p.m., 15 minutes)

20                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on the

21  record at 5:22 p.m.

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I want to go back to

23  Exhibit 239 briefly.  Hopefully, it's near the top of

24  your stack.  Look at the second page of Exhibit 239.

25  Down at the bottom of the page, the very last line, you

 1  write, Zest, we're finally getting all the information

 2  and we'll be collaborating on KPIs and testing versus

 3  collusion.  No, that's not a typo.  And here, your

 4  smiley face did come through.

 5       A    Yes.

 6       Q    What do you mean by testing vs. collusion?

 7  What collusion were you referring to?

 8       A    I have -- I really don't have any idea, but I

 9  thought it was cute, which is why I put a smiley face,

10  so it clearly was more of a said-in-jest.

11       Q    Did you feel like there was collusion going on

12  related to Zest?

13       A    I would not have put a smiley face because

14  that would not be funny if I thought that was the case.

15       Q    Okay.  So you did not feel like there was

16  collusion going on?  It was just a joke?

17       A    Not officially collusion.  I'm sure it was

18  said in jest.  Otherwise, I would not have put a smiley

19  face.

20       Q    Does this collusion in jest refer to the

21  notion that Zest had a relationship with Greg Foran?  Is

22  that what the joke was about?

23       A    No.  Zest had many relationships across all of

24  Walmart.

25       Q    And so that's what you were joking about here?
                                                         289



 1       A    I don't really remember the specifics, but it

 2  was not about just one relationship because there were

 3  many.

 4                  (Exhibit 243 was marked)

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Let's take a look at

 6  Exhibit 243.  This is an email from Kathryn McLay to Ed

 7  Oldham.  And if you look at the August 2nd email, the

 8  second one in the chain, Ed says, I talked to Kyle at

 9  Deloitte this p.m. for an hour.  Were you involved in

10  the conversation that he had with Kyle at Deloitte?

11       A    Not that I recall.

12       Q    He goes on to say, Some Zest, some Win in

13  Fresh, some let's get all our cards on the table about

14  what Deloitte is telling Greg.

15                 Was there some concern about what

16  Deloitte was telling to Greg Foran?

17                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form and

18  foundation.

19       A    I have no idea what he's writing this email

20  about.

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  He goes on to say, I

22  have some insights about how about we put a cork in the

23  Zest issue.

24                 Do you have any idea what he's talking

25  about here, putting a cork in Zest?
                                                         290



 1       A    No idea.

 2       Q    Did you ever have a conversation with Ed or

 3  Kathryn about putting a cork in the Zest issue?

 4       A    Not that I remember.

 5       Q    Take a look at what's been marked previously

 6  as Exhibit 119.  This is an email chain between Denise

 7  Sharpe and yourself, correct?

 8       A    Yes.

 9       Q    And if you look at the email down in the --

10       A    I'm sorry.

11       Q    Oh, sorry.

12       A    My candy is going to be very loud on this, and

13  I just realized that.  I apologize for the video guy.

14       Q    If you look at email sort of in the middle of

15  the page, Denise writes to you, Take a look at the

16  second slide.  I'll have the data points for the first

17  Emerson sensor either later today or early next week.

18  That's the one I'd like to recommend for the pilot.

19                 Do you see that?

20       A    Yes.

21       Q    This is -- she's -- this is during the POC,

22  right, the proof of concept or the bake-off?

23       A    That's correct.

24       Q    Where you're making a decision about who

25  you're going to choose.
                                                         291



 1       A    What sensor we're going to choose.

 2       Q    For the pilot, right?

 3       A    For the pilot, correct.

 4       Q    The next step?

 5       A    That's correct.

 6       Q    And she says -- she doesn't have all the data

 7  points yet for Emerson but that's the one that she's

 8  going to recommend for the pilot, right?

 9       A    Uh-huh.

10       Q    Any reason why she was ready to make the

11  recommendation despite the fact that she doesn't have

12  all the data points?

13                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

14       A    She might have 98 percent of them.

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.

16       A    Just doesn't have a hundred percent.  I

17  don't -- I don't know that means.

18       Q    You don't know?  You didn't have a

19  conversation with her about how much data she had when

20  the recommendation was made?

21                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

22  Mischaracterizes the document.

23       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did you have a conversation

24  with her about that?

25       A    Other than this email chain?

 1                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

 2  Mischaracterizes the document.  Please go ahead.

 3       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.

 4       A    Other than this email chain?

 5       Q    Yes.

 6       A    Not that I remember.

 7       Q    Okay.  Who made the decision about who you

 8  were going to choose for the pilot?

 9       A    We made a collective recommendation.  And then

10  it was shared with leadership, who shared it with more

11  leadership.

12       Q    And when you say, "we made a collective

13  recommendation," who was "we" that made the

14  recommendation?

15       A    Denise, Jon, Stephen provided information.

16  The collective team.

17       Q    And when you say Jon, which Jon are you

18  talking about, John Fox?

19       A    Yeah.

20       Q    And Stephen is Stephen Steele?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    And when did you make the decision?

23       A    If I remember correctly, it was sometime in

24  the fall of 2017.

25       Q    Do you remember anything more specific than
                                                         293



 1  the fall of 2017?

 2       A    Not specifically.

 3                  (Exhibit 244 was marked)

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Sorry.  I think there's two

 5  there.  I apologize.  Oh, maybe there's not.

 6                 This is 244.  Exhibit 244 is a

 7  October 10th, 2017 email attaching new decks, Cold Chain

 8  compliance.  Do you see that?

 9       A    Uh-huh.

10       Q    These decks are versions of the deck that you

11  were editing with Ms. Sharpe related to the POC,

12  correct?

13       A    That is correct.

14       Q    And if you look at slide 13, which is the

15  Bates number ending in 66.  And I apologize, it's

16  somewhat small.  But if you look at the top right-hand

17  corner, it says, Emerson auto sense is listed as the

18  first place finisher.  And for the sensor count, do you

19  see where it says 39 limited test?

20       A    Yes.

21       Q    So the winning vendor only had 39 sensors in

22  the evaluation?

23       A    Yes.

24       Q    Is that enough to evaluate the vendor?

25       A    Yes.
                                                         294



 1       Q    Why didn't you do more?  Why didn't you do a

 2  hundred -- you know, 1500 with the next one.  All the

 3  rest of are in the hundreds.  Some -- most of them, more

 4  than a thousand, but the winner only had 39.  Is there a

 5  reason why?

 6       A    Each vendor determined the number of sensors.

 7       Q    So you didn't have any requirement as to how

 8  many sensors they were going to need in order to be a

 9  valid test of the technology?

10       A    Our requirements were based on the evaluation

11  of the results not a number of sensors.

12       Q    Did you personally look at the results for the

13  39 sensors at issue here?

14       A    I don't remember specifically all the results

15  that I looked at.

16       Q    And it looks like you didn't get the data for

17  these Emerson sensors until at least late in September,

18  right, if you look back to Exhibit 119?

19       A    119?  Oh.

20       Q    No, it's the last exhibit you just had.

21       A    Oh, jeez.

22       Q    I know.  It sounded like we were going way

23  back but it's one of the -- it's this one-pager.

24       A    All right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Okay.

25       Q    Yeah.
                                                         295



 1       A    So this does not say that.

 2       Q    It says, I'll have the data points for the

 3  first Emerson sensor either later today or early next

 4  week.

 5       A    That speaks to when Denise would have them,

 6  not when we would have received all of the data.

 7       Q    Did you receive the data separately from

 8  Denise?

 9       A    I did.

10       Q    Did you have the data for these sensors before

11  she had it?

12       A    Nope.

13       Q    Okay.  So it looks like Denise, at least the

14  one she said she's going to be making the

15  recommendation.  And she did not have the data at that

16  point, correct?

17                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

18  Mischaracterizes the document.

19       A    She had some amount of data in her possession,

20  but this does not speak to how much data was available.

21       Q    Well, she says -- she doesn't say she has any

22  data.  She says, I'll have the data points for the first

23  Emerson sensor either later today or early next week,

24  right?

25       A    That's correct.

 1       Q    So it doesn't indicate that she has any data,

 2  right.

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.

 4       A    I don't know what she has or hasn't.  It just

 5  says what it says.

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  Did you have any

 7  Emerson data at this point?

 8       A    No, I did not.

 9                 (Exhibit 245 was marked)

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  Next exhibit is 245.

11  Bates label ending in 61136.  This indicates that Denise

12  has completed the POC for the Cold Chain vendors along

13  with the analysis of what technology she wants to

14  recommend for the pilot, right, as of October 16th,

15  2017?

16       A    It does not say that.

17       Q    The first sentence there?

18       A    It says "we" not "she".

19       Q    So it says Denise has completed --

20       A    Yeah.

21       Q    That we want to recommend; is that what you're

22  correcting?

23       A    Yes, yes.

24       Q    Got it.  Now, is this -- this is the same

25  recommendation that we've been talking about, right --
                                                         297



 1                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  -- in the last few exhibits?

 3       A    I believe so.

 4       Q    If you look at the last sentence in this first

 5  paragraph, It says, We need to get it in front of the

 6  logistic leadership team and come up with a reco on how

 7  to cut the cord.

 8                 Is cutting the cord meaning getting rid

 9  of Zest?

10       A    It means that we are not going to be using the

11  other vendors.

12       Q    This specifically is talking about Zest,

13  right, how to cut the cord with Zest?

14       A    Yep.  It would be the same with the other

15  vendors, but yes.

16       Q    Well, was there a process for cutting the cord

17  with the other vendors involved in the POC?

18       A    Of course.

19       Q    Was it similar to the process of cutting the

20  cord with Zest?

21       A    It was not as extensive.

22       Q    And why was -- why was that?

23       A    Zest had some relationships --

24       Q    Okay.

25       A    -- that we needed to be very sensitive to and
                                                         298



 1  -- and respectful of.  And make sure that we were

 2  handling the information appropriately.  And the other

 3  vendors were not as entangled with those things that we

 4  needed to consider.

 5       Q    Didn't have the long -- the same length of

 6  relationship as Zest had with Walmart?

 7       A    Some of them have a long relationship, just

 8  maybe not as complicated.

 9       Q    Okay.  This has previously been marked as

10  Exhibit 113, an email from you to Ed Oldham and Denise

11  Sharpe.

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    And you say, First stab at deck for

14  elimination of Zest, right?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    So the purpose of this deck, as you describe

17  it here, was to eliminate Zest?

18       A    The communication of the recommendation is the

19  purpose.

20       Q    But what -- the way you described this deck is

21  a deck for the elimination of Zest.

22       A    Out of the pilot, correct.  Eliminating Zest

23  is not part of the pilot.

24       Q    And really, you're going to be eliminating

25  Zest more than just out of the pilot, right?  You were
                                                         299



 1  ending the relationship completely, right?

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

 3  Mischaracterizes testimony.

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You can answer.

 5       A    I was only eliminating them out of my pilot.

 6  What they were doing with other things, I had no control

 7  over.

 8       Q    And when you say "they," what do you -- who

 9  were you referring to?

10       A    Zest.

11       Q    This has been previously marked as Exhibit

12  114.  Do you have an understanding as to why you were

13  directly involved with this process of, as the prior

14  email called it, eliminating Zest?  Why it sort of fell

15  in your domain.

16                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You can answer.

18       A    As with other projects I've mentioned, often,

19  the complexity of the projects and pilots that were

20  being run, that were end to end, were difficult to run

21  in -- within a function.  And because I'm a staff

22  function that crosses many functions and influences

23  across, I end -- I ended up getting projects that often

24  needed that help.

25       Q    Take a look at Exhibit 114 that you have in
                                                         300



 1  front of you.  It looks like this is a continuation of

 2  your discussions with Ed Oldham and Ms. Sharpe working

 3  on this same deck, correct?

 4       A    You're feeling my pain.

 5       Q    So this is part of what you were describing

 6  before, many edits but, also, we've now seen a number of

 7  versions, correct?

 8       A    Yes.

 9       Q    And Ed is providing comments on one of the

10  versions on this particular day, correct?

11       A    That is correct.

12       Q    And it looks like he said, it's always

13  tempting to say what you feel are pertinent details but

14  the EVP, SVP level, it's usually better to distill it

15  down to only what they need to know.  They will trust us

16  on the rest.

17                 Do you see that?

18       A    Uh-huh.

19       Q    Do you agree with his assessment on that?

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

21       A    I actually do not.

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You do not?

23       A    No.

24       Q    In terms of how this particular presentation

25  was prepared, is that what ended up happening, even if
                                                         301



 1  you didn't necessarily agree with it?  Did Ed's ultimate

 2  preferences rule the day?

 3       A    You asked me if I agree with that statement in

 4  general.  I do not agree with that statement in general.

 5       Q    Okay.

 6       A    This particular deck, Ed was controlling the

 7  edits.

 8       Q    Okay.

 9       A    I did not challenge it, nor did I feel the

10  necessary need to challenge it.

11       Q    So in the end, even if you didn't necessarily

12  agree with it, that's the way it went because Ed --

13                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.

14  Mischaracterizes testimony.

15       A    I said I don't agree with the general

16  statement.

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.

18       A    I said I didn't have any reason to disagree

19  with what he was doing here.

20       Q    Understood.  So ultimately, what happened was

21  you did distill it down to just what they needed to know

22  and have them trust you on the rest in this situation?

23                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

24       A    From his perspective, what we ended up with

25  was something he was happy with.  He would need to
                                                         302



 1  decide if it met those criteria.

 2       Q    Okay.  But, I think, as you said, you did not

 3  challenge this preference that he expressed here in this

 4  email?

 5                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.

 6       A    That is correct.

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did the ultimate presentation

 8  end up being distilled down from what you had in earlier

 9  versions?

10       A    I have absolutely -- like, seriously, like,

11  it's already five days between the last two and so I --

12  I -- I would have to go through all of them to tell you

13  what we pulled out and what we edited.  I mean, he's

14  doing title editing at this point on some of these, so

15  that's not necessarily detail.

16       Q    Who ultimately did the presentation or who

17  ultimately provided the presentation to the EVP/SVP

18  level?

19       A    That's a good question.  It was probably Ed or

20  myself.  I don't know for sure.

21       Q    Okay.  And, now, there was a meeting with Zest

22  on November 9th, 2017?

23       A    Correct.

24       Q    Right?

25       A    Correct.
                                                         303



 1       Q    Was there a meeting with senior leadership at

 2  Walmart before that meeting to prepare for the meeting

 3  with Zest?

 4       A    I am aware of those meetings.  I was not part

 5  of them.

 6       Q    Okay.  Do you know who was?

 7       A    Who was part of them?

 8       Q    Yes.

 9       A    I don't know for sure.

10       Q    Okay.  But you were not?

11       A    I was not.

12       Q    Your roll in this process, I think, as you

13  described, was you were working with Denise and Ed on

14  making a recommendation.  You put this presentation

15  together.  And then did Ed take it on its way up to

16  senior leadership, or did somebody else take it from you

17  and take it out?

18                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.

19       A    So can we break that up?

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Sure.  Why don't you describe

21  the process as you understood it.

22       A    So Denise and I worked on the recommendation.

23  Denise and I and Ed worked on the deck.  And then Ed

24  took it from there.

25       Q    And did you have visibility into what occurred
                                                         304



 1  after Ed took it from there?

 2       A    No visibility.

 3       Q    Did Ed report back to you as to what happened?

 4       A    I'm sure he did.

 5       Q    That means you were not in the meetings with

 6  senior leadership, and you were not in the meetings with

 7  sensors, correct?

 8       A    I was in the meeting with Zest.

 9       Q    Okay.  You weren't in the meeting with senior

10  leadership?

11       A    Correct.

12       Q    So after the meeting with senior leadership,

13  before the meeting with Zest, did Ed come back to you

14  and give you information or a download about what

15  happened in the prior meeting?

16       A    I don't remember specifically, but we moved

17  forward so I'm sure he probably communicated everything

18  was fine.

19       Q    And --

20       A    We didn't change anything.

21       Q    Did you use a presentation in the meeting with

22  Zest?

23       A    Yes.

24       Q    Was it the same presentation that you had

25  used, that you had prepared and sent up with Ed Oldham?
                                                         305



 1       A    Because I wasn't in those meetings, I can't --

 2  I have no idea exactly what he shared.

 3       Q    Right.  So what I'm saying is a little bit

 4  different; that is, you and Denise and Ed worked on a

 5  presentation, right?

 6       A    Correct.

 7       Q    Was that presentation the same presentation

 8  that was used in the meeting with Zest?

 9       A    I have no idea.  I'd have to look.

10       Q    Okay.  Who made the presentation in the

11  meeting with Zest?

12       A    It was a collective group.

13       Q    Did you have a portion of it that you did?

14       A    I remember being in the meeting.  I don't

15  remember who talked to what specifically.

16       Q    Do you recall that the meeting began with

17  someone saying to Zest this meeting is not going to go

18  the way that you think it's going to go?

19       A    I don't -- I know I didn't say that.  I don't

20  remember if someone said that and who it was if they

21  did.

22       Q    Do you remember any of the specifics of what

23  was said in the meeting or what was discussed in the

24  meeting with Zest?

25       A    I don't remember the specifics.
                                                         306



 1       Q    Do you remember anything?  Anything stand out

 2  in your mind?

 3       A    I remember Randy was there, Peter was there, I

 4  was there, Ed was there, Kath was there.  I don't know

 5  if anyone else was there.  It was -- I remember what

 6  room it was in.  And it's a fairly small room, so there

 7  couldn't have been too many more people there.

 8       Q    Anything else that you recall that stands out

 9  in your mind about the meeting?

10       A    The deck was projected.  And it was not a very

11  long meeting.

12       Q    When you say not very long, how long do you

13  recall it lasting?

14       A    I don't know.  Thirty minutes, maybe.  Forty

15  minutes, twenty minutes.  It just wasn't -- it wasn't

16  lengthy.

17       Q    Do you remember how much you talked versus Ed

18  and Kathryn?

19       A    Kath probably -- I don't remember her talking

20  much.  And I don't remember the difference between Ed

21  and I.

22       Q    So Ed and -- you and Ed talked more than

23  Kathryn than --

24       A    At my recollection.

25       Q    Do you remember Zest -- Peter or Randy's
                                                         307



 1  reaction to the meeting?

 2       A    I don't remember specifically the reaction.

 3       Q    Anything else that's --

 4       A    I mean, there was no physical reaction?  Is

 5  that what you're asking?  Did they jump up?  I mean,

 6  like, there was no physical reaction.  It was a

 7  conversation.

 8       Q    Do you remember anything they said?

 9       A    I don't remember the specific things that were

10  said.

11       Q    Do you remember them being surprised?

12       A    I -- I can't remember the specifics.  For some

13  reason, I think I remember being them surprised, but I

14  have no idea why.

15                 (Exhibit 246 was marked)

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  We have what's been marked as

17  Exhibit 246.  It's another email between you and Ed

18  Oldham and Kathryn McLay, correct?

19       A    Yes.

20       Q    This -- the subject line is:  Zest update for

21  Fri discussion, Friday discussion, right?

22       A    Correct.

23       Q    This looks like another meeting related to

24  Zest; is that correct, in January or around

25  January 10th of 2018?
                                                         308



 1       A    Yes.

 2       Q    And it looks like it says, Kelly has developed

 3  some content to drive discussion.  Update on Friday

 4  around Zest.  We'll send a PowerPoint so preread once

 5  you're good with it.

 6                 Do you recall creating content to drive a

 7  discussion about Zest in January of 2018?

 8       A    I don't recall specifically.

 9       Q    Okay.  Looks like, from this email, you did,

10  correct?

11       A    I provided it.  It doesn't mean it was from my

12  discussion.

13       Q    Fair enough.  But you created some content.  I

14  created --

15       A    I've created content, yes.

16       Q    It looks like this was a part of the

17  discussion about the statement of work, $1.5 million to

18  Zest, professional services agreement.  Sponsorship to

19  brief Greg S -- sorry, Greg F and get his support.  Do

20  you see that, A, B and C?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    Were you part of the process of talking to

23  Greg Foran about this particular part of the process,

24  statement of work?

25       A    No.
                                                         309



 1       Q    Who was responsible for that?

 2       A    I don't know.

 3       Q    Somebody above you?

 4       A    Yes.

 5       Q    Either Ed or Kathryn?

 6       A    Or Greg.

 7       Q    Or Greg.  Was Greg at the meeting with Zest on

 8  November 9th?

 9       A    Not that I recall.

10       Q    I think you said you don't remember having a

11  meeting with Zest around the time of January 10th, 2018?

12       A    I don't remember it.

13       Q    Did you have a meeting with Zest at some point

14  in either January or February of 2018 to talk about,

15  sort of, the aftermath of the November 9th meeting?

16       A    I remember being in one particular meeting

17  with Randy and Ed.

18       Q    Do you remember approximately when?

19       A    I don't.  It would have been after the

20  negotiations that Ed was working through or almost

21  finished, so late 2017.

22       Q    Late 2017 or early 2018?

23       A    Yeah.

24       Q    What else do you recall about that meeting?

25       A    The one thing that I remember about that
                                                         310



 1  meeting, are you ready?  Is that at the end of the

 2  meeting, Randy gave me a hug.

 3       Q    Any -- any reason why or was there something

 4  that he said when that happened?

 5       A    He just said, Give me a hug.  And it was very

 6  uncomfortable.

 7       Q    Why was it uncomfortable?

 8       A    I'm not a hugger.

 9       Q    Okay.  Anything else that you recall?

10       A    At that particular time, it was still he had

11  to go to his board, so they had not requested all of the

12  1.5 in consulting services yet.  We -- the -- what was

13  talked about in that meeting was a lump sum.  And he

14  started asking about a way to work or stay engaged.  And

15  that conversation began there.

16       Q    Anything else that you can recall about that

17  meeting?

18       A    No.

19       Q    Oh, sorry.  I think perhaps there are two

20  copies there.

21       A    There are.

22       Q    Too quick to pass.

23       A    Yeah.

24       Q    This is an exhibit that was marked in a prior

25  deposition, Plaintiff's Exhibit 52, the Eden -- the tech
                                                         311



 1  that brings -- the tech that's bringing fresher

 2  groceries to you, March 1st 2018.  Are you familiar with

 3  this blog post?

 4       A    Yes, sir.

 5       Q    If you look at the third page -- I'm sorry,

 6  the second page.  My apologies.  The very last

 7  paragraph.  It says, Eden also helps eliminate food

 8  waste.  Our goal is to eliminate 2 billion in waste

 9  other the next five years.  Already, Eden is being used

10  in 42 distribution centers and has prevented 86 million

11  in waste from happening.

12                 Do you see that?

13       A    Yes.

14       Q    It's my understanding from -- well, let me ask

15  this:  Were you involved in calculating either of these

16  numbers, 86 million or 2 billion?

17       A    Directly calculating?

18       Q    Directly or indirectly.

19       A    Directly calculating, no.  And I don't know

20  what indirectly would mean.

21       Q    So it's my understanding that Mr. Musani had a

22  conversation with you about some of these numbers before

23  this was posted and made public.  Do you recall having a

24  conversation with Mr. Musani?

25       A    So it's very -- especially at this time
                                                         312



 1  because we were doing a lot of evaluation.  It would be

 2  very understandable for me to talk to Parvez to say,

 3  here's our goals.  Here's what we're looking at.  Here's

 4  what Deloitte has identified.  You know, for him to

 5  understand from a waste perspective what we think is an

 6  opportunity.

 7       Q    Okay.

 8       A    So I would absolutely think that is probable.

 9       Q    Okay.  So you're saying it's probable that you

10  had this conversation.  Do you remember having this

11  conversation?

12       A    I remember having lots of conversations with

13  Parvez.

14       Q    Okay.

15       A    The specifics of when I would have said

16  something exactly that he would then, you know, come up

17  with that number, I don't remember those specifics.  But

18  I have talked to Parvez across all of my years, and he

19  is very aware of our objectives.

20       Q    Okay.  This 2 billion objective, is there some

21  place that that comes from?  You mentioned Deloitte.

22  Does it come from one of the Deloitte studies?

23       A    The waste study.

24       Q    Okay.  The waste study is the one that was

25  done -- going back to my notes.  The waste study was the
                                                         313



 1  one that was statement work from December of 2016,

 2  right?

 3       A    Correct, yes.

 4       Q    And the result of that study, when did that --

 5  when was that prepared or what -- what was the document

 6  that had this $2 billion number in it?

 7       A    It would have been three -- three months

 8  later, four months later, sometime in --

 9       Q    So early --

10       A    Early first quarter.

11       Q    Of 20 --

12       A    First quarter of 2017.

13       Q    Got it.

14       A    Fiscal '18.

15       Q    And is there a -- that was what you were --

16  the information you were passing along to Mr. Musani in

17  this conversation that you likely had with him in this

18  time frame?

19       A    Yes.

20       Q    Any other source for that $2 billion number

21  that you're aware of?

22       A    Well, any other time he may have been exposed

23  to it, we have flow meetings every two weeks where

24  Parvez is typically a part of.  There -- I would have

25  potentially reported that out to them.  There's other
                                                         314



 1  times that he would have been exposed to that

 2  information besides just a conversation with me

 3  independently.

 4       Q    Understood.  I guess I'm not asking what else

 5  -- where else he may have gotten it.  I'm asking if it

 6  came from you, are you saying that the source would have

 7  been Deloitte?

 8       A    Yes.

 9       Q    You wouldn't have had some other calculation

10  that you had done or some other source for that sort of

11  information?

12       A    Most -- I -- I have no idea.  I mean, in any

13  conversation am I calculating what waste, like, all food

14  waste, all fresh waste, like produce waste, like --

15       Q    Understood.  But is there some other document

16  where you have done your own calculation about

17  eliminating waste $2 billion in five years?

18       A    Not that I recall.

19       Q    Okay.  So that the place where we could find

20  that number in the calculation would be the Deloitte

21  work product from that waste study?

22       A    Yes.  It's an annual number.

23       Q    When you say it's an annual number, so in the

24  Deloitte report, is it a per-year number that totals up

25  to 2 billion?
                                                         315



 1       A    It is a per year number that totals up to

 2  whatever you multiply the number of years by.

 3       Q    Okay.  Fair enough.  Did you do anything to

 4  provide information about the $86 million number to

 5  Mr. Musani?

 6       A    Not to my knowledge.

 7       Q    You don't -- you're not aware of any

 8  calculations about saving Eden being used in 43

 9  distribution centers and has prevented 86 million in

10  waste from happening?

11       A    I don't know the specifics behind that.

12       Q    Okay.  You don't believe that you provided

13  that number to Mr. Musani?

14       A    No, no.

15       Q    What's your budget for the projects that you

16  oversee related to eliminating fresh food waste?

17       A    What do you mean by budget?

18       Q    You have an organization that has a budget,

19  correct?

20       A    Yes, yes.

21       Q    What's your total budget per year?

22       A    What I'm going to spend?

23       Q    Yes.

24       A    It's about $2 million.

25       Q    For your entire organization?
                                                         316



 1       A    Yep.

 2       Q    And when you -- I -- you said what I'm going

 3  to spend, so you made me believe that maybe there's some

 4  other way to calculate a budget besides what you're

 5  going to spend.  Is that true?

 6       A    Well, I don't know what you were referring to.

 7       Q    Yeah.  I mean --

 8       A    Budget for a project, budget for capital,

 9  budget for overhead, budget for --

10       Q    So let's start just with overall.  Your

11  organization, I think, you said is 24 people.

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    And I assume that each fiscal year you have a

14  budget for that organization?

15       A    That's correct.

16       Q    And is the $2 million number the budget for

17  that entire organization?

18       A    It's a little over 2 million but yes.

19       Q    Roughly.  And has it been about the same since

20  you've been at Walmart?

21       A    No.

22       Q    How much has it changed?

23       A    Relative to the number of head count.

24       Q    Okay.

25       A    As we grew, it changed over time.
                                                         317



 1       Q    So it's gotten bigger?

 2       A    Uh-huh.

 3       Q    As your organization's gotten bigger?

 4       A    Yes.

 5       Q    But, now, it's about $2 million?

 6       A    A little over 2 million.

 7       Q    And are there other things that are not

 8  technically in your budget that you are able to draw

 9  from in terms of money?

10       A    Yes.

11       Q    And what are those things?

12       A    So there's a capital spend.

13       Q    And how much is that?

14       A    My budget was 5 million.

15       Q    And what do you use that for typically?

16       A    Capital projects.

17       Q    Okay.  What else?

18       A    That's it.

19       Q    Okay.  So it's two for your head count and

20  then five for capital?

21       A    Five for capital.

22       Q    Anything else that you have access to in terms

23  of, you know, budget?

24       A    There is outside services.

25       Q    What's that, things like Deloitte or other
                                                         318



 1  studies?

 2       A    Correct.

 3       Q    And how much is that?

 4       A    I believe, this years, it's, I want to say,

 5  750.

 6       Q    750,000?

 7       A    That's correct.

 8       Q    Okay.  Anything else that's in your --

 9       A    Those are the big buckets.

10       Q    Okay.

11                 MR. SAMMI:  So we're past the 7-hour

12  mark, but if you are wrapping up.

13                 MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.  Why don't we take --

14  take a short break.  I mean, I may have just a few more

15  but --

16                 MR. SAMMI:  I mean, you don't get more

17  than seven -- I don't understand what you don't

18  understand about not getting more than seven hours.  You

19  have seven hours to pace yourself, and we're not

20  supposed to find out at 7:05 that you have a few more

21  questions.  So are you finished or when you say wrap up,

22  what do you mean?

23                 MR. SIMONS:  I mean a few minutes.

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.

25                 MR. SIMONS:  Okay?  Then we can go on to

 1  the 30(b)(6).

 2                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off the

 3  record at 6:05 p.m.

 4                 (A break was taken from 6:05 p.m. to 6:17

 5                 p.m., 12 minutes, Volume II concluded.)

          19          A.    Good morning.

          20          Q.    We met briefly off the

          21   record, but for the record, my name is

          22   Karleen Krenicky.  I represent the

          23   Defendant, Mr. Guerrero Lopez, that was

          24   just here in the lawsuit that you have

           1   filed against him for a car accident that

           2   happened back on October 31st of 2017.

           3                You just sat through his

           4   deposition, yours will be similar in that

           5   it's just a question-and-answer session,

           6   but I'm trying to find out about you,

           7   about your background, the accident that

           8   brings us here today, and then the

           9   injuries that you are claiming from the

          10   accident.  Okay?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    A transcript is getting made

          13   of everything everyone says, so it's very

          14   important that only one of us speaks at a

          15   time and that all of your answers are out

          16   loud.  Everyone does it.  Try really hard

          17   not to say mhmm, for example.  If you

          18   mean yes or you mean no, just make sure

          19   you say it out loud.  Okay?

          20          A.    Yes.

          21          Q.    Do not guess.  If you do not

          22   know something or you do not remember

          23   something, that's perfectly fine.  Dan

          24   doesn't want you to guess, I don't want

           1   you to guess.  Just say, "I don't know,"

           2   "I don't recall," whatever is the

           3   appropriate response.  Okay?

           4          A.    Yes.

           5          Q.    That being said, if you can

           6   estimate or approximate, please do so,

           7   just tell me that's what you're doing.

           8   Okay?

           9          A.    Yes.

          10          Q.    If you do not understand one

          11   of my questions, let me know that you

          12   don't understand it.  If you answer one

          13   of my questions today, I will assume you

          14   heard it, you understood it, and that is

          15   what you are answering; is that fair?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17          Q.    You took an oath to tell the

          18   truth.  Do you have that understanding?

          19          A.    Yes.

          20          Q.    If at any time today, I

          21   don't think we're going to be here too,

          22   too long, but if you need to use the

          23   restroom, get a drink, just let me know,

          24   we will do so.  The only rule is that you

           7   truthful and accurate answers to my

          16   had, like, started therapy so I could,

          17   you know, get out sooner than what I

          18   was -- I wouldn't go over, because

          19   sometimes I stay over at work like

          20   passing my eight hour day.  But I would

          21   let her know I have somewhere to be after

          22   work, I have to go to therapy so I

          23   couldn't stay longer.

          23   I'm not sure.  I've never heard anything

          24   from Core Source.

          20   and I had a PCP in South Carolina that I

          21   didn't go to because I was healthy.  So

          22   I'm going to say she was my only primary

          23   for right now, because I didn't go to a

          24   doctor enough to really get acquainted,

          18   get dark or not quite yet?

          19          A.    I'm trying to think of

          20   daylight savings time.

          21          Q.    From your memory, do you

          22   remember was the sun going down at all

          23   when this happened?

           1          A.    No.  We don't celebrate

           2   Halloween.

           3          Q.    Meaning for religious

           4   reasons or just because you're too old to

           5   do Halloween?

           6          A.    Well, we never celebrated

           7   Halloween, so I don't know why.  I've

           8   never participated in Halloween ever in

           9   life.

           1          A.    Not because of this

           6          Q.    Where had you parked at your

           7   dad's house?

           8          A.    In front of his house.

           1          Q.    And how far from the

           2   intersection with 12th were you parked on

           3   Potter?

           4          A.    Oh, a whole block.

           5          Q.    So were you parked at 11th

           6   and Potter?

           7          A.    Yes.

           8          Q.    And the intersection of 12th

           9   and Potter, is that controlled by a stop

          10   sign?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    Okay.  And how would you

          13   describe that intersection, is it a T or

          14   is it a three-way intersection?

          15          A.    It's a three-way

          16   intersection.

          17          Q.    Okay.  Is that because the

          18   other side of Potter is closed off to

          19   traffic?

          20          A.    It would be a three-way

          21   intersection anyway, because Potter

          22   Street is a one way.  So you have two,

          23   and then Potter Street is going up

          24   straight, that's a one way.  So

           1   regardless, it would be a three way.

           2          Q.    So what street is closed off

           3   to traffic?

           4          A.    So Potter Street.  Potter

           5   Street once you cross the intersection

           6   going straight, that's still considered

           7   Potter Street going straight up, so the

           8   end of Potter Street like crossing the

           9   intersection is blocked off.

          10          Q.    The road's been closed for

          11   quite some time?

          12          A.    Yes.

          13          Q.    When this accident occurred,

          14   was there anyone actively working on that

          16          A.    I'm not sure.

          11          Q.    Where was it?

          12          A.    So it was southbound of 12th

          13   Street.

          14          Q.    Was it in the travel lane?

          15          A.    No.

          16          Q.    And it's my understanding

          17   12th Street is a two-way street?

          18          A.    Yes.

          19          Q.    With one lane in each

          20   direction?

          21          A.    Yes.

          22          Q.    And parking on both sides?

          23          A.    Yes.

          24          Q.    Was there only one

           1   construction vehicle in the area when the

           2   accident happened?

           3          A.    Yes.

           4          Q.    Okay.  The construction

           5   vehicle that you've mentioned, was it

           6   parked in the parking lane on the

           7   southbound side of 12th Street, as you've

           8   described?

           9          A.    Yes.

          10          Q.    Were there any construction

          11   workers near that vehicle?

          12          A.    I'm not sure.

          13          Q.    Did you see any people that

          14   looked to go with the truck, that came

          15   with the truck, or driving the truck?

          16          A.    I can't recall.

          17          Q.    Okay.  Other than a road

          18   closed sign, were there any other

          19   construction signs in the area of this

          20   accident?

          21          A.    There was cones, the

          22   barricade, I'm not sure if I'm saying

          23   that correctly.  It was other stuff

          24   there, but it's like construction stuff,

           1   so I don't...

           2          Q.    Okay.  And where was it?

           3          A.    It was on the other side of,

           4   like, the street is closed off, so beyond

           5   that point is like whatever their

           6   construction stuff is.  But it was, like,

           7   cones and, like, the little barricade

           8   things and the sign and stuff like that

           9   in front of it.  But whatever was beyond

          10   that point, I'm not sure what was that.

          11          Q.    Was there anything near the

          12   parked construction vehicle?

          13          A.    Just a cone, I believe.

          14          Q.    Okay.  Did any of the

          15   construction equipment block the travel

          16   lanes on 12th Street?

          17          A.    No.

          18          Q.    The fact that this truck was

          19   parked there and there was cones in the

          20   area, did that have anything to do with

          21   this accident from your perspective?

          22          A.    If the construction vehicle

          23   was not there, I could have possibly

          24   prevented it by using the shoulder.

           1   However, the car was parked, the

           2   construction vehicle was parked on the

           3   shoulder.

           4          Q.    Okay.  So if I'm

           5   understanding you, you believe if you had

           6   been able to move into the shoulder lane,

           7   the accident would not have occurred?

           8          A.    Yes, I could have prevented

           9   it.

          10          Q.    In what way, by moving into

          11   the shoulder?

          12          A.    Yeah, I would have been able

          13   to move into the shoulder.

          14          Q.    How did the accident happen?

          15          A.    So I was leaving from my

          16   dad's house, I pulled -- I was coming to

          17   the top of 12th Street, I saw the stop

          18   sign.  As I'm approaching the stop sign,

          19   I noticed that it was shrubbery on my

          20   left-hand side and kids were trick or

          21   treating, so I slowly approached the

          22   second time.  And as I approached the

          23   second time to the stop sign, I noticed a

          24   car was five or six car lengths away from

           1   me.  And once I noticed that it was a

           2   clear way to drive, I proceeded to making

           3   my left turn.

           4                As I began to turn, I

           5   noticed the car coming closer, and

           6   probably like four or five seconds of

           7   noticing him, I noticed that he wasn't

           8   slowing down as I was turning.  So I

           9   began blowing the horn and I slammed on

          10   brakes and I noticed that he was looking

          11   down at his phone.  And by the time he

          12   looked up, he hit my car.

          13          Q.    Okay.  So I'm going to ask

          14   you a couple of things.  So you said you

          15   were stopped for the second time.  I just

          16   want to make sure I understand what you

          17   mean.  So you were coming down Potter

          18   Street?

          19          A.    Mhmm.

          20          Q.    You see the stop sign up

          21   ahead, correct?

          22          A.    Yes.

          23          Q.    And you said you brought

          24   your car to a stop?

           1          A.    Yes.

           2          Q.    And then when you said you

           3   did it a second time, what do you mean by

           4   that?

           5          A.    So I stopped before the stop

           6   sign, but because coming up 11th and

           7   Potter, it's a corner house, there's

           8   shrubbery, so I noticed that I couldn't

           9   see the oncoming traffic.

          10                MR. LINN:  Excuse me.  11th

          11          and Potter or 12th and Potter?

          12                THE WITNESS:  12th and

          13          Potter, I'm sorry.  There's a

          14          bush, so I noticed I couldn't see

          15          the oncoming traffic, so I inched

          16          up more to make sure that I could

          17          see the cars going by.

          18   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          19          Q.    Okay.  So you inched up

          20   about how far?

          21          A.    Like a half an inch.

          22          Q.    Okay.  And by doing so, were

          23   you able to see down 12th Street?

          24          A.    Yes.

          14   that point?

          15          A.    It wasn't an unusual speed.

          16          Q.    Okay.  And did it appear to

          17   be slowing down?

          18          A.    No.

          19          Q.    And were you at a complete

          22          Q.    When you saw this car about

          23   five or six car lengths away.

           2          Q.    And what kind of car was it

          14   accident occurred?

          15          A.    Yes.

           1          Q.    Are you able to say what

           2   time, what number on a clock your vehicle

           3   was facing when the accident occurred?

           4          A.    I'm not good with clocks.

           5          Q.    Okay, that's fine.  So 12:00

           6   is straight ahead, and then 11:00, 10:00,

           7   9:00.  I'm assuming you were angled

           8   towards the left.

           9          A.    I was angled towards the

          10   left.  So that's probably -- I'm a visual

          11   person, so I don't want to guess.

          12          Q.    Well, I don't want you to

          13   guess either.  If you're unable to do it,

          14   that's okay.  But I can show you just on

          15   here, this is a clock here.

          16          A.    Okay, so it's probably 9:00.

          17          Q.    About 9:00, okay.  And was

          18   my client's vehicle on an angle when the

          19   impact occurred?

          20          A.    No.

          21          Q.    It was at 12:00?

          22          A.    Yes.

          23          Q.    Was his car stopped or

          24   moving when the accident occurred?

           1          A.    When it occurred?

           2          Q.    Yes.

           3          A.    It was moving.

           4          Q.    Okay.  Do you know the

           5   speed?

           6          A.    No.

           7          Q.    Do you know your speed at

           8   the time of impact?

           9          A.    I had just started driving,

          10   so it's under five.

          11          Q.    Okay.  And from the time you

          12   first saw my client's car until the time

          13   the accident happened, did you ever lose

          14   sight of him?

          15          A.    Could you repeat it?

          16          Q.    Sure.  So from the time you

          17   first saw him five or six car lengths

          18   away from the intersection --

          19          A.    Yes.

          20          Q.    -- until the time the two

          21   vehicles came into contact with each

          22   other, did you ever lose sight of him?

          23          A.    Yes.

          24          Q.    Where were you looking when

           1   you didn't see him?

           2          A.    I was making a turn, so I

           3   was looking ahead and looking to turn.

           4          Q.    Okay.  But as you're

           5   turning, aren't you turning towards him?

           6          A.    Yes.  So as I'm coming out,

           7   you have to come out first.  So I'm

           8   looking ahead.  Because it was a brand

           9   new car, so I was being extremely

          10   careful.  So I'm looking ahead to make

          11   sure, because I know that there's

          12   construction on that side, to make sure

          13   that I make a correct turn as I'm

          14   turning.

          15          Q.    Okay.  So for how long did

          16   you lose sight of him?

          17          A.    Probably two seconds.

          18          Q.    And then the next time you

          19   saw him again, where was he?

          20          A.    Next time I saw him, he was

          21   probably a car length and a half away.

          22          Q.    And was he still on 12th

          23   Street?

          24          A.    Yes.

           1          Q.    And how far from the stop

           2   sign was he at that point?

           3          A.    He wasn't far, probably two,

           4   three seconds away.

           5          Q.    Are you able to say in feet

           6   or car lengths how far away from the stop

           7   sign he was when you saw him again?

           8          A.    Possibly 400, 500 feet.

           9          Q.    400 to 500 feet?

          10          A.    I don't know.

          11          Q.    Well, I don't want you to

          12   guess, remember that was my instruction.

          13                MR. LINN:  If you have to

          14          guess, then say you don't know.

          15   BY MS. KRENICKY:

          16          Q.    Okay.  Are you able to say

          17   how many car lengths from the stop sign

          18   he was when you saw him again after you

          19   lost sight of him?

          20          A.    A car and a half.

          21          Q.    Okay.  And the second time

          22   you saw my client until the moment of

          23   impact, did you lose sight of him again?

          24          A.    The second time I saw him,

           1   no.

           2          Q.    Okay.  And how long after

           3   you saw him again did the accident

           4   happen?

           5          A.    It was seconds, I believe

           6   one or two seconds.

           7          Q.    And where was the front of

           8   his vehicle on the roadway when the

           9   accident occurred?

          10          A.    It was past the stop sign.

          11   So I'm, like, in the middle of the

          12   street, so the front of his vehicle is

          13   way past his stop sign.

          14          Q.    How far past?

          15          A.    I'm not sure.  At that

          16   point, it was on the side of my car, so I

          17   wasn't looking.

          18          Q.    Okay.  Did he ever come to a

          19   stop before the accident occurred?

          20          A.    No.

          21          Q.    At any point in the roadway?

          22          A.    No.

          23          Q.    Were you alone in your car?

          24          A.    Yes.

           3          Q.    And you said that you saw

           4   him on his cellphone.  For how long did

           5   you observe that?

           6          A.    When I noticed him on his

           7   cellphone, I began blowing my horn.  When

           8   I noticed him, I noticed I was turning,

           9   he was looking down, and his speed didn't

          10   slow down, so that's what made my slam on

          11   brakes and start blowing my horn.

          12   Because I wouldn't be able to drive on

          13   the shoulder to prevent it because there

          14   was stuff going on over there.

          15          Q.    Okay.  But how long of a

          16   period of time was that?

          17          A.    From what points?

          18          Q.    How long did you see him on

          19   his cellphone?

          20          A.    How long was he looking on

          21   his phone?

          22          Q.    That you saw.

          23          A.    From the point that -- from

           2   turning, when I noticed him the second

           3   time is when I saw him on his cellphone.

           4          Q.    Okay.  So for how long of a

           5   period of time did you see him on his

           6   cellphone?

           7          A.    I don't know.

           8          Q.    Okay.  And did you see the

           9   cellphone, or did you just see him

          10   looking down?

          11          A.    I saw the cellphone.

          12          Q.    And what kind of cellphone

          13   was it?

          14          A.    It was just black.

          15          Q.    And what hand was it in?

          16          A.    His right hand.

          17          Q.    And describe where it was in

          18   relation to his body.

          19          A.    It was in his hand, in his

          20   right hand.  It was above the -- I don't

          21   know.  This is what I saw.

           2   steering wheel, his eyes were looking

           3   down at the phone.

           4          Q.    And you were not onto 12th

           5   Street yet when you observed that,

           6   correct?

           7          A.    I was, I was turning --

           8   well, I was in the middle of the street,

           9   I wasn't on 12th Street, no.

          10          Q.    Would you say that he hit

          11   you or you hit him?

          12          A.    He hit me.

          13          Q.    Okay.  What part of your

          14   vehicle was hit?

          15          A.    The middle of my driver door

          16   in the beginning of my passenger door --

          17   no, I'm sorry.  The middle of my driver

          18   door, and the beginning of my back door

          19   like on the driver side.

          20          Q.    Would you say it was one

          21   impact or like a scraping impact?

          22          A.    What do you mean by one

          11   noticed his car wasn't slowing down up

          12   until the point that he hit me.  So like

          13   three seconds, three, four.  I was like

          14   hitting hit on back and forth, it wasn't

          15   a constant horn, it was like hitting it

          16   more than once to get his attention.

          17          Q.    So it was beep, beep, beep,

          14          A.    In the middle of the

          16   turning, but it's like in the middle and

          17   we're in the middle of the street pretty

          18   much.

           4          Q.    What happened to them?

           5          A.    I took them for Service

           6   King, and then once they received them, I

           7   deleted them because my storage was full.

           8   And I felt like someone had the pictures

           9   that needed them, so if someone needed to

          10   obtain them, I could get them from

          11   somewhere.

          12          Q.    Were the pictures showing

          13   the location of the cars or just the

          10          Q.    How long did it take for

          11   them to get there?

          12          A.    Like ten minutes.

          13          Q.    And were the cars moved by

          14   the time the police got there?

          15          A.    Yes, yes, yes.  I moved my

          16   car because traffic was still, like,

          17   people were still driving, so I got my

          18   car out the middle of the street.

          19          Q.    Where did you move your car

          20   to?

          21          A.    I parked it on -- I just

          22   backed up, so I backed my car up.  Where

          23   it would be facing, I was parked

          24   basically on the opposite side of the

           1   street, if that makes sense.  So what is

           2   that, coming down 12th Street?  I was

           3   parked on the left-hand side of 12th

           4   Street.

           5          Q.    So just so I'm

           6   understanding, was that ahead of that

           7   construction vehicle you spoke of or

           8   behind it?

           9          A.    It was behind it.

          10          Q.    On the same block?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    So was the construction

          13   vehicle the very first car parked on the

          14   corner of 12th as you were turning?

          15          A.    Yes.

          16          Q.    Okay.  So where did your car

          17   fit behind it then?

          18          A.    Well, my car was on the

          19   left, the construction would be on the

          20   right if we're this way.

          21          Q.    Okay.  So you were pointing

          22   the wrong direction then when you pulled

          23   over; is that accurate?

          24          A.    Yes, I was parked on the

           2          Q.    And where did my client go?

           3          A.    He went on Potter Street, so

           4   he turned his car and backed up on Potter

           5   Street on the right side.

           6          Q.    On the shoulder he stopped

           7   and parked?

          12          A.    No.

          13          Q.    Did you exchange any

          14   information with him?

          15          A.    Well, I noticed that his

          16   English was broken, so he pulled out his

          17   insurance and I just informed him that I

          18   called the police so there could be a

          19   third party.

          20          Q.    Are you aware of any

          21   witnesses to this accident?

           4          Q.    He didn't walk over?

           5          A.    No, because I think he had

           6   pulled out behind me.  I don't know where

           7   he was at the time, but I don't think he

           8   was still at the house.  I don't know

          20   that came?

           1          A.    Yes.

           2          Q.    When is the first time you

           3   sought medical attention for this

           4   accident?

           5          A.    Probably two months after

           6   the accident.

           7          Q.    Okay.  And why did you wait

           8   two months to go to the doctor or

           9   chiropractor?

          10          A.    Because like I said, I'm an

          11   athlete.  So once I noticed that I was

          12   experiencing lower back pains, I began

          13   trying home remedies, because that's what

          14   I'm used to.

          21          Q.    Why not?

          22          A.    Because I thought it was

          23   something that would blow over because

          24   I'm used to having aches and pains from

           1   sports, so I thought it was something

           2   that would heal with ice or stim or

           3   anything or something like that,

           4   Biofreeze.

           5          Q.    And were you doing all that

           6   stuff at home?

           7          A.    Yes.

           8          Q.    How often?

           9          A.    Any time I would experience

          10   the pain.

          11          Q.    Were you continuing to run

          12   during that two-month period?

          13          A.    Yeah.

          14          Q.    Okay.  How often were you

          15   running in the two months between the

          16   accident and when you first started going

          17   to the chiropractor?

          18          A.    Well, I kind of stopped

          19   running.  Because after I would run, I

          20   would notice that my back would be

          21   hurting.  So the back pain kind of

          22   stopped -- it messed up my regimen of me

          23   going after work, if that makes any

          24   sense.

           1          Q.    Okay.  But how often were

           2   you still going?

           3          A.    So before I started or after

           4   I started seeing the chiropractor?

           5          Q.    So after the accident but

           6   before you were going to the

           7   chiropractor, how often were you going

           8   running?

           9          A.    So after that week of me not

          10   doing anything, every day.

          11          Q.    Okay.  And so it was getting

          12   cold out at that point?

          13          A.    Mhmm.

          14          Q.    That didn't matter?

          15          A.    No, no.

          16          Q.    Were you doing any other

          17   exercises besides running during that

          18   two-month period?

          19          A.    No.

          20          Q.    Do you ever lift weights or

          21   anything like that?

          22          A.    No, natural body weight.

          23          Q.    So from the records your

          24   attorney provided me, it looks like you

           1   saw Len Finkel, the chiropractor; is that

           2   accurate?

           3          A.    Yes.

           4          Q.    Had you ever been to him

           5   before?

           6          A.    No.

           7          Q.    How did you find Dr. Finkel?

           8          A.    My dad.

           9          Q.    Why does your dad know

          10   Dr. Finkel?

          11          A.    I'm not sure.

          12          Q.    Did he say, "Hey, I've been

          13   to this chiropractor before, you should

          14   go to."

          15          A.    Yeah, he's definitely been

          16   to Dr. Finkel.

          17          Q.    Where is Dr. Finkel at?

          18          A.    He's in Pennsylvania, but

          19   I'm not -- I think in Aston, PA.

          20          Q.    And how often did you see

          21   Dr. Finkel?

          22          A.    I seen him sometimes twice a

          23   week, sometimes three times a week.

          24          Q.    Were you going there after

           1   work?

           2          A.    Yes.

           3          Q.    For how long was each

           4   session?

           5          A.    Possibly an hour, hour and a

           6   half.

           7          Q.    And you were driving

           8   yourself there?

           9          A.    Yes.

          10          Q.    It looks like you stopped

          11   going there in March of 2018.  Does that

          12   sound accurate?

          13          A.    Yes.

          14          Q.    Why did you stop going?

          15          A.    Because I needed more, I

          16   needed something a little bit more than

          17   what Dr. Finkel or a chiropractor could

          18   do.

          19          Q.    Okay.  And did someone tell

          20   you that?

          21          A.    So I believe me and

          22   Dr. Finkel had a conversation about it

          23   and he wanted me to transfer somewhere

          24   else once -- yeah, Dr. Finkel I believe.

           1          Q.    Okay.  Did Dr. Finkel send

           2   you for any tests?

           3          A.    MRI.

           4          Q.    And that was of your lower

           5   back?

           6          A.    Yes.

           7          Q.    Did he discuss the results

           8   with you?

           9          A.    He did, and I think that's

          10   what made him send me out to someone else

          11   to get, like, rehab.

          12          Q.    Okay.  What did he tell you

          13   about your MRI?

          14          A.    From what I remember, I

          15   believe he said it was like an acute -- I

          16   don't know, I don't want to guess.

          17          Q.    He told you there was

          18   something on your MRI?

          19          A.    No.  He didn't say it was

          20   anything from my MRI -- I don't know, I

          21   don't want to guess.  I mean, there's

          22   medical paperwork that we could look over

          23   to see what he said, but I don't

          24   remember.

           1          Q.    Okay.  I mean, so I have the

           2   report from the MRI, your attorney

           3   provided it to me.  Would it surprise you

           4   to know that it says it was normal?

           5          A.    No, that doesn't surprise

           6   me.

           7          Q.    Okay.

           8          A.    He didn't say it was

           9   anything on the MRI, but he said I had a

          10   stress fracture or something happened

          11   with my back, but it didn't show up on my

          12   MRI.  But I don't want to use the wrong

          13   terminology is what I'm saying.

          14          Q.    Okay.  So did he refer you

          15   somewhere else?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17          Q.    Where?

          18          A.    It was somewhere in Bryn

          19   Mawr.  It was closer to my job, I don't

          20   remember the name of the rehab.

          21          Q.    Is it called MRCP?

          22          A.    Yes, MRCP.

          23          Q.    Okay.  And it looks like you

          24   went there from April 19th of 2018 to

           1   August 2nd of 2018; does that sound

           2   right?

           3          A.    Yes.

           4          Q.    So why did you wait a month

           5   to go to MRCP after leaving Dr. Finkel's

           6   office?

           7          A.    You said why did I wait a

           8   month after?

           9          Q.    So Dr. Finkel you stopped in

          10   March, and then you didn't go to MRCP

          11   until a month later.  Was there a reason

          12   for that delay?

          13          A.    Work possibly.

          14          Q.    Okay.  What was different

          15   about the treatment you received at MRCP

          16   in relation to the treatment you had with

          17   the chiropractor?

          18          A.    So it was just different,

          19   different things we were working on

          20   compared to what Dr. Finkel was doing,

          21   it's like different what they do.  So his

          22   chiropractic skills were focusing on the

          23   massaging and everything like that.  And

          24   the at the rehab, they were making me do

           1   different exercises and stretch different

           2   muscles, I guess.

           3          Q.    Why did you stop going to

           4   MRCP?

           5          A.    Because I experienced my

           6   prolactinoma, so I had to stop.  And the

           7   doctor at MRCP said he wanted to

           8   discharge me to focus on that because

           9   that's more important.

          10          Q.    Okay.  Have you gone back?

          11          A.    No.

          12          Q.    Is there a reason you

          13   haven't gone back?

          14          A.    Because my prolactinoma was

          15   more serious than my lower back.

          16          Q.    Right.  But you were

          17   diagnosed with that about a year ago now,

          18   right?

          19          A.    Yeah.  But that's -- it's

          20   not like I was diagnosed and we just walk

          21   away.  What I'm dealing with with that

          22   was may more -- I didn't have time

          23   really, and I was feeling a little bit

          24   better afterwards.

           1          Q.    Well, do you still have pain

           2   in your lower back today?

           3          A.    Little.

           7   pain?

           8          A.    Here and there, it's not as

           9   strenuous as it was before.

          10          Q.    Well, can you tell me how

          14   once a year?

          15          A.    Once a week.

          17   something when that happens?

          18          A.    Ice.

          20   When you get the back pain, is it after

          21   you're exercising?

          22          A.    Yes.  Or if I'm driving in

          23   the car for long periods of time.

           1   the point where you were only having the

           2   pain once a week?

           3          A.    I'm not sure.  The stuff

           4   that I was doing at MRCP, I was still

           5   kind of doing at home.  So just gradually

           6   after time, I'm not sure.

           7          Q.    Okay.  Have you seen any

           8   other doctors or medical providers for

           9   this accident that we haven't discussed?

          10          A.    No.

          11          Q.    Do you have any appointments

          12   to see anyone related to this accident?

          13          A.    No.

          14          Q.    Did anyone ever tell you you

          15   would need pain injections, pain

          16   management injections?

          17          A.    No.

          18          Q.    Did anyone ever tell you you

          19   would need surgery?

          20          A.    No.

           1   cannot do it?

           2          A.    No.

           3          Q.    Other than what we walked

           4   about with your job where you have to sit

           5   sometimes, are there things that cause

           6   you difficulty or pain because of your

           7   back injury?

           8          A.    Could you repeat the

           9   question?

          10          Q.    Sure, I'll ask it a

          11   different way.  How has your back injury

          12   affected your life?

          13          A.    So as far as -- I mean, it

          14   messed up how long I can go with a

          15   workout.  I know I have limit now, before

          16   I didn't really, you know, have a limit.

          17   But now I'm aware, a little bit more

          18   aware of how hard I go because I don't

          19   want to experience any, you know, I don't

          20   want to tweak anything, I don't want to

          21   experience any pain later.  So opposed to

          22   doing four miles, I'll cut it down to a

          23   mile and a half, or I won't do as many

          24   planks or crunches.

           1          Q.    Okay.  Other than

           2   exercising, any other affect on your

           3   life?

           4          A.    Driving.

           5          Q.    Okay.  How far can you drive

           6   without issue?

           7          A.    So if I'm driving to the

           8   beach, we go to Ocean City.

           9          Q.    Which one?

          10          A.    Maryland.  Probably after an

          11   hour I'm switching with someone.  But

          12   before, I could drive the whole way.

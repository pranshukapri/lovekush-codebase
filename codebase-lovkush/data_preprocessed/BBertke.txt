               3             WHO, BEING FIRST DULY SWORN,

               4                 TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Defendants continue

               6  their objection as to the relevance of any patient

               7  outcomes information and testimony about that.

               8  And would ask that any references to patients be

               9  done with initials.

              10                     EXAMINATION

              11  BY MR. ARCHINACO:

              12          Q.   Would you please spell your full

              13  name for the record?

              14          A.   Brad, Bradley, B-R-A-D-L-E-Y,

              15  John, Bertke, B-E-R-T-K-E.

              16          Q.   Where are you currently employed?

              17          A.   Mercy Health, Bon Secours Mercy

              18  Health.

              19          Q.   What is your current position?

              20          A.   I'm the president at St. Anne's

              21  Hospital.

              22          Q.   Have you ever given your

              23  deposition before?

              24          A.   Just one other time.

              25          Q.   What type of case?



                                                                6


               1          A.   It was a physician that we had a

               2  -- it was an independent contractor

               3  relationship with.  And we ended up severing

               4  that relationship, terminating that, and he

               5  filed a suit.

               6          Q.   Do you recall when that was

               7  approximately?

               8          A.   '12, '13, 2012, 2013.

               9          Q.   Was it a surgeon?

              10          A.   No.  It was a radiologist.

              11          Q.   I'll go through some basic ground

              12  rules.

              13          A.   Okay.

              14          Q.   The court reporter is the

              15  official transcript.  She takes down what we

              16  say, so think of it almost as a, I'll ask a

              17  question, then there is a potential of an

              18  objection.  Normally, you can answer after the

              19  objection, unless you have been instructed not

              20  to.  So it's question, potential objection,

              21  and then answer.

              22             If you give opposing counsel,

              23  Mr. Wiencek, an opportunity to state any

              24  objection, it will give you an opportunity

              25  also to think about your answer.



                                                                7


               1             Also, shakes and nods of the head

               2  don't work, so you have to keep your answers

               3  audible.  If for some reason you don't hear or

               4  understand a question, tell me you didn't hear

               5  or understand it.  Otherwise, I'll proceed as

               6  if you did.

               7             There is something called the

               8  attorney-client privilege.  I'm not seeking

               9  your conversations with counsel today, in

              10  terms of your conversations with Mr. Wiencek

              11  and things of that nature.  If any topics come

              12  up about where attorneys might have been

              13  involved in conversation, just proceed with

              14  caution.  You may be instructed not to answer

              15  questions at a certain point, depending upon

              16  what the questions are, so I'm trying to get

              17  your independent information.

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   Outside of attorneys.  Although,

              20  there may have been, at some points in the

              21  timeline --

              22          A.   Yeah, an attorney involved.

              23          Q.   Correct.  Okay.  So in those

              24  areas, just proceed with a little bit more

              25  caution in terms of how you're going to answer



                                                                8


               1  a question, just because the intent is not to

               2  get a waiver of some attorney-client

               3  privilege, but I may ask some questions around

               4  that.

               5             Anything -- is that all fair to

               6  you, what I have explained so far?

               7          A.   Seems all reasonable, until

               8  something specific comes up, I guess.

               9          Q.   Okay.  All right.  And then,

              10  generally, you can take a break whenever you

              11  want, unless a question is pending.  We try to

              12  do it about every hour or so, but if you need

              13  a break before then for any reason, just tell

              14  me, and we can go off the record, and we'll

              15  take a break.  Sometimes we'll go a little bit

              16  longer than an hour.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   And there will be a lot of

              19  documents.  There is also in front of you some

              20  binders, Binder I and Binder II.  At various

              21  points today, we may have you look -- you're

              22  going to be looking at a number of documents,

              23  so if something's already been marked, I'll

              24  tell you to go to that in the binder.  And

              25  there is a tab, and then that would mean that



                                                                9


               1  the exhibit appears behind the tab.

               2          A.   Okay.

               3          Q.   If it's tab 1 or whatever.

               4             First volume has like, has

               5  approximately the first 75 or so exhibits.

               6  And then after that, the other binders.  Then

               7  we'll also have some other exhibits probably

               8  to hand out today for you to go over as well.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   If we could just start with your

              11  educational background.  Walk me through that

              12  a little bit, and then I'm going to ask you

              13  about your work history briefly.

              14          A.   Okay.  I'm -- got a bachelor's in

              15  science, pre-medicine, from The University of

              16  Dayton.  And then I got my master's in

              17  hospital and health administration from Xavier

              18  University.

              19          Q.   What years were those?

              20          A.   I -- I graduated in -- from

              21  Dayton in 1989, and I graduated from Xavier in

              22  1993.

              23          Q.   Okay.  And how old are you today?

              24          A.   Today, I'm 52.

              25          Q.   And then after graduating from



                                                               10


               1  Xavier in 1993, what -- what then, if you

               2  could try to walk me through your work history

               3  leading up to your arrival at any Mercy

               4  entity.

               5          A.   Sure.  So from -- in '93 and part

               6  of '94, I worked at Lake Hospital.  That's

               7  where I was a -- I did my -- our program had

               8  a, essentially an administrative internship or

               9  residency.  I did mine there at Lake Hospital

              10  outside of Cleveland.  And I ended up staying

              11  on there for a period of time, in what

              12  essentially I would call an assistant

              13  administrator role.

              14             And then from there, I took a job

              15  as a consultant.  That job might have gone to

              16  '95, now that I think about.  Took a job as a

              17  consultant and worked at a place called New

              18  Health Management.  And didn't really like

              19  consulting all that much, so I got reconnected

              20  with a person that I knew while I was at Lake.

              21  He was at Catholic Healthcare Partners at that

              22  time, so I came to -- he offered me a job in

              23  essentially kind of a new startup that they

              24  were working around, on doing around physician

              25  integration, employment, variety of different



                                                               11


               1  things, which was kind of, all kind of new at

               2  that time.  Health systems weren't widely

               3  involved with employing doctors.  So I took

               4  that job in the summer of '96.  And some of

               5  the dates may not be accurate here, but was in

               6  that for maybe three years.

               7             And health systems kind of got out

               8  of the business of employing doctors, for a

               9  variety of different reasons, so the need for

              10  that role kind of changed.  I ended up kind of

              11  changing jobs and going into more informatics,

              12  data collection, data analysis at the

              13  corporate offices of Catholic Healthcare

              14  Partners.

              15             And in 2003, from that job, I left

              16  the corporate office to take an operations job

              17  at Mercy Hospital-Clermont.  Had that job

              18  until the summer of '11, which is when I took

              19  this job.

              20          Q.   So you assumed the presidency

              21  role at St. Anne's in roughly September --

              22  summer of 2000 --

              23          A.   I think it was July of 2011.

              24          Q.   And you have remained in that

              25  role until the present; is that right?



                                                               12


               1          A.   Correct.

               2          Q.   So basically you did -- you did a

               3  -- you had -- strike that.

               4             To go back a second.  When you were

               5  in school, did you fo -- did you know that you

               6  wanted to go into admin, hospital

               7  administration?

               8          A.   Well, actually, initially, I

               9  want, you know, I was premed.  I got accepted

              10  to med school, so I was thinking of maybe

              11  become a physician.  And then, you know, took

              12  another route, kind of evaluated if that was

              13  really what I wanted to do.  And then found

              14  the -- the Mercy -- the master's program in

              15  health administration, and felt that might be

              16  a better alignment with my interests.

              17          Q.   So when you did your graduate

              18  programs, did you -- what was -- was it sort

              19  of in mind at that point that you wanted to go

              20  into administration?

              21          A.   Yeah, I would --

              22          Q.   Managing?

              23          A.   -- for some, you know, you could

              24  go in a variety of different ways.  You might

              25  go be an insurance company consulting --



                                                               13


               1          Q.   Uh-huh.

               2          A.   -- on the provider side.  I found

               3  myself -- I thought to myself I'd end up on

               4  the provider side.

               5          Q.   And in terms of being a doctor,

               6  is there any event in particular that led to

               7  you not wanting to --

               8          A.   I don't know.

               9          Q.   -- do that any longer?

              10          A.   I think it was just the duration

              11  of the commitment, and you know, the certainty

              12  of which that you need to pursue that, given

              13  all the training, the -- the amount of

              14  schooling, debt, you know, variety of factors.

              15          Q.   Okay.  And then leading up to

              16  obtaining the presidency job, you had done a

              17  number of operations jobs, and administrative

              18  jobs, and management jobs, and things of that

              19  nature, correct?

              20          A.   Yeah.  I would say I would -- I

              21  had been more in a staff function, up until

              22  '13, when I took more of an operations role

              23  at Mercy-Clermont.

              24          Q.   All right.  Now, in terms of your

              25  duties as president at St. Anne's Hospital,



                                                               14


               1  what -- since summer of 2011 to the present,

               2  have they essentially remained the same, or

               3  have they changed over time?

               4          A.   The job is -- I mean, healthcare

               5  is changing a lot.  The job has changed a lot,

               6  but the basic functions of the president are

               7  still pretty similar.

               8          Q.   Okay.

               9          A.   Which is manage, you know, you're

              10  responsible for the profit and loss

              11  responsibility, you're developing growth

              12  initiatives, you're managing expenses, you're

              13  developing your team of management, so on and

              14  so forth.  Clinical quality.

              15          Q.   Yeah.  When you're saying that

              16  healthcare itself is changing, in terms of

              17  consolidations and things of that nature,

              18  correct?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   Including with what you see with

              21  ProMedica, having an insurance program and

              22  capturing market share by causing patients in

              23  their insurance program to be directed back to

              24  ProMedica institutions?  You have seen things

              25  like that, correct?



                                                               15


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative.

               2  Go ahead.

               3          A.   I mean, some healthcare systems

               4  are developing what they call horizontal and

               5  vertical integration --

               6          Q.   Right.

               7          A.   -- getting into different lines

               8  of business, that type of thing, so --

               9          Q.   Well, with ProMedica, what you

              10  see is you see that they have gotten into the

              11  insurance business, correct?

              12          A.   Yeah.  That was prior to my

              13  arrival here, but they have a wholly-owned

              14  insurance company called Paramount, yes.

              15          Q.   Right.  And Paramount has

              16  consumers, or customers from the region, that

              17  sign up for the insurance, correct?

              18          A.   Correct.

              19          Q.   And then the people that are

              20  signed into that insurance, that insurance

              21  program that is owned by ProMedica, then

              22  essentially directs the patients back to

              23  ProMedica physicians?

              24          A.   Yeah.  I think -- I'm not

              25  100 percent sure how their network is built.



                                                               16


               1          Q.   Uh-huh.

               2          A.   I'm not an expert in it, but

               3  certain doctors are, you know, certain doctors

               4  are in and not in their network.  For an

               5  example, we're -- we're -- Mercy is a -- as a

               6  -- even our facilities are participating in

               7  their Advantage product, but we don't

               8  participate in their commercial product.  Many

               9  of our doctors are also covered under the

              10  ProMedica plan, even though they're

              11  Mercy-employed doctors.

              12          Q.   Do you -- have you seen that with

              13  surgery, that surgery -- surgical -- or

              14  surgeons are typically covered by the

              15  ProMedica plans, so that ProMedica patients

              16  can have surgeries at Mercy hospitals?

              17          A.   It's kind of a two-layer

              18  question.  There are Mercy primary care

              19  physicians, and I believe specialists that are

              20  in the ProMedica network, and patients can go

              21  see them.  Whether they can go to a Mercy

              22  facility is another question.

              23          Q.   Okay.

              24          A.   Or another tier.

              25          Q.   I understand.  There are certain



                                                               17


               1  people, without going into names, or what have

               2  you, but there are certain people that would

               3  appear on approved lists for ProMedica, even

               4  though they also work at Mercy?

               5          A.   Correct.

               6          Q.   The issue that -- there is a

               7  separate issue that of where they would see

               8  the patient potentially?

               9          A.   Where they would perform that

              10  surgery or -- yes.

              11          Q.   Okay.  But what you're seeing in

              12  terms of a -- you're seeing -- you're seeing,

              13  with regard to -- to what we were talking

              14  about with insurance, you're seeing this in a

              15  competitive landscape for Mercy here in

              16  Toledo, correct?  ProMedica's competition?

              17          A.   ProMedica -- ProMedica is our

              18  competition, yes, I would agree with that.

              19          Q.   There is -- I mean, I think I

              20  even saw that there is a road here named

              21  ProMedica Road, or something along those

              22  lines?

              23          A.   Yeah.  They have an exit -- yeah,

              24  they have an exit off of 475.

              25          Q.   And -- and so over time, have you



                                                               18


               1  seen, and tell me yes or no.  I mean, I may be

               2  right, I may not be.  But over time, have you

               3  seen an impact on market share at St. Anne's,

               4  or a decrease in market share, because of

               5  ProMedica and their insurance program and what

               6  they're doing?

               7          A.   I -- I only have history in this

               8  town from '11 on.  My experience in the last

               9  few years is that Mercy's gaining market

              10  share, and ProMedica is losing market share.

              11             Now, what -- what is related to the

              12  insurance company versus, you know, whether

              13  their insurance company isn't doing as well,

              14  or whether we're just providing better

              15  services and patient choice, there is a

              16  variety of different factors, I assume.

              17          Q.   Okay.  We're going to cover a

              18  long time period today.  It's going to be

              19  fairly -- I have a lot of questions for you

              20  today, but I want to -- I'll try to mostly

              21  follow chronologically.  I'm going to skip to

              22  the end right away.

              23             First, I would like to ask you is,

              24  do you know why Doc -- the service agreement

              25  between Mercy and Toledo Clinic was terminated



                                                               19


               1  --

               2             (Whereupon, at 10:16, Greg Hood

               3  joined the deposition.)

               4          Q.   -- one year prior to its natural

               5  expiration?

               6          A.   Not 100 percent sure.

               7  Tom Arquilla was really the primary Mercy

               8  party involved with that.

               9          Q.   And I want to go through a couple

              10  of background things, just to ask you, before

              11  we start today.

              12             Have you ever -- has it ever been

              13  suggested to you that Dr. Holland has sued you

              14  in any way?

              15          A.   Sued me --

              16          Q.   Sued you personally --

              17          A.   -- personally?

              18          Q.   -- correct?

              19          A.   No.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Has it -- has it -- you

              21  ever gained information, or belief, that

              22  Dr. Holland has accused you of being a racist,

              23  or a person who discriminates?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   Okay.  Generally speaking, in



                                                               20


               1  terms of Dr. Holland, did you believe that you

               2  had a good relationship with him when he was

               3  at St. Anne's?

               4          A.   Workable.

               5          Q.   Did he appear to like you?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   Did he appear to trust you?

               8          A.   I think so.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Would he come to you with

              10  issues and meet with you and ask for your

              11  assistance?

              12          A.   From time to time, yeah.

              13          Q.   And would you, from time to time,

              14  get involved in things that Dr. Holland would

              15  ask you for assistance in?

              16          A.   Sure.  As the hospital -- I mean,

              17  similar to any other doctor on staff, yes.

              18          Q.   And in terms of your role, do

              19  you, as the president, do you try to -- strike

              20  that.

              21             Do you see yourself, or strike

              22  that.

              23             Have you worked in the sense of a

              24  mediator or facilitator as the president

              25  between doctors when disputes arise?



                                                               21


               1          A.   From time to time.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And tell me what it is --

               3  tell me, have you acquired skills, over the

               4  course of being the president in doing that,

               5  or have you trained outside of the hospital in

               6  doing it, or is it just like on-the-job

               7  training?

               8          A.   I would probably say it's more

               9  on-the-job training.  I mean, there is certain

              10  ongoing educations and those types of things,

              11  but most of these things have their own, you

              12  know, they all have their own flavor a little

              13  bit, so you ....

              14          Q.   In terms of being a businessman

              15  and a manager, are you a person that likes to

              16  read a lot of business books or business

              17  authors?

              18          A.   Not necessarily.

              19          Q.   Like Peter Drucker, for example,

              20  is he someone that you --

              21          A.   No.

              22          Q.   -- read?

              23             Now, I asked you about

              24  Dr. Holland's perception of you.  Is there

              25  anything that you saw with Dr. Holland, from



                                                               22


               1  his perspective, that he seemed to indicate

               2  that he didn't like you or didn't trust you?

               3          A.   I never -- no, I never got that

               4  feeling.

               5          Q.   Now, you've been made aware that

               6  there -- that Dr. Holland made a recording of

               7  a meeting that you were present at on

               8  St. Patrick's Day?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   Have you listened to the tape?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   Have you read a transcript of it?

              13          A.   Yes.

              14          Q.   Do you dispute that you were at

              15  the meeting with Dr. Holland?

              16          A.   No.

              17          Q.   Were you upset to learn he tape

              18  recorded it?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   Why?

              21          A.   I think it's a betrayal of our

              22  trust, but I guess in retrospect, looking at a

              23  variety of different things, I shouldn't be

              24  surprised, but ....

              25          Q.   Well, just to go through that for



                                                               23


               1  a second.  Do you have an understand -- any

               2  understanding about what -- that federal law

               3  permits a -- one person, who's a party to the

               4  conversation, to record it?  Do you know --

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               6          A.   No, I'm not familiar with federal

               7  law.

               8          Q.   And then Ohio law is one-party

               9  consent state, versus some states that are

              10  two-party consent?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Are you aware

              13  of that or not?

              14          A.   I'm not aware of it --

              15          Q.   Okay.  So --

              16          A.   -- what the laws are regarding --

              17          Q.   All right.  So --

              18          A.   -- tape recording meetings, no.

              19          Q.   So whether he was lawfully, even

              20  if he was lawfully allowed to do it, do you

              21  believe that even if it was legal to do it, do

              22  you still feel, in some way, that it was a

              23  betrayal of your trust with him that he

              24  recorded it?

              25          A.   I don't feel good about it.



                                                               24


               1          Q.   Okay.  Have you -- has that

               2  caused --

               3          A.   You know, looking at the tape, I

               4  have no issue with anything that was discussed

               5  either, so ....

               6          Q.   Okay.  Do you feel -- did -- do

               7  you feel any raised dislike, or animosity, or

               8  anything towards Dr. Holland in any way

               9  because he made that tape?

              10          A.   Not really, I guess.

              11          Q.   Have you been made aware that

              12  there are -- is at least one other person at

              13  Mercy, Mr. Carruthers, who's been making

              14  tapes?

              15          A.   No, I was not aware of that.

              16          Q.   Have you had meetings with

              17  Mr. Carruthers?

              18          A.   From time to time, yeah.

              19          Q.   Do you -- do you get along with

              20  Mr. Carruthers?

              21          A.   It's a complicated relationship,

              22  I would say, so at times, yes.  At times, I've

              23  had issues.

              24          Q.   Skill wise, he's very good,

              25  correct?



                                                               25


               1          A.   I think he's a good PA, as a --

               2  as a clinician, yes.

               3          Q.   Has complaints that he's made

               4  about his hours made it up to you, that he was

               5  overworked?

               6          A.   We have worked, from time to

               7  time, I've worked with Greg on trying to

               8  address some concerns he had relative to call

               9  load and those types of things.

              10          Q.   Okay.

              11          A.   I also understand he's fairly --

              12  we don't always know where he's at.

              13          Q.   Do you know why he would be

              14  recording conversations?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   Had you ever known, prior to

              17  learning that Dr. Holland recorded a

              18  conversation with you, had you ever believed

              19  him to be a person that would be recording

              20  conversations, or knew him to be doing that?

              21          A.   I never fully trusted Dr.

              22  Holland.  I guess I'll leave it at that.

              23          Q.   You never what?

              24          A.   Fully trusted him.  You know, I

              25  would find things he told me later weren't



                                                               26


               1  exactly the case they were.  So you know,

               2  whether I jumped to recording meetings, I'm

               3  not sure that came across my mind.

               4          Q.   No, not whether you did, I mean,

               5  whether you thought that Dr. Holland was the

               6  kind of person that was recording meetings

               7  with you over the course of your relationship

               8  with him?

               9          A.   Ask the question again, I guess.

              10  Kind of --

              11          Q.   I mean, you're aware of the

              12  St. Patrick's Day tape, correct?

              13          A.   Correct.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Do you have any impression

              15  that Dr. Holland would have been recording

              16  more conversations with you prior to then?

              17          A.   Taped one, I guess he could have

              18  taped others.

              19          Q.   And other than speculating or

              20  guessing, do you have any idea as to why it

              21  would be that Dr. Holland would begin to tape

              22  record conversations at the hospital?

              23          A.   Sounds like he was preparing, you

              24  know, wanted to prepare for this lawsuit, I

              25  guess is what the -- probably would have been



                                                               27


               1  the primary reason.

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Please don't guess.

               3          A.   Okay.

               4          Q.   You're just speculating on that?

               5          A.   Yeah.

               6          Q.   Okay.  How about Mr. Carruthers,

               7  do you have any idea as to -- strike that.

               8             Does it -- does it bring some alarm

               9  and concern to you that more than one person

              10  at your institution has been making tape

              11  recordings of conversations?

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   Does it -- does it concern you

              14  that -- that people would feel that the

              15  environment was such that they had to tape

              16  record conversations with people, because they

              17  couldn't trust them anymore?

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              19  mischaracterization of the record, narrative,

              20  lack of foundation.

              21          A.   Can you ask the question again?

              22          Q.   Yeah.  Would it concern you as a

              23  president, if the -- the reason that, one of

              24  the reasons people were tape recording

              25  conversations is there was a breakdown in



                                                               28


               1  trust, and they didn't believe people would

               2  tell the truth anymore?

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection, lack

               4  of foundation, and narrative.

               5          A.   I mean, there is so many things

               6  loaded in there that are assumptions.  I can't

               7  really say.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Do you know whether

               9  Dr. Phillips has been tape recording

              10  conversations?

              11          A.   I do not.

              12          Q.   Do you know what would bring him

              13  to do that, if he was?

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection,

              15  speculation.

              16          A.   I have no knowledge that he's

              17  doing it, so I can't really say why he might

              18  be.

              19          Q.   Have you ever heard generally the

              20  word mafia?

              21          A.   Generally the word mafia, yes.

              22          Q.   Okay.

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And you

              25  understand that there is a negative



                                                               29


               1  connotation with the word mafia, correct?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) I'm Italian,

               4  so I -- I know all about negative

               5  connotations.

               6             Do you know what the mafia

               7  generally is?

               8          A.   Yeah.  I -- I have watched the

               9  Godfather, if that's what you mean.

              10          Q.   Yeah.  Commonly understood to be.

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   Okay.  A lot of people associated

              13  with Italians, but there are all kinds of

              14  mafia.

              15             But in any event, had you ever

              16  heard that the word mafia was being used in

              17  connection with Mercy hospitals?

              18          A.   Not until this lawsuit was filed.

              19  Prior to that, I never heard that.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Would it concern you if --

              21  if the mafia was really operating in one of

              22  your hospitals?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              24  speculation.

              25          A.   Yeah, I don't -- would it concern



                                                               30


               1  me if that were the case?

               2          Q.   Yeah.

               3          A.   It seems beyond comprehension, so

               4  it's a little bit of a --

               5          Q.   What seems --

               6          A.   -- crazy --

               7          Q.   -- beyond comprehension?

               8          A.   That there is a mafia operating

               9  in the hospital.

              10          Q.   Okay.  So you -- you -- you think

              11  that people that are criminally involved in

              12  mafia enterprises tell others that they're

              13  involved in them?

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, relevance,

              15  speculation.

              16          A.   I mean, the question is just kind

              17  of preposterous.  I don't know what you want

              18  me to tell you.

              19          Q.   Do you think it's preposterous

              20  that someone would -- in a mafia, or a

              21  criminal organization, would be operating

              22  inside a Mercy hospital?

              23          A.   Yeah, I think that's --

              24          Q.   Have you ever conducted an

              25  investigation?



                                                               31


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to the

               2  relevance of this line of questioning.

               3          A.   Have I ever conducted an

               4  investigation --

               5          Q.   Yeah.

               6          A.   -- no.

               7          Q.   Into that.  No?  Okay.

               8             Have you ever heard the term the

               9  brotherhood used in connection with Mercy

              10  hospitals?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   You never even heard in this case

              13  either?

              14          A.   No.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, asked and

              16  answered.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You know,

              18  strike that.

              19             I'm going to sort of skip towards

              20  the end a little bit on the topic.

              21             Do you recall a surgical candidate

              22  being sourced by Dr. Hashmi named Dr. Hasan?

              23          A.   Oh, a CV, a cardiothoracic --

              24          Q.   Yes.

              25          A.   -- surgeon?



                                                               32


               1          Q.   Yes.

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   And what do you recall about how

               4  Dr. Hasan was identified as a potential

               5  cardiothoracic candidate?

               6          A.   Nothing.

               7          Q.   Now, just to be -- in terms of

               8  your hospital, you, St. Anne's receives

               9  federal monies through Medicare; is that

              10  right?

              11          A.   Sure.

              12          Q.   Did you ever hear that Dr. Hasan

              13  was a Defendant in a lawsuit where Medicare

              14  fraud was alleged?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   That wasn't brought up before he

              17  was vetted at the hospital, correct?  By

              18  Doctor -- strike that.

              19             Dr. Hashmi never mentioned that,

              20  correct?

              21          A.   Dr. Hashmi never mentioned it.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              23  foundation.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Now, you don't

              25  believe that Medicare money should be



                                                               33


               1  improperly taken from the United States

               2  government, correct?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   Okay.  So if there was some type

               5  of mafia organization that existed in one of

               6  your hospitals, if it was proven, and they

               7  were causing money to be, or strike that.

               8  Restate it.

               9             Did you ever learn, through any

              10  sources, that it was joked to Dr. Holland that

              11  he should change his first name to Mohammed,

              12  so that he would get more referrals?

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

              14          A.   No.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  -- form.

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Did you ever

              17  hear, or strike that.

              18             With Dr. Hasan, what was your

              19  understanding as to how he became a surgical

              20  candidate for a cardiothoracic position at

              21  Mercy?

              22          A.   I wasn't really involved with the

              23  recruitment of Dr. Hasan.

              24          Q.   Is that unusual, given that you

              25  were the president of St. Anne's?



                                                               34


               1          A.   Yeah.  Usually, I'm involved with

               2  those.

               3          Q.   Okay.  And incidentally, in

               4  preparing for your deposition, did you have a

               5  chance to look at various emails and things,

               6  documents?

               7          A.   Yeah.  We -- I reviewed whatever

               8  exhibits were given to me.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall generally

              10  what you reviewed in preparing?

              11          A.   Anything that was an email that I

              12  was involved with, and the -- and the meeting

              13  with Dr. Holland.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Did you look at any

              15  deposition transcripts or anything --

              16          A.   Few of those, yeah.

              17          Q.   -- that you can recall?

              18             Do you recall being shown any

              19  testimony that Dr. Holland gave about you?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   What kind of testimony do you

              22  recall being shown about you?

              23          A.   I don't know.  There was a lot

              24  there.  It was the entire deposition, so ...

              25  several of the things I didn't agree with the



                                                               35


               1  way he characterized them.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Okay.  I'm going to go

               3  back to -- I'm going to start -- I'm going to

               4  try to go through chronologically.  I'll go

               5  back, starting at the beginning.

               6             Were you involved initially with

               7  Buzz Hermann in any recruitment efforts of

               8  Dr. Holland?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   Do you recall who Buzz Hermann

              11  was?

              12          A.   Buzz Hermann was the cardiac,

              13  cardiology cardiac service line manager when I

              14  got here.  I don't know what time, when he

              15  left.  It was soon after I got here.  Maybe a

              16  year or two.

              17          Q.   And when -- when Mr. Hermann was

              18  there, who was -- give me ....

              19             Were you at St. Anne's when Kevin

              20  Cook was with Mercy?

              21          A.   Yes.  Not the entire -- Kevin got

              22  here before I did, but we were here together.

              23          Q.   I believe -- I believe the

              24  sequence, in terms of timing, was Kevin Cook

              25  and Buzz Hermann were both at Mercy at or



                                                               36


               1  about the time Dr. Holland was recruited.  And

               2  then I believe after Dr. Holland came on

               3  board, or thereabouts, Mr. Cook left and also

               4  Mr. Hermann left.

               5          A.   Okay.

               6          Q.   Do you recall Mr. Cook leaving --

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   -- Mercy?

               9             And then also Mr. Hermann also

              10  leaving?

              11          A.   Not as much.  I knew Kevin

              12  better.

              13          Q.   Okay.  But you knew Mr. Hermann

              14  also left, correct?

              15          A.   Yeah.

              16          Q.   In terms of Kevin, he got

              17  another, I think he got a job somewhere else;

              18  is that correct?

              19          A.   He's got a job at the University

              20  of Mississippi.

              21          Q.   And then do you know where

              22  Mr. Hermann went?

              23          A.   I think he was retiring, but I'm

              24  not 100 percent sure.

              25          Q.   And do you recall, prior to



                                                               37


               1  Dr. Holland coming, ever having any

               2  discussions with Mr. Hermann, where it was

               3  indicated that Dr. Holland was all for the

               4  St. Anne's cardiology initiative?

               5          A.   I don't remember Dr. Holland

               6  specifically being mentioned, but there was

               7  general, I think interest, in opening up a

               8  west side cardiac program by cardiologists and

               9  the group of cardiothoracic surgeons.

              10          Q.   So at the time that Dr. Holland

              11  was being recruited, did Mercy-St. Anne have a

              12  cardiothoracic program?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   If he had -- when he came in, was

              15  it going to be expected that he would try to

              16  build that program?

              17          A.   I don't know if St. Anne's was

              18  even in the planning when Dr. Holland started.

              19          Q.   At some point, though, do you

              20  recall Dr. Holland being involved in the

              21  planning or --

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   Okay.  And assisting in setting

              24  up the program at --

              25          A.   Yeah.  He was involved with that.



                                                               38


               1          Q.   Would you say he was heavily

               2  involved in doing that?

               3          A.   Yeah.  He was pretty involved.  I

               4  mean, we were going to perform surgery there,

               5  and we had never done it before, so ....

               6          Q.   Does he -- is the program still

               7  working there today?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Does he have a plaque anywhere --

              10          A.   No.  We have --

              11          Q.   -- acknowledging him?

              12          A.   -- no -- no -- no memorials or

              13  statues, no.

              14          Q.   I didn't get to the statue yet.

              15          A.   Oh, okay.

              16          Q.   I was just asking about a plaque.

              17          A.   No, no plaque.

              18          Q.   A plaque is simple.  A plaque is

              19  something that goes on a wall, and nobody

              20  really notices.  The statue is something that,

              21  you know, is a pretty big deal.

              22             Hold on one second.

              23             Okay.  What do you recall, during

              24  the recruitment period with Dr. Holland in

              25  terms of his recruitment, if anything?



                                                               39


               1          A.   Don't recall a lot.  Tom --

               2  Tom Leeds probably would have been the primary

               3  person involved with that.  We didn't have a

               4  cardiac program, so it didn't really make that

               5  much sense for me to be involved.  He --

               6          Q.   Leeds took the basic -- Leeds

               7  took the lead --

               8          A.   Leeds took the lead.  I think, at

               9  the time, you know, this was a Toledo Clinic

              10  hire, so they were really involved with this

              11  as well.

              12          Q.   And what was your understanding

              13  as to why Dr. Holland would be employed at

              14  Toledo Clinic, as opposed to Mercy?

              15          A.   I'm not an expert on it, because

              16  I really wasn't in the discussion at the time.

              17          Q.   If you don't know about it, I

              18  don't want you to speculate or guess.

              19          A.   I don't know about it.

              20          Q.   Fair enough.

              21             Do you recall any discussions that

              22  you were made aware of, or strike that.

              23             What kind of a relationship did you

              24  have with Fayyaz Hashmi overall, if you had

              25  any at all?



                                                               40


               1          A.   I didn't have -- not as, you

               2  know, I did not know him as well as like, for

               3  example, I knew Dr. Holland, because

               4  Dr. Holland was the one primarily at

               5  St. Anne's.

               6          Q.   You may or may not know these

               7  things or not.  If you don't, that's fine.  Do

               8  you recall any discussions, at or about the

               9  time that Dr. Holland was coming in, where you

              10  learned that Dr. Hashmi was asking how he

              11  could reconcile his wRVUs, since Dr. Holland

              12  was going to be taking some of the work?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Were you ever -- were you ever

              15  made aware that Dr. Hashmi had an RVU

              16  incentive-based contract?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   Are you aware generally of the

              19  contract that Dr. Holland had with Toledo

              20  Clinic?

              21          A.   With Dr. Holland's, no, I don't

              22  have any.  That would have been with the

              23  clinic and Dr. Holland, so ....

              24          Q.   The service agreement between

              25  Mercy and Toledo Clinic, you would have been



                                                               41


               1  aware of, generally, of that agreement,

               2  correct?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   And that agreement did not have

               5  any volume requirements for Dr. Holland,

               6  correct?  In terms of number of surgeries or

               7  RVUs?

               8          A.   I don't believe so.

               9          Q.   All right.  Now, do you recall

              10  any discussions, and I don't want any --

              11  anything that would be a privileged

              12  discussion, so I'm not asking for any internal

              13  meetings, or anything where you were sitting

              14  down with counsel, or anything like that on

              15  us, okay?

              16             Do you recall any discussions,

              17  outside of any discussions with counsel, where

              18  people discussed the fact that

              19  RVU-incentivized contracts for surgeons are a

              20  no-no, or inappropriate, or -- or shouldn't be

              21  used, because they incentivize improper

              22  conduct?  Or words to that effect.

              23          A.   Most -- most are -- I don't get

              24  involved with the physician contracts, kind of

              25  by design in our organization.  My



                                                               42


               1  understanding is that most of them do have

               2  some type of RVU basis, but on individual

               3  doctors, I don't really know.

               4          Q.   Do you believe that for surgeons?

               5          A.   Do I believe that they have RVU

               6  contracts?

               7          Q.   Most of them have the RVU

               8  contract?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   Do you know why it was that the,

              11  and if you don't know, again, I don't want you

              12  to speculate or guess, do you know why it is

              13  that the service agreement between Mercy and

              14  Toledo Clinic had no RVU component?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   Were you ever -- did you know a

              17  woman named Elizabeth Sheroian?

              18          A.   Only by name.  And I knew she was

              19  the practice manager of the cardiothoracic

              20  group.

              21          Q.   Did you know a doctor named

              22  James Burdine?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   And how did -- I know Mr. --

              25  Dr. Burdine has passed away, so in any event,



                                                               43


               1  we still ask questions about him.  What was

               2  your relationship with Dr. Burdine?

               3          A.   Very limited.

               4          Q.   Essentially --

               5          A.   I don't think he ever -- I don't

               6  know if he ever did one case at St. Anne's.

               7  Maybe a thoracic case here and there.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Was there a controversy

               9  that started -- was there any controversy that

              10  arose, when you were pushing to open the

              11  St. Anne's cardiothoracic program, in terms of

              12  competition with Mercy-St. Vincent?

              13          A.   I think we were careful to make

              14  sure we weren't unnecessary duplicating

              15  resources, because these are fairly expensive

              16  programs, and you know, fairly, require a lot

              17  of investment.  But I would say regular due

              18  diligence.

              19          Q.   Were you ever made aware that

              20  Dr. Burdine had made comments about Muslims or

              21  Muslim doctors?

              22          A.   I never heard Dr. Burdine say

              23  that to me.

              24          Q.   Did you hear indirectly these

              25  things?  And I don't mean through this



                                                               44


               1  lawsuit.  You may have heard things through

               2  this lawsuit, so if you say only through this

               3  lawsuit, fine.  But did you hear anything

               4  about comments like that from Dr. Burdine,

               5  independent of this lawsuit?

               6          A.   Not that I recall.

               7          Q.   And were you ever made aware that

               8  there is an audio of a dinner between

               9  Dr. Phillips, Dr. Holland, and Dr. Nahhas?

              10  Had you ever heard that there was an audio

              11  made --

              12          A.   Yeah, I did hear that.

              13          Q.   Did you see the transcript from

              14  that?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   Were you ever made aware that in

              17  October of 2013, Dr. Burdine circulated a memo

              18  to his entire -- to the -- his entire practice

              19  group about how referrals were supposed to

              20  occur?  Was that something you were made aware

              21  of?

              22          A.   No.

              23          Q.   And then just to be clear, so in

              24  terms of the cardiothoracic group that we're

              25  talking about, do you ever recall a



                                                               45


               1  Dr. Brunsting, Louis Brunsting?

               2          A.   No.

               3          Q.   And so basically, until your

               4  program got established at St. Anne's in

               5  cardiothoracic, you had, because you're the

               6  president of St. Anne's, you had very limited

               7  involvement, if any, with cardiothoracic

               8  surgeons from Mercy-St. Vincent?

               9          A.   Correct.  I think, memory serves

              10  me correctly, we may have gotten board

              11  approval for that sometime early '14, early

              12  '14.  And then start, you know, did our first

              13  catheterization in August of '14, and surgery

              14  in October of '14, if I remember correctly.

              15          Q.   Okay.  All right.  Just going --

              16  going to go through a little bit more

              17  background with you --

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   -- whether you knew about it or

              20  not.

              21             Were you ever made aware, or did

              22  you learn, that in November of 2013,

              23  Dr. Holland sent a letter to Thomas Arquilla,

              24  pointing out a variety of safety concerns that

              25  he had?



                                                               46


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   What was your -- what type of

               3  working relationship, if any, did you have

               4  with Thomas Arquilla?

               5          A.   So Tom was, on and off, as my

               6  boss occasionally.  He was predominantly in

               7  business development, but he did, from time to

               8  time, hold what we call the kind of metro

               9  president role, so I would report to him at

              10  times, and then sometimes it was more -- so it

              11  was -- it was -- he was primarily a support

              12  for me, particularly around business

              13  development.

              14          Q.   Did you trust him?

              15          A.   Yeah.

              16          Q.   You never saw issues that led you

              17  to believe that he was being less than candid

              18  with you?

              19          A.   No.

              20          Q.   So Mr. Arquilla --

              21          A.   Tom -- just -- Tom will tell you

              22  what he feels.  There is usually not much --

              23          Q.   Well, he compared humans -- he

              24  compared humans to toads.  He said that we're

              25  -- we're frogs, or something like that.  We're



                                                               47


               1  genetically --

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               3  mischaracterization.

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- genetically

               5  similar, we're 99, according to him --

               6          A.   Well --

               7          Q.   -- we're 99 percent 9 percent

               8  relatives of frogs.

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              10  mischaracterization of the record.

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Or words to

              12  that effect.  So he did have some interesting

              13  things to say, for sure.

              14             Okay.  Well, just to get a little

              15  backdrop.  So you don't recall Mr. Arquilla

              16  ever telling you, through -- that Dr. Holland,

              17  in late 2013, had been raising safety issues?

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   And were you ever made aware that

              20  five days after that letter was sent from

              21  Dr. Holland to Dr. Arquilla, that Elizabeth

              22  Sheroian, who was discussing with Dr. Hashmi

              23  Dr. Holland's retirement?

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative.

              25          A.   I have no knowledge of that.



                                                               48


               1          Q.   You -- okay.  And you may not

               2  have a knowledge of things.

               3          A.   Uh-huh.

               4          Q.   You may not.

               5          A.   Right.

               6          Q.   And that's fair enough.  And it's

               7  okay to -- I'm not trying to make you feel

               8  like you don't know things or anything like

               9  that.  If you don't know things, it's fair

              10  enough.

              11             If you can turn to Exhibit 50

              12  really quickly.  I'm not going to ask you to

              13  read the whole letter.

              14          A.   Okay.

              15          Q.   Unless you'd like to.  You're

              16  welcome to, if you like, as you're president

              17  of St. Anne's, sir, so ....

              18             And, sir, I may show you some

              19  information today as well that you've not

              20  seen, because one of the questions I may ask

              21  you at the end of the day is whether -- about

              22  questions about reinstatement and Dr. Holland,

              23  okay?

              24             Exhibit 50, and this is a letter

              25  Dr. Holland wrote to Thomas Arquilla on



                                                               49


               1  November 14, 2013.

               2             And before seeing this today, you

               3  had not seen this letter --

               4          A.   Correct.

               5          Q.   -- correct?  Okay.

               6          A.   If I can just -- at this point in

               7  time, we don't have a program.  Tom is at

               8  St. Vincent.  I really would have no reason to

               9  be involved with this.

              10          Q.   Okay.  I understand what you're

              11  saying.  I just -- make clear, though, that

              12  this was not -- subsequently, this letter was

              13  not subsequently brought up to you by

              14  Mr. Arquilla and say, hey, I just wanted to

              15  let you know, you know, back in 2013 --

              16          A.   No.

              17          Q.   -- Dr. Holland was raising safety

              18  concerns and --

              19          A.   No.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Now, and were you made

              21  aware, or do you recall being told, that

              22  Dr. Holland had a meeting with himself and

              23  Mr. Arquilla and Mr. Porterfield, Scott

              24  Porterfield, on or about January 21st, 2014,

              25  in which referrals and/or quality were



                                                               50


               1  discussed?  And if that's not how you

               2  understand that meeting, and you have heard

               3  that the meeting is something else, please

               4  tell me, but are you aware of any such meeting

               5  in January of 2014?

               6          A.   I'm not aware of a specific

               7  meeting --

               8          Q.   Okay.

               9          A.   -- whether there, you know?

              10          Q.   Now, did Mr. Arquilla ever tell

              11  you that during that meeting Dr. Holland

              12  brought with him STS data, or did you ever

              13  hear that he brought STS data?

              14          A.   No.

              15          Q.   Do you know what STS data is,

              16  generally?

              17          A.   Hardly an expert, but I -- I know

              18  -- know a little bit about it, yes.

              19          Q.   And I'm not -- I'm not trying to

              20  suggest you have.

              21          A.   Yeah.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              23             Now, were you told -- were you ever

              24  told that Dr. Holland went to a meeting in

              25  January 21st, 2014, that he brought a memo



                                                               51


               1  from Dr. Burdine about referrals, and he also

               2  brought STS data with him, his own, and also

               3  other data, and that he showed that, or he

               4  made the case that referrals did not seem to

               5  be based upon quality?

               6          A.   I have -- I have no recollection

               7  of this meeting.

               8          Q.   And you were not there, and I'm

               9  --

              10          A.   Right.

              11          Q.   -- just asking whether

              12  Mr. Arquilla told you about that?

              13          A.   No.

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  We'll object to the

              15  form of that question.

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Now, were you

              17  told, or did you ever hear, that at the end of

              18  that meeting, or towards the end of that

              19  meeting, Mr. Arquilla said in response to

              20  Dr. Holland, words to the effect, that if

              21  you're not happy here, I'll serve as a

              22  referral for you?

              23          A.   No.

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              25  foundation.



                                                               52


               1          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And did you

               2  ever hear from any source that after that,

               3  Dr. Holland was upset and communicated that he

               4  was upset by what Doctor -- Mr. Arquilla had

               5  said to him?

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               7          A.   I don't really -- I didn't get a

               8  report out of that meeting.  I don't really

               9  recall anything about it.

              10          Q.   Okay.  Now, were you ever told

              11  that subsequent to that meeting, or did you

              12  ever learn, that subsequent to that meeting,

              13  Dr. Holland attempted to get a, or make a

              14  dinner arrangement with Dr. Kabour?

              15          A.   I was aware of that.

              16          Q.   And how did you become aware of

              17  that?

              18          A.   Tom relayed back to me, at some

              19  point in time, in regards to coaching

              20  Dr. Holland about how to build his business,

              21  he suggested, you know, to meet with

              22  Dr. Kabour, to take him to dinner.  And I

              23  think Tom had some frustration about it,

              24  because he -- Dr. Holland suggested they bring

              25  their wives, and Tom was saying that's --



                                                               53


               1  that's not going to work.  If you want to have

               2  a candidate conversation with somebody, you --

               3  you don't bring your wives.

               4          Q.   And so do you know whether any

               5  dinner ever occurred with Doctor -- and by the

               6  way, and so you believe that -- and that's the

               7  way Mr. Arquilla, or strike that.

               8             That's what Mr. Arquilla advised

               9  you about the situation?

              10          A.   Yeah.  I think Tom was the one

              11  that relayed that to me.

              12          Q.   And do you ever recall, ever

              13  hearing, as to why Dr. Kabour never got any

              14  dinner at all with Dr. Holland at that time,

              15  whether with wives or without wives?

              16          A.   No.

              17          Q.   Do you see anything generally, if

              18  you're trying to get to know a doctor, and do

              19  you see anything wrong with taking your

              20  spouses to the dinner?

              21          A.   Depends what the con -- tell you,

              22  I've never brought my spouse to a dinner, but

              23  -- that's business related, but only because

              24  she'd probably say, why did you take me to

              25  that dinner?  But you know, I think sometimes,



                                                               54


               1  depending on the nature of the conversation,

               2  it may be a good idea, may not be a good idea.

               3             Actually, I'll take that back.  I

               4  did take my wife to one dinner, with -- of

               5  somebody brand new to town.

               6          Q.   It turn out to be good or bad?

               7          A.   It wasn't that bad.

               8          Q.   Was --

               9          A.   It wasn't that bad.

              10          Q.   If you can flip to Exhibit 31,

              11  please, in your binder.  I just want to show

              12  you something.  And you are not carbon copied

              13  on these.

              14          A.   Okay.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  And we'll object for

              16  foundation.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And I -- and I

              18  will show you Exhibit 31.  If you look on the

              19  bottom of the first page, you'll see

              20  Dr. Holland, February 10, and then it goes

              21  over to the next page, and that's his email

              22  about the dinner with Dr. Kabour.

              23          A.   About the dinner with Dr. Kabour?

              24          Q.   Yes.

              25          A.   Okay.



                                                               55


               1          Q.   Holland to Arquilla on February

               2  10th, where he's telling him about the idea

               3  about his -- the dinner.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   Okay.  And I'll represent to you

               6  that this email was one that was sent -- well,

               7  February 10th, this is only a few weeks after

               8  the meeting between Dr. Holland, Mr. Arquilla

               9  and Mr. Porterfield, okay?

              10             And first, do you see where

              11  Dr. Holland says, thank you for taking time on

              12  21 Jan 2014 to discuss the matter of referrals

              13  and program statistics with Scott and myself.

              14  I'm having dinner at LaScola's tomorrow

              15  evening with Dr. Kabour and our spouses, in an

              16  effort to get better acquainted, since we know

              17  that referrals currently are not driven by

              18  outcomes, particularly mortality and other

              19  quality parameters.

              20             The intent of the evening is to

              21  present an opportunity for Dr. Kabour to

              22  discuss anything, or nothing, as he desires,

              23  and open a dialogue encouraging future

              24  collaboration.

              25             Once again, I appreciate your time



                                                               56


               1  and input.

               2             Okay.  Have I read that correctly

               3  generally?

               4          A.   Yeah.

               5          Q.   All right.  Now, here, you see

               6  that Dr. Holland states the intent is to allow

               7  Dr. Kabour to discuss anything or nothing at

               8  that dinner, correct?

               9          A.   I can read what is on this paper,

              10  yeah.

              11          Q.   Okay.  I'm just trying to --

              12  you're not carbon copied on this.

              13          A.   Uh-huh.

              14          Q.   You weren't told things by

              15  Mr. Arquilla, correct?  You weren't forwarded

              16  this by Mr. Arquilla?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   At any point in time.  Okay.

              19             And -- and here, Mr. Arquilla

              20  didn't -- he also didn't tell you about, or he

              21  didn't fill you in that the meeting in

              22  January 21st had to do with referrals, and how

              23  they were currently not driven by outcomes,

              24  particularly mortality and other quality

              25  parameters, he didn't tell you that part?



                                                               57


               1  Mr. Arquilla never did tell you that, did he?

               2          A.   Tom did not tell me that part?

               3          Q.   He didn't tell you that, did he?

               4          A.   I don't know if he commented on

               5  it.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Well, do you recall having

               7  any thought or knowledge, in or about February

               8  of 2014, that Dr. Holland had raised issues

               9  with the management at Mercy, with

              10  Mr. Arquilla, to be specific, about referrals

              11  not being driven by outcomes, particularly

              12  mortality and other quality parameters?

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Once again, lack of

              14  foundation.

              15          A.   Yeah, that's -- some assumptions

              16  in there.  I guess what I can say is I was

              17  aware Dr. Holland was looking to get busier,

              18  and had some frustrations, but in terms of

              19  specifics, at this date, I wasn't that

              20  involved with it.

              21          Q.   When Dr. Holland first came in to

              22  the, Mercy, did you -- were you told anything

              23  negative about him by -- from any source?

              24          A.   The only thing that I remember

              25  specifically, you know, he had been in Toledo



                                                               58


               1  before.  I wasn't here at the time.  But when

               2  he came to like our credentials committee,

               3  there was discussion, more than usual, around

               4  his behavior, some of the things that happened

               5  at Toledo Hospital, you know, those types of

               6  things and whether he would be a good, you

               7  know, whether, in the evaluation of his

               8  privileging.  But other than that, I don't --

               9  I don't recall a whole lot, up until the time

              10  that I started interacting with him.

              11          Q.   Do you recall what was said about

              12  him from 20 years earlier, when he was a young

              13  man in Toledo and at that practice?  Do you

              14  recall what was said about him, if anything,

              15  any specifics?

              16          A.   Probably generally describe it as

              17  abrasive, had issues with relationships, you

              18  know, colleagues, that type of thing.

              19          Q.   And who told you that?

              20          A.   Whoever the members of the

              21  committee would have been at that time.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall any

              23  specifics, though --

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   -- any specific people?



                                                               59


               1             Well, were you told that -- that

               2  one of the problems was that all the nurses

               3  fell in love with Jamie Holland, and the other

               4  doctors didn't like that?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

               6          A.   Well, I think there was another

               7  --

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  -- speculation.

               9          A.   Yeah.

              10          Q.   Did you hear that?

              11          A.   No, I did not hear that.  But I

              12  think there were issues.  There were concerns

              13  about interactions with staff as well, so ....

              14          Q.   Well, did you ever hear that

              15  nurses typ -- swooned to Dr. Holland, and he

              16  was openly invited into sexual relationships

              17  by many nurses over the years?  Did you ever

              18  hear that?

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, lack of

              20  foundation for this witness.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Have you ever

              22  heard of that?

              23          A.   I have never heard that.

              24          Q.   You didn't hear that he was --

              25  that -- strike that.



                                                               60


               1             Did you ever hear about any

               2  jealousies that ever erupted between

               3  Dr. Holland and any other doctor, because the

               4  other doctor got mad that the nurses were

               5  attracted to Dr. Holland and said so?

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               7  foundation, form.

               8          A.   I never heard that.

               9          Q.   Did you ever hear that any nurses

              10  commented about Dr. Holland, that when he was

              11  operating, he had "buns of steel"?  Have you

              12  heard that?

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.  Same

              14  objection.

              15          A.   I have -- I -- I have never heard

              16  him talked about that way.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And you didn't -- you

              18  didn't follow his entire career, or you didn't

              19  have details about his entire career --

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   -- correct?  You knew --

              22          A.   The only thing, I'm sorry.

              23          Q.   Go ahead.

              24          A.   The -- you know, he had been in

              25  several different places, which is, you know,



                                                               61


               1  when you're looking at a file, that's always

               2  something to look at.

               3          Q.   All right.  Well, let's -- let's

               4  talk about that, since you pointed that out.

               5  So he leaves Toledo, and then where did he go

               6  next?

               7          A.   I think between the two Toledo

               8  trips, he was in South Carolina for a stint,

               9  and Erie, Pennsylvania for a stint.

              10          Q.   Well, let's -- let's walk through

              11  the -- the big ones.  Basically, he gets a job

              12  in Pittsburgh, and then after, whether you

              13  know this or not, do you know that he got a

              14  job in Pittsburgh, and that was a

              15  substantially better position than the one he

              16  had had prior?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              18  foundation.

              19          A.   I don't know if it's a better job

              20  or not, but --

              21          Q.   All right.  And then from --

              22          A.   -- he went to Pittsburgh.

              23          Q.   All right.  And then he gets --

              24          A.   If you say so.  I don't even

              25  really know that much.



                                                               62


               1          Q.   And then he was in Pittsburgh for

               2  relatively a short time.  And after being in

               3  Pittsburgh, was almost immediately solicited

               4  to become the chief at St. Vincent in Erie,

               5  Pennsylvania.  Were you aware of that?

               6          A.   No.

               7          Q.   And that Dr. Holland was a chief

               8  -- let me just check.  One second.

               9             And that Dr. Holland then was the

              10  chief for approximately seven years in Erie.

              11          A.   (Witness nods head.)

              12          Q.   Were you aware of that?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Okay.  And then does that, for

              15  some reason -- and then he went to South

              16  Carolina, where he was chief for approximately

              17  five years.

              18          A.   (Witness nods head.)

              19          Q.   And that strikes you as a pattern

              20  as being unusual for someone?

              21          A.   Well, a little on the high side,

              22  but not -- not unusual.

              23          Q.   Okay.

              24          A.   Five to seven-year stints are --

              25          Q.   And you were never provided any



                                                               63


               1  details, just to be clear, you were never

               2  provided any details about what, if anything,

               3  happened in Erie, correct?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   As to why he left there?

               6          A.   No, not that I recall.

               7          Q.   Do you recall having discussions

               8  with Dr. Holland in terms of his, the age of

               9  his parents and their health?

              10          A.   Yeah.  One of them was, I think

              11  in a home.  I think the mother.

              12          Q.   Do you recall whether or not

              13  during -- when Dr. Holland was being

              14  recruited, whether or not you remember any

              15  discussions with him, where he indicated that

              16  he wanted to be closer to the one or both of

              17  his parents?

              18          A.   Yeah.  So that whole recruiting

              19  process, when he came back to town, if he was,

              20  and it sounds like he might have been in South

              21  Carolina the last time.

              22          Q.   Yes.

              23          A.   You know, that whole process, I

              24  wasn't involved with at all.

              25          Q.   Fair enough.



                                                               64


               1             Have you found that it's difficult

               2  to recruit quality surgeons to the Toledo

               3  marketplace?

               4          A.   That -- quality doctors, yeah,

               5  they're hard to recruit.  I think, nationally,

               6  they're hard to recruit.  I -- I hear Toledo

               7  is more difficult, but ....

               8          Q.   Is there a current supply problem

               9  with cardiothoracic surgeons that you can see?

              10          A.   I would describe it as tight.

              11  It's a tight market.

              12          Q.   Demand is pretty high and quality

              13  surgeons more limited?

              14          A.   Yeah.

              15          Q.   Have you also seen, as a trend,

              16  that some of the large medical institutions

              17  are sucking off resources, so that they go to

              18  larger -- strike that.

              19             Did you ever speak to a woman named

              20  Angela Bontempo, who was the former CEO of

              21  Mercy-St. Vincent?

              22          A.   Angela Bontempo?

              23          Q.   She was a -- she was a nun.

              24          A.   Oh, no.

              25          Q.   Okay.  Coming back to -- do you



                                                               65


               1  recall being -- strike that.

               2             Have you been told that during this

               3  litigation, when Dr. Kabour was asked whether

               4  or not he would be open to going to a dinner

               5  and working collaboratively in the future with

               6  Dr. Holland, that he was open to doing so?

               7  Were you informed of that?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   And that -- were you informed

              10  that other physicians in his group, not all of

              11  them, but including ones like Mohammed Alo,

              12  Doctor, a number of them in his group,

              13  indicated that they would be willing to work

              14  with Dr. Holland again, if he were ever to

              15  return to Toledo, were you made aware of that?

              16          A.   I --

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to the word

              18  number.

              19          A.   Okay.  No, but I -- for Kabour

              20  and his group, I would be shocked.

              21          Q.   Okay.

              22          A.   Because I mean, they had ample

              23  opportunity to work with him for the time

              24  period at St. Vincent's, and the time that

              25  even he was at St. Anne's, but ....



                                                               66


               1          Q.   Mr. Bertke, I'm not -- I'm not

               2  questioning what your answer is right now.

               3  But what I'm saying to you is that during the

               4  course of this litigation, people came in,

               5  under oath, not just walking around in a

               6  hallway.

               7          A.   Uh-huh.

               8          Q.   And not all of them, but a number

               9  of the people in his group, including

              10  Dr. Kabour, indicated a willingness to work

              11  with Dr. Holland again and collaborate with

              12  him, if he returned to Toledo.

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection to the

              14  number.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) The question

              16  is whether or not you were made aware of that

              17  before today?

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   Okay.  Now, Mr. Hood expressed,

              20  in his deposition, that he questioned the

              21  sincerity of that, and that seems to be --

              22  strike that.

              23             You're not -- you -- based on what

              24  you saw with Dr. Kabour's group, you -- your

              25  initial reaction to that was to question them,



                                                               67


               1  correct?

               2          A.   Yeah.  I'm not sure --

               3          Q.   Okay.

               4          A.   You know, the pattern doesn't

               5  quite match what they're saying there.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Under -- understand.

               7             Now, have you ever gotten any

               8  feedback from the Toledo Clinic cardiologists

               9  that still refer patients to -- to

              10  Mercy-St. Anne, have you got any feedback from

              11  them, from any source, that they wouldn't want

              12  to work with Dr. Holland, if he were to return

              13  to Toledo?

              14          A.   The Toledo Clinic physicians, I

              15  believe had a good experience with

              16  Dr. Holland.

              17          Q.   Dr. Nahhas and his people?

              18          A.   Dr. Nahhas, Dr. Yazji,

              19  Dr. Bren -- Brenya really doesn't send,

              20  Sarikonda, Dr. Al-Bawab, Youssef.

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  Poor court reporter.

              22          A.   Oh.

              23          Q.   She's going to ask you for

              24  spellings later.

              25          A.   All right.



                                                               68


               1          Q.   That's the real tough part, is

               2  when you get asked for spellings.

               3          A.   Yeah.

               4          Q.   We're -- we're at about an hour

               5  in.  Why don't we take a 10-minute break or so

               6  for restroom.

               7          A.   Sure.  Okay.

               8          Q.   Thank you.

               9             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record.

              10             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              11  11:07 until 11:18.)

              12             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  We're

              13  back on record.

              14          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Bertke,

              15  during the break, you and I had a brief

              16  conversation about P22, the mountain lion,

              17  correct?

              18          A.   That is correct.

              19          Q.   All right.  Fair enough.  I

              20  wanted to make that clear.

              21             Move up to a little bit having to

              22  do with the establishment of St. Anne's

              23  program, cardiothoracic program.  Can you tell

              24  me what you recall about Dr. Holland's

              25  involvement with regard to setting that up



                                                               69


               1  with you?  Or for you, or for the institution,

               2  however you want to --

               3          A.   My --

               4          Q.   -- characterize?

               5          A.   -- here is what I recall in terms

               6  of the lead-up, and then the subsequent.  For

               7  whatever reason, a variety of different

               8  reasons, Dr. Holland had had -- did not have

               9  much success at St. Vincent's.  I don't think

              10  he was getting a lot of referrals from the --

              11  the group down there, the TCC group, even some

              12  of the rural physicians.  And his primary

              13  support seemed to be the Toledo Clinic

              14  physicians.  He was in fact a partner with

              15  them.  And when we started the program at

              16  St. Anne's, because Anne's was directly across

              17  the, I guess the wall, but you know, the park

              18  -- parking lots were adjacent, it was believed

              19  that Toledo Clinic cardiologists would be the

              20  primary cardiologists over there.  And since

              21  Dr. Holland was part of their group, he was

              22  really kind of selected to help us lead and

              23  start the program there.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall a

              25  conversation with Dr. Holland, in or about



                                                               70


               1  July of 2014, in which you advised him words

               2  to the effect that Arquilla, Tom Arquilla, had

               3  requested that Dr. Holland be investigated?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Do you recall talking to

               6  Dr. Holland about the fact that you looked

               7  into a -- strike that.

               8             That you had looked into

               9  complaints, and that you were unable to find

              10  substance to rumors, and it was just a lot of

              11  smoke?  Do you recall words to that effect,

              12  saying that to Dr. Holland?

              13          A.   That I had looked into complaints

              14  regarding what?

              15          Q.   That Thomas Arquilla had raised,

              16  and that you were unable to find substance to

              17  the rumors, it was a lot of smoke?

              18          A.   No, not exactly.

              19          Q.   You're not denying that that

              20  conversation might have occurred, you just

              21  can't remember it as you --

              22          A.   I don't know --

              23          Q.   -- sit here today?

              24          A.   -- really what I would have been

              25  investigating at that time, because we weren't



                                                               71


               1  really doing procedures, and Dr. Holland

               2  wasn't working at St. Anne's, so I --

               3          Q.   Do you --

               4          A.   -- I'm -- I'm doubtful that would

               5  have occurred.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Well, do you recall, just

               7  shortly before opening this program, that you

               8  received any complaints about Dr. Holland from

               9  anyone at Mercy?

              10          A.   Yeah.  So there was, I would say

              11  general knowledge.  I don't remember specific

              12  people and specific complaints, but generally

              13  the themes were, wasn't successful in building

              14  the referral relationships, had some

              15  contentious, maybe relationships with medical

              16  staff, could be abrasive, and I don't want to

              17  use -- well, I guess, for lack of a better

              18  term, belligerent toward staff.

              19          Q.   And so were -- and that was the

              20  person you selected to head opening up the

              21  St. Anne's program, correct?

              22          A.   Correct.  But the clinic had

              23  faith in him, and sometimes, you know, new

              24  environments, you'll see a different person.

              25  And so I thought it was worthy of a second



                                                               72


               1  chance to see, if under different

               2  circumstances, things could be different.

               3          Q.   So you believed you were giving

               4  Dr. Holland a second chance when he was

               5  opening up the program?

               6          A.   That might --

               7          Q.   At St. Anne's?

               8          A.   That might be a, the way I would

               9  phrase it, yeah.

              10          Q.   Okay.  So you don't recall,

              11  though, that Buzz Hermann told you, as early

              12  as 2012, that Dr. Holland was -- was all for

              13  the St. Anne's initiative that was going to

              14  occur?  You don't recall anything about that?

              15          A.   I don't remember --

              16          Q.   Do you recall --

              17          A.   -- him specifically being

              18  mentioned.  I remember there was a lot of

              19  general support.

              20          Q.   Okay.  You don't recall, but you

              21  don't recall the St. Anne's initiative being

              22  discussed in any way with Dr. Holland, before

              23  he even arrived at Mercy, and that that was

              24  one of the things he was going to be asked or

              25  encouraged to do?



                                                               73


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

               2  foundation.

               3          A.   Yeah.  I have no knowledge of

               4  that.

               5          Q.   Now, in terms of what you say

               6  general, who -- who was it, if anyone, that

               7  communicated to you what they believed was

               8  Dr. Holland's personality?  Tell me anyone's

               9  name who communicated that to you.

              10          A.   Hmm.

              11          Q.   Prior to him coming over in the

              12  St. Anne's program and running it.

              13          A.   Well, it would have been, I

              14  suspect, Greg, Tom Arquilla.

              15          Q.   Well, let's go through --

              16          A.   Oh, I'm sorry.

              17          Q.   Please tell me the names.

              18          A.   Greg Hood.

              19          Q.   Greg Hood.  Okay.

              20          A.   Tom Arquilla.

              21          Q.   Uh-huh.

              22          A.   Who else might have been around?

              23  No.  Imran, Kevin Cook, if he was the -- I

              24  think he was still present at St. Vincent's at

              25  that time.



                                                               74


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Could you say Imran's

               2  last name.

               3          A.   Oh, Imran Andrabi.

               4          Q.   So when you -- when Doc -- when

               5  Mr. Arquilla advised that Dr. Holland could be

               6  abrasive and these other things, one of the

               7  things he didn't tell you, though, was that

               8  Dr. Holland had raised quality concerns or

               9  referral pattern issues, right?

              10          A.   No.  He didn't bring that up.

              11          Q.   And now, did you ever learn, at

              12  any point in time, prior to the opening of the

              13  St. Anne's program, that Dr. Holland had been

              14  arrested?

              15          A.   I believe -- well, prior to it

              16  opening?  No.

              17          Q.   Did you learn about it after it

              18  opening?

              19          A.   I believe that was in '15, so

              20  yes.

              21          Q.   Now, did you ever learn, or have

              22  you ever been told, that the person who made

              23  complaints about Dr. Holland that day had --

              24  was attempting to obtain a job at Mercy?

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,



                                                               75


               1  foundation.

               2          A.   So that neighbor applied for, I

               3  believe -- the woman, if I have this correct,

               4  was a nurse, who had cardiac experience.  And

               5  during her interview, she asked who -- who we

               6  felt the surg -- I don't think -- I don't

               7  remember if she was coming back to this area

               8  or not, or whether she knew surgeons in the

               9  area or not.  But somehow in the interview,

              10  she asked who the primary surgeon was, and

              11  when we said it was Dr. Holland, she -- and

              12  I'm paraphrasing here, don't quote me on it, I

              13  wasn't in the interview with her -- but

              14  basically, he's my neighbor, it's been a

              15  nightmare, and there is no way I can work with

              16  that guy.

              17          Q.   Now, did you have an

              18  understanding that these comments were made by

              19  the "neighbor" before or after the arrest of

              20  Dr. Holland?

              21          A.   Those were made when they first

              22  moved in.

              23          Q.   When they first moved in?

              24          A.   Well, I -- I think the neighbor

              25  was new and had moved in.  And it was before



                                                               76


               1  our pro -- it was while we were interviewing

               2  staff, so it would have been before the

               3  arrest.

               4          Q.   All right.  Now, were you ever

               5  told from any -- that's fair enough.  I just

               6  want to hear what information you have.

               7          A.   Uh-huh.

               8          Q.   Whether it's true, not true,

               9  whatever.  Just want to hear what you had,

              10  what you knew, what you were told.

              11             Were you ever told from any source

              12  that that neighbor, the nurse who wanted to

              13  get the job at Mercy, started complaining

              14  about Dr. Holland's music at his house before

              15  she even moved into her house?

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              17  foundation.

              18          A.   No, I don't recall that.

              19          Q.   Now, does that -- just -- I want

              20  you to assume for a second that that can be

              21  verified through Dr. Holland.  That the person

              22  who was looking to get a job at Mercy, before

              23  she ever even moved into her house, started to

              24  complain about him playing music in his house.

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  Once again --



                                                               77


               1          A.   It's a statement, so I'm --

               2          Q.   Fair enough.  Does that --

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  -- same objection.

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- does that

               5  -- if that were true, that would sound unusual

               6  to you that a person who hasn't even moved

               7  into their house yet, would already be

               8  complaining about their neighbor, correct?

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              10  narrative and argumentative.

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Right, that

              12  would be unusual?

              13          A.   If -- if true --

              14          Q.   Okay.

              15          A.   -- I guess.

              16          Q.   Now --

              17          A.   Depending on --

              18          Q.   Yeah.

              19          A.   -- you know, what -- what was

              20  going on, but ....

              21          Q.   Sure.  But that would sound

              22  unusual to you, correct?

              23          A.   It depends.

              24          Q.   Have you ever heard of a neighbor

              25  -- have you ever heard of someone complaining



                                                               78


               1  about a person's music from their house,

               2  before they moved into their house?  They're

               3  not even living there yet.  Have you ever

               4  heard of anything like that?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   Now, did you ever -- has anyone

               7  ever shown you the police report pertaining to

               8  Dr. Holland?

               9          A.   I did -- yes, I did see the

              10  police report.

              11          Q.   Who showed you that?  And when

              12  did you see it?

              13          A.   Our -- so that would have -- it

              14  would have come from our Police Department,

              15  because when the neighbor called me, who said

              16  -- she called me and said, are you aware, I

              17  don't remember the exact conversation, but

              18  basically are you aware that, you know, your

              19  surgeon was arrested on Saturday night, or

              20  whatever the night was.                  And

              21  you know, you're in this job long enough, you

              22  learn to verify things, so I called our

              23  internal Police Department and said, can you

              24  verify if this actually did occur.

              25          Q.   Uh-huh.



                                                               79


               1          A.   And so that -- I don't remember

               2  who specifically in the Police Department.

               3          Q.   Did you -- did you think that the

               4  arrest of Dr. Holland seemed at all suspicious

               5  to you, just right before you're about to open

               6  up the St. Anne's program, that could

               7  potentially take cases away from St. Vincent?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   You think that was unusual?

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   If you accept the fact that I

              12  told you that the person is -- strike that.

              13             Now --

              14          A.   I want to clarify one other

              15  thing.

              16          Q.   Okay.

              17          A.   The program was already open.

              18  The pro -- we did the first heart in October

              19  of '14, and I believe the arrest was in --

              20          Q.   September.

              21          A.   September of '14?

              22          Q.   Yes.

              23          A.   Okay.  So all right.

              24          Q.   Do you recall any discussions

              25  with Mr. -- Dr. Andrabi or Mr. Arquilla about



                                                               80


               1  the arrest?

               2          A.   Yes, vague recollections, but I

               3  think I notified them, after I learned about

               4  it, and validated it with our internal police.

               5          Q.   You don't recall the contents of

               6  that report as you sit here today, correct?

               7          A.   Here's what I remember about it.

               8  There was some dispute about the music.  The

               9  neighbor was concerned, because Dr. Holland

              10  seemed to be going out of the way to agitate

              11  them.  I believe there was some reference to

              12  Dr. Holland and his wife were arguing, and

              13  that had them concerned about it as well.  She

              14  felt the wife was kind of saying, well, hey,

              15  why don't you just turn down the music, is

              16  this really worth it.  I think the police came

              17  a couple of different times.  Ultimately ended

              18  in his arrest, and at one -- there was an

              19  accusation that, from the neighbor, that

              20  tomatoes were thrown into -- from -- I don't

              21  know his yard into their yard, or their

              22  driveway, or whatever.

              23             You know, from my standpoint, and I

              24  think even when -- I also let Dr. Nahhas know,

              25  because it's his --



                                                               81


               1          Q.   Uh-huh.

               2          A.   -- employer, in essence, there

               3  were two things that bothered me about the

               4  incident is, number one, who gets in an

               5  argument with their neighbor to the -- to the

               6  point where you get arrested?  But -- and then

               7  number two, when I asked about the tomatoes, I

               8  think he said, I don't remember.  Now, this is

               9  two days ago.  So you know, I only draw --

              10  either he does remember, and he doesn't want

              11  to tell me he remembers, or he was so hammered

              12  he threw tomatoes and didn't remember, so --

              13  and I think that was, you know, for Dr.

              14  Nahhas, I know, because I don't think

              15  Dr. Nahhas is the type of person that would

              16  get involved with this type of situation.  I

              17  think those -- those were the things that were

              18  most concerning about it.

              19             And I, you know, I think -- I think

              20  there was some fairly terse exchanges with the

              21  police as well, if I recall.

              22          Q.   Now, did you ever go to

              23  Dr. Holland's house?

              24          A.   I have only driven by.

              25          Q.   Did you ever look -- did you ever



                                                               82


               1  see in his backyard, whether what was

               2  described as him supposedly throwing tomatoes

               3  from his backyard, whether or not it would

               4  even be, from a physics perspective, even

               5  possible for a human being to throw tomatoes

               6  from his backyard into the pool of the

               7  neighbor?

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you really

              10  think that would even be physically possible?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Speculation.

              12          A.   I -- I have no knowledge of

              13  whether that's possible.

              14          Q.   Okay.

              15          A.   They don't look that far apart

              16  from the road, but ....

              17          Q.   Do you recall being provided STS

              18  data from -- by Dr. Holland at any point in

              19  time?

              20          A.   He might have sent me STS data.

              21  I think we look at it from time to time.  And

              22  more so at St. Anne's, since I'm at

              23  St. Anne's.

              24          Q.   Now, after -- did Dr. Holland --

              25  strike that.



                                                               83


               1             Do you recall -- strike that.

               2             When do you recall the first heart

               3  being performed at St. Anne's, first open

               4  heart surgery?

               5          A.   I believe it was October of 2014.

               6          Q.   Hold on one second, please.

               7             Do you recall ever receiving any --

               8  let's go back and mark this.  What is the next

               9  one?  136.

              10          A.   This is 136?

              11          Q.   Yes.

              12          A.   Okay.

              13             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 136

              14  was marked for identification.)

              15          Q.   Let me know when you have had a

              16  chance to review this.

              17          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              18          Q.   And you see that you indicate to

              19  Mr. Arquilla, on or about September 29th,

              20  2014, that you had never seen -- I never --

              21  strike that.

              22             On or about September 29, 2014, you

              23  wrote to Mr. Arquilla, "I never saw this info

              24  presented this way before".  Do you see that?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               84


               1          Q.   And you see that you were being

               2  presented what appears to be stats through,

               3  for 2014 through June; is that right?

               4          A.   Stats through June, okay.

               5          Q.   And --

               6          A.   I mean, there is -- I don't know

               7  what was sent, but ....

               8          Q.   Okay.  That's what I was going to

               9  ask.  Well, here at attachments, it says M & M

              10  conference second quarter 2014 PowerPoint.

              11             Do you see that?

              12          A.   Here at -- oh, on the attachments

              13  at the --

              14          Q.   Yeah.  At the very top of your

              15  email.

              16          A.   Oh, it's the -- oh, okay.  Yeah.

              17          Q.   Says M & M Conference Second

              18  Quarter 2014 PPTX.

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   So that appears that you were

              21  sent an M & M conference PowerPoint.  Do you

              22  recall that?

              23          A.   Appears that it was sent, yeah.

              24          Q.   You don't recall -- do you recall

              25  ever getting M & M conference PowerPoints,



                                                               85


               1  other than this one?

               2          A.   I might have.  I don't -- I don't

               3  recall that.

               4          Q.   And --

               5          A.   And -- and to the extent this is

               6  probably St. Vincent's, which is why I just

               7  referred it on to Tom.

               8          Q.   Do you recall becoming involved

               9  in any way with any issues about Ms. Sheroian

              10  complaining, in or about November 2014, that

              11  Dr. Holland was difficult to communicate with?

              12          A.   Most of what I got was through

              13  Dr. Holland, and I think Dr. Holland did

              14  communicate there were, yeah, that Elizabeth

              15  had -- had told that, or said that about him.

              16          Q.   Do you recall getting involved in

              17  that matter in any way?

              18          A.   Not really.

              19          Q.   Did you have anything

              20  communicated to you at St. Anne's that

              21  Dr. Holland was diff -- strike that.

              22             Did the cardiologists at St. Anne's

              23  ever indicate to you Dr. Holland was difficult

              24  to get in touch with at St. Anne's?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               86


               1          Q.   Did anyone at St. Anne's ever

               2  claim Dr. Holland would fail to appear for

               3  surgeries?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Did you ever hear from anyone at

               6  St. Anne's that he was refusing surgical

               7  procedures?

               8          A.   No.  I mean, there might have

               9  been an occasional clinical disagreement, but

              10  it was not a trend.

              11          Q.   Do you recall -- do you recall

              12  talking to Dr. Holland about his complaints

              13  that he had, that he had complaints about

              14  Elizabeth Sheroian, who was the office manager

              15  of his practice group?

              16          A.   Yeah.  Dr. Holland would talk to

              17  me about frustrations with Elizabeth.  I

              18  didn't -- I had no knowledge or real

              19  jurisdiction over it, so it was maybe more as

              20  a counseling session, as opposed to anything I

              21  would really be able to do.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Hold on one second.

              23             Were you ever advised that

              24  Dr. Hashmi told Elizabeth Sheroian to begin

              25  documenting matters on Dr. Holland?



                                                               87


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               2  foundation.

               3          A.   I believe Dr. Holland may have

               4  told me that, but I don't -- Doctor -- I never

               5  got it through any other source.

               6          Q.   Do you recall ever having any, or

               7  being told, in or about either late 2014 or

               8  early 2015, that anybody was trying to get rid

               9  of Dr. Holland?

              10          A.   In late 2000 -- that's kind of --

              11          Q.   Late 2014, which is right after

              12  the St. Anne's program opened.

              13          A.   Okay.

              14          Q.   Into early 2015.  Do you recall

              15  any discussions in that time period about

              16  anybody discussing "getting rid of or

              17  terminating Dr. Holland"?

              18          A.   I -- I think, you know, there was

              19  -- there was always kind of a review on him,

              20  given the pattern of things that we're seeing

              21  at St. Vincent's.  I think one of the other

              22  things that I -- that I didn't mention was

              23  that there was also concern, after the

              24  patients were discharged, about whether he was

              25  seeing them in the office or not.  And that



                                                               88


               1  came up through several of the cardiologists,

               2  so I mean, based on some of these things that

               3  were being seen, I would say it was -- it was

               4  on a short rope type of situation.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Well, let's go back a

               6  second.  Where -- where, if anywhere, does any

               7  documentation from you, and any other person,

               8  anywhere, exist about this "short rope

               9  situation"?

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              11  foundation.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) There isn't

              13  any, right?

              14          A.   If you had -- if you had it -- if

              15  we had it, you have it.

              16          Q.   Well, you said if you had it.

              17  You never had any, because you never had any

              18  documentation?

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              20  argumentation.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Correct?

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Argumentative.

              23          A.   There is nothing written, but

              24  there were conversations.

              25          Q.   Conversations with -- now, you



                                                               89


               1  say cardiologists.  Which cardiologists said

               2  he wasn't seeing patients?  Give me the names,

               3  please?

               4          A.   It was all secondhand.  I didn't

               5  have direct knowledge.

               6          Q.   Okay.  So these, always a review

               7  of Dr. Holland, who would be involved in these

               8  conversations that were, you know, that we're

               9  doing the "always reviews of Dr. Holland",

              10  would be involved, other than yourself?

              11          A.   It would be everybody that would

              12  be a stakeholder in it.

              13          Q.   Okay.  Please give me the names.

              14          A.   Cardiologists.

              15          Q.   What are their names?

              16          A.   Some of the Toledo Clinic

              17  doctors.  I already went through those.

              18          Q.   No.  I need the names of the

              19  people that were involved in the conversations

              20  with you about the short rope conversations

              21  with Dr. Holland.  I need to know the names.

              22  So if you can give me the names, please.

              23          A.   Greg Hood.

              24          Q.   Okay.

              25          A.   Tom.



                                                               90


               1          Q.   Tom Arquilla?

               2          A.   Yeah.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Anyone else you can think

               4  of?

               5          A.   From time to time, certain

               6  doctors would be involved, Nahhas, maybe

               7  Kabour.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Anyone else you can think

               9  of?

              10          A.   Maybe Dr. Hashmi.

              11          Q.   Were you ever advised in or about

              12  January of 2015 that Dr. Hashmi began to

              13  inquire about his w -- his RVU bonus?

              14          A.   I didn't have any direct

              15  knowledge of that.  He might have, but I don't

              16  -- I don't recall a lot with it.

              17          Q.   Did you know whether or not

              18  Dr. Hashmi had an economic incentive to have

              19  cases referred to him, because of his RVU

              20  contract?

              21          A.   I have no knowledge of his

              22  specific contract, but it's not unusual, in

              23  physician contracts, to have some incentive

              24  relative to work performed.

              25          Q.   Can you turn to Exhibit 65,



                                                               91


               1  please?

               2          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

               3          Q.   Before we go to -- you can turn

               4  to 65, but I have some questions before you

               5  turn.

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   Just go ahead and turn for me.

               8             Were you involved at all in the

               9  recruitment of Dr. Phillips?

              10          A.   Was I involved with the

              11  recruitment of Dr. Phillips?

              12          Q.   Yes.

              13          A.   Yeah.

              14          Q.   What type of relationship did you

              15  -- do you have with Christopher Phillips?

              16          A.   Um, fair.

              17          Q.   Did you have a better or worse

              18  relationship with Dr. Phillips that you had

              19  with Dr. Holland?

              20          A.   About the same.  Maybe a little

              21  bit better with Dr. Holland, only because

              22  Dr. Holland was so much at St. Anne's, and I

              23  saw him so much more frequently than I saw,

              24  then I see Dr. Phillips.

              25          Q.   In terms of Dr. Phillips, are



                                                               92


               1  there criticisms of Dr. Phillips' personality?

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   And what type of criticisms are

               4  there of Dr. Phillips' personality?

               5          A.   I would say the primary one, and

               6  this is when he initially started, he wanted

               7  to kind of change everything, and was a little

               8  bit, you know, too aggressive with his ideas.

               9  But I think, you know, with coaching and all

              10  that, he -- he did modify his behavior to be

              11  more diplomatic.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Well, we'll come and

              13  sequence that.  But is he -- you have -- find

              14  personality flaws with Dr. Phillips too?

              15          A.   Personality flaws, not -- not

              16  necessarily.

              17          Q.   Why did you seem to have a better

              18  relationship with Dr. Holland than you did

              19  Dr. Phillips?  Just because you saw him more,

              20  and you were around him more, or --

              21          A.   Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.

              22          Q.   Did it help to be around

              23  Dr. Holland to, in terms of your relationship

              24  with him?

              25          A.   Did it help to be around him?



                                                               93


               1          Q.   Yeah.

               2          A.   Yeah, I felt it did.

               3          Q.   Okay.

               4          A.   I mean, you know, familiarity is

               5  always good, I think.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Did you feel like you had

               7  difficulty managing Dr. Holland personally,

               8  when you were involved?

               9          A.   At times, yes.

              10          Q.   Okay.  And what -- what was it

              11  that -- what was the difficulty for you?

              12          A.   The biggest issue seemed to be

              13  with his relationship with the staff, and them

              14  feeling intimidated, not respected, you know,

              15  short on phone calls, sometimes, you know,

              16  being berated.

              17             And I'll just give you an example

              18  of something where, you know, you asked about

              19  working with him.  I remember at one time we

              20  -- but, to me, he was always very

              21  complimentary of the staff, so I've got this

              22  kind of issue with the staff feeling like he

              23  makes them feel incompetent, and I've got him

              24  saying positive things to me.  So I remember

              25  Barb Martin and I sat with him, and I don't



                                                               94


               1  remember -- I don't think it was specifically

               2  on this matter, but it was -- at the end of

               3  it, we mentioned, you know, if -- if you feel

               4  -- you're very complimentary of the staff to

               5  us, but they don't feel that.  And if, you

               6  know, that's the way you feel, you know, in

               7  order to make them more confident in their

               8  jobs, and you know, these people are hard to

               9  find too, they're not going to stay in an

              10  environment where they feel intimidated.  You

              11  know, why don't you try.

              12             Somehow, that totally backfired on

              13  us.  I think he went onto the unit and told

              14  the nurses if -- maybe I ought to just do all

              15  my hearts at V's, which is like how did we go

              16  from that, which I thought was a fairly

              17  nonintimidating coaching session, to going on

              18  the unit and telling the nurses, maybe I just

              19  need to take all my cases to V's.

              20             And I remember talking with Barb

              21  afterwards saying, you know, I don't -- I

              22  don't know how we could have been anymore kids

              23  glove on that.

              24          Q.   Hmm.

              25          A.   So what I found with Dr. Holland



                                                               95


               1  is if you were going to challenge him on

               2  something, it became like a scorch dearth

               3  (phonetic), you know, I'm going to -- who can

               4  I throw under the bus?  So you know, I just

               5  learned to try to approach him with -- but you

               6  know, when things were good, they were good.

               7  But if -- if there were issues of contention

               8  that came up, I needed to be real delicate

               9  with it.

              10          Q.   So Dr. Holland, you knew, was

              11  demanding of staff, correct?  He was?

              12          A.   Sure.

              13          Q.   Lives were on the line when

              14  Dr. Holland was involved, correct?

              15          A.   Exactly.  Uh-huh.

              16          Q.   Did you feel that he was trying

              17  to build a quality program for you at

              18  St. Anne's?

              19          A.   Yeah.

              20          Q.   And in fact, the cardiologists

              21  were happy with the quality of the program,

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   Okay.  And so did you hear

              25  complaints from nurses --



                                                               96


               1          A.   Well, let me say that --

               2          Q.   Strike that.

               3          A.   -- the one -- the -- the Toledo

               4  Clinic cardiologists were happy with him.

               5          Q.   Well, we know about --

               6          A.   The others didn't really have

               7  experience.

               8          Q.   We know about Doctor -- we talked

               9  a little bit about Kabour's group.

              10          A.   Okay.

              11          Q.   We'll talk more about it later,

              12  if you want.

              13             In terms of nurses, though, did --

              14  do you know of nurses that had positive

              15  relationships with Dr. Holland and liked

              16  working for him?  And with him?

              17          A.   I think they made it work.

              18          Q.   You think they what?

              19          A.   I think they made it work, but I

              20  don't know if --

              21          Q.   Did you see -- did you, in this

              22  case, have you ever been shown photographs

              23  that Dr. Holland's being sent from nurses to

              24  his phone, smiling, wanting him to come back?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               97


               1          Q.   There was recently a strike at

               2  some of the Mercy hospitals.  Did that affect

               3  St. Anne's?

               4          A.   Yeah.  We had -- yes, it did.  We

               5  did not have a strike at St. Anne's, but we

               6  got impacted operationally a little bit,

               7  because V's cancelled some of its elective

               8  cases.  And you know, because they were having

               9  people -- essentially they were staffing with

              10  agency, the doctors moved some of their

              11  elective cases to St. Anne's.

              12          Q.   Okay.

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  I'll object to any

              14  line of questioning about the strike as

              15  irrelevant.

              16             MR. ARCHINACO:  Do you have the

              17  exhibits from yesterday, by any chance?

              18             THE REPORTER:  I do.

              19             MR. ARCHINACO:  Okay.  We'll just

              20  take a minute for you to find those color

              21  photographs of the nurses.  That black and

              22  white photo -- we can go back on one second,

              23  while you look.  If we can just go back on, I

              24  just want to tell him.

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) I have black



                                                               98


               1  and white photos of some nurses that are going

               2  to be harder to see the faces, so --

               3          A.   Okay.

               4          Q.   -- I'm asking the court reporter

               5  to find the color ones to show you.

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

               8             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Are we going off

               9  record?

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Yeah.  Let's go off

              11  for a minute or two, okay?

              12             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off

              13  record.

              14             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              15  11:52 until 11:54.)

              16             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right.

              17  We're back on record.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) I'll provide

              19  you first Exhibit 124.  There are three nurses

              20  in that photograph.

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  We object --

              22          A.   Okay.

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  -- earlier.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you know

              25  who they are?



                                                               99


               1          A.   Yeah, not -- not by name, but

               2  they're nurses on the cardiovascular unit.

               3          Q.   Are those the senior nurses on

               4  your cardiovascular unit at St. Anne's?

               5          A.   I'm not sure the one on the left,

               6  but the middle one and -- and Abbey certainly

               7  are.

               8          Q.   At least in that photo they're

               9  all smiling --

              10          A.   They are smiling.

              11          Q.   -- for Dr. Holland?

              12          A.   Yeah.

              13          Q.   Okay.

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  We object based on

              15  form and foundation again.

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Send us a

              17  picture, so we can see that face we miss so

              18  much.

              19          A.   (Witness nods head.)

              20          Q.   They, at least, I mean, at least

              21  from this text, they at least seem to be --

              22  they seem, from the text, to like Dr. Holland?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection, form,

              24  foundation and incomplete.

              25          A.   Yeah, I mean, I have no idea what



                                                               100


               1  they're thinking.

               2          Q.   All right.  I'll give you three

               3  more.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   I don't know if you know -- this

               6  one is a little harder to see.  It's a little

               7  smaller.

               8          A.   These are three people, yeah,

               9  that I recognize them from --

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  What picture are we

              11  referring to?

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  I'm sorry, 125, I

              13  believe it is.

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  And you can have

              16  the same objections to these exhibits,

              17  Mr. Wiencek.  They're preserved.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Do you know

              19  those nurses?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Who are those nurses?

              22          A.   I don't know them by name, but

              23  they're in the operating room.

              24          Q.   They're at St. Anne's?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               101


               1          Q.   Okay.  This one is a little more

               2  funnier.  This is from New Year's.  This is

               3  126.  That's more -- I think that's New

               4  Year's, so some alcohol in that photo.

               5             Do you know those three nurses?

               6          A.   These are not -- the woman on the

               7  left looks familiar, but the other two, at

               8  least I don't recognize.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And the woman on the

              10  right, do you know who she's giving the middle

              11  finger to?

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And now, in terms of

              14  St. Anne's itself, the nurses weren't on

              15  strike, correct?

              16          A.   Correct.

              17          Q.   Now, that in fact is

              18  St. Vincent's though, correct?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   Now, were you aware, from any

              21  media reports or photographs, that some of the

              22  nurses that were striking were wearing masks?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              24  foundation.

              25          A.   No, I wasn't aware of that.



                                                               102


               1          Q.   Okay.  And were you -- were you

               2  ever made aware that some of the nurses that

               3  were striking at St. Vincent's were holding

               4  signs that said, patients over profits?

               5          A.   Yeah, I saw that on the news.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Exhibit 54, just -- this

               7  is a -- you're not carbon copied on this, just

               8  so you're aware.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   54 is a memo?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  54 or 65?

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Exhibit 54

              13  we're using right now.

              14          A.   Okay.

              15          Q.   And then if you turn to the next

              16  page, there is three communication issues that

              17  are documented here.

              18             I'm -- I want to ask you about the

              19  third one, November 5, 2014, left ventricle

              20  thrombosis.  Do you see that noted there, left

              21  ventricle thrombosis?

              22          A.   St. Anne's -- yep.

              23          Q.   Okay.  I just want to ask you

              24  about a left ventricle thrombosis for a

              25  moment.  Do you know what that is generally?



                                                               103


               1          A.   It's a blood clot.  A thrombus --

               2          Q.   Okay.

               3          A.   -- well, I'm not clinical.  I'm

               4  not going to go there, but ....

               5          Q.   Okay.  Now, do you know how a

               6  left ventricle thrombosis is ordinarily

               7  treated?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   Were you ever made aware that,

              10  maybe 20 years ago, the procedure was to

              11  conduct surgery on the person?

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              13  foundation.

              14          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Anything along

              15  those lines?

              16          A.   No.

              17          Q.   Okay.  I'm just trying to jog

              18  your memory, if you know any of this.  Or

              19  whether or not, for example, that because of

              20  side -- side effects from those type of

              21  surgeries, where clots would become -- they

              22  would try to clean the clot out, and the clot

              23  would break free and cause strokes, that as a

              24  result of that, the standard switched from

              25  doing surgery to using anticoagulants over an



                                                               104


               1  extended period of time to break the clot up?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

               3  foundation, narrative.

               4          A.   You're stating facts of which I

               5  have no knowledge of, so yeah.

               6          Q.   Sir, it's okay.  I'm -- it's all

               7  right if you don't, or do.  I'm trying to get

               8  your state of knowledge here.  Because this is

               9  a matter, do you recall being involved in a

              10  matter with Ms. Sheroian raised issues, about

              11  communications issues with Dr. Holland,

              12  generally?

              13          A.   Like I said, I recall that

              14  Dr. Holland had mentioned that Elizabeth was,

              15  you know, the group, Elizabeth, Dr. Hashmi,

              16  had concerns regarding -- did you say

              17  communication?

              18          Q.   Yes.

              19          A.   Yeah, communication or

              20  availability, so....

              21          Q.   Now, just to be clear, at no

              22  point in time you got the impression that

              23  Dr. Holland was attempting to create or

              24  generate some type of Medicare fraud suit, so

              25  that he could go after the hospital, catching



                                                               105


               1  people doing dishonest things, right?  You

               2  never got that impression from him, correct?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Now, were you ever made

               5  aware, or strike that.

               6             Ms. Sheroian testified yesterday

               7  and indicated that she was aware that

               8  Dr. Hashmi treated left ventricle thrombosis

               9  with surgery.

              10             Were you ever made aware that doing

              11  so was not the proper standard of care any

              12  longer?

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              14  foundation.

              15          A.   I have no knowledge of --

              16          Q.   Okay.

              17          A.   -- left thrombosis, left

              18  ventricle thrombosis --

              19          Q.   Okay.

              20          A.   -- treatment.

              21          Q.   Just to be clear about the

              22  communication issues for a second.  You

              23  weren't made aware, through any source, for

              24  example, that Ms. Sheroian was complaining

              25  that Dr. Holland should have seen a patient



                                                               106


               1  emergently about a left ventricle thrombosis,

               2  when that is not normally surgically treated,

               3  but instead it's treated with clots, but

               4  Ms. Sheroian apparently didn't know that, or

               5  realize that, because she had seen the way

               6  Hashmi had been doing it all those years?

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative

               8  and foundation.

               9          A.   Could you simply the question for

              10  me, because there is so many layers to that?

              11          Q.   Let me try.  Yeah.  I guess the

              12  bottom line is is that, were you ever made

              13  aware that Ms. Sheroian got the medicine

              14  wrong, started making complaints about what

              15  should be done about surgeries, did you ever

              16  hear anything like that?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              18  foundation.

              19          A.   No.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall any

              21  discussion, when Dr. Phillips was being

              22  recruited, that he was being brought in to

              23  replace Dr. Holland?

              24          A.   Holland?

              25          Q.   Yes.



                                                               107


               1          A.   No.  I believe at the time we had

               2  a vacancy.  My understanding was, I've got to

               3  think back in time, but I think Burdine was

               4  gone, so it was, you know, we were looking for

               5  a third.

               6          Q.   Burdine was either sick or

               7  transitioning out --

               8          A.   Okay.

               9          Q.   -- or gone, I think, during that

              10  time period.  That would jive with your

              11  recollection?

              12          A.   Yeah.

              13          Q.   Where he was basically transfer

              14  -- transitioning out, due to health concerns

              15  or --

              16          A.   He was -- yeah.

              17          Q.   -- Hashmi was going to go?

              18          A.   He was pretty sick.  Yeah, he was

              19  pretty sick, and there was discussions of

              20  Dr. Hashmi potentially retiring.

              21          Q.   Okay.  If you can go to

              22  Exhibit 65.

              23          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              24          Q.   And this is a, just some type of

              25  messaging between Ms. Sheroian and



                                                               108


               1  Ms. Collins, where Ms. Sheroian states,

               2  Danielle, do not mention us replacing

               3  Dr. Holland.  We do not want that to be heard

               4  or get out.

               5             Do you see that?

               6          A.   Yeah.

               7          Q.   Okay.  So you didn't know of any

               8  plan to use Dr. Phillips, in or about February

               9  of 2015, to replace Dr. Holland, correct?

              10          A.   Like I said, I think -- my

              11  recollection with Phillips, at least, was that

              12  we had a -- we wanted -- he was replacing

              13  Burdine.

              14          Q.   Okay.

              15          A.   And I just, for the record, I

              16  don't know who Danielle Collins is either, so

              17  ... but ....

              18          Q.   You may not.

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   You may not.

              21             Exhibit 66, which is the next one

              22  I'll let you look at briefly.  February 20,

              23  2015, Ms. Sheroian to Fayyaz Hashmi.  You see

              24  that at the top?

              25          A.   Okay.



                                                               109


               1          Q.   Thank you for the heads up.  Who

               2  is to officially inform Dr. Holland of his

               3  release?

               4             Do you see that?

               5          A.   Yeah.

               6          Q.   You were not involved in

               7  discussions at this time period with

               8  Fayyaz Hashmi about releasing Dr. Holland,

               9  correct?

              10          A.   Like I said, I think there was

              11  kind of always an evaluation of whether that

              12  was the right fit, but none of this sounds

              13  familiar to me.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall being told,

              15  at a point in time, that -- any point in time

              16  -- that Mr. Carruthers, Adam Carruthers,

              17  wanted to work full-time with Dr. Holland at

              18  St. Anne's?

              19          A.   I don't recall that specifically.

              20  What I -- what I -- there always seemed to be

              21  a scheduling issue, we're trying to get Adam

              22  for the cases that the doctors wanted him in.

              23  But I don't remember him specifically saying

              24  he wanted to go one place versus the other, or

              25  work for one doctor exclusively, no.



                                                               110


               1          Q.   Just give me one second.  I'm

               2  sorry, sir.

               3          A.   Sure.

               4          Q.   I'm just trying to locate some

               5  documents and see if ....

               6             This is Exhibit 137.

               7          A.   137.  This is new?

               8          Q.   This is a new one, yes.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 137

              11  was marked for identification.)

              12          A.   Do you want me -- should I be

              13  reading this?

              14          Q.   Yeah, please do.

              15          A.   Okay.

              16          Q.   It's a little bit longer chain.

              17  I try to let you have an opportunity to read

              18  it.  So just let me know --

              19          A.   Let me start from the beginning.

              20          Q.   Okay.

              21          A.   Oh, wow.  Okay.

              22          Q.   It's -- it's kind of long.

              23          A.   All right.

              24          Q.   We've been doing pretty well not

              25  giving you too much to read, but ....



                                                               111


               1          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Good.

               2          Q.   Okay.  This is a chain that

               3  included you towards the top, and you advised

               4  Dr. Holland, I don't think this is a good way

               5  to handle this.

               6             Correct?

               7          A.   Yeah.

               8          Q.   And then at the top, it appears

               9  that after that, Dr. Holland writes to you,

              10  thank you for your guidance today.  I

              11  understand and it is much appreciated.  Okay.

              12             You see that?

              13          A.   Uh-huh.

              14          Q.   Yes?

              15          A.   Yeah.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall having a

              17  meeting with Dr. Holland, in which you gave

              18  him guidance about how to handle this

              19  situation with Dr. Hashmi and --

              20          A.   I -- I remember meeting with

              21  Dr. Holland and -- and this particular issue,

              22  circumstance being discussed with him.

              23          Q.   All right.  Well, do you recall

              24  basically Dr. Holland being quite upset over

              25  this, what he -- this situation with



                                                               112


               1  Dr. Hashmi, where Dr. Hashmi saw him in the

               2  hall, waved at him, and then pretended like he

               3  didn't know where Dr. Holland was?

               4          A.   I pretty much -- I remember him

               5  kind of recanting this situation --

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7          A.   -- as he describes it.

               8          Q.   Yeah.  And so basically what

               9  Dr. Holland did here, in this email -- you

              10  don't have to go through every fact, but what

              11  he tried to do in this email was give you

              12  specific facts about where he was, when he

              13  was, including, you know, where he saw

              14  Dr. Hashmi.  Correct?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative.

              16          A.   I mean, he's telling what he

              17  recalls of the situation, yes.

              18          Q.   Okay.

              19          A.   He's not sending it to me,

              20  though.  He's sending it to Jayne Beckstead.

              21          Q.   Well, it went up -- on his

              22  initial --

              23          A.   And then he sent it to Randy and

              24  me.

              25          Q.   Okay.  Well, it went to



                                                               113


               1  Dr. Nahhas, who appeared to tell him to, you,

               2  one of the people, that it should be shared

               3  with potentially.

               4          A.   Uh-huh.

               5          Q.   Correct?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   And it looks like, if you see

               8  November 10, 2014, Mr. Dixon, Randy Dixon,

               9  whose offices we're in today.

              10          A.   Uh-huh.

              11          Q.   Do you know why he was carbon

              12  copied on this communication?

              13          A.   I could guess, but I don't really

              14  know why.

              15          Q.   I don't want you to guess.

              16             So did you get the impression from

              17  Dr. Holland that this episode that he had with

              18  Dr. Hashmi was basically him informing you,

              19  words to the effect, that he was being set up

              20  to make it look like he was unavailable, when

              21  he really was?

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              23  foundation.

              24          A.   Can you unpack that a little bit

              25  for me?



                                                               114


               1          Q.   Yeah.  Like, for example, in

               2  Dr. Holland's email, he notes how he failed to

               3  state, he, Dr. Hashmi, failed to state that he

               4  walked within two feet of me, and that

               5  Dr. Holland did acknowledge Dr. Hashmi with

               6  the wave of his hand.  And Hashmi didn't make

               7  any attempt to communicate that Dr. Holland

               8  was paged, even though Dr. Hashmi claimed that

               9  he overheard a page for Holland.

              10          A.   Yeah.  I remember he also

              11  verbally told me that.

              12          Q.   All right.

              13          A.   That --

              14          Q.   Now --

              15          A.   -- version of the story.  I don't

              16  know if it's accurate or not, but ....

              17          Q.   Did you -- have you been informed

              18  that on the -- the conversation, the dinner

              19  conversation between Dr. Phillips, Dr. Nahhas,

              20  and Jamie Holland that was -- was lawfully

              21  recorded.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to

              23  mischaracterization.

              24             MR. ARCHINACO:  No, it's not.

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) That during



                                                               115


               1  that conversation, Dr. Nahhas told

               2  Dr. Phillips and Holland, that he had received

               3  complaints from Dr. Brunsting about his

               4  inability to obtain referrals?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               6  foundation.

               7          A.   Yeah.  I don't -- I don't really

               8  even know anything about Dr. Brunsting,

               9  so ....

              10          Q.   Okay.  Did you learn that during

              11  that dinner conversation, Dr. Nahhas conveyed

              12  to Dr. Phillips and Dr. Holland, that

              13  Brunsting believed he, or words to the effect,

              14  that he couldn't get referrals, because Hashmi

              15  was very controlling behind the scenes, it was

              16  like he had a mafia in place?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative,

              18  foundation.

              19          A.   I never heard the term mafia or

              20  any of that involved with it.

              21          Q.   Okay.

              22          A.   But I -- I have heard Nahhas say

              23  that.  I don't know where he got it from, but

              24  I've heard Nahhas say that.

              25          Q.   Okay.



                                                               116


               1          A.   And I like Dr. Nahhas, but

               2  sometimes I'll find -- and I have a lot of

               3  respect for him -- but sometimes I find he --

               4  he -- he wants to believe people, as we all

               5  do, but sometimes he'll take what is said as

               6  the Bible, and it may or may not be.

               7          Q.   Do you have some reason to think

               8  that he would make up a conversation that he

               9  had had with Dr. Brunsting?

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   Do you know John Starcher?

              12          A.   Yep.

              13          Q.   How do you know Mr. Starcher?

              14          A.   He's the president of, and CEO,

              15  of Bon Secours Mercy Health.

              16          Q.   Have you ever had any

              17  communications or discussions with him about

              18  this matter?

              19          A.   No.

              20          Q.   Were you ever made aware that --

              21          A.   In fact, I sat across from him

              22  for two days yesterday, Tuesday and Wednesday,

              23  and never once came up.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Did he ever tell you that

              25  he wrote an email to Dr. Brunsting's employer?



                                                               117


               1          A.   Eh-heh.

               2          Q.   Never told you that?

               3          A.   No.  We -- I might see and talk

               4  to John Starcher once every year or two.

               5          Q.   We have subpoenaed him for a

               6  deposition.  There might be a fight over that,

               7  but maybe I'll get to meet him sometime.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  There won't be, so

               9  you'll be getting my letter today.

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Yeah, sure.  We'll

              11  take it up with the Court.

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Yes, sir.

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  Looking forward to

              14  it, since he put his head in this matter.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You were not

              16  aware of Mr. Starcher reached into this matter

              17  with an email to Mr. -- Dr. Brunsting's --

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   -- inquiry?  Okay.

              20             Have you been communicating with

              21  any third parties trying to obtain dirt, or

              22  bad information, on Dr. Holland in connection

              23  with this case?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   Okay.



                                                               118


               1          A.   Not that I recall.

               2          Q.   All right.  At least in the email

               3  I put before you in Exhibit 137, Dr. Holland

               4  is telling you that he appreciated, or thanked

               5  you and appreciated your guidance, correct?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Now, you were aware that

               8  -- were you aware that Dr. Holland would

               9  compliment staff and had done so in writing

              10  from time to time?

              11          A.   No, not -- I should say I have

              12  never -- I have heard him, from time to time,

              13  compliment staff, yes.  I don't -- I don't

              14  know of anything in writing.

              15          Q.   Okay.  If it's not something

              16  carbon copied to you, I'll probably just move

              17  on, so we can just cut through the material.

              18  We won't --

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   Now, I would like to show you,

              21  next exhibit, this is a new one.  This is

              22  going to be 138.  Mr. Wiencek.

              23             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 138

              24  was marked for identification.)

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And just to be



                                                               119


               1  clear, I'll have you flip, so you can see you

               2  did not sign this, but I want to show you

               3  that.

               4          A.   Uh-huh.

               5          Q.   This is a document --

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   Just to represent to you what I

               8  understand this to be.  I understand this to

               9  document to be, based on its front page, a

              10  physician employment agreement between Mercy

              11  Health Physicians North, LLC, which at the

              12  top, and Fayyaz Hashmi, which would take

              13  effect on May 1, 2017 and run to April 30 of

              14  2018.  So you see that term on the front page?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   Okay.  And then if you turn to

              17  page 28330, that's the page where the

              18  signature page is.

              19          A.   28330.  Okay.

              20          Q.   Yes.

              21          A.   All right.

              22          Q.   Okay.  And then you'll see that

              23  originally this signature appears to have been

              24  for Bob Baxter, President.  Do you see that?

              25          A.   Yeah.



                                                               120


               1          Q.   And it's crossed out, and Todd

               2  Warner, the COO, signs it instead, correct?

               3          A.   Correct.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Now, was Bob Baxter, to

               5  your knowledge, the president in or about

               6  2017?

               7          A.   I don't know.  He became the

               8  president whenever -- he became the president

               9  of the region and CEO whenever Andrabi left,

              10  so I don't -- I don't know the dates on that.

              11          Q.   Okay.  But -- and I'm -- that's

              12  fair enough.  But you see how here, all there

              13  is is a cross-out --

              14          A.   Uh-huh.

              15          Q.   -- and someone else's name with

              16  authority to sign it, apparently, signs the

              17  contract to execute it, correct?

              18          A.   Todd Warner signs the contract.

              19          Q.   Okay.  In your practice, from

              20  what you have seen in your role as a

              21  president, have you ever seen anything

              22  improper about someone crossing a name out and

              23  executing a contract like this?  Anything

              24  improper that you think about this?

              25          A.   No.  That doesn't appear to be



                                                               121


               1  improper to me.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

               3             Now, I want --

               4          A.   If -- if indeed Todd had signing

               5  authority for this type of arrangement.

               6          Q.   Fair enough.

               7             Now, do you recall -- put a time

               8  frame in -- in place.  Dr. Phillips arrives in

               9  or about May of 2015.

              10          A.   Dr. Holland?

              11          Q.   Dr. Phillips.

              12          A.   Oh, Dr. Phillips.

              13          Q.   In about May of 2015.

              14          A.   Okay.

              15          Q.   We were walking through the

              16  timeline we walked through.  And you have

              17  indicated that upon his presentation, he was

              18  wanting to change things, and a number of

              19  other things you've already testified about

              20  today --

              21          A.   Yeah.

              22          Q.   -- correct?

              23             Now, did you have an understanding

              24  that upon him coming in, that he was going to

              25  become the medical director?



                                                               122


               1          A.   Yeah, that was my understanding.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And if you can turn to

               3  Exhibit 70, that will give you --

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   -- you can keep that to the side.

               6  We'll use that again later.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   138 --

               9          A.   70?

              10          Q.   -- so keep it to the side.  Yes,

              11  Exhibit 70.

              12          A.   Okay.

              13          Q.   And this is August, after

              14  Dr. Phillips comes in, he sends this email

              15  around, and you're not carbon copied on it,

              16  correct?

              17          A.   Correct.

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  We'll object to

              19  foundation.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And he --

              21  there is STS report for 2015 quarter one.  Do

              22  you see that?

              23          A.   As the subject?

              24          Q.   Yes.

              25          A.   Yeah.



                                                               123


               1          Q.   And he's thanking Marsha for

               2  providing certain data to him, and noting

               3  that, after a quick, initial review, the data

               4  appears to be concerning in some areas and has

               5  highlighted multiple opportunities for

               6  improvement.

               7             I read that middle portion there

               8  correctly?

               9          A.   Is this on the second page, or

              10  where is this?

              11          Q.   The first page.  It's right in

              12  the center.  After a quick initial review, the

              13  data appears to be concerning in some areas

              14  and has highlighted multiple opportunities for

              15  improvement.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Now, to go back a second,

              18  had you -- did you ever hire Adam Middleton to

              19  do any consulting work?

              20          A.   He was hired for consulting work

              21  by the region, I guess, not me specifically.

              22          Q.   That was -- that was a question

              23  is, do you know what his relationship was with

              24  Mr. Arquilla prior to being hired to do any

              25  work for Mercy?



                                                               124


               1          A.   Adam's -- I think Adam and Tom

               2  worked together in Dayton, at some level, I

               3  don't know what.  And when we were a little

               4  short staffed in the business development

               5  area, and Adam was, I don't know the dates,

               6  but he was on retainer, it was kind of a

               7  retainer relationship with Mercy, to work on a

               8  variety of different initiatives.  In fact, he

               9  kind of was my project management person when

              10  we were getting St. Anne's started.

              11          Q.   Okay.

              12          A.   So he helped organize the

              13  meetings, you know, do the follow-up work,

              14  make the assignments, organize the next

              15  meetings, that type of thing.

              16          Q.   Do you know whether he was hired,

              17  shortly after this email went out about

              18  quality issues, to conduct an investigation at

              19  Mercy?

              20          A.   I don't know the date he was

              21  hired to -- I don't know the date he was hired

              22  to do that, no.

              23          Q.   Do you recall that he was in fact

              24  hired to conduct an investigation of some

              25  sort?



                                                               125


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   And who do you recall was the --

               3  was it Mr. Arquilla who did that, hired him to

               4  do that?

               5          A.   Yeah, I'll say Tom directed it.

               6          Q.   Okay.  And what was your

               7  understanding, if any, as to why that

               8  investigation was occurring?

               9          A.   There had been several complaints

              10  about Phillips, mostly in relation to, like I

              11  said earlier, I think how quickly he wanted to

              12  change things.  In fact, I think one of the

              13  impetuses for this investigation was that I

              14  met with Dr. Hashmi and Dr. Holland, about

              15  this same time period, where both of them

              16  expressed concerns about Phillips.  I can't

              17  recall specifically what they were.  I

              18  remember thinking it was a little bit strange

              19  to be meeting with Holland and Hash -- I think

              20  I even brought it up at the meeting, you know,

              21  Hashmi and Holland don't always see eye to eye

              22  on things, but they seemed to have mutual

              23  concerns about Phillips.

              24             So I think there was enough there,

              25  we said, well, Adam, can you go through,



                                                               126


               1  interview some people, and we can kind of

               2  figure out what is going on here.

               3          Q.   Now, did Dr. Holland, in that

               4  time frame, advise you, or do you recall him

               5  advising you, that Dr. Phillips had the same,

               6  or similar, concerns that he had about

               7  Dr. Hashmi's quality and safety?

               8          A.   Yeah.  I think he -- he -- he

               9  brought that up.

              10          Q.   Now, in terms of Dr. Phillips, he

              11  can be boisterous, from time to time?  Is that

              12  one of the -- strike that.  Let me go back.

              13             Dr. Phillips can be boisterous

              14  around others that maybe shouldn't be involved

              15  in the conversation about things?

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Is that

              18  accurate, in your experience, and if not --

              19          A.   No.  I don't know if I would say

              20  that was --

              21          Q.   Do you ever recall being told

              22  that when Dr. Phillips reviewed the STS data,

              23  and he looked at the valve statistics from

              24  Dr. Hashmi, that he said these are way off the

              25  F'ing charts?



                                                               127


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               2  foundation.

               3          A.   No, I don't recall that.

               4          Q.   Do you recall being told that

               5  Dr. Hashmi's valve procedures resulted in

               6  300 percent or higher death statistics than

               7  the national averages?

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               9  foundation.

              10          A.   Here is what I recall.

              11  Dr. Holland relayed a lot of things to me.  I

              12  don't remember if they came directly from

              13  Phillips or not.

              14          Q.   Okay.

              15          A.   But Dr. Holland made a lot of

              16  these types of assertions.  Not that I wasn't

              17  concerned, but I had the program at

              18  St. Anne's I was running.  That was my primary

              19  interest.  St. V's has its own quality M & M

              20  structure.  If there is concerns, that's the

              21  proper place to go and evaluate those things,

              22  not discuss it with me, who is really not

              23  involved with it.  Though, I would say I, you

              24  know, don't remember a lot of specifics on it.

              25          Q.   Well, let me ask this --



                                                               128


               1          A.   Other than the gen, you know --

               2          Q.   Okay.

               3          A.   -- the general complaint.

               4          Q.   Let me kind of ask it in terms of

               5  this then.

               6             In terms of the corporate

               7  hierarchy, is that something that would have

               8  been in your bailiwick to investigate in terms

               9  of complaints by Dr. Phillips and Holland

              10  about Hashmi's quality, or is that something

              11  that you anticipated someone else in the Mercy

              12  organization --

              13          A.   It would -- it would defer to the

              14  quality review.  To the extent the surgery

              15  occurred at St. Anne's, it would be under

              16  mine.  To the extent it occurred somewhere

              17  else, it would go to St. Vincent's.  And a lot

              18  of times, if Dr. Holland brought something up

              19  to me, I would call either Greg, or someone,

              20  and just say, this is what he's telling me.

              21  Just make sure we're investigating it, or

              22  that, you know, we've already got a review in

              23  place, or whatever we needed to do to follow

              24  up.

              25          Q.   Okay.  Now, you learned, I think,



                                                               129


               1  or, correct if I'm wrong, but did you have an

               2  understanding that Dr. Hashmi was planning on

               3  retiring in or about 2016, or early 2017?

               4          A.   That just seemed to be like an

               5  ongoing conversation.  You know, kind of like

               6  the retirement that may or may not ever

               7  happen, but I -- you know, there was a lot of

               8  discussion over an extended period of time

               9  about, you know, Hashmi's looking to retire.

              10          Q.   So we're coming to basically

              11  questions about a candidate, where Dr. Hashmi,

              12  I think I referenced this earlier today, this

              13  is in or about August of 2016, where

              14  Dr. Hashmi, so -- has sourced a potential

              15  candidate, Dr. Hasan.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   Okay?  And then we have some

              18  documents to look at with this.

              19          A.   Okay.  We still on I, or are we

              20  into II?

              21          Q.   Yeah.  We're going -- we're going

              22  to be talking about the topic of Hasan coming

              23  in.

              24          A.   Okay.  But we're still in the

              25  Volume I?



                                                               130


               1          Q.   Yeah.

               2          A.   Okay.

               3          Q.   We're still in the first one.

               4  Yeah.  Just turn to Exhibit 72.  You're not

               5  copied on this.

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   And at the bottom,

               8  Christopher Phillips is sending his comments,

               9  this, as I will represent to you, about

              10  Dr. Hasan to Tom Leeds.

              11          A.   Okay.

              12          Q.   Okay.  So according to what

              13  Dr. Phillips writes to Leeds on August 22nd,

              14  it appears that Dr. Holland and Dr. Phillips,

              15  at this point in time, have an agreement that

              16  they don't want to go in the direction of

              17  hiring Dr. Hasan, correct?

              18          A.   I don't know about Phillips, but

              19  Doctor -- I don't know about Dr. Holland, but

              20  Dr. Phillips is saying that for sure.

              21          Q.   Phillips is saying, I discussed

              22  with Dr. Holland, and we both agree?

              23          A.   Oh, okay.

              24          Q.   That's what he said, correct?

              25          A.   Okay.



                                                               131


               1          Q.   All right.  Now, just to be

               2  clear, when Dr. Phillips came in initially,

               3  the investigation that occurred resulted in

               4  him being -- being placed on probation; is

               5  that right?

               6          A.   I don't know what the formal

               7  action was, but I know there was a coaching.

               8          Q.   And did you feel that at -- at

               9  the -- at Saint -- strike that.

              10             At Mercy's disposal was, if you

              11  believed Dr. Holland needed coaching, you

              12  could get him coaching as well, like you had

              13  gotten for Dr. Phillips?

              14          A.   I -- it was not formal coaching

              15  that Dr. Phillips received.  It was more, I

              16  think Tom Welch sat with him and kind of said,

              17  hey, here is the issues.  You know, we'd like

              18  you to work on them.

              19          Q.   Tom Welch is the chief medical

              20  officer; is that correct?

              21          A.   Correct.  I think at that time

              22  that was his role.

              23          Q.   Okay.  And -- fair enough.

              24             But that type of resource would

              25  have also been available, if you ever thought



                                                               132


               1  you had to put Dr. Holland on probation,

               2  correct?

               3          A.   Little bit different, because

               4  Phillips was employed.  Dr. Holland really

               5  wasn't employed, but I tried to give feedback

               6  to Dr. Holland on anything that I thought

               7  could, you know, make him more successful.

               8          Q.   Well, you could -- could Mercy

               9  restrict his abilities, or place him on a

              10  probation, or give him a warning, if they felt

              11  it was necessary?

              12          A.   I -- I would have to refer to the

              13  details of the, you know, the professional

              14  services agreement and how that exactly would

              15  work.

              16          Q.   Okay.  But you don't recall

              17  anything in writing being sent to the

              18  Toledo Clinic, where you asked them to do

              19  anything like that, correct?

              20          A.   Nothing in writing that I recall,

              21  no.

              22          Q.   So even if it wasn't -- to go

              23  back, in terms of the contract.  Even if Mercy

              24  itself "couldn't take that direct action",

              25  Mercy could inform Toledo Clinic, hey, we have



                                                               133


               1  a reason to investigate, or we want you to, or

               2  we want you to suspend, or you could do that,

               3  tell Toledo Clinic that?

               4          A.   Yeah.  I'm not sure what our

               5  abilities were under the contract, but we

               6  could certainly say, you know, this -- this

               7  isn't -- we want you to do an evaluation, or

               8  coach Dr. Holland on the following topics, but

               9  I -- I, from time to time, would feel

              10  comfortable going to him just directly as

              11  well.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Now, on Exhibit 72,

              13  Dr. Hashmi writes to Tom Leeds, this is

              14  interesting.  The real issue, what is Mercy's

              15  need?  I'll leave the decision to Imran and

              16  Tom.  They can determine if they will be

              17  satisfied with the current two surgeons, plus

              18  an unknown surgeon after I'm gone.

              19             Did I read that part correctly?

              20          A.   Yep.

              21          Q.   Now, did you know, or do you know

              22  whether or not the decision was left to Imran

              23  Andrabi and Tom Arquilla about who would be

              24  the person selected for whoever this surgeon

              25  was being hired?



                                                               134


               1          A.   I don't know who -- I don't know

               2  who was involved with that.

               3          Q.   Now, I don't know if this is a

               4  good time to break or not.  It's 12:30.  What

               5  would you gentlemen like to do?

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  Break for lunch is

               7  fine with me.

               8          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Why don't we

               9  just break for lunch --

              10          A.   Fine with me.

              11          Q.   -- at this point.

              12          A.   Okay.

              13          Q.   There is a number of places in

              14  the area.  We'll try to do it in one hour.

              15          A.   Oh, St. Anne's is -- yeah.  Yeah.

              16          Q.   Got you.

              17          A.   St. Anne's is within a tenth of a

              18  mile, so ....

              19             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off record.

              20             (Whereupon, a lunch break was taken

              21  from 12:33 until 1:34.)

              22             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are on

              23  record.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Bertke,

              25  I'm going to just go through a couple of



                                                               135


               1  exhibits here first, and then we'll --

               2          A.   Okay.

               3          Q.   -- get to some more substantive

               4  matters.  I just want to mark this as 139.

               5  These are a little bit out of sequence

               6  chronologically.  That's --

               7          A.   Do you want me to grab that?

               8          Q.   The court reporter will mark it.

               9          A.   Oh, got you.

              10             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 139

              11  was marked for identification.)

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Just for

              13  identification purposes, on Exhibit 139, just

              14  to confirm that that appears to be an email at

              15  the top from you to Dr. Holland on the first

              16  page.  Stats for 2014 through June, is the

              17  subject.  Any of the slides that last column

              18  is listed as TB/JH.

              19             Do you see that there?

              20          A.   Yeah.  That's -- yeah.  My --

              21  from me.  Okay.  Yep, I see the comment.

              22          Q.   All right.  Just confirming that

              23  you believe then that you would have had an

              24  email exchange?  That is your email address

              25  that appears in this email, correct?



                                                               136


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Next Exhibit, 140.  I'm

               3  not going to have any more questions about

               4  that at this point.

               5          A.   Okay.

               6          Q.   Just --

               7             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 140

               8  was marked for identification.)

               9          A.   You want that?

              10          Q.   Okay.  Exhibit 140 is from

              11  March 2nd, 2016.  Pamela Kadlick to a couple

              12  of people, and you're cc'd on this email.

              13             Do you see that?

              14          A.   Uh-huh.

              15          Q.   Yes?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And then this, this

              18  appears to document that Dr. Holland had

              19  called and complimented people, correct?

              20          A.   That he had called the Chief

              21  Nursing Officer, Pam Kadlick, and complimented

              22  the work of the OR and the floor.

              23          Q.   Did you ever hear any -- did you

              24  ever hear any joke to the effect that

              25  Dr. Holland shouldn't be Fred Holland, instead



                                                               137


               1  he should be Fred Rogers?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Oh, God.

               3          A.   No.

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Foundation.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you know

               6  who Fred Rogers is, Mr. Rogers Neighborhood?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   I --

               9          A.   Well, now that you say that, yes.

              10          Q.   Okay.

              11          A.   But ....

              12          Q.   Now, do you recall, in or about

              13  -- I'm coming back to 2016 now, towards the

              14  end of 2016, and I'm going to talk about the

              15  November, November time frame.

              16          A.   November 2016?

              17          Q.   Yes.

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   This is in the time period when

              20  there is the potential of Dr. Hasan being

              21  hired, or being offered a contract.  Just

              22  keeping that in mind.

              23          A.   Okay.

              24          Q.   Do you recall any -- an audit, a

              25  CHAN audit being conducted in or about late



                                                               138


               1  2016?

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   And do you know what a CHAN audit

               4  is?

               5          A.   CHAN is a, I guess I would call

               6  it an internal auditing firm.

               7          Q.   Okay.  And what -- what was it,

               8  if you had an understanding, what did you have

               9  an understanding about what was being audited

              10  in or about late 2016?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  I'm going to object

              12  on privilege.  That was an audit that was

              13  requested by the general counsel, pursuant to

              14  the associate general counsel.  It was a

              15  self-critical analysis, so I'm going to direct

              16  that you don't answer any of the questions,

              17  other than its existence.

              18          A.   Okay.

              19             MR. ARCHINACO:  Just let me read

              20  that last part.  I just missed the last

              21  sentence.

              22             Just to be clear then, you will

              23  assert privilege in the, any questions

              24  pertaining to the CHAN audit, correct?

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  That's correct.



                                                               139


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Okay.

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  To the substance of

               3  it.

               4             MR. ARCHINACO:  Right.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Can you look

               6  at Exhibit 22, please?

               7          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

               8          Q.   This is an email from you to

               9  Jeffrey Dempsey, dated November 12th, 2016.

              10  Correct?

              11          A.   Correct.

              12          Q.   Now, the first paragraph starts,

              13  Andrabi, Hashmi, Arquilla, Hood, Theadore.

              14             Do you see that?

              15          A.   Yep.

              16          Q.   I don't know if this will be

              17  viewed as passive-aggressive, but I won't to

              18  go on record just hiring this guy (along with

              19  Holland issue) could blow things up.

              20             Did I read that generally

              21  correctly?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   Okay.  Now, what I'm trying to

              24  understand here, and maybe you can explain it

              25  to me, why are the names of those five people



                                                               140


               1  listed out before the sentence?

               2          A.   This is an email that I sent to

               3  Jeff --

               4          Q.   Okay.

               5          A.   -- contemplating sending this to

               6  those others.  And in essence, Jeff is

               7  somebody that I frequently with, will confer

               8  with regarding work issues, in terms of

               9  approach and so forth.  So I'm in essence

              10  asking Jeff, can you look through this for me,

              11  and see if you think it's appropriate.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Mr. Dempsey still works at

              13  the institution?

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   What is his position?

              16          A.   He's the president at

              17  St. Vincent's.

              18          Q.   And you have a good working

              19  relationship with Mr. Dempsey?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   I believe Mr. Dempsey, in terms

              22  of this matter, only came on board at some

              23  point in -- strike that.

              24             Do you recall when Mr. Dempsey

              25  became the president of St. Vincent?



                                                               141


               1          A.   Don't know the exact date, no.

               2  At the time of this writing, I -- I know he

               3  would not have been the president, back in

               4  '16.

               5          Q.   Sometime in 2017, would that

               6  be --

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   -- consistent with your

               9  recollection, he became president?

              10          A.   Uh-huh.

              11          Q.   You have to keep it audible, I'm

              12  sorry.

              13             So this first -- so what you're

              14  doing is ref -- you're sending this to

              15  Mr. Dempsey for his -- this email to

              16  Mr. Dempsey about his input about what a

              17  potential email will say to those five people?

              18          A.   Yes.  If I remember correctly, I

              19  essentially talked to Jeff and said, hey, I'm

              20  going to send this to you, kind of take a look

              21  at it and tell me what you think.

              22          Q.   And what do you recall, if

              23  anything, receiving back from Mr. Dempsey, or

              24  discussing with him about what you had sent to

              25  him?



                                                               142


               1          A.   From my memory, I don't really

               2  remember anything, but there was, in some of

               3  the materials I got in preparation, he

               4  basically said, it looks good, I'll give you a

               5  call about it, and that's all I remember.

               6          Q.   Do you remember if you did have a

               7  call about it?

               8          A.   Not -- not specifically, no.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Earlier -- by the way, I

              10  just want to go back on one thing.  Earlier, I

              11  believe that you had indicated that -- I want

              12  to go back to the Phillip, complaints about

              13  Phillips that led to Mr. Middleton's

              14  investigation.  You -- I recall you saying,

              15  essentially, that you had advised Greg Hood

              16  about -- strike that.

              17             Do you recall stating that you had

              18  advised Greg Hood that Dr. Holland and/or

              19  Dr. Phillips, had raised quality or safety

              20  concerns about Dr. Hashmi?

              21          A.   Could you read that back?

              22             (Whereupon, the court reporter read

              23  back the requested testimony.)

              24          A.   Can you read it back one more

              25  time, because I thought he said strike that



                                                               143


               1  about Greg Hood, but ....

               2             (Whereupon, the court reporter read

               3  back the requested testimony.)

               4          A.   I -- I remember, you know,

               5  Dr. Holland, from time to time, would bring up

               6  specific cases and circumstances.  I don't

               7  remember Dr. Phillips so much.  And typically,

               8  I would refer those matters, in particular, if

               9  they happened at St. Vincent's, on to Greg, or

              10  somebody else that is more responsible at

              11  St. V's.

              12          Q.   Okay.  And I believe you also,

              13  you indicated earlier, when matters were

              14  within your control, such as St. Anne's

              15  matters, if a matter was referred to you to

              16  investigate, you would -- you would have it

              17  followed up on, correct?  If it's a St. Anne's

              18  issue?

              19          A.   Yeah.  There is a very standard

              20  process for evaluation of care concerns, or

              21  you know, behavior issues, whatever it might

              22  be.

              23          Q.   And you would also -- and so by

              24  -- if you referred any matter, a St. Vincent

              25  type matter to St. Vincent people, you would



                                                               144


               1  anticipate they would follow whatever

               2  procedures they had --

               3          A.   Correct.

               4          Q.   -- in place, correct?

               5             And do you recall ever being

               6  advised of any findings or conclusions

               7  Mr. Hood, or anyone else made, with regard to

               8  any investigation into any quality or safety

               9  concerns Dr. Holland raised about Dr. Hashmi?

              10          A.   No.  That would be outside the

              11  standard process, for somebody to report back

              12  to me out of their quality process.

              13          Q.   Okay.  Since I'm covering some

              14  prior ground, if you can mark this

              15  Exhibit 141, please.

              16             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 141

              17  was marked for identification.)

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Bertke, I

              19  had asked you some questions earlier about

              20  Dr. Holland's recruitment process.  And I

              21  actually did not -- I was able to print this

              22  email out.  I intended on showing it to you

              23  this morning.

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   From Buzz Hermann to you, dated



                                                               145


               1  December 7, 2012, subject, Dr. Holland.  Once

               2  you've had a chance to review it, let me know.

               3          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

               4          Q.   Okay.  And Mr. Hermann is saying,

               5  Brad, I did get a chance to talk to

               6  Dr. Holland about the St. Anne cardiology --

               7  cardiology initiative, and he is all for it.

               8  Thanks for the tip ..

               9             Correct?  Read that correctly?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And now -- now seeing this

              12  email, does this help refresh your

              13  recollection as to whether or not, prior to

              14  Dr. Holland being hired, that it was talked to

              15  him about there was this potential St. Anne's

              16  cardiology initiative?

              17          A.   I don't remember that, but you

              18  know, obviously, if this is an accurate email,

              19  and this was sent --

              20          Q.   Okay.

              21          A.   -- it must have been.  I don't --

              22  I think Dr. Holland joined in '13, so I would

              23  assume this was during his recruitment period.

              24          Q.   Yeah.  And I -- I asked you

              25  questions today without showing it to you, and



                                                               146


               1  it was just based on your recollection.  So

               2  you're not disputing --

               3          A.   Okay.

               4          Q.   -- that this -- there is a --

               5  there is a -- strike that.

               6             There is a Mercy-St. Vincent stamp

               7  on it in the bottom right-hand corner, 003620.

               8          A.   Okay.

               9          Q.   So this document was produced to

              10  us from Mercy, okay?

              11             So with that in mind, providing

              12  it's authentic, you would believe that, yes,

              13  there were some type of conversation to this

              14  effect in 2012, correct?

              15          A.   I can only assume that, yeah.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              17             Now, coming back to Exhibit 22.  I

              18  have a few more questions about this one.

              19          A.   Sure.

              20          Q.   So what were you -- now,

              21  essentially you're saying you wouldn't go on

              22  record as hiring this guy.  And when I say

              23  this guy, I believe that it was Dr. Hasan that

              24  was, at that point, the candidate.  Okay?

              25             Do you know why it is that you were



                                                               147


               1  concerned about hiring Dr. Hasan, and that it

               2  could blow things up?

               3          A.   Well, if you look on here, we

               4  talk about, in 8-23, and I don't remember this

               5  meeting, but I'm referencing it, so I assume

               6  it occurred, we wanted a real solid plan with

               7  the way we were evaluating candidates.  So

               8  Greg Hood, myself, Kabour, Nahhas and Hashmi

               9  talked about what is going to be our plan

              10  going forward for CT surgery.  And we had kind

              11  of a general agreement in that plan, and one

              12  of the items we were going to do was, when

              13  candidates came in, they would be vetted

              14  through this group of key constituents.  And I

              15  believe, in this case -- and my primary

              16  interest was to make sure the Toledo Clinic

              17  was, felt good about the candidates coming in.

              18  They were the primary cardiology group at

              19  St. Anne's at the time.  Okay?

              20             And Dr. Nahhas was apparently

              21  involved in interviewing this candidate.

              22  Seemed like a reasonably good surgeon and a

              23  nice man, but he didn't necessarily see it as

              24  an upgrade.

              25          Q.   Okay.



                                                               148


               1          A.   And so, I think at the end, I

               2  just kind of ask, can somebody cover the base

               3  with, if we're going to make an offer to this

               4  guy, who I think you reference in here

               5  correctly, Dr. Hasan --

               6          Q.   Uh-huh.

               7          A.   -- can somebody make sure we've

               8  covered that base.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Well, at least according

              10  to what you were considering sending to people

              11  that you sent to Mr. Dempsey, you were going

              12  to point out to people that doing this could

              13  blow things up, correct?

              14          A.   Might have been a little

              15  dramatic, but I mean, I think it would --

              16          Q.   Well --

              17          A.   -- be a little -- it wouldn't be

              18  consistent with the process that we had agreed

              19  to.

              20          Q.   Do you -- do you regard yourself

              21  as being a dramatic person?

              22          A.   Not typically.

              23          Q.   You're not known for beating your

              24  fist on desks, right?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               149


               1          Q.   Okay.  Now, so in the second --

               2  this is actually the third paragraph, but in

               3  the second substantive paragraph, down where

               4  it says in the past, do you see that?  The

               5  paragraph that begins with in the past?

               6          A.   Oh, yes.

               7          Q.   Okay.  And you say, about a

               8  meeting to set a go-forward plan, and that

               9  included Greg Hood, correct?

              10          A.   That would be the Greg, yeah.

              11          Q.   Okay.  Now, Dr. Kabour is

              12  mentioned here, correct?

              13          A.   Uh-huh.

              14          Q.   Yes?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   Okay.

              17          A.   Sorry.

              18          Q.   Now, just -- just a question for

              19  you about referrals back then versus today.

              20  In terms of St. Anne's program, which is what

              21  you were concerned about overall, at the time

              22  -- well, strike that.

              23             Did you have any other -- did you

              24  have any oversight over the entire

              25  cardiothoracic program at Mercy-St. Vincent



                                                               150


               1  and Anne's, or just at St. Anne's, at any

               2  point in time?

               3          A.   There might have been a brief

               4  period of time where I was the executive

               5  sponsor for cardiovascular services with, I

               6  think it was the time period where we were

               7  contemplating opening up St. Anne's and

               8  coordinating all that.

               9             Probably, maybe when Greg

              10  initially, Greg Hood initially got into his

              11  job.  And then most of that transitioned at

              12  some point in time in the future, either to

              13  Tom or to Jason Theadore.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Now, at the time in or

              15  about 2016, was it primarily Toledo Clinic

              16  referring cardiothoracic surgeries to

              17  St. Anne's?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19          Q.   Were there other cases referred

              20  from Dr. Kabour's group or not that many?

              21          A.   Rarely.

              22          Q.   And did Dr. Kabour, in or about

              23  this time period in November 2016, ever

              24  suggest to you that he was going to refer more

              25  cases, if he -- or strike that.



                                                               151


               1             That he would refer more cases to

               2  St. Anne's, if there were different surgeons

               3  there?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   For example, did he ever say to

               6  you, you know, that my group would feel more

               7  comfortable referring cases to St. Anne's, if

               8  there was a surgeon of -- a foreign-born

               9  surgeon, or someone with darker skin color, or

              10  anything along those lines than Dr. Holland?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   But you knew his group, Kabour's

              13  group in particular, primarily seemed to refer

              14  to Dr. Hashmi, correct?

              15          A.   That was my understanding, yes.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Now, why -- you knew that

              17  there were conversations -- strike that.

              18             We showed you a contract earlier,

              19  which I will represent to you we received in

              20  discovery, and was the last contract, I

              21  believe, that Mercy signed with Dr. Hashmi.

              22  It was from May of 2017.

              23             And just with that in mind, did

              24  that -- does that jog your memory that at

              25  least, or did you -- strike that.



                                                               152


               1             Did you have an understanding, as

               2  of late 2016, that Dr. Hashmi's contract was

               3  basically going to be up in May of 2017,

               4  absent a further extension?

               5          A.   I didn't -- I didn't really know

               6  Hashmi's contract dates, and when they may

               7  have been up.

               8          Q.   All right.  So there were -- in

               9  this paragraph, in the past, you wrote, in the

              10  past, there had been so much confusion and

              11  hard feelings when candidates were brought in.

              12             Do you see that there?

              13          A.   Yes.

              14          Q.   And so who had the hard feelings

              15  about candidates being brought in in the past

              16  that you can remember?

              17          A.   I don't remember specific

              18  individuals, but I think there was just a

              19  request that if these are the key, primary

              20  stakeholders, you know, they would like to be

              21  involved in vetting of CT surgery candidates.

              22          Q.   All right.  Next sentence, It was

              23  agreed that Phillips and Holland would be

              24  swapped out and a group assembled would be

              25  involved in interviewing new CT candidates.



                                                               153


               1  Holland and Phillips would not.  It was agreed

               2  Phillips would go first, since he had minimal

               3  support among either group.  We agreed to

               4  reconvene to discuss go-forward with any

               5  candidates.

               6             Did I read that correctly,

               7  essentially?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Now, so is that a true

              10  statement that you wrote here that -- well,

              11  let me -- let me take that back.

              12             Is it correct that during a meeting

              13  with yourself, Dr. Kabour, Dr. Nahhas,

              14  Mr. Hood, and Dr. Hashmi that an agreement was

              15  made that Dr. Phillips would be -- would "go

              16  first"?

              17          A.   I don't remember the meeting

              18  specifically and the discussions around that,

              19  but this says what it says.

              20          Q.   Okay.  So at least as of -- at

              21  least -- so this is referring to the

              22  August 23rd meeting; is that right?

              23          A.   That was -- that was -- yes.

              24          Q.   Okay.  The next paragraph, it

              25  says, Since that time, the CHAN audit has



                                                               154


               1  indicated that we need to make changes to the

               2  agreement with the Toledo Clinic/Mercy, which

               3  provides Dr. Holland.  So this needs to be

               4  prioritized.

               5             Did I read that correctly?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   So was it -- was it your

               8  understanding that the CHAN audit, led at the

               9  direction of counsel, as previously mentioned

              10  by the attorneys, was the reason that

              11  Dr. Holland's agreement was going to change?

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              13  privileged.

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  Are you instructing

              15  not to answer?

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Correct.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you recall

              18  ever getting any feedback from someone that

              19  Dr. Holland's contract was not -- not

              20  "profitable"?

              21          A.   We -- we -- I don't remember that

              22  specifically, but it was prob -- my knowledge

              23  of these things would tell me we're -- it was

              24  probably upside down, you know?  It wasn't

              25  generating as much revenue as the expense



                                                               155


               1  associated with it, but I didn't have great

               2  details on it.

               3          Q.   Do you recall that being

               4  discussed at all, prior to the services

               5  agreement with Toledo Clinic being terminated?

               6          A.   Hmm.  Not that I recall.

               7          Q.   Now, just to be clear, in this

               8  time period in November, would you be having

               9  any general discussions -- strike that.

              10             I see you have consulted with

              11  Mr. Dempsey.  Is there some reason you weren't

              12  consulting with Dr. Andrabi or Mr. Arquilla?

              13          A.   Like I said, I mean, I think

              14  given the fact that who I was sending this to

              15  and the approach --

              16          Q.   Uh-huh.

              17          A.   -- what I was stating in it, I

              18  wanted somebody to review it, prior to sending

              19  it.  But I think subsequent to this, and

              20  again, it was something that was given to me

              21  as part of the, what might come up here, in

              22  essence, Imran had talked to me shortly after

              23  this and said, you know, the bases are covered

              24  with the clinic, and I just kind of never sent

              25  it.  Felt it got addressed, my concern got



                                                               156


               1  addressed without needing to send the email.

               2          Q.   So Imran Andrabi made some type

               3  of decision and addressed your concern?

               4          A.   Yeah.  I don't recall

               5  specifically, but somewhere -- somewhere along

               6  the lines, he alleviated my concern that the

               7  bases with Nahhas and the Toledo Clinic will

               8  be covered, so ....

               9          Q.   Now, in this sentence, it also

              10  says, The clinic expressed concern -- well,

              11  let's go back a second.

              12             Do you know what, if anything,

              13  happened, or strike that.

              14             Were you ever -- hmm.

              15             Mr. Arquilla provides notice on or

              16  about November 28th to Toledo Clinic.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   November 28, 2016, that there was

              19  an intent to terminate the service agreement

              20  effective February 28, 2017.

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   There is a three-month provision

              23  in there, I believe.  And that's why you'll

              24  see the difference in the dates from November

              25  to February 28th.  Okay?  So you have that



                                                               157


               1  date in mind.

               2          A.   And Tom -- Tom was the one that

               3  made that decision, since he was originally

               4  involved with it and had responsibility and

               5  authority.

               6          Q.   Did Mr. Arquilla ever say to you,

               7  or suggest to you, that my client is a Nazi,

               8  or a Nazi sympathizer?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   Did you ever see anything that

              11  would suggest my client is a Nazi, or a Nazi

              12  sympathizer?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Okay.  So according to what we

              15  see here, in a meeting that Mr. Arquilla was

              16  not at, it appeared that Dr. Phillips would go

              17  first, according to what you documented from

              18  August 23rd, correct?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   Okay.  But then subsequent to

              21  this -- now, this is dated November 12th.

              22          A.   Uh-huh.

              23          Q.   So somewhere between

              24  November 12th and the date November 28th, it's

              25  Mr. Arquilla that decides, not you, to



                                                               158


               1  terminate the service agreement by which

               2  Dr. Holland is providing services, correct?

               3          A.   That's my understanding, yes.

               4          Q.   Okay.  And you were not involved

               5  in that decisionmaking with Mr. Arquilla,

               6  correct?

               7          A.   It was his decision.

               8          Q.   Okay.  And would you expect that

               9  he would have been consulting with his

              10  superior, Dr. Andrabi?

              11          A.   You'd have to ask him.

              12          Q.   Okay.

              13          A.   But I would assume.

              14          Q.   He's going to be coming in at

              15  some point.  Okay.

              16             So to be clear, you were not

              17  personally involved in any decision to choose

              18  to terminate or remove Dr. Holland, prior to

              19  removing Dr. Phillips, correct?

              20          A.   I might have been alerted that it

              21  was going to go that way, because obviously on

              22  November 12th, I already know that, but it

              23  wasn't really my call.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Now, do you think this

              25  email you sent to Mr. Dempsey, where you



                                                               159


               1  pointed out that things could blow up after --

               2  well, strike that.

               3             Were you aware, in this general

               4  time frame, that Dr. Holland was making

               5  complaints that referrals did not seem to be

               6  based on outcomes, but instead seemed to be

               7  based on something else?

               8          A.   Well, that predates this and goes

               9  back a long history, but I, on frequent

              10  occasion, Dr. Holland expressed concerns

              11  regarding referrals.

              12          Q.   Now --

              13          A.   And he felt he was the best

              14  surgeon, which by the way, is pretty

              15  consistent with any other surgeon, but ....

              16          Q.   You would stipulate that most

              17  surgeons would state that they're the best, if

              18  not one of the best?

              19          A.   Yes.  That's -- it's kind of a

              20  general.

              21          Q.   Did you believe -- well, strike

              22  that.

              23             So now we see this email from you,

              24  dated November 12, 2016.  Are you happy that

              25  you sent this to Mr. Dempsey, documenting that



                                                               160


               1  you didn't want to go on record hiring

               2  Dr. Hasan, given what was going on with

               3  Dr. Holland, because it might blow things up?

               4  Are you glad you sent this?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               6          A.   Am I glad I sent it?

               7          Q.   Yes.

               8          A.   I'm ambivalent to it.  I don't

               9  really have feelings positive or negative

              10  about it.

              11          Q.   Well, here is -- here is why.

              12  You saw a situation in which it appeared that

              13  Dr. Phillips was going to be removed first,

              14  and that the new surgeon is being brought in,

              15  correct?

              16          A.   Appears like he may be being

              17  brought in, yes.

              18          Q.   Dr. Hasan --

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   -- correct?

              21             And did you notice that Dr. Hasan

              22  was similar to Dr. Hashmi, also Pakistani?

              23          A.   I knew he was Pakistani, but I

              24  never met him.

              25          Q.   And were you made aware that --



                                                               161


               1  strike that.

               2             So did you believe that given the

               3  complaints that Dr. Holland was raising about

               4  -- strike that.

               5             Do you think that from your email,

               6  you were pointing out to Mr. Dempsey that

               7  there was a potential problem here, because

               8  what was happening is Dr. Holland was going to

               9  be potentially replaced, and in his stead was

              10  going to be a Pakistani surgeon that knew

              11  Dr. Hashmi?

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to

              13  foundation.

              14          A.   Can you read that back?

              15             (Whereupon, the court reporter read

              16  back the requested testimony.)

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              18  foundation.

              19          A.   I have -- I have -- in previous

              20  to this discussion, and during this

              21  discussion, nobody ever raised concerns that

              22  he was Pakistani.  Dr. Nahhas never brought it

              23  up.  Nobody else brought it up.  I was aware

              24  that he was Pakistani, but I think that what

              25  Dr. Nahhas was just indicating is he was



                                                               162


               1  looking for somebody that was a little bit

               2  more of an up and comer, but I -- this line of

               3  questioning about Pakistani and all that, is

               4  -- that just wasn't in play at the time.

               5          Q.   So you didn't -- you didn't see

               6  that what could blow things up was that

               7  Dr. Holland was either stating or insinuating

               8  that he wasn't getting referrals, not because

               9  of quality, but because of race or national

              10  origin, and that that was the real reason.

              11  And that now by hiring a Pakistani surgeon to

              12  replace him, that that could blow things up,

              13  because that looked, on its face, like

              14  discrimination?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              16  foundation, narrative.

              17          A.   Again, that's a lot packed in

              18  that question.

              19          Q.   Yeah.

              20          A.   Here -- here were the issues,

              21  from my perspective.  Dr. Nahhas and the

              22  Toledo Clinic wanted a quality surgeon at

              23  St. Anne's, who they believed Dr. Holland was

              24  a quality surgeon.

              25             But referencing some of my earlier



                                                               163


               1  testimony, if you go back to -- I would target

               2  some of the discussion around the arrest, and

               3  some of the -- the concerns that came out

               4  during that time period.  From that time

               5  period forward, you know, I'll use a short

               6  leash metaphor, I don't know if that's the

               7  best or the worst, but there was ongoing

               8  discussions, not every day, but periodically

               9  about is this the right fit.

              10             Dr. Nahhas had an interest in a

              11  quality surgeon.  I don't think he really

              12  cared where the man came from, or what his

              13  race or -- race or ethnicity was.

              14          Q.   Okay.  So let's go back --

              15          A.   And I think his concerns

              16  regarding Dr. Hasan were related to those

              17  issues, not how it was playing in these

              18  geopolitical politics.

              19          Q.   Just to be clear, I mean, you

              20  mentioned that since the time of the arrest,

              21  and the arrest occurred in 2014; isn't that

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Correct.

              24          Q.   September of 2014.  And so just

              25  to be clear, you saw not a single written



                                                               164


               1  document ever from 2014, until even the

               2  present, between yourself and anyone

               3  discussing Dr. Holland's arrest and whether it

               4  had anything whatsoever to do with him working

               5  at Mercy, correct?

               6          A.   I don't believe I have a written

               7  document to that, no.

               8          Q.   Okay.  And so -- and so there is

               9  nothing in here, in this email, on

              10  November 12th, 2016, about any arrest of

              11  Dr. Holland, correct?

              12          A.   Correct.

              13          Q.   And in fact, according to this,

              14  the agreement was Phillips would go first,

              15  correct?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Right?  So whatever Phillips had

              18  done wrong, or was doing wrong, was a lot

              19  worse, apparently, in everybody's mind than

              20  what Dr. Holland was doing wrong, right?

              21          A.   That could have been at the time.

              22          Q.   Okay.  So by the way, after

              23  Dr. Hashmi was out of the institution, didn't

              24  you -- did you notice how Dr. Phillips'

              25  referrals from Dr. Kabour increased?



                                                               165


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               2  foundation.

               3          A.   I have no knowledge of who --

               4  who's referring to who right now.

               5          Q.   Dr. Phillips perform surgeries at

               6  St. Anne's?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   And who is it that's performing

               9  surgeries at St. Anne's right now,

              10  Dr. Phillips and Dr. Dibardino?

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   Okay.  And in fact, I believe you

              13  might have an advertisement for another

              14  surgeon; is that right?

              15          A.   That's correct.

              16          Q.   And how long has that been

              17  posted, that potential job?

              18          A.   Hmm.  A month or two, I suppose.

              19          Q.   Is that to replace Dr. Phillips?

              20          A.   No.  Doctor -- there was a

              21  surgeon, Dr. Kokocki, who left, so we're down

              22  to two surgeons right now.

              23          Q.   All right.  Well, going back to

              24  this, even though there was an agreement that

              25  Phillips would go first, when was the -- who



                                                               166


               1  made the decision that Phillips would never

               2  go?  When did that decision change?

               3          A.   I don't really remember.

               4          Q.   Okay.  All right.  So in this

               5  memo, I think you referred to a couple of

               6  things here.  I just want to read a couple of

               7  things.

               8             The Toledo Clinic cardiologists are

               9  aware of this need, as I communicated it this

              10  week at our regular cardiac meeting.  The

              11  Clinic expressed concern, as Holland is a

              12  known factor, and the program has had a good

              13  success.  We did our 100th heart last week and

              14  quality outcomes have been good.  I explained

              15  Holland can stay, but the Mercy/Clinic

              16  agreement will change.  We have a plan for

              17  this transition, but it's likely to cause hard

              18  feelings with the cardiologists, will see --

              19  who will see it as our excuse to change

              20  Dr. Holland.

              21             I read that part correctly?

              22          A.   Uh-huh.

              23          Q.   Okay.

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Okay.  So --



                                                               167


               1          A.   Could I -- sorry.  I had

               2  something that I wanted to add to the earlier

               3  question, but I can't remember what it is

               4  right now.

               5          Q.   Okay.  You're welcome to go back,

               6  and if you need to -- if you remember

               7  something later.

               8             Here, you explained, according to

               9  this email, you explained Holland can stay; is

              10  that right?

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   So at least in your viewpoint,

              13  according to you, as of this time frame, you

              14  were going to explain to people that

              15  Dr. Holland can stay at Mercy; is that right?

              16          A.   Well, just because the agreement

              17  with the Clinic changed, did not change

              18  anything in regards to Dr. Holland being able

              19  to stay and do work at St. Anne's.

              20          Q.   Okay.  So this doesn't appear, at

              21  least from your perspective, when you're

              22  writing an email to Mr. Dempsey -- well, let's

              23  go back a second.  I just want to talk about

              24  management.

              25             Imran Andrabi is gone from Mercy,



                                                               168


               1  correct?

               2          A.   That's correct.

               3          Q.   And why did he leave?

               4          A.   He took a job with Thedacare in

               5  Wisconsin.

               6          Q.   Did he ever tell you that during

               7  the time periods he was looking for a job,

               8  that I was writing him letters about issues

               9  pertaining to patient care?

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   On behalf of Dr. Holland, I was

              12  writing those letters?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   He never told you that -- he

              15  never -- strike that.

              16             Dr. Andrabi and you didn't have a

              17  relationship, where he would confide in you

              18  things, correct?

              19          A.   That's correct.

              20          Q.   He may have had that relationship

              21  with -- or strike that.

              22             Mr. Arquilla was his right-hand

              23  man, correct?

              24          A.   They were closer and worked in

              25  the same building.  I worked, you know, at



                                                               169


               1  St. Anne's.

               2          Q.   So Dr. Andrabi, who -- he's -- he

               3  is gone, correct?

               4          A.   Yeah.  I don't remember the date,

               5  but he's gone.

               6          Q.   Thomas Arquilla, he's gone,

               7  correct?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Why did he -- why was he gone?

              10          A.   I believe Dr. Andrabi recruited

              11  him and took him to Wisconsin.

              12          Q.   All right.  So those two are gone

              13  from Toledo, right?

              14          A.   (Witness nods head.)

              15          Q.   Okay.

              16             THE REPORTER:  Yes?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   All right.  Sorry.

              19             Then we also have Dr. Hashmi,

              20  Fayyaz -- Fayyaz Hashmi, he's gone --

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   -- correct?

              23             Okay.  And so now in terms of

              24  management at St. Vincent, St. Anne, it's

              25  yourself and Mr. Dempsey who are on this



                                                               170


               1  November 12, 2016 email, the presidents?

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   And who do you --

               4          A.   Now, Greg, or Jeff was not the

               5  president at that -- at the time of this.

               6          Q.   No.  No.  He wasn't at this time,

               7  but he is now --

               8          A.   Right.

               9          Q.   -- correct?

              10             So the two of you are their

              11  presidents of St. Vincent's and St Anne.

              12             Who do you report to?

              13          A.   Currently, I report to

              14  Jim Weidner.

              15          Q.   What is his last name, I'm sorry?

              16          A.   W-E-I-D-N-E-R.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And how about Mr. Dempsey,

              18  do you know who he --

              19          A.   He reports to Jim also.

              20          Q.   And then who does Jim report to?

              21          A.   Bob Baxter.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Then Mr. Baxter reports up

              23  to?

              24          A.   I believe Brian -- no, Don Kline

              25  now.



                                                               171


               1          Q.   Okay.  Mr. Dempsey never --

               2  strike that.

               3             You -- Mr. Dempsey never expressed

               4  to you, following November 12, 2016, that he

               5  believed that Dr. Holland could not stay at

               6  Mercy, right?  He never -- strike that.

               7             Mr. Dempsey never told you that he

               8  had a belief, or it was his idea, that

               9  Dr. Holland not be allowed to stay at Mercy,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   That's really confusing, but I

              12  think I'll just cover it with Jeff -- Jeff had

              13  nothing to do.  I mean, he had nothing to do

              14  with this really.

              15          Q.   Okay.

              16          A.   At this time.  It wouldn't have

              17  been a topic I even would have discussed with

              18  him.

              19          Q.   And then you wrote here also,

              20  you're talking about making Hasan an offer,

              21  correct?  Or at least when he's being made an

              22  offer; is that right?

              23          A.   I don't know if he's been made an

              24  offer, or contemplating an offer, or what --

              25  what the circumstances were at this time.



                                                               172


               1          Q.   I'll show you another exhibit,

               2  which will help, which is Exhibit 40.

               3          A.   40?

               4          Q.   Yes.  It's not a memory quiz.

               5  It's a long time ago --

               6          A.   Yeah.  Yeah.

               7          Q.   -- so Exhibit 40 will help you.

               8             40 is an ongoing chain between

               9  yourself and Mr. Dempsey.  So this adds the

              10  additional conversation between the two of

              11  you.

              12          A.   That I referenced earlier?

              13          Q.   Yes.  So if you see -- if you

              14  look at the bottom of Exhibit 40, you'll see

              15  your email, the one that we were just talking

              16  about.

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   Okay.  And then now it goes up to

              19  Mr. Dempsey, and then it goes up.  And so if

              20  you can just read the rest of the chain, I'll

              21  have some additional questions for you.

              22          A.   You want me to read what Jeff

              23  says, and what I --

              24          Q.   Yeah.

              25          A.   -- then what I say in response?



                                                               173


               1          Q.   Yes, please.

               2          A.   Jeff says, give me a ring

               3  tomorrow.

               4          Q.   No.  You don't have to read it

               5  aloud.

               6          A.   Oh.

               7          Q.   Just to yourself.

               8          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  There is no copy of

              10  40 in this binder.

              11             THE WITNESS:  There is no 40 in

              12  your --

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  No.

              14             THE WITNESS:  Oh.

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Let's go off the

              16  record for a couple of minutes.  We'll make a

              17  copy.

              18             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off record.

              19             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              20  2:18 until 2:21.)

              21             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on record.

              22          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Bertke, we

              23  made a copy for counsel.  And we have before

              24  you Exhibit 40, which is a continuing email

              25  chain between yourself and Mr. Dempsey about



                                                               174


               1  the email drafted we had been talking about

               2  earlier, correct?

               3          A.   Correct.

               4          Q.   Okay.  And Mr. Dempsey advised

               5  you, in part, that he believes your email is

               6  well written and laid out the facts, but he

               7  had a question for context; is that right?

               8          A.   Correct.

               9          Q.   And then this goes up, and so

              10  according to your email, just to be clear, I

              11  was asking you this earlier, you weren't sure

              12  whether or not Hasan had an offer or not yet,

              13  right?

              14          A.   Yeah.  I think I say, my request

              15  is that before something is extended, that we

              16  meet with Nahhas and Toledo Clinic and

              17  communicate our intentions.

              18          Q.   Okay.  And then --

              19          A.   You know, doc -- doctors like to

              20  be involved with things.  They don't -- that's

              21  -- so that's, for me, always kind of critical.

              22          Q.   Now, the next email, I'm just

              23  wondering is this one you wrote, or you

              24  believe that Mr. Dempsey wrote, where it says,

              25  I talked to Imran about it last night.  I



                                                               175


               1  guess we already offered the guy, but he said

               2  he would call Hashmi and have him cover bases

               3  with the clinic.

               4          A.   I believe that was me.

               5          Q.   And then Mr. Dempsey writes back,

               6  cool, correct?

               7          A.   Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.

               8          Q.   So basically you and Mr. Dempsey

               9  were not in the loop on the offer itself,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   And so that would have been done

              13  through the Andrabi-Arquilla decisionmaking,

              14  correct?

              15          A.   Yeah, or through the, you know,

              16  the employed group, and I'm not sure who all

              17  was, you know, involved with running the

              18  employed group at that time.

              19          Q.   Okay.  Okay.  If you can turn to

              20  Exhibit 74, there is some related emails.

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   So -- get a chance to take a look

              23  at that.

              24          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              25          Q.   And first, there is an email



                                                               176


               1  where Dr. Andrabi --

               2          A.   Let me -- let me read this --

               3          Q.   Oh, yeah.

               4          A.   -- this last, this entire part at

               5  the end here.

               6          Q.   Also, to be clear to you, sir,

               7  just so you know, I believe that the last

               8  email that looks a lot like your other one,

               9  but it's not exactly the same.

              10          A.   Yeah.  It looks like maybe I

              11  re-sent it, but it's kind of weird, because it

              12  doesn't have who I sent it to, but --

              13          Q.   Uh-huh.

              14          A.   -- it sounds like I must -- I

              15  mean, I assume this went to Andrabi.  It's --

              16  yeah, essentially says some of the same things

              17  in the previous one.

              18          Q.   Similar things, not necessarily

              19  exactly the same thing, but similar, correct?

              20          A.   It looks that way, yes.

              21          Q.   The comment about blowing things

              22  up is not -- does not appear in this version,

              23  correct?

              24          A.   Correct.  Sounds like I used more

              25  could alienate the Clinic cardiologists, which



                                                               177


               1  is what I essentially meant when the -- with

               2  the blowup comment.

               3          Q.   And you sent this email, it

               4  looks, at least -- you're right, we don't have

               5  here the people you sent it to, but we -- we

               6  -- looks like you sent it to Dr. Andrabi,

               7  because approximately two hours and 11 minutes

               8  later, he responds to your email, correct?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   Brad, the offer has already gone

              11  out.  I will talk to Hashmi, and we'll circle

              12  back with you.  Thanks.  Correct?

              13          A.   Yes.

              14          Q.   Does that assist you in -- in

              15  seeing who it looks like who was involved in

              16  extending the offer?

              17          A.   I don't know who extended it, but

              18  Imran is certainly aware that it went out.

              19          Q.   Okay.  And then you write back,

              20  Greg is shooting to get the meeting tomorrow

              21  night.  And then --

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   -- Dr. Andrabi says, what

              24  meeting, correct?

              25          A.   Yep.



                                                               178


               1          Q.   And then it was a -- a

               2  Hashmi/Nahhas conversation; is that right?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   Then at the top, Andrabi says to

               5  you, is someone talking to Hashmi, so he knows

               6  how to handle the conversation?  You still

               7  want me to have the conversation with him?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Do you recall what that was

              10  about?

              11          A.   Not really.

              12          Q.   Okay.  If you can turn to

              13  Exhibit 36.

              14          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              15          Q.   You're not carbon copied on this

              16  email.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  So I'll object for

              19  foundation.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Now, I'm

              21  trying to give you a -- a date and reference

              22  period by letting you see this email.  This is

              23  November 23rd, 2016, which appears to be just

              24  before Thanksgiving.

              25             Do you see that?



                                                               179


               1          A.   I see the date, yes.

               2          Q.   And it says, Can we get a forum

               3  to discuss our objectives for Jamie in 2017?

               4  He is in significant distress, and we need to

               5  ensure that he lands somewhere, if not FTE, at

               6  St. V's.  Thanks and have a great

               7  Thanksgiving.  And this is written by

               8  Michael D'Eramo, to Thomas Arquilla, Jason

               9  Theadore, and Adam Middleton, correct?  With a

              10  cc to Charles Kopitke?

              11          A.   Uh-huh, yes.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Now, did you notice also,

              13  in this time period, like Mr. D'Eramo did, did

              14  you notice that my client, Dr. Holland, was in

              15  significant distress over what was occurring?

              16          A.   I don't know if I'd say

              17  significant distress, but -- and I don't even

              18  know what was driving it at this time.  Not

              19  sure what might have been, you know, his

              20  issues at this time.

              21          Q.   Okay.

              22          A.   I'm just looking at the date, and

              23  saying it was before -- if you're saying

              24  November 28th was the date that Arquilla gave

              25  notice, it was prior to that, so I'm not sure



                                                               180


               1  what might have been going on specifically on

               2  the 23rd.

               3          Q.   Uh-huh.  Okay.  Next exhibit is

               4  which one, 142.

               5          A.   42, or 142?

               6          Q.   No, 142.  We're going to hand out

               7  another one.

               8             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 142

               9  was marked for identification.)

              10          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Bertke,

              11  just so you're also aware, Exhibit 142 that

              12  I've handed out to you, in the second binder

              13  in Exhibit 107 --

              14          A.   Second binder, 107?

              15          Q.   Yes.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Is part of this email

              18  chain, so that when you see the redacted

              19  portion, if you want to get more context of

              20  what was going on, the unredacted one appears

              21  at 107.  So you can take it out of the book

              22  temporarily, if you'd like.  We could put it

              23  back in later.

              24          A.   Oh.

              25          Q.   You can take that out, if you



                                                               181


               1  want, if you want to compare it.  But what I'm

               2  pointing out to you is the November 27, 2016

               3  email in Exhibit 107, is the same as the one

               4  in Exhibit 142, except the 142 one has the

               5  redacted one.

               6          A.   Okay.  So the -- so the

               7  patient-specific information is redacted in

               8  the 142 version?

               9          Q.   I wouldn't say necessary

              10  patient-specific, but yes, patient -- all --

              11  all references to the patient, the cases and

              12  --

              13          A.   Yes.

              14          Q.   -- the facts of the cases have

              15  been redacted.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   However, I want you to be able to

              18  see it, in case you needed to have context

              19  here about questions I'm asking you, okay?

              20             Now, as we have seen, or as you

              21  have indicated -- strike that.

              22             As you have indicated, if quality

              23  concerns were raised with you about something

              24  that was going on with a surgeon from

              25  St. Vincent's, you would then refer it over to



                                                               182


               1  the St. Vincent people, correct?

               2          A.   Correct.

               3          Q.   So Dr. Holland -- which exhibit

               4  would you like to use right now?  Let's use

               5  107 for a second, okay?

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   Make it a little bit easier.

               8  Just go to his November 27th email for a

               9  second, okay?

              10             And Brad, I thought that I should

              11  bring -- now, his November 27th email from

              12  Dr. Holland is sent to not just you.  It's

              13  also sent to Ed Nahhas, Mike D'Eramo, and also

              14  he appears to carbon copy himself.  Subject:

              15  Value, correct?  But it's addressed to you?

              16          A.   I'm one of the addressees, along

              17  with --

              18          Q.   Okay.

              19          A.   -- Nahhas and D'Eramo, who I

              20  guess he's including for effect.  He's in the

              21  Toledo Clinic.  He's a member of the Toledo

              22  Clinic is -- that's his employer.

              23          Q.   Fair enough.  And then he's

              24  bringing you, in particular, up -- I mean,

              25  he's carbon copying people, but he says, Brad,



                                                               183


               1  I thought that I should bring you up to speed

               2  on the events of this weekend, with the

               3  perspective that there are many ways to view

               4  value.

               5             Correct?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   Next sentence, There were two

               8  returns to OR from Thursday to Sunday, with

               9  one being a serious, adverse event, all with

              10  the same primary surgeon, correct?

              11          A.   That's what he is saying.

              12          Q.   Okay.  And then below this then,

              13  Dr. Holland goes into the case of MB, correct?

              14  And then gives some details there.  And then

              15  goes into patient two, WA, correct?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Okay.

              18          A.   I would just say by past

              19  experience, I wouldn't say I agree with --

              20  these are the actual -- I'm not refuting it,

              21  but I'm just saying I'm not sure this is

              22  factually accurate, but ....

              23          Q.   No.  But you never looked to the

              24  medical records -- I mean, you never looked to

              25  the medical records to see if it was accurate,



                                                               184


               1  correct?

               2          A.   Yeah, that would not be something

               3  I typically do.

               4          Q.   Okay.

               5          A.   We have a process for that, yeah.

               6          Q.   Right.  And but you're aware,

               7  just given what he's referring to, that he's

               8  talking about Dr. Hashmi, correct?

               9          A.   That's who I assumed, yes.

              10          Q.   Okay.  And then coming back to

              11  the version that has, the one I handed out

              12  with Exhibit 142.

              13          A.   Okay.

              14          Q.   Because now we've gone past --

              15  I've skipped over the specific patient

              16  information.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   By the way, prior to moving on,

              19  you would expect that the medical records

              20  should accurately describe what occurred in

              21  them, correct?  With a patient, medical

              22  records should be accurate?

              23          A.   People don't always document

              24  things 100 percent of the time, but generally,

              25  that's your only source of truth.



                                                               185


               1          Q.   They should be accurate?

               2          A.   It's your only source of what

               3  really happened, yes.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Now, coming back to

               5  Exhibit 132 -- or 142, I'm sorry.

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   Which is the one with the

               8  redacted.  So now we're getting past --

               9          A.   I took this one out.  What was --

              10  what was --

              11          Q.   That was --

              12          A.   -- 107.

              13          Q.   -- 107.

              14          A.   All right.  We're on 142?

              15          Q.   Yes, because it will just

              16  continue on from there.  I'm not going to ask

              17  you specific questions about patients.

              18             Dr. Holland continues by saying, It

              19  is no accident that the program at SA's has

              20  low mortality and complication rates.

              21             Did I read that part correctly?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   And you agree with that, that S

              24  -- at St. Anne's --

              25          A.   We had good data.



                                                               186


               1          Q.   Okay.  The next paragraph, it

               2  says, Due to recent discussions, which have

               3  been offered only from a biased and

               4  agenda-driven perspective, I offer the above

               5  as a more realistic portrayal of value.

               6             Did I read that part correctly?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   And Dr. Holland specifically used

               9  the word here biased, correct?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   November 27th is a time period

              12  when we have seen that Dr. Hasan has already

              13  been offered a contract, correct?

              14          A.   If that was the date.

              15          Q.   Yeah.  He's already been offered

              16  a contract by this time, correct?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   Based on what you saw earlier?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   And you've seen other email

              21  talking about Dr. Holland being in distress,

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   And he's pointing out to you that

               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to form.

               2          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- there is a

               3  biased and agenda-driven perspective, correct?

               4          A.   I'm reading the same words you

               5  are.

               6          Q.   Did you ever feel that

               7  Dr. Holland was shy about telling you

               8  anything?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   So do you recall him ever saying

              11  to you, basically words to the effect, or

              12  anything along the lines, it doesn't look

              13  right to me that I'm being replaced with a

              14  Pakistani surgeon of inferior skills?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              16  foundation, and a mischaracterization of the

              17  record.

              18          A.   Can you ask it again?  What was

              19  it?

              20          Q.   Let me -- let me restate it.

              21             Do you recall Dr. Holland saying

              22  anything to you about, you know, this just

              23  doesn't look right to me, that it looks like

              24  I'm being pressured, or something is going to

              25  happen with my contract?  In the meantime,



                                                               188


               1  you're bringing in Dr. Hasan, a doctor from

               2  Pakistan?

               3          A.   I remember the first part of it,

               4  not so much the last part, just meaning -- and

               5  I don't even know if he ever brought up

               6  Dr. Hasan specifically.  He may or may not

               7  have, but I -- I remember the general -- I

               8  remember the general discussions with him that

               9  he feels like I have a good track record in

              10  quality, and so on and so forth, and why --

              11  why would I be under the microscope or -- but

              12  I don't -- I don't remember him --

              13          Q.   Do you --

              14          A.   -- necessarily saying a doctor

              15  from Pakistan.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Do you remember -- okay.

              17             Dr. Holland does not talk generally

              18  in course terms.

              19          A.   Course?

              20          Q.   Street vernacular.

              21          A.   Generally not, no.

              22          Q.   Okay.  And do you recall him

              23  saying something along the lines to you, Brad,

              24  this gentleman, Dr. Hasan, has not even been

              25  practicing medicine in the United States, he's



                                                               189


               1  Pakistani, from Pakistan, what are we doing

               2  here, or words to that effect?  Do you

               3  remember anything along those lines?

               4          A.   Yeah.  There was something about

               5  not practiced in the United States.

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7          A.   And I believe he was practicing

               8  in Pakistan at the time.

               9          Q.   Now, just to be clear, do you

              10  think that the standard of care, and if you

              11  don't know, don't speculate, but do you think

              12  the standard of care in Pakistan is the same

              13  as in the United States?

              14          A.   I have no idea.

              15          Q.   Okay.  Now, do you recall an

              16  incident where Dr. Bruhl was reprimanded by

              17  the chief medical officer?

              18          A.   Dr. Bruhl?

              19          Q.   Yes.

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   Do you know --

              22          A.   Well, he was the chief -- the

              23  chief --

              24          Q.   Steven Bruhl?

              25          A.   Yeah.  He was the chief medical



                                                               190


               1  officer.

               2          Q.   The CMO was the gentleman you

               3  mentioned earlier.

               4          A.   Tom Welch?

               5          Q.   Tom Welch.

               6          A.   No, I don't remember anything

               7  about that.

               8          Q.   Do you recall Mr. -- Dr. -- Mr.

               9  Welch becoming involved in an issue having to

              10  do with Steven Bruhl attempting to prevent

              11  Dr. Holland from performing surgery on a

              12  patient?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   And do you -- were you ever

              15  informed that a patient was in need of

              16  emergent surgery, that both Dr. Phillips and

              17  Dr. Holland agreed with that, but that

              18  Dr. Bruhl, from Tiffin, Ohio, had attempted to

              19  prevent that surgery from going forward,

              20  instead he wanted Dr. Hasan to return from

              21  vacation two days later?

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Dr. Hashmi.

              23          A.   Oh, Doctor --

              24          Q.   Oh, okay.

              25          A.   Dr. Hashmi?



                                                               191


               1          Q.   Yes.

               2          A.   Not Hasan?

               3          Q.   Yes, Dr. Hashmi, I'm sorry.

               4          A.   I -- I -- if I got it, I got it

               5  second or thirdhand.  I don't remember

               6  anything about it.

               7          Q.   Do -- do you know a gentleman

               8  named Randy King?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   Do you know whether Randy King

              11  provided Dr. Bruhl with a reprimand pertaining

              12  to his attempts to interfere with an emergent

              13  surgery?

              14          A.   No.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to form.

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You don't have

              17  any information about that one way or the

              18  other, correct?

              19          A.   It might sound vaguely familiar.

              20  If I got it, it was third, fourth hand, not --

              21  I wasn't -- it must have happened at St. V's.

              22          Q.   Do you agree with me that in

              23  terms of value, it's not just the -- strike

              24  that.

              25             Did -- did -- was Dr. Holland, to



                                                               192


               1  your knowledge, in November of 2016, being

               2  evaluated based upon the quantity of his work,

               3  as opposed to the quality?

               4          A.   I would suppose, like most

               5  surgeons, it was -- it was both.

               6          Q.   Okay.  And towards the end here,

               7  he notes, this is on page 3197.

               8          A.   Okay.

               9          Q.   Well, let's go to the last page,

              10  3198.

              11          A.   Okay.

              12          Q.   I hope that the above provokes

              13  the thought necessary to see the unique

              14  quality and nature of the program at

              15  St. Anne's, and everyone who has made possible

              16  the success we have enjoyed.  Like any other

              17  startup, the last two years have allowed us to

              18  develop an infrastructure upon which to build

              19  a thriving program in the future.  Regards,

              20  Jamie.

              21             Now, did I read that portion

              22  correctly?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   Now, this is where I wanted to

              25  refer you to, is the next email up in the



                                                               193


               1  chain.  So this is November 27th at 7:28 p.m.,

               2  correct?

               3          A.   Oh.

               4          Q.   The one with the redacted

               5  section, Jamie Holland, to you and others,

               6  November 27th, 2016.

               7          A.   Okay.  It's the same email.

               8          Q.   7:28 p.m.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   You see that?

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   Now, turn up to the next page,

              13  you have a response that you write on

              14  November 28th at 10:34 a.m.

              15             Do you see that?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   And this document notes

              18  attorney-client.

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   Now, if you can flip back to

              21  Exhibit 107 for a second, because there is one

              22  difference between these.  If you --

              23  Exhibit 107, for reference.  Keep 142 out.

              24  I'll show you something.

              25          A.   Keep 142 out?



                                                               194


               1          Q.   Yeah.

               2          A.   Okay.  I got it right here.

               3          Q.   Yeah.  We'll keep using it,

               4  because you have the top response.

               5          A.   Okay.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Now, you have written --

               7  on Exhibit 142, this is the one with the MSV

               8  003195 in the bottom corner.  That's the

               9  document produced by Mercy, okay?

              10  Exhibit 142.

              11          A.   Exhibit 142.

              12          Q.   You see a stamp in the bottom

              13  right-hand corner.  That's --

              14          A.   Okay.

              15          Q.   -- a document produced by Mercy.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And that's the one I

              18  pointed out to you that says attorney-client,

              19  right?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   And you had indicated earlier

              22  that, you know, that it looked a little weird

              23  to you, because you didn't see who was carbon

              24  copied on an email earlier.  Do you remember

              25  when you pointed that out?



                                                               195


               1          A.   Not -- not specifically, but --

               2          Q.   Okay.  But this one says

               3  10:34 a.m., and this is from you to

               4  Dr. Holland.

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Now, if you look at

               7  Exhibit 107.

               8          A.   Oh, I see cc Deb Morelli.  Okay.

               9          Q.   All right.  Correct.  That's what

              10  I was pointing out to you.  It took me a long

              11  time to get that, but ... Debbie Morelli is

              12  cc'd on this email you write to Dr. Holland

              13  the next morning, correct?

              14          A.   Correct.

              15          Q.   All right.  Does that indicate to

              16  you that -- strike that.

              17             Do you normally, on your own

              18  accord, without input from someone else, like

              19  an attorney, or others, write attorney-client

              20  on an email?

              21          A.   Very rarely, but I do do it

              22  occasionally.

              23          Q.   Do you believe that it would be

              24  more -- more likely that you had spoken to

              25  someone at Mercy -- put it to you this way.



                                                               196


               1  You have 7:28 p.m. on November 27th,

               2  Dr. Holland is sending you documentation about

               3  two more patients and Dr. Hashmi.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   And then by the next morning at

               6  10:34 a.m., you're writing him back,

               7  attorney-client, cc'ing an attorney, okay?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Does that indicate to you,

              10  consistent with what you said earlier, that if

              11  a quality concern was raised by Dr. Holland,

              12  that implicated someone in another

              13  institution, that you were then referring it

              14  back to that institution for --

              15          A.   Not -- this is probably not the

              16  way that I referred it on to another

              17  institution.  Deb -- Deb Morelli typically

              18  dealt with all our medical staff, legal issues

              19  with peer review, and any issues related to

              20  physician disruptive behavior, so any

              21  physician review items.

              22             So in this particular circumstance,

              23  I cc'd her probably because these were quality

              24  and care issues.  One of my concerns with

              25  this, in addition to the patient care items



                                                               197


               1  that are brought up, is why is Dr. Holland

               2  sending this in an email to me?  This is not

               3  typical.  This is not the way we typically do

               4  quality reviews on doctors, or -- or inspect

               5  quality of care items.

               6          Q.   Do you believe --

               7          A.   I mean, I -- I can't tell you if

               8  I've ever gotten another doctor, from another

               9  doctor, an email to me about, with this level

              10  of detail and so on and so forth, from another

              11  doctor.  This is very atypical, so I wanted

              12  Deb to just be aware of -- of the email that

              13  came to me.

              14             In terms of referring it, and I

              15  think I say that in here, you know, look, the

              16  one -- I think the one -- the one SSI happened

              17  here, so that would go through our review

              18  here.  The other item, the first case, you

              19  know, that needs to go over to V's.

              20          Q.   Is one of the reasons that --

              21  that this could be an atypical response is

              22  because Dr. Holland kept being ignored when he

              23  was raising quality concerns about Dr. Hashmi

              24  with others?

              25          A.   You'd have to ask him, but it



                                                               198


               1  could be one of the reasons, I suppose.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Do you ever recall

               3  receiving an email like this from Dr. Holland

               4  before November 27th, 2016?

               5          A.   Similar emails maybe, yes.

               6          Q.   With details about patients?

               7          A.   Not that I recall, no.

               8          Q.   So in terms of regarding this as

               9  atypical, you did, you thought this was

              10  atypical of Dr. Holland's communications with

              11  you even, correct?

              12          A.   A little bit, yeah.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And then one of the things

              14  that was written back to Dr. Holland --

              15  Holland is that you wrote, At a minimum, for

              16  this type of email containing patient

              17  information, please use your Mercy email, in

              18  order to make sure this information is

              19  properly protected from an IT standpoint.

              20          A.   Yeah.  I mean, you know, when

              21  you're using your private email account,

              22  things can get hacked into.  The Mercy emails

              23  have a higher level of protection.

              24          Q.   But if he uses his own email, he

              25  can also keep copies without stamps of



                                                               199


               1  redactions, right?  Like he did.

               2          A.   I suppose.

               3          Q.   Okay.  With the facts about what

               4  occurred with these patients?

               5          A.   (Witness nods head.)

               6          Q.   You don't -- you don't have any

               7  reason to think that Dr. Holland took these

               8  patients and fed them to Plaintiff attorneys,

               9  so they could file lawsuits against the

              10  institution, correct?

              11          A.   No.  I have no --

              12          Q.   And you have no --

              13          A.   -- basis for that.

              14          Q.   -- and you have no reason to

              15  think that in any case that he reported about

              16  quality concerns with Dr. Hashmi, that he's

              17  ever fed potential clients to Plaintiffs, so

              18  that they could sue Mercy, correct?

              19          A.   I have no knowledge of that.

              20          Q.   You never seen any, or never

              21  heard anything, you know, coming from outside

              22  the institution, that Dr. Holland's being

              23  malicious, and he's trying to cause lawsuits

              24  against the center, us, right?

              25          A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.



                                                               200


               1          Q.   Okay.  So you had a pretty good

               2  -- you knew from Dr. Holland's perspective

               3  that he thought he had a pretty good

               4  relationship with you, correct?

               5          A.   Yeah.

               6          Q.   He respected you and your

               7  opinion --

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   -- correct?

              10             He would ask you your opinion on

              11  things, correct?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And so here he is writing

              14  you an atypical thing about a couple of

              15  patients, correct?

              16          A.   Correct.

              17          Q.   And then you involve Ms. Morelli,

              18  and who was she -- who was she employed by, to

              19  your knowledge?

              20          A.   She was employed by Mercy.

              21          Q.   Okay.  Now, I know you weren't

              22  involved in the decision to terminate

              23  Dr. Holland's services agreement, but I have

              24  represented to you that it was on

              25  November 28th.  And this is correct, and you



                                                               201


               1  can look at it, if you'd like, it's

               2  Exhibit 106.

               3          A.   Okay.

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to the

               5  reference of Dr. Holland's service agreement.

               6             MR. ARCHINACO:  Sorry.  I'm going

               7  to strike my question, because it wasn't even

               8  complete.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) If you can

              10  just turn to Exhibit 106, please.

              11          A.   (Doing as indicated.) 106, yeah.

              12          Q.   So in Exhibit 106, this is the --

              13  a letter giving the intent from Thomas

              14  Arquilla, Interim President, November 28,

              15  2016, to Toledo Clinic, correct?

              16          A.   Correct.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And do you know how it got

              18  from -- or strike that.

              19             Do you know what -- what type of

              20  discussions, if any, Ms. Morelli had with

              21  Mr. Arquilla on November 28th, the day that

              22  you advised Dr. Holland he should be having

              23  attorney-client communications?

              24          A.   Am I aware of any discussions

              25  between --



                                                               202


               1          Q.   Yeah.

               2          A.   -- the two of them?  No.

               3          Q.   So do you know what -- why it

               4  was, of all days, that Tom Arquilla chose

               5  November 28, 2016 to be the day to terminate?

               6          A.   No.

               7          Q.   You were not given any advance

               8  notice that that was going to occur on the

               9  28th, correct?

              10          A.   On the date?  Like I said, I was

              11  probably given a heads up, but in terms of the

              12  specific date, no.

              13          Q.   Well, do you think you were given

              14  notice before the actual day that it occurred?

              15          A.   Probably.

              16          Q.   You had an understanding that

              17  something was going to change, correct?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19          Q.   You just didn't know when it was

              20  going to change?

              21          A.   Didn't know -- yeah.

              22          Q.   In fact, what appears from the

              23  email is like you were in favor of working out

              24  some type of arrangement with Dr. Holland, or

              25  new agreement.  The terms were just going to



                                                               203


               1  change.

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               3  mischaracterization.

               4          A.   Yeah.  I don't know.  That's

               5  probably a little broad to agree to, but ....

               6          Q.   Well, I mean, in your November

               7  emails that we looked at already, it showed

               8  that Dr. Holland could stay, just the

               9  agreement is going to change.  You want to --

              10          A.   Yeah, as if there may not be one

              11  at all, but yeah, you know?

              12          Q.   Is that really what you were

              13  saying?

              14          A.   That's what I was saying.

              15          Q.   You were getting a little tricky

              16  with your language.  You were saying that the

              17  agreement is going to change and he could

              18  stay, but there may not be anything at all?

              19  You were trying to be clever like that?

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              21          A.   I -- I -- I had no idea, a

              22  preconceived notion of what an arrangement

              23  might be.

              24          Q.   But you were talking to the

              25  cardiologists at Toledo Clinic about the fact



                                                               204


               1  that Dr. Holland can stay, but it's just the

               2  agreement will change, right?

               3          A.   Yeah, but I, under the concept of

               4  changing, it could have been this is just

               5  going to go away.

               6          Q.   Okay.  So -- so when you were

               7  telling them, did you think you were trying to

               8  be clever or mislead them, because --

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   -- what you really meant is this

              11  could entirely go away, when what you were

              12  really saying is he can stay, just under

              13  different terms?

              14          A.   Yeah, one of those terms could

              15  just be he's, you know, on his own, but I -- I

              16  didn't have a preconceived notion that we were

              17  going to have any agreement going forward.

              18          Q.   If you can look at Exhibit 142

              19  again, please.

              20          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              21          Q.   And then not to belabor, but

              22  Dr. Holland wrote you back another response

              23  after your attorney-client email, correct?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   In this email, he stated to you,



                                                               205


               1  in the center, I apologize for my -- for my

               2  awkward attempts to promote what I believe to

               3  be obvious.  That is, I am a proven operator

               4  who is efficient, consistent, knowledgeable

               5  and capable and available who cares about the

               6  patient.

               7          A.   I don't know exactly where you're

               8  at, but ....

               9          Q.   Okay.  Did you ever write

              10  Dr. Holland back after this November 28th

              11  email?

              12          A.   Not that I recall.

              13          Q.   Is there any reason you didn't?

              14          A.   Not -- not particularly.

              15          Q.   If you can go back to

              16  Exhibit 104, please, in the binder.

              17          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              18          Q.   And just so you know, why don't

              19  we just use Exhibit 105, because it has a more

              20  complete chain, but you can note --

              21          A.   Exhibit 105?  Okay.

              22          Q.   Yeah, 105, I think, is more

              23  complete.  It has additional emails.  It's the

              24  same thing at the bottom.

              25          A.   Starts with -- okay.



                                                               206


               1          Q.   With you, at the bottom, on

               2  November 28th at 4:35 p.m. to Greg Hood and

               3  Jason Theadore.  Correct?

               4          A.   Yes.

               5          Q.   Subject:  Toledo Clinic.

               6             By the way, who is Mr. Theadore

               7  again?

               8          A.   I don't remember his exact title,

               9  but he was -- kind of replaced Tom in that

              10  business development area.  And he had the

              11  service line administrators reporting to him,

              12  so --

              13          Q.   He was a Mercy employee?

              14          A.   He was a Mercy employee.

              15          Q.   And then you wrote to Mr. Hood,

              16  on this day, When do you plan on meeting with

              17  D'Eramo regarding agreement for Dr. Holland?

              18  Thanks.

              19          A.   So that -- I don't know what it

              20  meant specifically, but -- so on the 28th is

              21  the date we gave notice, so probably was

              22  asking Greg, and Jason, when are you going to

              23  go meet with the clinic to talk to them about

              24  this.

              25          Q.   Well, it actually says, When do



                                                               207


               1  you plan on meeting with D'Eramo regarding

               2  agreement for Dr. Holland.

               3          A.   Okay.

               4          Q.   Correct?

               5          A.   Correct.

               6          Q.   Okay.  So at least as of

               7  4:35 p.m. on November 28th, 2016, you had the

               8  belief that there was going to be an agreement

               9  with Dr. Holland; is that right?

              10          A.   Yeah.  I think the two things we

              11  were kind of kicking around was we still

              12  needed a regional call agreement, and then we

              13  had -- Dr. Holland was participating in our

              14  cardiac management agreement.  And there was a

              15  way we could change that around to get him,

              16  modify a little bit the way he was reimbursed

              17  in that.  Those were the two things that were

              18  kind of discussed.

              19          Q.   I pointed out to you earlier, in

              20  Exhibit 22, which was a November 12th email,

              21  you're welcome to go back again, but I'm just

              22  saying this for context.

              23          A.   I'm sorry, what exhibit?

              24          Q.   Exhibit 22.

              25          A.   Okay.



                                                               208


               1          Q.   From November 12, 2016.  What you

               2  said to Mr. Dempsey, I explained Holland can

               3  stay, but the Mercy/Clinic agreement will

               4  change.  We have a plan for this transition.

               5  Correct?

               6          A.   Yep.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Now, fast forwarding to

               8  Exhibit 105, as of November 28th, we've just

               9  referenced this potential, this agreement for

              10  Dr. Holland that you're telling Mr. Hood --

              11  strike that.

              12             You're asking Mr. Hood when he

              13  plans on meeting with Mr. D'Eramo about an

              14  agreement for Holland, correct?

              15          A.   Correct.

              16          Q.   And then Mr. Theadore writes

              17  back, That all TC leadership is out of the

              18  country this week.  We'll know more next week.

              19             And then you write back, I'm going

              20  to talk to Holland.  He's fishing everyone for

              21  info, so I will give him some info, tell him

              22  more to come.

              23             Correct?

              24          A.   Correct.

              25          Q.   Okay.  And then -- so basically



                                                               209


               1  what was happening is Dr. Holland's, the

               2  service agreement's been terminated.  Now he's

               3  trying to figure out what is going on --

               4          A.   Yes.

               5          Q.   -- is that right?

               6          A.   That's what I would assume.

               7          Q.   And did he seem to be emotionally

               8  distressed to you at that time?

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, term,

              10  form.

              11          A.   I don't know if I've really seen

              12  Dr. Holland very emotionally distressed.

              13  That's not what I -- what I would have

              14  characterized it as, no.

              15          Q.   Was he upset?

              16          A.   He might have been.  I don't

              17  really remember.

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Is this a time you

              19  want to take a quick break?

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  Yes.  One more, one

              21  more document, and then this will be great.

              22  143.

              23          A.   143?

              24          Q.   Yes.

              25             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 143



                                                               210


               1  was marked for identification.)

               2          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Is this an

               3  email that you wrote to yourself?

               4          A.   Yeah.

               5          Q.   On January 25th, 2017, cardiac

               6  surgery call?

               7          A.   Yep.  So sometimes when I'm

               8  writing, drafting something, I'll send it to

               9  myself, so I can work on it later.

              10          Q.   Or could it -- could it serve as

              11  a memo to the file, in a sense?

              12          A.   Maybe.  I don't remember exactly

              13  why I did it, but ....

              14          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  But just

              15  before we take the break, I know a break has

              16  been requested, so we'll take a break.

              17             But you see here that as -- it says

              18  January 25, 2017, you're noting that there are

              19  3.5 practitioners budgeted to CT surgery

              20  practice?

              21          A.   Okay.  Yes.

              22          Q.   Okay.  So as of January 2017,

              23  there was Dr. Hashmi, Dr. Phillips.  But now

              24  we know that Dr. Holland is -- his service

              25  agreement is --



                                                               211


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Object to service

               2  agreement.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- by which

               4  he's -- by which he's providing services,

               5  pursuant to Toledo Clinic, that's been given

               6  notice, right?

               7          A.   Yeah, I -- I couldn't hear with

               8  the objection, but ....

               9          Q.   Okay.  Well, put it to you this

              10  way:  There was a budget for 3.5 surgeons,

              11  according to what you were documenting here.

              12          A.   As I understood it, yeah.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And even if Dr. Hasan had

              14  come on board, that would have only been

              15  three, correct?

              16          A.   Correct.

              17          Q.   Hasan.  Okay.  And Hasan never

              18  actually came on board, correct?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Take the break now.  Thank

              21  you.

              22          A.   Okay.

              23             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record.

              24             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              25  3:03 until 3:14.)



                                                               212


               1             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on

               2  record.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Okay.  Next

               4  exhibit is one -- oh, we were on, yeah, 144 is

               5  next exhibit, please.

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  134?

               7             THE REPORTER:  144.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  144.  Okay.

               9             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 144

              10  was marked for identification.)

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) This is --

              12  these are redacted minute meetings from

              13  December 20 of 2016.  Do you see that?

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   Appears that you were present?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Do you see anyone that was -- do

              18  you know why Dr. Andrabi was excused?

              19          A.   I don't know if he came to every

              20  meeting, but I don't -- I don't recall.

              21          Q.   And now, December 20th, if you

              22  flip to the second page, Brad asked for input

              23  regarding how to structure a call agreement

              24  for Dr. Holland.

              25          A.   Yes.  This could have been one of



                                                               213


               1  the things I was referencing earlier, Jason,

               2  when you brought up the, you know, the

               3  agreement would change, well, this was one of

               4  the things in play.

               5          Q.   I didn't mean to -- I just wanted

               6  them to close the door.

               7          A.   No, no problem.

               8          Q.   Little distracting.

               9          A.   The dog.

              10          Q.   Sorry.  We had a dog --

              11          A.   The dog better be careful, or

              12  he's going to be dead, bud.

              13          Q.   Mr. Bertke, all I can tell you is

              14  that there is a very famous, there is a very

              15  famous video.  There is a -- there is a very

              16  famous video of a gentleman named Irving

              17  Younger, who passed away young.  He was a law

              18  professor, and he taught the ten commandments

              19  of cross-examination.  And during his

              20  recording of his big event at like Red Rocks

              21  in Colorado, a dog literally comes in, during

              22  his big speech, in the video, makes its

              23  appearance, and then make its exit, so you are

              24  --

              25          A.   Animal always steals the show.



                                                               214


               1          Q.   -- now -- you are now on par with

               2  --

               3          A.   That's the great Irving Young, or

               4  whoever you said?

               5          Q.   The dog stopped in on your

               6  deposition.  Sorry.  So you'll -- you'll get a

               7  kick of looking him up or Wikipedia'g him

               8  later.

               9          A.   Right.

              10          Q.   Irving Younger.

              11          A.   Irving Younger.

              12          Q.   Irving Younger.  Great -- great

              13  teacher.

              14             In any event, so what's being

              15  referenced in these notes from December of

              16  2016 is in fact what you were referencing

              17  earlier with regard to a call agreement,

              18  correct?

              19          A.   Correct.  This is one of the ways

              20  I would say, maybe in reference to what we

              21  were talking about earlier, that the agreement

              22  may change.  You know, I would describe this

              23  as a pretty big change, so, you know, this is

              24  essentially a call agreement, as compared to

              25  the other thing, which is kind of a



                                                               215


               1  full-fledged PSA, professional services

               2  agreement.

               3          Q.   And when you say a big change,

               4  what do you mean by that?  Financially, it

               5  would be a big difference?

               6          A.   Well, it's just a total different

               7  breadth of services.

               8          Q.   How about financially?

               9          A.   Yeah, it would have been

              10  different dollars for sure.

              11          Q.   How much do you recall was being

              12  paid under the services agreement for

              13  Dr. Holland's services through Toledo Clinic?

              14          A.   I -- I would be guessing.  There

              15  -- it would be somewhere in the documents

              16  somewhere.

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Don't guess.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You'll defer

              19  to whatever the document says, correct?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Would it be fair to believe that

              22  he was being provided compensation in excess

              23  of 500,000 a year?

              24          A.   That's a number I'd probably

              25  think about, yeah.



                                                               216


               1          Q.   Okay.  And then in terms of a

               2  call agreement, what type of -- if Dr. Holland

               3  had a call agreement in place, how frequently

               4  would he be taking call, to your knowledge?

               5          A.   It would depend, ultimately, how,

               6  you know, often, you know, people were off,

               7  and what the rotation of the call was, so it

               8  could vary.

               9          Q.   And as I showed you earlier in

              10  Exhibit 143, there was a budget in place for

              11  three and a half practitioners, correct?

              12          A.   Correct.

              13          Q.   So there was no budget --

              14  budgetary reason per se that a call agreement

              15  could not be reached with Dr. Holland,

              16  correct?

              17          A.   There appeared to be dollars

              18  allocated.  I will tell you, you know, as Greg

              19  will attest, as soon as the January books

              20  close, we're officially behind budget, and we

              21  need to figure out ways to improve our run

              22  rate.  So we don't spend dollars just because

              23  they're budgeted.  I'll leave it at that.  It

              24  needs to be real need.

              25          Q.   If you look at Exhibits 108 and



                                                               217


               1  109 together.

               2          A.   Can I -- are we done on 1 -- I'm

               3  sorry, I know you're --

               4          Q.   On the minutes?

               5          A.   144?

               6          Q.   I believe so, so if you would

               7  like to put them to the side.

               8          A.   Okay.  Can I add something to --

               9          Q.   Sure.

              10          A.   Okay.  I mean, the -- the only

              11  thing I would note here is this -- this is

              12  kind of a lifestyle issue, where the surgeon

              13  saw value in Dr. Holland participating in a

              14  regional call.  We always had one surgeon on

              15  call for the region, and they covered both

              16  St. Anne's and St. Vincent's.  And you can see

              17  Tom notes on here, he really wanted to see one

              18  agreement for participation and a regional

              19  call agreement rotation, so ....

              20          Q.   So it's more than just quality of

              21  life for the surgeons.  It also impacts

              22  potential safety care to have a third surgeon

              23  on call, correct?

              24          A.   No.  We never had -- oh.  We

              25  never had -- we never had a third surgeon on



                                                               218


               1  call.  You mean to have a third in the

               2  rotation?

               3          Q.   Yes.  There is -- there is --

               4  normally, there appeared to be a three, a

               5  minimum of a three-person rotation, absent

               6  some small time periods --

               7          A.   Correct.

               8          Q.   -- of change.  And that wasn't

               9  just set up for quality of life.  That's also

              10  set up for quality of care for the patients;

              11  isn't that right?

              12          A.   I suppose, if you want to go the

              13  -- go the route of doctors on call every other

              14  night is in a demanding service, like

              15  cardiovascular surgery, it's probably best,

              16  from a fatigue standpoint and so forth, to

              17  keep the rotation, you know, keep -- have a

              18  rotation that is more than one and two, if

              19  that's what you're referencing.

              20          Q.   Yes.  So and that was what you

              21  typically had seen at Mercy; isn't that

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Yeah.  I think from the time, at

              24  least that Anne's had the program, we had

              25  three doctors in the rotation, maybe with the



                                                               219


               1  exception of the time if there was a gap

               2  between Burdine's departure and Phillips'

               3  beginning.  And we might have been in a one

               4  and two.

               5          Q.   And there might have been a

               6  period in there, I can't recall with him, but

               7  there might have been a period in there where

               8  Dr. Burdine was, although present in the sense

               9  that he was still not officially retired, he

              10  may have been sick and not performing, so you

              11  may -- that may be accurate.  There may have

              12  been a period --

              13          A.   Yeah.

              14          Q.   -- where there was only two.

              15          A.   And we're actually on a one and

              16  two right now.

              17          Q.   Right.

              18          A.   So Dr. Dibardino and Dr. Phillips

              19  are covering the service, and have been for

              20  probably two months.  I think for periods of

              21  time, as long as the doctors know there is a

              22  light at the end of the tunnel, they'll --

              23  they'll work with you.

              24          Q.   Do you know of any reason that

              25  you can think of that if Dr. Holland applied



                                                               220


               1  for the open position that he wouldn't be

               2  considered?

               3          A.   He may be considered.  I don't --

               4  I think it would be a long shot he would --

               5  you mean a current open position?

               6          Q.   Yes.

               7          A.   Probably be a long shot he'd get

               8  it, but ....

               9          Q.   Why do you think it would be a

              10  long shot with -- if -- if I -- if what I said

              11  to you is accurate, that Dr. Kabour and his --

              12  a number of his people in his group appear

              13  supportive, Dr. Nahhas appeared previously to

              14  be supportive of him, why would it be a long

              15  shot for him to get the job?

              16          A.   I don't know.  I don't know if I,

              17  you know, so if we did a round robin of

              18  interviews, and through that process, you

              19  know, I -- I would be surprised if the Kabour

              20  group would end up -- if there were other

              21  candidates to be evaluated and looked at, that

              22  they would pick Dr. Holland.  I'd be surprised

              23  by that.

              24             And then, you know, from St. Anne's

              25  perspective, right now, at the time, Toledo



                                                               221


               1  Clinic was doing virtually all the elective

               2  cardiac caths there, where right now,

               3  Dr. Maly is -- which was not the case when

               4  Dr. Holland was there -- Dr. Maly is no longer

               5  a ProMedica-employed physician.  He's

               6  independent.  And Dr. Hussein's doing most of

               7  his cath work at St. Anne's right now.

               8             And I can just tell you from

               9  hallway conversations, that they would not

              10  support Dr. Holland's return.

              11          Q.   Dr. Hussein?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   And what is his first name?

              14          A.   He goes by Phil, but I believe

              15  his real name is Fadhil.

              16          Q.   And what makes you believe that

              17  Dr. Hussein is no -- not a supportive person

              18  of Dr. Holland?

              19          A.   Comments he's made.

              20          Q.   Do you know whether or not

              21  Dr. Hussein ever served as a reference for

              22  Dr. Holland?

              23          A.   A reference, no.

              24          Q.   Do you know whether Dr. Hussein

              25  used to refer cases to Dr. Holland before he



                                                               222


               1  left?

               2          A.   Before he left this most

               3  recently?

               4          Q.   Yes.  Before he left this most

               5  recently, did Dr. Hussein refer cases to

               6  Dr. Holland?

               7          A.   He may have, not very frequently,

               8  by what he is telling me.  And I don't mean

               9  Holland.  I mean by what Dr. Hussein is

              10  telling me.

              11          Q.   So have there been conversations

              12  recently, where you have had hallway

              13  conversations with physicians about the

              14  potential of Dr. Holland returning?

              15          A.   No.  I would say it's been more

              16  -- you have to know Phil Hussein a little bit,

              17  but it's been more him saying, you know, how

              18  do I phrase it?  Him more questioning how we

              19  ever got Holland in the first place.  I guess

              20  I'll leave it at that.

              21          Q.   And how long has Dr. Hussein been

              22  in any way associated with the hospital?

              23          A.   Now, he's had privileges for as

              24  long as I remember.

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  That's one of the



                                                               223


               1  depositions you didn't take.  Your co-counsel

               2  took.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Did -- did you

               4  -- did you have a conversation with

               5  Dr. Hussein, where you told him he couldn't be

               6  the chief, because he was too disruptive of a

               7  person?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   Did you have conversations with

              10  Dr. Hussein about why he couldn't be the

              11  chief?

              12          A.   I don't think he was ever in the

              13  running for the chief.

              14          Q.   Is there a reason he was never in

              15  the running for the chief?

              16          A.   Not necessarily.  He had -- I

              17  worked more with the Clinic on it, on the

              18  original setup of the agreement.  And I don't

              19  -- I don't know what you mean by chief, but

              20  ....

              21          Q.   Chief of --

              22          A.   Maybe I should have --

              23          Q.   Chief of cardiology?

              24          A.   Chief of cardiology is appointed

              25  by the -- the department chair of medicine.



                                                               224


               1  It's not my position to give.

               2          Q.   Well, who is the chief of

               3  cardiology currently at St. Anne's?

               4          A.   Dr. Al-Bawab.

               5          Q.   Now, in terms of Dr. Hussein,

               6  does he refer -- refer patients to ProMedica,

               7  to your knowledge?

               8          A.   He previously referred most his

               9  -- yes.  His -- his surgeries to ProMedica.

              10          Q.   And what volume of surgeries does

              11  he currently refer to St. Anne's or to Mercy,

              12  to your knowledge?

              13          A.   I'd have to go back and see how

              14  many open hearts he's referred this year.  I

              15  would -- well, I would be guessing, I guess.

              16          Q.   Does he refer more or less than

              17  Dr. Kabour's group?

              18          A.   At St. Anne's or at Mercy?

              19          Q.   St. Anne's, first St. Anne's?

              20          A.   I would say more.

              21          Q.   And how about Mercy?

              22          A.   I would say Kabour's group is

              23  bigger across all of Mercy.  I mean, Phil

              24  Hussein is a solo practitioner.  Dr. Kabour's

              25  group is 9 to 10 or whatever.



                                                               225


               1          Q.   Okay.

               2          A.   Yeah.

               3          Q.   Yeah.  And I was just trying to

               4  figure out whether or not -- I didn't see

               5  Dr. Hussein's name in any of these emails,

               6  where you invited him to meetings to get --

               7  meetings to get his perspective on anything?

               8          A.   He came to meetings initially.

               9  He kind of self-selected out of the process.

              10  Back in '14, yeah, when we started the

              11  program, he kind of self-selected, and just

              12  didn't get real involved with it until about

              13  mid-last year he started coming and bringing

              14  his elective cath work.

              15          Q.   Well, in terms of the November

              16  meetings we looked at earlier, you had invited

              17  Dr. Kabour and Nahhas, in November of 2016,

              18  you invited Kabour and Nahhas, when it came

              19  time to talking about CT surgeons, correct?

              20          A.   That's correct.

              21          Q.   Does Dr. Kabour and Dr. Nahhas

              22  still have that type of status at the -- at

              23  Mercy, such that they would be invited to

              24  consider CT surgical candidates?

              25          A.   I would say so, yeah.



                                                               226


               1          Q.   So, for example, if -- this is

               2  just hypothetical at this point.  If

               3  Dr. Kabour and Dr. Nahhas both supported

               4  Dr. Holland's rehiring, if he applied for the

               5  position, would that carry substantial weight

               6  with the organization?

               7          A.   It would certainly be a factor to

               8  consider, yes.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And, you know, you have

              10  noted earlier that there were tensions prior,

              11  previously with Dr. Kabour's group and

              12  Dr. Holland, correct?

              13          A.   Correct.

              14          Q.   But if those were able to be

              15  remedied, legitimately, and Dr. Kabour lent

              16  his support, would you see that as a pos --

              17  that you would see that as a positive thing

              18  for considering Dr. Holland for potential

              19  rehire, correct?

              20          A.   I think similar to what we were

              21  suggesting back in, you know, August, which

              22  is, you know, we want the key constituents

              23  involved in any evaluation of a candidate --

              24          Q.   Uh-huh.

              25          A.   -- Nahhas, Kabour's group.  I



                                                               227


               1  would certainly include Phil Hussein in that

               2  right now.  Our nurse manager, people, you

               3  know, the operating manager, so all the people

               4  that were involved, because I have some -- I

               5  have an understanding of the way things,

               6  Dr. Holland interacted with staff.  They may

               7  not be 100 percent accurate.  I'd like them to

               8  be re-involved.  You know, involved with any

               9  evaluation of any candidate.

              10          Q.   Okay.

              11          A.   Including if Dr. Holland were in

              12  that process.

              13          Q.   If we were -- if we were seated

              14  in table in terms of decisionmakers, or people

              15  with influence about bringing Dr. Holland

              16  back, or considering him for a CT surgery

              17  position, you would at least consider that

              18  Dr. Kabour and Dr. Nahhas would be consulted?

              19          A.   They would certainly be --

              20          Q.   Okay.

              21          A.   -- in the -- in the

              22  consideration, yes.

              23          Q.   You would also indicate, you

              24  would probably also consult with Dr. Hussein,

              25  at least as to St. Anne's, correct?



                                                               228


               1          A.   Certainly.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Does he refer many

               3  patients to St. Vincent?

               4          A.   I -- no.

               5          Q.   So, and then in terms of -- in

               6  terms of doctors, or doctors, Dr. Phillips is

               7  still with the organization.  Would you think

               8  that he would have some type of say as well?

               9          A.   Yeah.  The CT surgeons or, you

              10  know, potential partners, right, so yes.

              11          Q.   So do you know -- do you believe,

              12  or do you know that Dr. Phillips still has a

              13  positive relationship with Dr. Holland as of

              14  this day?

              15          A.   I have no knowledge of that.

              16          Q.   Okay.  I'll represent to you that

              17  I believe he does have a positive relationship

              18  with him to this day.  But, he would at least

              19  have some type of input into this, to such a

              20  discussion, correct?

              21          A.   Yeah.

              22          Q.   Okay.  And then also --

              23          A.   I guess I should say I'm not sure

              24  Dr. Phillips is staying or going from Toledo.

              25          Q.   Oh, okay.



                                                               229


               1          A.   You know --

               2          Q.   Yeah.  Well --

               3          A.   -- I would say right now, we're

               4  probably more along the lines that, you know,

               5  Dr. Dibardino is clear in his interest in

               6  staying.  Dr. Phillips is looking for jobs, so

               7  it's telling me might be somebody we consider,

               8  but I'm not 100 percent sure.

               9          Q.   Okay.  If Dr. Phillips leaves, in

              10  the current scenario, that leaves you with

              11  only one surgeon, correct?

              12          A.   That would be correct.

              13          Q.   All right.  So do you know

              14  whether or not a factor potentially in

              15  Dr. Phillips staying or going, is whether or

              16  not Dr. Holland would be -- would return?

              17          A.   I don't think that will factor

              18  into his decision --

              19          Q.   You don't think --

              20          A.   -- one way or the other.

              21          Q.   Well, why don't you think that

              22  would factor into his decision?  What makes

              23  you believe that?

              24          A.   I don't -- he's just never raised

              25  that as an issue one way or the other.



                                                               230


               1          Q.   Well, you know he previously

               2  worked with Dr. Holland in a positive way,

               3  right?

               4          A.   Are you talking about the time --

               5          Q.   Yes.

               6          A.   -- that when they were here

               7  together?

               8          Q.   Yes.

               9          A.   Yeah, they -- I guess they seemed

              10  to get along.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And do you know, did

              12  Dr. Phillips ever say anything to you along

              13  the lines when Dr. Holland left, that he

              14  thought he lost a very valuable asset to him

              15  and a resource?

              16          A.   I -- no, not necessarily.

              17          Q.   You don't remember him saying

              18  anything like that?

              19          A.   Not -- not nothing like that, no.

              20          Q.   So any other doctors that, at

              21  this point, would be involved in the process,

              22  that you know of, in terms of who would be

              23  selected as a CT surgical candidate, other

              24  than the ones you mentioned?

              25          A.   Maybe our chief medical officers,



                                                               231


               1  but --

               2          Q.   Who are those people?

               3          A.   Dr. Hooker at St. Anne's, and

               4  Dr. Tita at St. Vincent's.

               5          Q.   Okay.  And then in terms of

               6  administrators, you would be involved,

               7  correct?

               8          A.   Correct.  I mean, as an example,

               9  we had a candidate in, came to St. Anne's.  OR

              10  director met him, I met him, Dr. Hooker, the

              11  chief medical officer met him.  They went on

              12  the floor.  You know, I don't think they

              13  actually went on the floor, so ....

              14          Q.   Uh-huh.

              15          A.   Strike that.

              16          Q.   Mr. Dempsey also would have a

              17  say?

              18          A.   Oh, yeah.

              19          Q.   Okay.  And do you feel that you

              20  have a good relationship with Mr. Dempsey?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   So any other administrators you

              23  can think of that would be at the table that

              24  would be participating?

              25          A.   Well, Michele Montague now runs



                                                               232


               1  the employed group.

               2          Q.   Okay.

               3          A.   Greg certainly.

               4          Q.   Mr. Hood.  Okay.

               5          A.   Uh-huh.

               6          Q.   Anyone else you can think of?

               7          A.   Those are the chief, I think,

               8  administrative people.

               9          Q.   Okay.

              10          A.   Which you got your -- Michele

              11  runs the employed group, so -- and from -- and

              12  Jeff and I as the two hospital presidents that

              13  have the service, and Greg, the service line

              14  administrator.  Maybe -- probably Jim Weidner

              15  as well now.

              16          Q.   Now, of the people that would be

              17  at the table evaluating the long-shot

              18  candidacy of Jamie Holland -- by the way, did

              19  you know him as Fred or Jamie?

              20          A.   Jamie.

              21          Q.   And of those evaluating the

              22  long-shot candidacy of Jamie Holland, if he

              23  were to apply -- apply, who would be the

              24  people, in terms of your viewpoint, which

              25  people do you believe would be the most



                                                               233


               1  supportive of that group, and the -- and those

               2  that would be the least supportive, if you had

               3  to rank them?

               4          A.   Well, first of all, I always

               5  referred to him as probably Dr. Holland, and

               6  not Jamie, but, so I would say probably, in

               7  order, I had the most positive experience with

               8  him, probably Toledo Clinic.  I don't think

               9  there would be much support around -- around

              10  any of the others.  Maybe -- if you're telling

              11  me Phillips, maybe Phillips, but I don't --

              12          Q.   The least support, where would

              13  you -- given your prior experience, before

              14  reading deposition transcripts, or anything

              15  like that in this case, based on your prior

              16  experience, who do you think would have ranked

              17  the lowest, Kabour group?

              18          A.   Kabour and Hussein.

              19          Q.   Okay.  And Kabour does refer a

              20  significant portion of -- of -- a significant

              21  number of cases into Mercy, correct?

              22          A.   He's the largest cardiology group

              23  presence in the Mercy system, yes.

              24          Q.   His technical skills are, to your

              25  knowledge, greatly complimented, correct?



                                                               234


               1          A.   Dr. Kabour?

               2          Q.   Yes.

               3          A.   That's my understanding.

               4          Q.   Okay.  So in order to perhaps

               5  change the paradigm, so to say, of the long

               6  shot, what would have to happen is at least

               7  Dr. Kabour's group would have to be sincere,

               8  or people that testified under oath would have

               9  to be sincere about being able to work with

              10  Jamie Holland again in a collaborative manner?

              11          A.   Uh-huh.

              12          Q.   Correct?  Correct?

              13          A.   That would have to happen, yes.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Sworn testimony, they

              15  would have to adhere, if they did testify

              16  under oath that way, I'm not asking you to

              17  judge on what they said or didn't, but if

              18  certain people testified under oath that way,

              19  they would have to adhere, in your viewpoint,

              20  to their sworn testimony that they would do

              21  that and try to do that?

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              23          A.   Yeah, they would -- they --

              24          Q.   Okay.

              25          A.   -- if -- they would have to say,



                                                               235


               1  we support Dr. Holland, we think that is the

               2  candidate we need.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Have you heard about any

               4  discussions that Dr. Holland and Dr. Kabour

               5  might be in about trying to collaborate going

               6  forward?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   About potentially making a

               9  television show together about race and how to

              10  cure racism in this country?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   Did you know that Dr. Kabour

              13  himself felt that he was subjected to -- I

              14  won't say he used the word discriminatory, or

              15  -- but perhaps prejudice is the best response

              16  when he went and asked for support for his

              17  television show, and people commented about

              18  his accent to him?

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, relevance.

              20          A.   I -- I have no knowledge of any

              21  of that.

              22          Q.   But you know that Dr. Kabour is

              23  from Syria, correct?

              24          A.   I believe he's from Syria, yes.

              25          Q.   And do you see in Dr. Kabour's



                                                               236


               1  group, tell me if you see this or not, do you

               2  see anything in Dr. Kabour's group that shows

               3  you that he tries to assist people who are --

               4  strike that.

               5             Okay.  If we can come to

               6  Exhibit 108 and 109, please.  These are read

               7  together.

               8          A.   Okay.

               9          Q.   And --

              10          A.   108 and 109?

              11          Q.   Yes.

              12          A.   Okay.

              13          Q.   108 is the -- you'll see that

              14  there is -- there is an MSV 5030 and 5031 from

              15  108 to 109.  So 108 is the cover page to the

              16  supporting materials we believe attached.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   From Mr. Hood to you, call

              19  agreement for Dr. Holland, February 3rd, 2017.

              20          A.   Okay.

              21          Q.   All right.  And then in

              22  Exhibit 109, there appears to be a discussion

              23  leader, which is you.  You see that?

              24          A.   Oh, discussion leader.  Okay,

              25  yes.



                                                               237


               1          Q.   Okay.  And then is this a

               2  document that you prepared, or participated in

               3  preparing, to your knowledge?

               4          A.   Greg and I -- Greg Hood and I

               5  probably collectively put this together.

               6          Q.   Okay.  And so there is a couple

               7  of different -- I don't want to read through

               8  everything.  I just want to go through a

               9  couple of things.

              10             There is a section under 2, and

              11  this is to determine if the proposed

              12  transaction is consistent with and furthers

              13  MH's mission, correct?

              14          A.   Yeah.  There is some sub-bullet,

              15  sub-questions there, yes.

              16          Q.   Okay.  And then there is some

              17  sub-factors, but 2B, enhances safety of

              18  patient care, correct?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   And then here it says, expedites

              21  the time a patient receives cardiothoracic

              22  assessment and treatment.  Allows other CT

              23  surgeons on staff at both hospitals

              24  appropriate rest and work-like balance.

              25          A.   That speaks to the -- the items



                                                               238


               1  we talked about a little bit earlier.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Alternative would be

               3  locums at much more expense and less

               4  continuity (since Dr. Holland currently

               5  practices at both hospitals).

               6             Did I read that generally

               7  correctly?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   And then there is, under 2C,

              10  improves quality of services and care to the

              11  community as well, correct?

              12          A.   Correct.

              13          Q.   And there is a variety of other

              14  ones that are all, variety of factors that are

              15  also addressed in here as well, correct?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   So at least from what we can see

              18  here, it appears that you, and potentially

              19  Mr. Hood as well, were proponents of a call

              20  agreement being placed, put in place with

              21  Dr. Holland; is that right?

              22          A.   Yes, the -- for the reasons that

              23  were indicated there.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Next exhibit is 145.

              25             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 145



                                                               239


               1  was marked for identification.)

               2          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) On

               3  Exhibit 145, Mr. Bertke, at the bottom on

               4  February 7, 2017, subject, Dr. Holland call

               5  agreement.  Do you see that?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   I request PSC approval for a call

               8  agreement for Dr. Holland as part of the

               9  transition from our Toledo Clinic arrangement

              10  (Mercy paid Toledo Clinic 100% salary and

              11  physician benefits) to Dr. Holland as an

              12  individual practitioner.  This transitions at

              13  the end of February.

              14             Did I read that portion correctly?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   Is that -- that was accurate at

              17  the time, that Mercy had paid Toledo Clinic

              18  100 percent of the salary and physician

              19  benefits?

              20          A.   That was my understanding, yes.

              21          Q.   Okay.  Are you also -- do you

              22  know, and don't guess or speculate, but do you

              23  know whether or not Mercy also

              24  paid Dr. Holland's pension?

              25          A.   I do not know.  His pension plan



                                                               240


               1  would have been with the Toledo Clinic, so I

               2  mean, there was no Mercy pension, so I'm not

               3  --

               4          Q.   But you don't know who would have

               5  paid that, the money that went into the

               6  pension, correct?

               7          A.   Correct.

               8          Q.   In any event, you go on to talk

               9  about reasons for the call agreement, correct?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   Without reading them all.  And

              12  then, it goes up on February 7th, the same

              13  day, it goes out to a number of people and

              14  ccs, correct?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   Subject, and now there is amper

              17  signs in bold and -- and capital, Urgent

              18  Requests for Approval for Call Agreement with

              19  Dr. Holland for Mercy-St. Anne's, correct?

              20          A.   Yeah.  That must -- that must

              21  have been standard for an off cycle.

              22          Q.   Okay.  And then it says please --

              23          A.   Just meaning we usually discuss

              24  these and meet in person and discuss them.

              25          Q.   Uh-huh.



                                                               241


               1          A.   This looks like we're getting --

               2  we're going to the committee via email, so

               3  this must have been Sharon's methodology when

               4  she did that, because it's not what I have,

               5  but ....

               6          Q.   Okay.  And it says that the

               7  people should vote separately; is that right?

               8  Vote appropriately by replying to this email?

               9          A.   Looks that way, yes.

              10          Q.   Okay.  And do you remember who,

              11  if anybody, voted against the call agreement?

              12          A.   I don't -- no, I don't remember

              13  the votes.

              14          Q.   Did you ultimately receive

              15  approval for that call agreement?

              16          A.   Yes.  We got approval to proceed

              17  with a call agreement, yes.

              18          Q.   Just mark 146 and 147.

              19             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibits

              20  146 and 147 were marked for identification.)

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And these are

              22  just two emails I provided from Sharon Aldrich

              23  to you, and also -- the first one is to you

              24  and Mr. Hood, dated February 10th.  That's

              25  Exhibit 146.  And Exhibit 147 is from Ms. --



                                                               242


               1  Ms. Aldrich to you and Nancy Ingram.  Both of

               2  these have to do with the Holland call

               3  agreement, correct?

               4          A.   It appears that way, yeah.

               5          Q.   And then it looks like people

               6  were working on a call agreement; is that

               7  right?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   This is a little out of sequence.

              10  This will be 148.

              11             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 148

              12  was marked for identification.)

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Bertke,

              14  this is a weekly contract acquisitions meeting

              15  from February 16, 2017.  Do you see that?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Are you generally familiar with

              18  this document?

              19          A.   No.

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  I'll object then for

              21  foundation.

              22          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) In refer --

              23  what we had referred to earlier, about

              24  Dr. Hasan, it says, under old business, you'll

              25  see four down, under old business, Dr. Hasan,



                                                               243


               1  CT surgery recruit, out for signature, Tom?

               2          A.   Okay.

               3          Q.   That would be consistent with

               4  what you understood, is that there had been an

               5  offer made to Dr. Hasan, correct?

               6          A.   I think when we discussed, talked

               7  about it earlier, it looked like late in

               8  November, a call agreement, or a -- not a call

               9  agreement.  Sorry.  Some type of offer had

              10  been made, so --

              11          Q.   Do you know whether --

              12          A.   -- now we're in February, and

              13  it's out for signature.

              14          Q.   Do you know whether or not that

              15  offer was reneged or withdrawn?

              16          A.   He never came here, so I don't

              17  know what happened, but he never came here.

              18          Q.   You don't -- you don't recall

              19  ever hearing what happened to him?

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   All right.  So in the first

              22  binder, Mr. Bertke.  Bless you.

              23          A.   No problem.

              24          Q.   First binder, Exhibit 37.

              25          A.   Okay.



                                                               244


               1          Q.   And are you familiar -- your

               2  signature appears on the last page of

               3  Exhibit 37; is that correct?

               4          A.   That's correct.

               5          Q.   Dr. Holland's signature appears

               6  on that as well?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   And there is one signature

               9  missing; is that correct?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And whose is that?

              12          A.   Tom Arquilla.

              13          Q.   And what is he identified there

              14  as?

              15          A.   As the interim president for

              16  St. Vincent Medical Center.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Now -- all right.  So this

              18  is dated -- this is dated, I believe,

              19  March 1st, or to be effective March 1st.  That

              20  you can see that on page Bates stamped 1391,

              21  under term, in termination, paragraph 16?

              22          A.   Paragraph 16.  Okay.

              23          Q.   Okay.  So it was an effective

              24  date of March 1st.  I'm going to show you some

              25  emails now, and then try to see the sequence



                                                               245


               1  of when you signed this, compared to --

               2          A.   Okay.

               3          Q.   -- the -- okay.  Next exhibit is

               4  149.

               5             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 149

               6  was marked for identification.)

               7          A.   I'm sorry.

               8          Q.   I'll pass out another one for you

               9  as well, okay?  150 --

              10          A.   All right.

              11          Q.   -- this will be.

              12             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 150

              13  was marked for identification.)

              14          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And then

              15  Mr. Bertke, there is a couple of different

              16  emails here to look at.

              17          A.   149 and 150?

              18          Q.   Yes.  You can keep them side by

              19  side.  I think it just makes it easier for you

              20  and me.

              21             In any event, in the bottom of

              22  each, the email is the same, which is from

              23  Dr. Holland to you and Mr. D'Eramo, call

              24  agreement, correct?  February 28th, 2017,

              25  10:27 a.m.



                                                               246


               1          A.   Are we on 49 or 50, I'm sorry?

               2          Q.   Well, actually, at the bottom, I

               3  was pointing out to you at the bottom of both

               4  of those, Exhibits 149 and 150, the bottommost

               5  email in each of those is the same.

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   In terms of the content.

               8             Brad, just following up on last

               9  week.  Should I stop by and sign?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And then in both -- okay.

              12             So now, let's go off and look at

              13  Exhibit 150, which is from you to Dr. Holland,

              14  at 11:19 a.m. on February 28th.

              15             Do you see that?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   And you say, I am trying to dot

              18  an "I".  I will text you when it's

              19  ready...should be today.

              20             Read that correctly?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   And then at 11:26 a.m., you write

              23  to him again, Dr. Holland, and Mr. D'Eramo,

              24  It's ready.  I may not be here, if you swing

              25  by...



                                                               247


               1          A.   Okay.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Now, when you said, I may

               3  not be here, if you swing by, what I'm

               4  wondering is is if at this point you had

               5  already signed the call agreement or not, if

               6  you can remember?

               7          A.   I -- I can't remember if I signed

               8  it first, or Dr. Holland signed it first, and

               9  then I signed it.  I don't really remember.

              10          Q.   But there came an issue with

              11  Mr. Arquilla's signature, correct?

              12          A.   Yeah.  It appears he never signed

              13  it.

              14          Q.   Well, you were aware that he

              15  hadn't signed it, correct?

              16          A.   Right.

              17          Q.   And how did you become aware he

              18  hadn't signed it?

              19          A.   At some point in time, I --

              20  either he called me, or I looped back with

              21  him, to see if -- if it had been signed.

              22          Q.   Was it that same day?

              23          A.   No.

              24          Q.   It would have been in advance of

              25  March 1st, though, correct?



                                                               248


               1          A.   Hmm, no.

               2          Q.   Well, what was going to happen if

               3  there was no call agreement in place for

               4  Dr. Holland?  How would that impact his

               5  practice of medicine?

               6          A.   I don't know how it impact his

               7  practice of medicine, but from the hospital's

               8  perspective, we must have had call coverage,

               9  or we would have been -- I would have been

              10  pressing on this hard.

              11          Q.   Well, you seem to be.  You seem

              12  to have been pressing hard to get call

              13  coverage.

              14          A.   Yeah.  I was tying to get it in

              15  place by the date.

              16          Q.   Yes.  And the call coverage

              17  provides, what, pays Dr. Holland if he covers

              18  call?

              19          A.   Yes.  That's the standard

              20  agreement.

              21          Q.   So if there was no call agreement

              22  in place, then could Dr. Holland even

              23  participate in call?

              24          A.   It -- yeah.  He could take call,

              25  but it wouldn't be paid.



                                                               249


               1          Q.   He'd have to do it just for free?

               2          A.   He'd have -- yes.  And we have

               3  services that take call for free, but in --

               4  yeah, we don't retro deal, so we needed -- if

               5  -- in order for him to be paid for call, this

               6  needed to be signed.

               7          Q.   Have you ever, in your

               8  experience, had any cardiothoracic surgeons

               9  that agreed to perform surgeries for free and

              10  not be compensated?

              11          A.   For -- do surgeries for free?

              12          Q.   Yes.

              13          A.   No.  I mean, they would bill for

              14  the surgeries, yes.

              15          Q.   Okay.  So in terms of being on

              16  call, how would Dr. Holland have a -- strike

              17  that.

              18             What does the call agreement

              19  provide to Dr. Holland, paying him to be on

              20  call, and then if a surgery comes in, to come

              21  in and perform the surgery?

              22          A.   Exactly.  So if he would walk

              23  back over time, and this is a big issue in

              24  healthcare in general, so --

              25          Q.   Uh-huh.



                                                               250


               1          A.   -- allow me to go off track a

               2  little bit.  But historically, call was an

               3  obligation of the medical staff.  It wasn't

               4  compensated.  Over time, lifestyle

               5  considerations, issues in healthcare

               6  environment and overall, you know, paying call

               7  in certain specialties is becoming

               8  commonplace.

               9          Q.   Okay.  By the way, going back to

              10  Exhibit 109 for one second.

              11          A.   109?

              12          Q.   Yes.

              13          A.   Okay.

              14          Q.   The third page, this is the

              15  document that you and Mr. Hood, you believe,

              16  jointly prepared.  MSV 5033 in the bottom

              17  right-hand corner.

              18          A.   Uh-huh.

              19          Q.   Under 3A, how did he -- did these

              20  physicians exhibit quality patient care in

              21  their practice?  This physician has excellent

              22  cardiothoracic and surgical training and has

              23  solid outcomes in Mercy's cardiac program,

              24  correct?

              25          A.   I believe so, yes.



                                                               251


               1          Q.   Okay.  Then under C, are these

               2  physicians well respected and known within the

               3  community to provide quality care?  The main

               4  cardiologists at St. Anne (Toledo Clinic)

               5  prefer Dr. Holland to other CT surgeons.

               6  Correct?

               7          A.   Correct.

               8          Q.   Now, in terms of why Mr. Arquilla

               9  did not sign the call agreement, what did he

              10  tell you was the reason he didn't sign it?

              11          A.   I don't know if he really gave me

              12  a reason.

              13          Q.   At the time you learned that the

              14  call agreement was not signed, which was

              15  probably on or around March 1st; is that fair?

              16          A.   I don't know if I can say that.

              17  It's -- to me, it's sometime between the 1st,

              18  and the meeting that I had with Dr. Holland.

              19          Q.   Okay.  On the 17th of March?

              20          A.   So somewhere in that time frame.

              21          Q.   Okay.  And originally when you

              22  signed the call coverage agreement, you did

              23  not know, at the time you signed it, that

              24  Dr. Holland had filed a charge of

              25  discrimination with the United States



                                                               252


               1  government through the EEOC, correct?

               2          A.   I don't believe so, no.

               3          Q.   But at some point prior to the

               4  March 17, 2017 meeting, you learned that that

               5  had occurred, correct?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Mr. Bertke, we know that

               8  you have reviewed the transcript of a

               9  St. Patrick's Day tape that my client is

              10  represented to have made of a meeting with

              11  you.  Correct?

              12          A.   Yes, I have reviewed that.

              13          Q.   What we're going to do now is

              14  play a short portion of the tape, simply so

              15  you can identify your own voice, if you hear

              16  it.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   And then what we'll do is, to

              19  make it easier, is use the transcript, as

              20  necessary, if we're talking about that

              21  meeting.

              22          A.   Sounds good.

              23          Q.   Okay.

              24             MR. ARCHINACO:  Mike, can you play

              25  a portion, please?



                                                               253


               1             MR. O'LEARY:  Move this a little

               2  closer.

               3             (Whereupon, the following was

               4  played from the audio.)

               5             DR. HOLLAND:  Good.

               6             NEW SPEAKER:  Good.  Sorry I was --

               7             DR. HOLLAND:  There is no one here.

               8             NEW SPEAKER:  Yeah.  We'll go on

               9  there.  (Inaudible.)  How are you?

              10             DR. HOLLAND:  Good.

              11             NEW SPEAKER:  How are you doing

              12  today?

              13             DR. HOLLAND:  Good.  How about you?

              14             NEW SPEAKER:  Doing all right.

              15             NEW SPEAKER:  Looks like it's going

              16  to get ugly out there.  It's really getting

              17  dark.  I don't know if it's supposed to rain

              18  or snow, or I don't know what's supposed to

              19  happen today.

              20             DR. HOLLAND:  St. Patrick's Day, it

              21  can't get ugly.

              22             NEW SPEAKER:  That's right.  What's

              23  Holland, is that Irish?

              24             (Whereupon, the audio was stopped.)

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Is that your



                                                               254


               1  voice?

               2          A.   Sounds like me, yeah.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Were you making a joke on

               4  St. Patrick's day about whether Doctor --

               5          A.   Yeah.  An icebreaker

               6  conversation, yes.

               7          Q.   Okay.  If you had known that

               8  conversation was being recorded, would you

               9  have changed anything you said during that?

              10          A.   I'm sure I would have.

              11          Q.   Why is that?

              12          A.   I don't know.  I'm just, you

              13  know, retrospect probably, but you know?

              14          Q.   Has the existence of that tape

              15  and what you said in it put you in any awkward

              16  position at work?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   Do you believe you just -- you

              19  spoke candidly on that tape?  I mean, in what

              20  you read in terms of the transcript?

              21          A.   Yeah, I think pretty much.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Mark as Exhibit 151.

              23             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 151

              24  was marked for identification.)

              25          Q.   We have marked the transcript



                                                               255


               1  151.  Now, just for identification purposes,

               2  we also have previously marked, and we can

               3  provide the Bates stamp number as necessary to

               4  the tape, if required, Mr. Wiencek.

               5             Mr. O'Leary just simply pointed out

               6  that we played a portion of the tape, and it

               7  can be identified by a Bates stamp number

               8  later, if necessary.

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Okay.  Then let's do

              10  that.

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Bertke,

              12  does this look similar to a transcript you saw

              13  regarding, or -- or is this the actual one you

              14  saw, do you know?

              15          A.   It looks a little different, but

              16  --

              17          Q.   Okay.

              18          A.   -- for the most part, it looks

              19  the same.

              20          Q.   On the second page of this, at

              21  the bottom, on line 24, New Speaker:  That's

              22  right.  What's Holland?  Is that Irish?

              23             And that's what you've identified

              24  was your voice, correct?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               256


               1          Q.   Okay.  And then Dr. Holland tells

               2  you, it's Anglic -- Anglicized Houlihan.  We

               3  were Houlihans, correct?

               4          A.   Yes.

               5          Q.   Okay.  And then I just want to

               6  skip ahead to some things.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   If you look at page 3, at the

               9  bottom, starting at line 22, New Speaker.

              10  Well, let me go back a second.

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  And Jason, I'm going

              12  to object that this does not identify Brad at

              13  all, other than New Speaker.  And you'd have

              14  to identify him at each one of these.

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  That's fine.  I'll

              16  keep doing it, because he's the New Speaker.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And so

              18  whenever they immigrated here, they changed it

              19  to something that sounded more desirable to

              20  (inaudible).

              21             Hey, I just want touch base.  So,

              22  we had this (inaudible) account all worked

              23  out, ironed out, and there were three

              24  signature lines on there.  There was yours,

              25  mine and Tom's.



                                                               257


               1             So when I got up to Tom, then they

               2  -- he said, hey, do you -- are you aware that

               3  -- I'm not even sure exactly what it is, some

               4  type of complaint has been filed against

               5  Dr. Andrabi and Dr. Hashmi by Dr. Holland.  I

               6  said, no, I don't.  I said, he was just in

               7  here.  He didn't mention anything about it,

               8  not that he and I might not want him to do

               9  that.

              10             So this is kind of putting a cloud

              11  over something we have worked on here for a

              12  couple of three months.  So (inaudible) worry

              13  about it.

              14             So I just generally read that

              15  correctly?

              16          A.   Yeah.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Now, I want to go back a

              18  second, just in terms of your memory of

              19  events.  Do you recall basically going to

              20  Doctor -- or strike that.

              21             Going to Mr. Arquilla, and that to

              22  find out where the third signature was, and

              23  Mr. Arquilla told you words to this effect,

              24  that some type of complaint had been filed

              25  against Andrabi and Hashmi by Holland?



                                                               258


               1          A.   Not sure it was all linked

               2  together like that, so I'm not sure I -- if he

               3  called me, I called him.

               4          Q.   Uh-huh.

               5          A.   But somewhere along the lines, I

               6  followed up to see where the call agreement

               7  was and to say is this thing signed.  I don't

               8  -- and he hadn't signed it.  I'm not sure

               9  exactly why he hadn't signed it.

              10             And then he asked me about, hey,

              11  are you aware of this thing.  So I don't know

              12  exactly what the time line was on that.

              13             And then --

              14          Q.   You didn't.  In fact, when it was

              15  first mentioned to from Mr. Arquilla, you

              16  actually did not know that he had filed with

              17  the EEOC, correct?

              18          A.   Correct.

              19          Q.   And what -- I know in here there

              20  is -- you mention some type of complaint.  You

              21  didn't know exactly what it was called,

              22  correct?  What the legal --

              23          A.   I didn't know what it was.

              24          Q.   What the legal document is

              25  called --



                                                               259


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   -- correct?

               3             All right.  So the first time you

               4  hear that Dr. Holland has filed something with

               5  government, is through Mr. Arquilla, correct?

               6          A.   That's correct.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Now, you were --

               8  Dr. Holland had not in advance told you he was

               9  going to do that, correct?

              10          A.   Not that I recall.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And then -- so then when

              12  do you recall happening -- I know you have

              13  said some things in this tape, or the

              14  transcript that reflects the tape.  But what

              15  do you recall being said to you about Arquilla

              16  and this call agreement, and about signing it

              17  at that point?

              18          A.   He -- he didn't say he wasn't

              19  going to sign it.  He just said, hey, you

              20  know, I haven't signed it.  We have got this

              21  thing.  We got to take a look at what this is

              22  and understand what -- what it means, and what

              23  is our rights, responsibilities, and all that.

              24             So, to me, kind of indicated, we

              25  got to take a couple of days pause here and



                                                               260


               1  figure out what this thing is.

               2          Q.   Now, Mr. Arquilla wound up never

               3  signing any call agreement, correct?

               4          A.   I believe that's true.

               5          Q.   And do you remember earlier I

               6  showed you Dr. Hashmi's contract from 2017,

               7  where one person's name was on it, and then

               8  there was a strike through, and someone else

               9  signed it?

              10          A.   Yeah.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And with this call

              12  agreement, what happened was, what you just

              13  said, is Arquilla said, we have to look at

              14  this, right?

              15          A.   Correct.

              16          Q.   Okay.  So instead of his name

              17  getting crossed out at that point, and someone

              18  else's name going on this call agreement --

              19          A.   Why -- why would we cross his

              20  name out?

              21          Q.   Well, I don't know.

              22          A.   No.

              23          Q.   Did Mr. Arquilla tell you he

              24  didn't have the authority to sign it?  He

              25  didn't tell you that?



                                                               261


               1          A.   He didn't -- I don't really

               2  remember a reason.

               3          Q.   He said, he -- he told you right

               4  after saying that this complaint, or whatever

               5  had been filed, that they had to think -- you

               6  had to think it over, right?

               7          A.   Yeah.  I think he, you know,

               8  wanted an opportunity to consult with whoever

               9  the appropriate people to be, to consult with

              10  was, because it, my recollection, when I

              11  talked to him, it had just arrived like that

              12  day, or you know, the day before, or whatever.

              13          Q.   Okay.  Why did you believe that

              14  -- strike that.

              15             Was it because of your conversation

              16  with Doctor -- strike that.

              17             Was it because of your conversation

              18  with Mr. Arquilla, what came out of that

              19  conversation, is that the reason that you told

              20  Dr. Holland that this was kind of putting a

              21  cloud over something we have worked on here

              22  for --

              23          A.   Yeah.  And that's one of the -- I

              24  don't know if I would say that, you know, when

              25  you said, would you change some things, if you



                                                               262


               1  knew you were being recorded, I probably would

               2  have worded it differently, and just said

               3  we're going to have to evaluate this, what

               4  this complaint is, and make sure it's all

               5  consistent with what our plans were here.

               6          Q.   But as -- as we have seen from

               7  emails and whatnot, I mean, you're a person

               8  who did sign off on the call agreement with

               9  Dr. Holland, correct?

              10          A.   Correct.

              11          Q.   And you're a person who went

              12  through the process of filling out forms to

              13  say this, I believe this is in the best

              14  interest of our hospital/patients to do this

              15  call agreement, correct?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   And so we see a pattern of you

              18  consistently, it seems, advancing the ball, or

              19  trying to get something in place with

              20  Dr. Holland, correct?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   And then what it hits is no

              23  signature from Mr. Arquilla, shortly after he

              24  learns that a complaint of some sort has been

              25  filed, correct?



                                                               263


               1          A.   I would agree with everything you

               2  said up until the point of, I don't really

               3  know the timing around Tom's signature, when

               4  the complaint was dropped and all that, but

               5  I'll agree with you in general.

               6          Q.   Okay.  So it's not you that is

               7  holding off and not signing.  You've already

               8  signed.  You didn't say I'm taking my name off

               9  of this, right?

              10          A.   No.  No, there was no reason to

              11  do that.

              12          Q.   So when you're talking about

              13  putting a cloud over it, in terms of your

              14  perspective, you had already signed it,

              15  correct?

              16          A.   Yeah, but that was before the --

              17  before the EEOC complaint, which Tom felt

              18  warranted some review of what it was.

              19          Q.   Fair enough.  But just to be

              20  clear, you never said, and nowhere in this

              21  tape, I don't think, you ever say you're going

              22  to take your name off of the call agreement.

              23  You never threatened Dr. Holland in any way

              24  like that, did you?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               264


               1          Q.   You never said, I'm, you know,

               2  now that you filed, I'm going to pull out

               3  support for you, right?  You didn't say that

               4  to him?

               5          A.   I don't think I said that on

               6  behalf of myself or of Mercy.

               7          Q.   Well, whatever the words are that

               8  you said will stand for themselves, however

               9  those are read.

              10             But it's Mr. Arquilla's signature

              11  that remained off of this agreement, correct?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   And so if there were compromises

              14  to any patient care, if, not saying whether

              15  there were, you have to agree if there were or

              16  were not, but if there were any, Mr. Arquilla

              17  would bear more responsibility certainly than

              18  you, because he is the one who didn't sign the

              19  agreement, correct?

              20          A.   I -- I never felt there was

              21  safety issues being jeopardized.  I don't

              22  think there were issues around patient safety,

              23  I don't think anything was in jeopardy

              24  relative to the delays of this call agreement.

              25  I was anxious to get it done, because that's



                                                               265


               1  the way I am, but ....

               2          Q.   Sir, you had written in documents

               3  that it improved the quality of care that was

               4  going to be rendered if it were signed,

               5  correct?

               6          A.   Sure.

               7          Q.   Okay.

               8          A.   Because I don't think going long

               9  periods of time with two people in the call

              10  rotation would have been a good thing.

              11          Q.   Do you recall Dr. Holland telling

              12  you on, words to the effect, on St. Patrick's

              13  Day, that there was a pattern of issues with

              14  referrals and Dr. Hashmi?

              15          A.   I mean, this is kind of

              16  consistent with previous things he's brought

              17  up.

              18          Q.   Okay.  If you'd turn to page 10.

              19          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              20          Q.   And if you look at lines 5

              21  through 11.

              22          A.   5 through 11?

              23          Q.   Yes.

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   In particular.  And this is in --



                                                               266


               1  this is in a New Speaker, which is you on the

               2  tape.

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               4          Q.   But so, I just -- I'm just

               5  thinking about here, and like you're saying, I

               6  think the track record and all that is good.

               7  I felt good about (inaudible) putting

               8  together, but I'm not sure if it's -- how it's

               9  going to hold up under what is going on.  So I

              10  just wanted to let you know.

              11             Did I read that portion correctly?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   And so you were telling -- you

              14  were trying to communicate to Dr. --

              15  Dr. Holland, that given his filing, that you

              16  weren't sure what was going to happen?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              18  foundation.

              19          A.   What am I supposed to do with

              20  that, I -- so --

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  You can answer.

              22             THE WITNESS:  What's that?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  You can answer.

              24          A.   You can answer.  Okay.  I think,

              25  yeah, there is an expression of uncertainty



                                                               267


               1  there.  Just to say, hey, you know, we've

               2  worked on this call agreement, and whatever

               3  the -- the -- whatever else we might have been

               4  working on, and now we got this thing, we need

               5  a couple days, several days to figure out what

               6  it is.

               7          Q.   But at least from your

               8  perspective personally, the fact that

               9  Dr. Holland had raised his federal rights, or

              10  asserted his federal, federally-protected

              11  rights, that had no bearing on your belief

              12  system personally about going forward with the

              13  call agreement, correct?

              14          A.   No, and I don't really think it

              15  had much to do with anybody else's.

              16          Q.   Okay.  So who is -- who is the

              17  person then, you said it doesn't have much to

              18  do, well, who -- who is it putting a cloud

              19  over?

              20          A.   Doesn't have much to do?  Well,

              21  you mean with others?

              22          Q.   Yeah, with other people?

              23          A.   I mean, in the end, I don't think

              24  it really mattered all that much.  I mean, we

              25  ended up entering into the call agreement,



                                                               268


               1  so ....

               2          Q.   How many months later?

               3          A.   I don't know.  You might know

               4  better than me, but ....

               5          Q.   Were you ever made aware that a

               6  patient died in April of 2017, prior to the

               7  call agreement being signed, because

               8  Dr. Hashmi said he would be responsible for

               9  the patient, and then he took too long and/or

              10  took a longer time than expected in one

              11  surgery, and when he got out, he wrote in the

              12  patient's records, too tired to operate, and

              13  -- and instead of calling Dr. Holland, the

              14  patient died?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to --

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You aware of

              17  that?

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  -- form, foundation

              19  and narrative.

              20          A.   I have no knowledge of any of

              21  that.

              22          Q.   Okay.  If -- if it were true, or

              23  you were told, through an investigation of

              24  some sort, that a patient died during the time

              25  period Mr. Arquilla did not sign the call



                                                               269


               1  agreement, and then subsequently when it was

               2  signed, because Dr. Holland was not called in

               3  to do the operation, would that be upsetting

               4  to you?

               5          A.   It's hypothetical, but I guess to

               6  play along, I would say, yeah, that would

               7  concern me.

               8          Q.   Okay.

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Which is why it's

              10  objectionable.

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And then

              12  you're not suggesting, you've not heard from

              13  any source that Dr. Holland has tried, in any

              14  way, to refer that, families, to an attorney

              15  to sue Mercy, right?

              16          A.   No.  I haven't heard that.

              17          Q.   Okay.  On page 12.  If we go back

              18  to page 11, you'll see New Speaker.  You're

              19  welcome to read this in context, Mr. Bertke.

              20  I'm not trying to not let you read it in

              21  context.

              22          A.   Okay.

              23          Q.   If you need to read any

              24  surrounding portions, please do so.  There is

              25  a section on the page, top of 12, you said, in



                                                               270


               1  line 2, I try to do that, but this is obvious

               2  a lot of -- it's always been a lot of moving

               3  parts and drama.  This is going to be another

               4  level.

               5             Do you see that?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   And then Dr. Holland says, And it

               8  will get interesting, but you never know.

               9  They might -- they might reflect upon the

              10  situation and come up with some kind of an

              11  offer of a solution.

              12             And then on line 11, New Speaker:

              13  I'm not even sure -- you know, Katrina was our

              14  head of legal, and I talked to her yesterday,

              15  and she was not even -- she had been away for

              16  a period of time.  She was not really that

              17  familiar with it.

              18             You see that?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   Then you say, Dr. Holland:  Yeah.

              21             New Speaker:  What the basis of

              22  that really was.

              23             Do you see that?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Now, do you recall talking to



                                                               271


               1  someone, not -- without disclosing the

               2  conversation right now -- do you recall

               3  talking to someone in the legal department,

               4  prior to your St. Patrick's Day meeting with

               5  Dr. Holland?

               6          A.   I don't recall speaking with her,

               7  but I reference that I -- and I remember she

               8  was out for a period of time, so it sounds --

               9  so it sounds like, without getting into the

              10  details of the conversation, the day before I

              11  met with Holland, I asked Katrina, you know,

              12  have you had a chance to look at this EEOC and

              13  see if this thing impacts our arrangement at

              14  all?

              15             My recollect -- my recollection was

              16  she wanted a brief period of time to look at

              17  it.  A couple of days later, I remember kind

              18  of a hallway conversation with Andrabi and

              19  Katrina to say kind of where we at with this

              20  thing, and they just kind of said, we don't

              21  think the thing has any merits, just proceed.

              22          Q.   Do you know why it was that

              23  Mr. Arquilla didn't sign the agreement at that

              24  point in time?

              25          A.   No, I don't.



                                                               272


               1          Q.   Okay.  So in terms of -- between

               2  the first time you learned that Mr. Arquilla

               3  was not signing the agreement, which was

               4  probably early March, and March 17th, who was

               5  it that you spoke to, if anyone, about that

               6  fact?

               7          A.   That Tom had not signed the

               8  agreement?

               9          Q.   Yes.

              10          A.   Other than this conversation?

              11          Q.   Yes.  I mean, you have -- you

              12  have an agreement effective March 1st, signed

              13  by you and Dr. Holland, but not signed by

              14  Mr. Arquilla.  I showed you that already.

              15          A.   Yeah.

              16          Q.   Okay.  So between the, whatever

              17  that time period is that that agreement is not

              18  signed, and the March 17th meeting, that seems

              19  like a couple of weeks' time, at least, who

              20  did you talk to about the fact that

              21  Mr. Arquilla was not -- was refusing to sign

              22  the agreement?

              23          A.   I don't know if --

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to the term

              25  refusing and form.



                                                               273


               1          A.   I don't remember having another

               2  con -- any other conversation with any other

               3  person about whether he signed the agreement

               4  or not.

               5          Q.   Do you agree that -- that

               6  Mr. Arquilla did not take a pen in his hand

               7  and put it on a piece of paper and put his

               8  name on the signature, right?

               9          A.   There is no signature on that

              10  document.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And so other than

              12  Mr. Arquilla, between -- and there may, what

              13  appears to be Katrina, but other than

              14  Mr. Arquilla and Katrina, who else did you

              15  talk to in that time period about the fact

              16  that Mr. Arquilla's name did not appear on

              17  that signature, signature on that call

              18  agreement, prior to the St. Patrick's Day

              19  meeting with my client?

              20          A.   That might have been it.  I don't

              21  -- maybe Greg.  I don't remember anyone else.

              22          Q.   Is there any reason you can think

              23  of you weren't following up with people about

              24  that issue, during that time period?

              25          A.   I -- I mean, at that time, no.  I



                                                               274


               1  don't know why I -- I mean, Tom was the only

               2  person involved with it, so I don't know who

               3  else I would have gone to talk to about it.

               4          Q.   What did Mr. Arquilla say to you

               5  about Dr. Andrabi and, if anything, having to

               6  do with the call agreement or signing it?

               7          A.   Nothing in relation to

               8  Dr. Andrabi.

               9          Q.   Was Dr. Andrabi still at Mercy at

              10  that time?

              11          A.   Yes.  I think the only thing that

              12  Dr. Andrabi's name may have came up was just

              13  that when he referenced the EEOC complaint,

              14  said it was against Dr. Andrabi, and -- he was

              15  one of the parties named.

              16          Q.   Okay.  And then on page 13 of the

              17  transcript, there is just an indication that

              18  you indicated that you never believed there

              19  was a quality of care issue with regard to

              20  referrals to Dr. Holland; is that right?

              21          A.   That's correct.

              22          Q.   Dr. Holland --

              23          A.   Well, let me rephrase that.

              24  Surgical quality, if you would encapsulate

              25  quality of care to include relationships with



                                                               275


               1  referring doctors, and feedback that

               2  cardiologists got, you could include that, but

               3  in terms of his ability to perform cardiac

               4  surgery, no, not an issue.

               5          Q.   You see Dr. Holland tells you, on

               6  that same page, well, you know there's still

               7  -- you can't deny where there's smoke, there

               8  is fire, though.  Because Brunsting left

               9  because the same situation.  He saw there was

              10  an issue in referrals.  He was young enough

              11  that he wanted to have a career, and he ended

              12  up in -- in a great, and I think he ended up

              13  at UAB doing robotics down there.

              14             Burdine came on board, and within a

              15  few months, his heart volume went down to

              16  nothing.  The last year he practiced

              17  full-time, his volume was either 10 or 18 for

              18  the entire year.  Burdine.

              19             New Speaker:  Mm-hmm.

              20             Dr. Holland:  Now, Dr. Phillips is

              21  in the same situation, where he's Hashmi's

              22  boy.  Phillips is now doing the lungs or the

              23  (inaudible) and things that Hashmi doesn't

              24  want to do.

              25             New Speaker:  Mm-hmm.



                                                               276


               1             Dr. Holland:  So that's four

               2  surgeons within, what, five or -- five years

               3  who have experienced the same sort of

               4  behavior.  And no quality of surgeon is going

               5  to sit back and watch Hashmi, you know,

               6  butcher patients essentially, and that's what

               7  he's doing.  And they're not going to sit back

               8  and just round on Hashmi's patients

               9  indiscriminately.

              10             New Speaker:  Uh-huh.

              11             Dr. Holland:  I mean, that's not

              12  what we do.  We take care of our patients.  We

              13  participate in the greater good.  We try to

              14  build a team with members who are cooperative

              15  and appreciate our efforts and quality, but

              16  that's not what happened down there.

              17             And there was plenty of opportunity

              18  for Hashmi to do that.  We've had many

              19  meetings with that.  Burdine participated in

              20  those meetings, talked about referrals and

              21  quality.

              22             And even now, the M & Ms down

              23  there, you don't even have to go to the

              24  M & Ms.  The last M & M they had was with

              25  their little girl who takes the stats.  It was



                                                               277


               1  Hashmi and the girl, so ....

               2             New Speaker:  Yeah, he invited her.

               3             Dr. Holland:  So it's a very

               4  corrupt system.  The nurses have been

               5  uninvited to the meeting.  Cardiology and

               6  cardiology fellows have been uninvited.  And

               7  now it's just Hashmi, the statistician and

               8  Phillips will show up from time to time.

               9             But even, you know, the last

              10  meeting they had down there, Phillips got --

              11  came in after Hashmi discussed the three

              12  mortalities he had for that month.  It's a

              13  fairly corrupt system.

              14             But, no, I appreciate your -- your

              15  situation.

              16             New Speaker:  Right.

              17          A.   Yeah, so this -- this goes under

              18  that had I been --

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Just make an

              20  objection --

              21             MR. ARCHINACO:  Yeah.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  -- to the

              23  self-serving narrative that's in this

              24  transcript.

              25          A.   I mean, this is a -- this is just



                                                               278


               1  his narrative of things that were going on.

               2  And when you asked about if I had known I had

               3  been taped, I would be a little more careful

               4  with my mm-hmms and right, because those are

               5  merely tools of active listening, not

               6  necessarily that I agree with everything he's

               7  saying, because I don't -- I don't have any

               8  knowledge of any of this stuff.

               9          Q.   Well --

              10          A.   Only from what he has told me.

              11          Q.   Right.  You at least have

              12  knowledge of what he's told you.

              13          A.   Right.

              14          Q.   All right.  So --

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   -- have you looked at

              17  Mr. Carruthers' transcript in this case?

              18          A.   I have not.

              19          Q.   Okay.  But -- but you could --

              20  you could, if you -- if you -- do you know of

              21  any reason you wouldn't be able to review it,

              22  to see what he had to say about all this?

              23          A.   I mean, I would --

              24          Q.   All right.

              25          A.   -- you know --



                                                               279


               1          Q.   Defer to counsel.  You'll defer

               2  --

               3          A.   Defer to counsel, but --

               4          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  And then

               5  also, Dr. Phillips, what he has to say about

               6  all this, you -- you would be, look at what he

               7  has to say about all this?

               8          A.   Yeah.  I'm not sure I'm -- would

               9  still be in a position to really judge the

              10  accuracy of it, but ....

              11          Q.   Throughout what I showed you with

              12  the mm-hmms, there was no, you know, pushback

              13  from you on those things, correct?

              14          A.   I could neither confirm nor deny

              15  them.  I mean, they're not -- they're not

              16  anything I really know much about.

              17          Q.   You didn't tell them they weren't

              18  true, though, correct?

              19          A.   I could neither confirm or deny

              20  them.  I don't know them to be true.  I don't

              21  know them to be false.

              22          Q.   But you knew that Dr. Holland --

              23  well, you knew that Dr. Holland's volume was

              24  significantly less than Dr. Hashmi's, correct?

              25          A.   That I did know, yes.



                                                               280


               1          Q.   Now, you asked Dr. Phillips, on

               2  page 16 of lines 13 to 15, are you

               3  coordinating with Phillips, because he seems

               4  to at least somebody you're --

               5             Dr. Holland:  No, he's --

               6             New Speaker:  It seems like there

               7  is some level of cooperation there that -- and

               8  I know he's -- yeah.  I know he's agreed to

               9  say I'll cover for you on all your time, which

              10  that got -- that bridge got burned a little

              11  bit with Hashmi, which I think he potentially

              12  winded up going to.  But it doesn't seem

              13  (inaudible) now.

              14             All right.  Just kind of put that

              15  in perspective.

              16          A.   I don't know what all that means,

              17  or what I'm trying to say there, but I think

              18  what I'm trying to get to is -- is as -- as a

              19  practitioner on the medical staff, Dr. Holland

              20  needs a -- a physician that is his covering

              21  physician, so I think I'm asking, is Phillips

              22  your covering physician, because I doubt

              23  Hashmi is at this point.

              24          Q.   Okay.

              25          A.   Okay?



                                                               281


               1          Q.   You see later on that Mr. --

               2  Dr. Holland makes a reference to the Perceval

               3  valve program?

               4          A.   The?

               5          Q.   Perceval valve program on page

               6  19.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   Do you recall asking anyone to

               9  investigate Dr. Hashmi's use of the Perceval

              10  valves?

              11          A.   Probably after the meeting, and I

              12  don't -- I don't -- can't say for certain,

              13  Greg was there, he heard the same things I

              14  heard.  My usual position would have been,

              15  Greg, can you -- can you track down these

              16  things that he's bringing up.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And page 21, Dr. Holland,

              18  at line 7, advised you, That's enough to shut

              19  down a program.  No hospital in the United

              20  States would allow a surgeon to experiment on

              21  patients to get his numbers up.  It's enough

              22  to shut it down.  He had -- when he was trying

              23  to learn minimally invasive aortic surgery, he

              24  had back-to-back deaths within 36 hours, and

              25  it's in the complaint, and I took care of



                                                               282


               1  those patients.  I knew -- knew those

               2  patients.

               3             New Speaker:  Right.

               4             So just in reference to that --

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to the

               6  self-serving narratives in this transcript.

               7          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- you were

               8  being advised of information that Dr. Holland

               9  believed could shut the entire program down,

              10  correct, according to him?

              11          A.   I don't believe he's talking

              12  about the St. Anne's program here.  I think

              13  he's talking about the St. V's program.

              14          Q.   St. Vincent, correct.  Correct,

              15  is that what you thought, St. Vincent?

              16          A.   I was -- I -- I assumed he was

              17  talking about St. Vincent's.

              18          Q.   Fair enough.  Because the focus

              19  was on Dr. Hashmi issues, correct?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Okay.

              22          A.   Who predominantly practiced at

              23  St. V's.

              24          Q.   On the last page, page 26,

              25  Dr. Holland advises you, on lines 5 through 7,



                                                               283


               1  What is it, five percent of the people cause

               2  95 percent of the problems?

               3             New Speaker:  That's true.

               4          A.   Yes.

               5          Q.   You see that?

               6             Is that -- is that normally a

               7  statistic, I think that's cited in the medical

               8  field, is it not, that essentially, what it

               9  turns out, is that five percent of the medical

              10  doctors are responsible for 95 percent of

              11  medical malpractice litigation?

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative.

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Or something

              14  along those lines.  Is that what you're

              15  referencing there, or is it something else?

              16          A.   I don't know.  I think this is

              17  more tongue and cheek discussion about --

              18          Q.   No.  I'm just wondering if you

              19  know whether that's an actual rule of thumb

              20  that actually exists.

              21          A.   I have -- I have no knowledge.

              22          Q.   Whether or not there's been

              23  statistics shown that it's a relatively small

              24  portion of the medical population that winds

              25  up accounting for a very large portion of the



                                                               284


               1  medical malpractice cases and --

               2          A.   5 to 95, just from general

               3  industry knowledge, would seem to be --

               4          Q.   A high spread?

               5          A.   -- a high spread.

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7          A.   But I don't really know.

               8          Q.   After this meeting with

               9  Dr. Holland, who did you report back to, if

              10  anyone, about what had been discussed in the

              11  meeting?

              12          A.   I don't really, like I said, the

              13  only other subsequent conversation I remember

              14  around this was just the, again, it wasn't a

              15  sit-down meeting.  It was just a quick

              16  conference with Katrina and Dr. Andrabi on,

              17  are we kind of moving, have you had a chance

              18  to review this EEOC?  Are we moving forward

              19  with all the things we talked about?  And they

              20  said, yeah, we're good to go.  And you know,

              21  that was kind of the last thing I remember

              22  about it.

              23          Q.   Give me one second.  I misplaced

              24  something.

              25             I believe it's Exhibit 138, which



                                                               285


               1  is the Dr. Hashmi contract extension.

               2          A.   Okay.

               3          Q.   I believe that's the number on

               4  it.  If you can just flip to that.

               5          A.   To 138?

               6          Q.   Yes.  And then this term, as we

               7  see, is May 1, 2017, correct?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Now, if you can turn to

              10  Exhibit 113, in the second binder.

              11          A.   Oh, okay.  Okay.

              12          Q.   And then, if you look at

              13  Exhibit 113, you'll see that Greg Hood tells

              14  Jamie Holland, down about May 4, 2017, sorry I

              15  wasn't involved in the first contract.  I will

              16  get you an answer.  I heard Dr. Phillips

              17  reached out to you about call.  I have

              18  approval to move forward on the call contract.

              19             Do you see that?

              20          A.   This is May 1st.  Okay.

              21          Q.   May 4th, 2017.

              22          A.   May 4th, I'm sorry.

              23          Q.   Yes.

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   And so does this help refresh



                                                               286


               1  your recollection as to roughly when it was

               2  that the call agreement ultimately got put in

               3  place with Dr. Holland?

               4          A.   It looks like May, but I don't --

               5  I don't know the exact date.

               6          Q.   Yeah.  I'm not going to hold you

               7  to the actual date it was signed, whether it's

               8  May or June, but roughly, at least as of this

               9  time frame, approval had been obtained,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   It looks that way, yes.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Now, what do you know

              13  happened between, if anything, between

              14  March 17th and May 4th that caused or delayed

              15  this call agreement from being approved, when

              16  you had already obtained approvals prior,

              17  during February of 2017?

              18          A.   The only -- the only thing I can

              19  think of really going on at that time was, you

              20  know, you did have a change in leadership at

              21  V's, so Dempsey probably needed to be brought

              22  up to speed with this and made sure he was

              23  comfortable.  I --

              24          Q.   Okay.

              25          A.   -- I'll tell you as a



                                                               287


               1  self-critique, Mercy is notoriously slow, so

               2  it's -- sometimes there is just delays and

               3  things that's kind of inexplicable, but I

               4  don't -- I don't recall specifically.

               5          Q.   Fair enough.

               6             Do you know a -- do you know a

               7  woman named Robyn Schuller?

               8          A.   Yeah, that's my assistant.

               9          Q.   That's your assistant.  And I'll

              10  represent to you -- I don't have a printout of

              11  this right now, but I'll represent to you --

              12  give me one second.  Bates stamp number, for

              13  the record.  This is -- this -- for reference

              14  purposes, ultimately Bates stamp 5177 through

              15  5179, but I'll represent to you that

              16  Robyn Schuller sent Greg Hood an email on

              17  July 7th, 2017.

              18          A.   July 7th, 2017, from Robyn

              19  Schuller to Greg?

              20          Q.   Yes.

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   Forward, need signature on the

              23  attached agreement for the St. Anne cardiology

              24  contract.

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               288


               1          Q.   And then it was @sadirector.pdf.

               2  Do you recall Dr. Holland signing an agreement

               3  about being a director of some sort at

               4  St. Anne's?

               5          A.   So what -- in July, I believe it

               6  was July 1st of 2017, we -- we -- from the

               7  time period that we started the programs at

               8  St. Anne's, Dr. Holland was a member of our

               9  cardiac consulting agreement.  Okay?  He was

              10  eligible for the performance bonus portion of

              11  that agreement, but he was not eligible for an

              12  hourly rate, because in essence, the hourly

              13  rate was already being -- already being

              14  covered by the other agreement, the -- the

              15  Toledo Clinic-Mercy agreement.

              16             In July of 2017, that was -- we --

              17  Holland -- in July of 2017, Holland's role

              18  never really changed.  He stayed the section

              19  chief of cardiothoracic surgery, he was the

              20  chair, or co-chair of the CVTU operations

              21  meeting, and he came to a lot of the meetings.

              22             The only difference was, because he

              23  no longer had essentially that arrangement

              24  with Mercy, with dollars flowing to the Toledo

              25  Clinic, he became eligible for the hourly



                                                               289


               1  rate.  So it -- I know there are some

               2  questions in here about medical directorship

               3  and that type of thing.  In my mind, that --

               4  that was the equivalent of a medical

               5  directorship.  We don't really -- wasn't

               6  really called that, but that's, in essence,

               7  what it was.

               8          Q.   I'll represent to you that

               9  Ms. Schuller wrote, yahoo, we got it!!!! Four

              10  exclamations.

              11          A.   Yeah.

              12          Q.   You were happy to have

              13  Dr. Holland sign that agreement?

              14          A.   I don't know if it was his

              15  signature or others that she's referencing on

              16  there.

              17          Q.   Fair enough.

              18          A.   We're always happy to get an

              19  agreement across the finish line.

              20          Q.   I'll tell you that the last email

              21  prior to her responding, four minutes earlier,

              22  was from Dr. Holland to -- it was from

              23  Dr. Holland to Robyn, see attached, have a

              24  good weekend.

              25          A.   Okay.  He probably signed the



                                                               290


               1  signature page, sent it on, and then we had --

               2  there were -- there is probably 10 to 12

               3  doctors that participate in that.

               4          Q.   The difference being in terms of

               5  Dr. Holland, that the -- what was previously

               6  referenced in an email is the 100 percent

               7  salary and benefits that were a flow-through

               8  from Mercy to Toledo Clinic, Toledo Clinic to

               9  Dr. Holland, that was no longer in place?

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              11  foundation.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Correct?

              13          A.   I'll just call it the

              14  professional services agreement that we have

              15  talked about, where Tom provided notice.

              16  That's the agreement I'm referencing.

              17          Q.   Do you have any understanding, or

              18  knowledge, as to what happened with Adam

              19  Carruthers in terms of being an assistant to

              20  Dr. Holland in or about 2017?

              21          A.   Do you have a more specific

              22  question?

              23          Q.   Yeah.  Let me go through this a

              24  little bit.  Jennifer Haaser ultimately

              25  reported up the chain to -- the -- the chain



                                                               291


               1  that goes to Arquilla/Andrabi, correct?  To

               2  your knowledge?

               3          A.   Ultimately, at that time,

               4  everybody would have, you know, would end with

               5  Andrabi, but okay.

               6          Q.   But not -- she wasn't in your

               7  chain of command, Jennifer Haaser?

               8          A.   That's correct.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And so an issue arose

              10  about support, and just tell me if you know

              11  anything about this, is that after Dr. Holland

              12  was no longer going to be providing services

              13  through the service agreement, an issue arose

              14  about the support of Adam Carruthers, or other

              15  physician assistants with Dr. Holland.  Did

              16  you ever get informed of anything about that

              17  at the time?

              18          A.   Yeah.  That was, in my opinion, a

              19  misunderstanding, because I think we got --

              20          Q.   Where do you have the facts from?

              21  Who told you anything about it, first of all?

              22          A.   I think Dr. Holland might have

              23  told me about it.

              24          Q.   Okay.  And what made you think

              25  that there was a misunderstanding?



                                                               292


               1          A.   Because it quickly got resolved.

               2          Q.   Well, isn't it true that

               3  Dr. -- that Dr. Holland was never provided,

               4  after the service agreement was terminated, he

               5  was provided no physician assistant support

               6  for any of his patients, other than in the

               7  operating room itself?  Is that --

               8          A.   That's true.

               9          Q.   Okay.  So that was different,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   That was different than the other

              12  arrangement.

              13          Q.   And that makes it harder for him

              14  to practice medicine, doesn't it?

              15          A.   I don't think it was an unduly

              16  burden, given how busy he was, but ....

              17          Q.   Well, his income had basically

              18  been -- there was no financial support, not

              19  even -- not 100 percent level from Mercy, not

              20  a 50 percent level, not a 20 percent level,

              21  0 percent level, was what the support was,

              22  right?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative.

              24          A.   That's a separate issue than the

              25  PA.  What his income was was a separate issue.



                                                               293


               1          Q.   Right.

               2          A.   I don't think the removal of the

               3  PA to do his floor rounds placed a burden on

               4  him.

               5          Q.   Well --

               6          A.   Given the -- given the -- given

               7  the level of work that he was doing.

               8          Q.   It can impact his income, though,

               9  correct?

              10          A.   I -- not -- I -- I'm not an

              11  expert, but I don't think so.

              12          Q.   Well, the biggest impact then was

              13  then the -- the pullout of the support on the

              14  services agreement, correct?

              15          A.   I'm not sure of the details, but

              16  I assume that would have some impact, yes.

              17          Q.   All right.  Let's take a couple

              18  of minute break.  This will hopefully be my

              19  last break of questioning.  I have some

              20  additional documents and questions, I think I

              21  have, but let me just cut down on material.

              22  And I'll be done fairly soon --

              23          A.   Sure.

              24          Q.   -- and then I'll give Mr. Wiencek

              25  time, so you can get out of here by your 6:30



                                                               294


               1  time.

               2          A.   Oh, I appreciate that.

               3          Q.   No problem.  No problem.  Thank

               4  you.

               5             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record.

               6             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

               7  4:46 until 4:57.)

               8             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on

               9  record.

              10          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Bertke, we

              11  just came back from a break.  Do you recall

              12  Dr. Holland being advertised in St. Anne

              13  marketing materials?

              14          A.   Um, yeah, I guess he might have

              15  been.  I don't -- I don't specifically

              16  remember a piece, but ....

              17          Q.   You don't remember a specific

              18  one, but you know that it did happen from time

              19  to time?

              20          A.   It -- we -- we didn't -- we

              21  didn't have a lot of marketing materials, but

              22  so you know, I don't -- no.  He was never on a

              23  billboard, or anything of that nature, but --

              24  so I -- I can -- I can't really say I remember

              25  something specifically, but ....



                                                               295


               1          Q.   Do you know what Toledo Medicine

               2  Columns are?

               3          A.   Toledo Medicine -- I write.

               4          Q.   Let me just reference this

               5  quickly.  We'll just -- it will make it

               6  easier, Exhibit 152.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 152

               9  was marked for identification.)

              10          A.   Yeah.  So these are -- the Toledo

              11  Medicine, if I'm thinking of the right thing,

              12  was -- this is a column that appeared in the

              13  Toledo Academy of Medicine.  Yes, I'm sorry.

              14          Q.   And then this would contain --

              15  Dr. Holland's name is in here, do you see

              16  that, correct?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   Okay.  So then this was put out

              19  to the -- it's something, you know, whether it

              20  was altered, or what have you, at some point

              21  something like this was published in the

              22  Toledo Medicine Column, to the best of your

              23  recollection?

              24          A.   Yeah.  There was a, again, if I'm

              25  thinking of the right thing, there was a



                                                               296


               1  section where each hospital wrote a little

               2  article about things going on at the hospital.

               3  This is what I think what we were working on

               4  here.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Skip ahead to 2018, I

               6  believe, and then we'll be getting close to

               7  being done.  Exhibit 153.

               8          A.   Okay.

               9             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 153

              10  was marked for identification.)

              11          A.   Okay.

              12          Q.   Oh, incidentally, I wanted to

              13  come back to one point, before I ask you about

              14  this.

              15             Do you recall when I showed you an

              16  email pertaining to -- people had to vote with

              17  regard to the call agreement.  Do you recall

              18  that?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   And one of the people on that

              21  list was Mr. Dempsey.  Do you recall that?

              22          A.   He is a member of that committee.

              23          Q.   Okay.

              24          A.   I don't recall his name on there,

              25  but he's a member of the committee, so it



                                                               297


               1  wouldn't surprise me.

               2          Q.   And for reference purposes, would

               3  it surprise you that Mr. Dempsey, on or about

               4  February 7, 2017, and this is reflected in MSV

               5  1303, that on or about February 7th, 2017,

               6  Jeffrey Dempsey wrote, I approve contingent on

               7  FMV?

               8          A.   I -- it wouldn't surprise me, but

               9  I don't know that that happened, but okay.

              10          Q.   I don't have a copy right, marked

              11  right now, but I'm limited to support the

              12  copy, but I'll show you MSV 1303, the top

              13  section.

              14          A.   I approve.  Okay.  I approve.

              15  Can you go to the top?

              16          Q.   Yes.

              17          A.   I approve contingent on fair --

              18  fair market value.  That's what --

              19          Q.   Okay?

              20          A.   -- FMV is.

              21          Q.   All right.  Thank you.

              22             So coming back to Exhibit 153,

              23  which was the new one before you, January 3rd,

              24  2018, RE:  Cessation of activity.  Do you see

              25  that?



                                                               298


               1          A.   I'm sorry.  Okay, yes.

               2          Q.   And then if you go all the way

               3  back to the first chain, to the first, in this

               4  chain, it's January 2nd, 2018.  It says, Mike,

               5  please see attached letter.

               6             Do you see that?

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   And does this assist in

               9  refreshing your recollection that Dr. Holland

              10  sent a letter on or about January 2nd, 2018,

              11  in which cessation of activity, or ceasing

              12  activity at Mercy hospitals was discussed?

              13          A.   It sounds right.

              14          Q.   Okay.  And then if you go to MSV

              15  1714, which is the prior page, you write, in

              16  response to Mr. D'Eramo, We need a CT surgeon.

              17  Correct?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19          Q.   And then Tom Leeds writes back,

              20  Daniel Dibardino has an offer in hand.  Second

              21  visit to be scheduled.  Tom.

              22          A.   Okay.

              23          Q.   And then you write, What if

              24  Holland brings Adam with him?  Likely

              25  scenario.  And then Dempsey asks you, Do we



                                                               299


               1  really think that's a possibility?  And then

               2  you write, Maybe not likely possible.  Not

               3  like Adam has been happy here.

               4             Do you see that?

               5          A.   Yep.

               6          Q.   Okay.  And then in terms of the

               7  final email, at the very top of the chain, it

               8  indicates you had talked to Dr. Holland,

               9  correct?

              10          A.   Sounds like it.

              11          Q.   And he was moving, but did not

              12  have a job lined up?

              13          A.   That's correct.

              14          Q.   And then you note, so the current

              15  crisis remains.  Do you see that?

              16          A.   Yeah.

              17          Q.   What was the crisis that you

              18  believe existed at that point?  That there was

              19  only one surgeon at that point?  Or two?

              20          A.   He did case today, but only last

              21  30 minutes.  I don't know.  I don't know.

              22  Could either be the -- could either be

              23  referencing potentially Adam leaving, or could

              24  be the number of surgeons that would be left,

              25  if Dr. Holland left, which I don't -- I don't



                                                               300


               1  know what it was at that time, because I'm not

               2  sure when Hashmi left.

               3          Q.   Okay.  We showed you a contract

               4  before.  You're not sure if he lasted through

               5  the entirety of the contract, correct?

               6          A.   Oh.

               7          Q.   Do you know whether he did or

               8  didn't?

               9          A.   Not off the top of my head, no.

              10          Q.   Okay.  Do you have any

              11  recollection that his contract, his one-year

              12  contract was terminated early?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Next up is Exhibit 154.

              15             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 154

              16  was marked for identification.)

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) This is an

              18  April 9th email from yourself --

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   -- April 9th, 2018 from yourself

              21  to Robyn Schuller, Challenge, Subject:

              22  Challenge?

              23          A.   Okay.

              24          Q.   So here you note, in April of

              25  2018, we currently have three CT surgeons



                                                               301


               1  covering the programs at St. Anne and

               2  St. Vincent.  Dr. Hashmi is retiring, and

               3  Dr. Ghazoul is taking another opportunity in

               4  Cleveland.

               5             Do you see that?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   Why is it, to your knowledge,

               8  that Dr. Ghazoul's tenure at Mercy was so

               9  short?

              10          A.   My understanding with Ghazoul

              11  was, he always wanted to go to Cleveland.  And

              12  he took this job, I don't remember where he

              13  came from.  I think it was Arizona.  And he --

              14  he took this job to be closer to home, but

              15  then something opened up in Cleveland, so he

              16  took the job in Cleveland.

              17          Q.   Well, you're noting here, as of

              18  April, that we will be down one cardiac

              19  surgeon from our ideal number.

              20          A.   Yeah.  So we're -- our ideal

              21  number is three, so we had Phillips and Dibar

              22  -- Phillips -- Phillips would have been here,

              23  of course, and then Dr. Dibardino, who would

              24  have been new.

              25          Q.   Do you recall a time period in



                                                               302


               1  2018, when Mercy advertised a position for a

               2  surgeon in the Toledo area, and Dr. Holland

               3  applied for it?

               4          A.   We were advertising for a

               5  surgeon, yeah.

               6          Q.   Do you recall receiving notice

               7  that Dr. Holland applied for that position?

               8          A.   Yeah, I think I recall that.

               9          Q.   And then what happened at that

              10  point, when he applied for that position, what

              11  do you recall happening internally, if

              12  anything?

              13          A.   What I -- what I recall is we had

              14  Dr. Kokocki signed, and he was really

              15  thoracics, but he indicated he would do

              16  cardiac, and so we kind of felt maybe we could

              17  get by with three surgeons, with one of them

              18  having the thoracic capability, instead of

              19  four.

              20          Q.   Was there any -- was there any --

              21  when you indicated previously evaluation

              22  process, when Dr. Holland's resume came in, or

              23  indication came he was applying for the job,

              24  was there any consideration given as to hiring

              25  him?



                                                               303


               1          A.   I don't -- I don't know the

               2  timing on everything, but I think eventually,

               3  and Jim Weidner kind of posed the question, do

               4  we really need a fourth surgeon?  And I mean,

               5  the drill at Mercy is we're always looking for

               6  opportunities to reduce costs.  I think that's

               7  pretty much any healthcare system, so he asked

               8  the question, if Kokocki can do hearts, do we

               9  really need four surgeons?

              10             So to tell -- I don't know if

              11  anybody was really reviewed for that position

              12  in the end.

              13          Q.   Did you ever hear any -- did you

              14  ever hear that Dr. Holland had applied for a

              15  job with Toledo in Cincinnati, or strike that.

              16             That Dr. Holland applied for a job

              17  with Mercy in Cincinnati?

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   Did you ever --

              20          A.   Not that I recall, I should say.

              21          Q.   Do you ever recall hearing that,

              22  words to the effect, that an APBA, or an all

              23  points bulletin, was put out if Dr. Holland

              24  ever applied for a position at Mercy?

              25          A.   No.

               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

               2  foundation.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) I might be

               4  done, so give me a second.

               5          A.   Okay.

               6          Q.   I know Mr. Wiencek will have some

               7  questions for you.

               8             With regard to Dr. Kokocki, how --

               9  why is it that he left?

              10          A.   Dr. Kokocki?

              11          Q.   Kokocki, yes.  I'm sorry.

              12  Kokocki, why did he leave?

              13          A.   I don't know.  He resigned.

              14          Q.   Do you know why he resigned?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   Do you know how old Dr. Kokocki

              17  was?

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   Did you ever receive any notice,

              20  or come to understand that -- strike that.

              21             I think that's all I have for now.

              22  I might have some follow-up, once Mr. Wiencek

              23  is done, but thank you --

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   -- for you time so far.



                                                               305


               1  Appreciate it.

               2                     EXAMINATION

               3  BY MR. WIENCEK:

               4          Q.   Brad, has Dr. Holland's tape

               5  recording of you during that March 17th

               6  meeting affected your ability to be truthful

               7  today?

               8          A.   I don't think so.

               9          Q.   During any of your discussions,

              10  if you were party to any discussions regarding

              11  the consideration of ending Dr. Holland's

              12  employment relationship with Mercy regarding

              13  his ability to practice there, did you ever

              14  hear anything that was based on complaints

              15  about safety as the reason for ending that

              16  ability to practice?

              17             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              18  Object to the extent it's asked and answered.

              19          A.   Can you -- can you make --

              20  because I think in the beginning you said

              21  employment agreement.  He never had an

              22  employment agreement, so ....

              23          Q.   Well, his -- to the effect, to

              24  the extent he was allowed to practice there,

              25  and was practicing there, pursuant to the



                                                               306


               1  service agreement --

               2          A.   Okay.

               3          Q.   -- was there any discussion that

               4  the reason for terminating the service

               5  agreement was based on any of Dr. Holland's

               6  complaint about safety issues?

               7          A.   No.

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to form.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Let's take a

              10  look at Exhibit 137.

              11          A.   Okay.  Oh, this was one of the

              12  ones today?  37?

              13          Q.   137.

              14          A.   Did that come today?

              15          Q.   I believe so.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   Take a look at the second page,

              18  005643.

              19          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              20          Q.   And both on -- on page 5644, the

              21  -- the narrative that -- that Dr. Holland sent

              22  to Ed Nahhas.

              23          A.   Okay.

              24          Q.   Now, what does this represent to

              25  you, after you -- after you have read this?



                                                               307


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               2          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Is this

               3  something that was -- was common, these kinds

               4  of long narratives?

               5             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               6          A.   My -- this is kind of common with

               7  my experience with Dr. Holland, in that when

               8  something happened, if it put him in an

               9  unfavorable light at all, there was kind of

              10  this long list of issues and things brought

              11  up, and a lot of defensive mechanisms, as

              12  opposed just, is there a better way to handle

              13  it.

              14          Q.   And I see that Ed -- Ed Nahhas

              15  was involved in this.  Was that unusual for

              16  Ed Nahhas to be involved in -- in significant

              17  issues regarding his employment?

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              19          A.   Dr. Nahhas was usually in --

              20  involved with all these issues.  He was the

              21  contact point with Mercy for the professional

              22  services agreement.  Since he was an employee

              23  of the Toledo Clinic, a lot of these issues,

              24  Dr. Nahhas would be involved with.

              25          Q.   Did Dr. Holland have a



                                                               308


               1  supervisor?

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               3  No, withdraw that.

               4          A.   A supervisor would -- it probably

               5  be Dr. Nahhas.

               6             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

               7  extent it calls for a legal conclusion.

               8          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Take a look at

               9  Exhibit 40.  In the middle of the page, where

              10  it says, I don't know if this will be viewed

              11  as passive-aggressive, but I won't go on

              12  record just hiring this guy (along with

              13  Holland issue) could blow things up.

              14             What was the Holland issue you were

              15  referring to in that sentence?

              16             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

              17  extent it's been asked and answered.

              18          A.   I think the -- the issue with the

              19  Holland issue was, as I was saying, was the

              20  agreement was going to change with him, so --

              21          Q.   Okay.

              22          A.   -- and I referenced that later in

              23  the -- the email.

              24          Q.   And what about blowing things up,

              25  what did you mean by that?



                                                               309


               1          A.   I just -- you know --

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

               3  extent it was asked and answered, but go

               4  ahead.

               5          A.   Okay.  I was trying to preserve

               6  the relationship with the Toledo Clinic, in

               7  making sure they were involved with evaluating

               8  future candidates.

               9          Q.   Okay.  Take a look at 145.

              10          A.   Should have kept them in order.

              11  Okay.

              12          Q.   Look at this.  Toward the bottom,

              13  where it says on February 7, 2017, there is --

              14  there is a parenthetical, Mercy paid Toledo

              15  Clinic 100 percent salary and physician

              16  benefits.

              17             Do you see that?

              18          A.   Yeah.

              19          Q.   What were you communicating

              20  there?

              21             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

              22  extent it's been asked and answered.

              23          A.   I guess it's -- probably what I

              24  should have said we -- we pay a service

              25  agreement to Toledo Clinic currently for



                                                               310


               1  Dr. Holland's services.  And I -- I don't

               2  really have knowledge of exactly how this

               3  worked after that point.

               4             So, under the service agreement,

               5  there was a payment to the Toledo Clinic.

               6  What really happened after that point in time,

               7  I'm -- wasn't really familiar with.  The

               8  Clinic kind of handled it.

               9          Q.   Did Mercy-St. Vincent or

              10  Mercy-St. Anne ever pay Dr. Holland's salary

              11  directly?

              12          A.   No, he was not on the payroll at

              13  Mercy, no.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Did they -- did they ever

              15  provide him benefits directly?

              16          A.   No.  Probably could have worded

              17  that section in the email better.

              18          Q.   Take a look at 151.

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   That's the transcript.

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   Directing your attention to page

              23  10.

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   Line 21.  It says, Dr. Holland:



                                                               311


               1  So I don't have that.  But for certain that

               2  agreement is off?

               3             Do you know what agreement he was

               4  talking about?

               5          A.   What line are you on here?

               6          Q.   It's line 21.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   Page 10.

               9          A.   So I don't have that, but for

              10  certain, that agreement.  I believe he's

              11  talking about the call agreement.

              12          Q.   Okay.  And new speaker, was that

              13  you that said, that's not what I said?

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   And why did you say that?

              16          A.   Because that's not what I said.

              17  I simply referenced that there was clout, so

              18  there was some, you know, we needed to do some

              19  review on this, just to make sure we were

              20  fully complicit and understood the relations

              21  on the EEOC complaint, but I never really said

              22  the call agreement was off.  I didn't -- I

              23  just simply said that.

              24          Q.   Have you read the entire

              25  transcript of the tape recording of March 17



                                                               312


               1  --

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   -- 2017?

               4             And did it -- now that you have

               5  read the tape recording, do you have any

               6  impression of what you believe was happening

               7  in this -- in this meeting?

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               9  That calls for speculation.

              10          A.   In this --

              11          Q.   What is your perception of what

              12  was happening in this meeting?

              13          A.   In that specific circumstance --

              14          Q.   No.

              15          A.   -- and others?

              16          Q.   The entire -- the entire

              17  transcript, the entire conversation.

              18          A.   He had -- he had an agenda that

              19  he wanted me to agree to.  And for example,

              20  here, he wanted to bait me into saying yes,

              21  which I didn't do, but ....

              22             MR. ARCHINACO:  Move to strike.

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) What about

              24  overall, the entire transcript, what was your

              25  perception of what was going on, the real



                                                               313


               1  purpose of the conversation?

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

               3  and to the statement "real focus of the

               4  conversation".

               5          A.   I mean, it's kind of long

               6  monologues of Dr. Holland speaking.  It seems

               7  like he's setting this up for whatever

               8  purposes, I don't know, but ... setting this

               9  up for -- to get his side of the story on the

              10  record, I guess is the way I would describe

              11  it.

              12          Q.   Now, you were aware of

              13  Dr. Holland's arrest for criminal mischief

              14  involving his neighbor in August 2014?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   And did you ever discuss that

              17  incident with him?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19          Q.   And what did you tell him?

              20          A.   I don't -- he -- he came by the

              21  office.  I don't know if it was by design, or

              22  just popped in.  And I just simply said, you

              23  know, Dr. Holland, I got a call from your

              24  neighbor.  I remember, you know, kind of, I

              25  remember a reaction like, you know, jeez.  And



                                                               314


               1  then I just kind of asked him, you know, this

               2  concerning, what, you know, what -- what his

               3  side of the story.  And then he, you know,

               4  proceeded to tell the events of the night.

               5          Q.   And how did you perceive his

               6  reaction?  Or his explanation?

               7          A.   Some of it made sense, some of it

               8  didn't really make sense.  I referenced, you

               9  know, some of the -- can't remember if I threw

              10  tomatoes or not.  That didn't really make

              11  sense to me.  Some of it didn't seem to be

              12  plausible, in my opinion, but ....

              13          Q.   Let's take a look at Exhibit 65

              14  and 66.

              15          A.   Okay.

              16          Q.   65 says, Danielle, do not mention

              17  us replacing Dr. Holland.  We do not want that

              18  to be heard or get out.

              19             Is that correct?

              20          A.   Correct.

              21          Q.   66 says, Thank you for the heads

              22  up.  Who is to officially inform Dr. Holland

              23  of his release, correct?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   What kinds of discussions were



                                                               315


               1  going on, this is six months after that arrest

               2  and tomato incident, what kind of discussions

               3  were going on during this time about

               4  Dr. Holland and his relationship, and ability

               5  to practice at Mercy-St. Vincent or

               6  St. Anne's?

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

               8  and also to the extent it calls for

               9  speculation.

              10          A.   In terms of his ability to

              11  practice, I won't -- won't necessarily comment

              12  on that.  But I just think in terms of overall

              13  his fit within the cardiothoracic surgery

              14  program, I would say ever -- ever -- after

              15  that arrest, you know, came in, there was, I

              16  think I alluded to a little bit earlier around

              17  some of the issues and concerns when he came.

              18  Kind of a fresh start at Anne's.  We get this

              19  arrest.  So I would say this was just kind of

              20  an ongoing dialogue.  It kind of plays out

              21  like a movie.  I can't -- it's almost like

              22  it's hard to remember specific circumstances

              23  and conversations, but there were just a lot

              24  of them about, is it the right fit with

              25  Dr. Holland.  And that was, like not an every



                                                               316


               1  day discussion, but it came up on a regular

               2  basis.

               3          Q.   Were there any committees needed

               4  to approve the call agreement that was being

               5  drafted up for Dr. Holland in 2017?

               6          A.   Yeah.  That -- that -- yeah.

               7  There is -- there is committee reviews for

               8  those.

               9          Q.   And does that take any time to

              10  review that?

              11          A.   Yeah, depending on when the

              12  committee meets and so forth, that can -- that

              13  can play into delays and timing.

              14          Q.   Do you know the name of the

              15  committee?

              16          A.   The - we call it the PSC, stands

              17  for Physicians -- PSC, Physician Service

              18  Council, something.

              19          Q.   Do you know how often it meets?

              20          A.   Every -- now it meets a little

              21  more often.  I think back then, it met every

              22  month.

              23          Q.   Okay.  So was this committee also

              24  charged with reviewing Dr. Holland's call

              25  agreement?



                                                               317


               1          A.   Not just Dr. Holland's.  Any --

               2  any call agreement, any type of service

               3  arrangement with doctors would go to that

               4  committee.

               5          Q.   Okay.  So to the extent there was

               6  a delay between March of '17 and May of '17,

               7  when the call agreement was ultimately

               8  executed, then what would you attribute that

               9  delay to?

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

              11  as asked and answered.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Go ahead.

              13          A.   I -- I answered it earlier.

              14  There were a couple of different moving parts

              15  in there in terms of leadership with V's, and

              16  changes there.  You know, confirmation with

              17  cardiothoracic surgeons around their

              18  acceptance of it, and the committee -- there

              19  could be a committee approval in there as

              20  well.

              21          Q.   Did you get a sense that

              22  Dr. Holland knew that the services agreement

              23  was going to be terminated?

              24             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

              25  to the extent it would call for any



                                                               318


               1  speculation.

               2          A.   I -- I think Dr. Holland knew he

               3  was, that he was, you know, that he was under

               4  scrutiny, and that may be an eventual

               5  consequence.

               6          Q.   Do you have any estimation of

               7  when he -- you sensed he might have known

               8  that?

               9          A.   From the day he came to

              10  St. Anne's.  I mean, you know, pretty much, it

              11  seemed to be he was on, defensive about things

              12  from the day he got there.

              13          Q.   Did you notice any pattern in his

              14  complaints about safety and patient issues

              15  after that time?

              16             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

              17  extent it calls for speculation, lacks

              18  foundation.

              19          A.   Maybe in retrospect, but at the

              20  time, I don't know if it.

              21          Q.   Okay.  But in retrospect, what is

              22  your perception?

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              24  Object to the extent it calls for speculation

              25  and lack of foundation.



                                                               319


               1          A.   Can you repeat the question

               2  again?

               3             (Whereupon, the court reporter read

               4  back the requested testimony.)

               5          A.   I guess the -- the specifics and

               6  the frequency increased towards the end, but

               7  they -- but there had been times in the past

               8  he did it as well, but the frequency and

               9  occurrence picked up at the end.

              10          Q.   And do you know Dr. Bruhl?

              11          A.   I do know Dr. Bruhl.

              12          Q.   And what race and national origin

              13  is he?

              14          A.   Race, he's Caucasian, and

              15  national origin?

              16          Q.   (Nods head.)

              17          A.   I think he's American, American

              18  born.

              19          Q.   What about Scott Porterfield, do

              20  you know him?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   What is his race?

              23          A.   He's Caucasian.

              24          Q.   What is his national origin?

              25          A.   I believe he told me he's a --



                                                               320


               1  he's been in Toledo his whole life, so I would

               2  assume he's an American.

               3          Q.   And what about Elizabeth

               4  Sheroian, do you know her?

               5          A.   Not -- not -- I don't know if I

               6  can say.  I maybe met her once.

               7          Q.   Do you know her race?

               8          A.   I believe she's white, Caucasian.

               9          Q.   Do you know her national origin?

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   Do you know whether anyone from

              12  Mercy-St. Anne had input or influence over the

              13  terms of Dr. Holland's contract with the

              14  Toledo Clinic?

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

              16  to the extent it calls for a legal conclusion.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did they -- were

              18  they --

              19          A.   Did anybody at St. Anne's have

              20  influence?

              21          Q.   Yeah.  Did they --

              22          A.   No.

              23          Q.   -- did they participate at all in

              24  the negotiations of Dr. Holland's contract

              25  with the Toledo Clinic?



                                                               321


               1          A.   The original agreement signed in

               2  '13?

               3          Q.   That's correct.

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Have you read the services

               6  agreement between the Toledo Clinic and

               7  Mercy-St. Vincent?

               8          A.   Long time ago.

               9          Q.   Okay.  At St. Anne's, who had the

              10  right to control the manner and means of doing

              11  Dr. Holland's work at Mercy-St. Anne?

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

              13  extent it calls for a legal conclusion.

              14          A.   Dr. Holland -- Dr. Holland's

              15  clinical work, he was, you know, an

              16  independent contractor doing his own work.

              17          Q.   Did you have any determination

              18  over the manner and means of how Dr. Holland

              19  performed his surgeries at St. Anne's?

              20          A.   No.  No more, no less than any

              21  other doctor, so no.

              22          Q.   How about Mercy

              23  Health-Cincinnati, did they have any input or

              24  influence over how he practiced at

              25  Mercy-St. Anne's?



                                                               322


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   Did they have any influence,

               3  Mercy-Cincinnati have any influence on how

               4  referrals were made at St. Anne's?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   Did you have any input as to

               7  which patients would be admitted for surgery

               8  at Mercy-St. Anne's?

               9          A.   No, but -- let me --

              10  occasionally, in the very beginning, when we

              11  were doing, first starting the program, there

              12  -- there is something, I think it's called the

              13  EuroSCORE, which is kind of a measure of the

              14  acuity of the patients, and the likelihood for

              15  mortality.

              16             And because, you know, we --

              17  and Dr. Holland and I were in this discussion

              18  a lot about, you know, the -- we really want a

              19  clean record to start the program.

              20  Occasionally, we would look at this EuroSCORE,

              21  and we would discuss if the patient, if this

              22  was a good location for that patient, given --

              23  given that -- given the interest in having a

              24  good track record.

              25          Q.   So what kinds of patients for



                                                               323


               1  surgery were you accepting typically when you

               2  first began the -- you said October 2014?

               3          A.   I mean, what type is kind of a

               4  broad question.

               5          Q.   What kinds of surgeries were

               6  being performed, or did you accept for

               7  surgery, heart surgeries, at St. Anne's when

               8  you first started the program?

               9          A.   They were, you know, vessel and

              10  valves, so I don't know what the, you know,

              11  what the lineup is for that.

              12          Q.   Were they considered more

              13  complicated or less complicated?

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

              15  and to the extent it calls for speculation.

              16          A.   I don't think it necessarily had

              17  to do as much as what was the surgery, as how

              18  sick the patient was.

              19          Q.   Ah.  Okay.  So what kinds of --

              20  what level or degree of sickness then was

              21  being accepted --

              22          A.   Yeah.

              23          Q.   -- first?

              24          A.   This -- this is getting in

              25  clinical knowledge, and I'm, a little bit over



                                                               324


               1  my head, but you know, if the patient had

               2  renal conditions, or you know, their lung

               3  capacity was kind of, you know, those might --

               4  those all, from my understanding, which is

               5  limited, those all kind of contributed to your

               6  EuroSCORE, and then that might jump you into a

               7  higher risk category.  Those would be patients

               8  that occasionally we would -- and I -- I can't

               9  even, in recollection, tell you whether a high

              10  EuroSCORE is good, meaning sicker, or not as

              11  sick, but at the time, it could, and we would

              12  kind of have the discussion, is this a good

              13  patient for St. Anne's, or should we take it

              14  to St. V's?

              15          Q.   So were you essentially

              16  considering more lower-risk patients in the

              17  beginning?

              18          A.   In the beginning, yeah.

              19          Q.   Okay.  Was there ever a guarantee

              20  that Dr. Holland would practice at

              21  Mercy-St. Anne for any specific period of

              22  time?

              23          A.   No.

              24          Q.   And who determined the amount of

              25  his compensation at St. Anne?



                                                               325


               1          A.   Well, I wouldn't really say at

               2  St. Anne's.  I would just -- because he wasn't

               3  exclusively at St. Anne's, but the

               4  compensation was determined by the Clinic

               5  through the arrangement.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Was he required to

               7  practice exclusively at Mercy-St. Anne's?

               8          A.   Not that I know of, no.

               9          Q.   Was he prohibited from seeing

              10  non-Mercy patients while practicing at

              11  Mercy-St. Anne?

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

              13  and to the extent it calls for any speculation

              14  about insurance agreements.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Go ahead.

              16          A.   I wouldn't really classify our

              17  patients as Mercy or non-Mercy patients, I

              18  guess.  That -- I mean, he -- he could see

              19  patients from a variety of different referral

              20  sources, so they didn't all have to come from

              21  Mercy doctors, if that's what you mean.  In

              22  fact, the Toledo Clinic are not -- they

              23  practice at Mercy, but I wouldn't consider

              24  them Mercy physicians.

              25          Q.   Could Dr. Holland have maintained



                                                               326


               1  a separate surgical practice while he was

               2  practicing at Mercy-St. Anne's?

               3          A.   He -- he could have seen any

               4  patient from anywhere, and performed that at

               5  St. Anne's, if he wanted.

               6          Q.   Could he have had privileges at

               7  other hospitals in the Toledo market, if there

               8  was a need for his services and the providers

               9  approval?

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              11          A.   If the -- if the hospital --

              12  yeah, if he -- he could, theoretically, have

              13  privileges at other hospitals, yes.

              14          Q.   Was there any joint ownership

              15  interest between Mercy-St. Anne and the Toledo

              16  Clinic?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   Did the Toledo Clinic and

              19  Mercy-St. Anne have any corporate relationship

              20  whatsoever jointly?

              21          A.   No.

              22          Q.   With respect to Mercy-St. Anne

              23  and the Toledo Clinic, was there any common

              24  management between the two entities?

              25          A.   Common man -- no.



                                                               327


               1          Q.   Any centralized control of labor

               2  relations?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   Any common financial control?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   Any common assets?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   Any common identification and

               9  provider numbers?

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   Any common human resource

              12  Departments?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Were there any transfers of funds

              15  without service between entities?

              16          A.   Without service?

              17          Q.   That's correct.

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   Were there any common officers or

              20  boards of directors?

              21          A.   Not that I'm aware.  The only way

              22  a Toledo Clinic -- well, they wouldn't have

              23  been necessarily common board members.  That

              24  would have been pretty unusual, but the chief

               1  board.  If they happen to be on the Toledo

               2  Clinic board, they could maybe be on the same

               3  board, but that's, to my recollection, that

               4  has not occurred.

               5          Q.   Any common accounts receivable

               6  between the two --

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   -- entities?

               9             How about common billings between

              10  the two entities?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   Any common corporate records

              13  between the two entities?

              14          A.   No.

              15          Q.   Any shared bank accounts between

              16  the two entities?

              17          A.   Eh-heh.

              18          Q.   Any shared checking writing

              19  between the two entities?

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   Any shared insurance programs

              22  between the two entities?

              23          A.   No.

              24          Q.   Any shared office managers

              25  between the two entities?



                                                               329


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   Any shared office space between

               3  the two entities?

               4          A.   The only arrangement that I can

               5  think of that had a little bit of a shared

               6  office, and I don't know how you'd exactly

               7  describe it, but Dr. Holland, it was the

               8  Toledo Clinic physicians' office was at the CT

               9  surgery office, but ....

              10          Q.   How about any shared equipment

              11  and infrastructure?

              12          A.   Other than the one I mentioned,

              13  that's the, you know, with the -- did

              14  Dr. Holland use Mercy's printer at the CT

              15  surgery office?  Maybe.  But that would have

              16  been the only one.

              17          Q.   What about shared accountants?

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   So did Dr. Holland first begin

              20  practicing at St. Anne's in October 2014?

              21          A.   He might have done something at

              22  St. Anne's prior to that, maybe a thoracic

              23  case, but in terms of cardiac surgery, that

              24  was the first, that was the onset of his

              25  practice there.



                                                               330


               1          Q.   So between the time of

               2  March 2013, when he first began practicing at

               3  Mercy-St. Vincent, until the time he resigned

               4  and was no longer providing services to any

               5  healthcare provider in March of 2018, was

               6  Dr. Holland primarily practicing as a surgeon

               7  at St. Anne's in the Mercy system?

               8          A.   I would say yes.

               9          Q.   Now, what did he do when he was

              10  first assigned to Mercy-St. Anne?

              11          A.   Well, I don't know if I'd really

              12  describe him as assigned.  He migrated there,

              13  based on opportunity.

              14          Q.   Okay.

              15          A.   So he wasn't -- he could have

              16  gone to either St. V's, or St. Anne's.  He

              17  just migrated to St. Anne's, because that's

              18  where he was getting the bulk of the business

              19  and referrals.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Now, based on your

              21  knowledge, was there any way that someone

              22  could redirect surgery referrals at St. Anne's

              23  over the preference of referring

              24  cardiologists?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               331


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               2          A.   I do not think we could do that,

               3  no.

               4          Q.   Are you aware of any referrals

               5  that were redirected away from Dr. Holland at

               6  St. Anne's?

               7          A.   No.

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did you ever

              10  hear or see anything that led you to believe

              11  that referrals were being redirected away from

              12  Dr. Holland based on his race or national

              13  origin?

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              15          A.   Based on his race or ethnic

              16  origin, no.

              17          Q.   National origin?

              18          A.   National origin, no.

              19          Q.   Do you know Dr. Hashmi?

              20          A.   Dr. Hashmi, the cardiothoracic

              21  surgeon?

              22          Q.   That's correct.

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   Did he have any influence or

              25  responsibility in directing or preventing the



                                                               332


               1  direction of referrals to Dr. Holland at

               2  Mercy-St. Anne's?

               3             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

               4  and object to the extent it calls for

               5  speculation.

               6          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Go ahead.

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   So where did Dr. Holland get most

               9  of his referrals at St. Anne's?

              10          A.   From -- well, most of them were

              11  from the Toledo Clinic.

              12          Q.   And are you familiar with those

              13  of -- cardiologists there?

              14          A.   Yeah.  Pretty familiar with them,

              15  yes.

              16          Q.   How many of them are Caucasian?

              17          A.   I don't think any of them are.

              18          Q.   What about how many of them are

              19  United States citizens?

              20          A.   Citizens?

              21          Q.   Yeah.

              22          A.   That I don't know.

              23          Q.   So is it true that while he was

              24  at St. Anne, that he was receiving most of his

              25  referrals from cardiologists who were not



                                                               333


               1  Caucasian?

               2          A.   If I look at the Toledo Clinic,

               3  that would be, and that was the bulk, yes,

               4  that would be the case, that a vast majority

               5  would -- none of them are Caucasian.

               6          Q.   Would it also be true that he

               7  would be referring, receiving referrals from

               8  the Toledo Clinic from most of the doctors who

               9  were not United States citizens?

              10          A.   They're -- I don't know if

              11  they're citizens, but they're not -- I don't

              12  think -- I don't know if any of them were born

              13  here.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Did you ever witness or

              15  perceive any bias in referrals to Dr. Holland

              16  based on his race or national origin?

              17             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              18  Object to the extent it calls for a legal

              19  conclusion.  Speculation.

              20          A.   I -- I never heard this

              21  suggestion around race or ethnic origin, until

              22  this came up.

              23          Q.   You -- you testified earlier

              24  about a meeting on March 17th, 2017 that was

              25  tape recorded.  Did you ever consent to that



                                                               334


               1  tape recording?

               2          A.   No.

               3          Q.   Did you ever ask Dr. Holland if

               4  he was Irish during the meeting?

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   And what was the purpose of that

               7  question?

               8          A.   It was -- it was St. Patrick's

               9  Day.  I guess, looking back on it, it was just

              10  simply an icebreaker question.

              11          Q.   Did you ever discuss issues with

              12  relationships with other referring physicians

              13  during that meeting?

              14          A.   I believe so, yeah.

              15          Q.   And what did you intend to

              16  express to Dr. Holland, when you used the word

              17  relationships?

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to form.

              19          A.   Some of the things I referenced a

              20  little bit earlier, just, you know, his

              21  ability to build good relationships with

              22  cardiologists for referrals, and some of the

              23  issues that he's had with other members of the

              24  medical staff and staff in general.

              25          Q.   Did you ever use the word



                                                               335


               1  relationships in the context of race or

               2  national origin?

               3          A.   No.  I meant it more as

               4  interpersonal interaction.

               5          Q.   Did you ever suggest that

               6  Dr. Holland's Irish ancestry was an issue in

               7  his ability to receive referrals from

               8  cardiologists?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   With regard to the call agreement

              11  and Mr. Arquilla, what exactly did he say to

              12  you about not signing the agreement?  Did he

              13  say anything?

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

              15  extent it was asked and answered already.

              16          A.   Yeah.  I think I answered it

              17  earlier, which was just, he just, it wasn't

              18  signed, but I don't -- he didn't really give a

              19  reason on it.  And he didn't say he wasn't

              20  going to sign it.  He just said, I asked him

              21  if it's signed, and he said no.

              22          Q.   Did he ever tell you he was not

              23  going to sign the call agreement because of

              24  the discrimination claim?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               336


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               2          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did he ever tell

               3  you the reason --

               4             MR. ARCHINACO:  Asked and answered.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did he -- you

               6  know Dr. Andrabi?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   Did Dr. Andrabi, or Mr. Arquilla,

               9  ever direct you not to execute the call

              10  agreement with St. Anne's?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   Did you ever indicate to

              13  Dr. Holland that your hands were tied working

              14  out a call agreement for him, because of the

              15  discrimination claim, or for any other reason?

              16          A.   I think everything I said about

              17  the call agreement was pretty much covered on

              18  the discussion on the 17th, which was I don't

              19  know if I used the words hands tied.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Did you ever tell him that

              21  you would love to work with him, but the

              22  lawsuit or EEOC charge prevented you from

              23  doing so?

              24          A.   I don't remember saying that, no.

              25          Q.   And do you know Mike D'Eramo?



                                                               337


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   And what was his position at the

               3  time Dr. Holland was practicing at

               4  Mercy-St. Anne?

               5          A.   He -- he is the administrator of

               6  the clinic.  When he -- when he became

               7  administrator, I'm not 100 percent sure.

               8          Q.   Did you ever tell Mr. D'Eramo to

               9  inform Dr. Holland that he would need to

              10  withdraw his discrimination claims against

              11  Mercy before he could ever be employed by it?

              12          A.   I don't remember saying that.

              13          Q.   Other than the call --

              14          A.   I would say it more emphatically

              15  no, but I just don't recall that, no.

              16          Q.   Other than the call agreement,

              17  was there any other employment agreement that

              18  you contemplated for Dr. Holland to provide

              19  him work that you did not execute with him?

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   Did you execute any other

              22  agreement with him to provide him work, other

              23  than the call agreement, after March 2017?

              24          A.   I referenced it a little bit

              25  earlier, that cardiovascular management



                                                               338


               1  agreement, where he had the opportunity to

               2  submit administrative hours for time that he

               3  spent helping us pick equipment, train staff,

               4  run meetings, you know, develop order sets,

               5  clinical practice, those types of things.

               6          Q.   Let's mark this as Bertke A.

               7          A.   By the way, I wrote on one of

               8  these, just so you know, so ....

               9             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit A

              10  was marked for identification.)

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Handing you

              12  what's been marked as Bertke A.  Have you seen

              13  this document before?

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   And what is it?

              16          A.   So this is the -- the way we

              17  track for payment the doctors under the

              18  cardiology management.  It's a -- well,

              19  cardiology management compensation tracking

              20  sheet.

              21          Q.   Okay.

              22          A.   So we keep track of the hours

              23  that doctors submit, the dollars that we pay

              24  them, and keep a running total of that.

              25          Q.   Did you pay Dr. Holland any hours



                                                               339


               1  under this exhibit?

               2          A.   Yes.  It's a little bit foggy

               3  here, but it looks like there were payments in

               4  August, September, October, and November.

               5          Q.   And that's in 2017?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Was Dr. Holland ever

               8  removed as the medical director at St. Anne's?

               9          A.   At St. Anne's -- we never really

              10  had a medical director title at St. Anne's, so

              11  no.

              12          Q.   So did any of his titles at

              13  St. Anne's change as a result of his EEOC

              14  charge in 2017 and thereafter?

              15          A.   I -- I believe he was section

              16  chief until the -- the day that he, you know,

              17  resigned.

              18          Q.   Okay.

              19          A.   And then the -- the only other --

              20  the only other role he had, which again, is,

              21  was in the agreement, effective until the end,

              22  was the chair, or the co-chair, of the CVTU

              23  operating committee, something of that nature

              24  in the agreement.

              25          Q.   Did Dr. Holland continue to



                                                               340


               1  receive call assignments after March 17, 2017

               2  meeting between -- between you guys?

               3          A.   I would have to go back and check

               4  the call schedule, but my assumption was he

               5  was on the call schedule at St. Anne's.

               6          Q.   In your experience with

               7  Dr. Holland, was it unusual for him to

               8  criticize other colleagues' work?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   What do you believe were his

              11  strengths as a surgeon?

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

              13  extent it calls for speculation, or that he's

              14  not qualified to offer opinions about

              15  physicians' qual -- surgery abilities.

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Go ahead.

              17          A.   The -- the objection is somewhat

              18  true.  I'm not an expert in cardiothoracic

              19  surgery, but you know, I think his operating

              20  technique, from people that were in the room,

              21  their feedback to me was he's a good surgeon

              22  in the operating room.

              23          Q.   What would you perceive as his

              24  weakness?

              25          A.   Interpersonal relationships,



                                                               341


               1  working with others.

               2          Q.   Anything else?

               3          A.   No.  I mean, that -- it kind of

               4  -- it's a fairly broad concept, but it kind of

               5  bleeds into this, how do you develop a

               6  referral network to make yourself sustainable,

               7  how do you interact with people on the floor,

               8  how do you, you know, how do you interact with

               9  your colleagues, other members of the medical

              10  staff?  I mean, it's a short-term, but it's,

              11  you know, fairly pervasive throughout the

              12  practice of medicine.

              13          Q.   Mark this as Bertke B.

              14             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit B

              15  was marked for identification.)

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Have you seen

              17  this document before?  Especially at the

              18  bottom, from Ameer Kabour, to you on

              19  June 22nd, 2017.  Want to review that?

              20          A.   Yeah.  So he sent this to me?

              21          Q.   That's correct.

              22          A.   Okay.

              23          Q.   It says to Brad Bertke from --

              24  who is --

              25          A.   Wait a minute.  This -- I have a



                                                               342


               1  -- this is all mine says.

               2          Q.   Oh, okay.  You got the -- just

               3  one page of it.  That's the problem.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   Here.

               6          A.   All right.  Okay.

               7          Q.   Who is Ameer Kabour?

               8          A.   Ameer Kabour is the president and

               9  CEO of Toledo Cardiology Consultants.

              10          Q.   And were they the primary

              11  referral sources to Dr. Holland?

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   Total Cardiology Consultants, or

              14  at least to Mercy-St. Vincent?

              15          A.   They were, yes, to St. -- Mercy

              16  overall cardiac program, yes, but to

              17  Dr. Holland, no.

              18          Q.   That's correct.  So what was

              19  going on in this email, what were the issues?

              20          A.   I don't recall the specifics of

              21  the patient, but he's upset with the way the

              22  last two cases at St. -- at St. Anne's were

              23  managed by Dr. Holland.  Then he goes on to

              24  reference some things at St. Vincent's.  I'm

              25  not quite sure what those.



                                                               343


               1          Q.   I'm going to represent to you

               2  that in his deposition, Dr. Holland alleged

               3  that the, toward the end of 2015 to 2016, a

               4  meeting was held between Tom Arquilla,

               5  Dr. Nahhas and you, as part of a campaign to

               6  terminate him.  Did any such meeting occur?

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

               8  and to the extent it misstates Dr. Holland's

               9  testimony.

              10          A.   Was there a meeting at the end of

              11  2015 --

              12          Q.   Yeah.

              13          A.   -- with Dr. Nahhas?

              14          Q.   Or early '16.  With Tom Arquilla,

              15  and Dr. Nahhas?

              16             MR. ARCHINACO:  Same objections.

              17          A.   I remember a meeting with the

              18  Toledo Clinic, Tom, and myself, to just kind

              19  of temperature check on this service

              20  arrangement, and Dr. Holland, and is this

              21  thing working for everybody.

              22          Q.   What precipitated that meeting?

              23          A.   I would put it under some of the

              24  earlier commentary I gave around, you know,

              25  this whole time that Dr. Holland was under,



                                                               344


               1  while he was at St. Anne's, there was kind of

               2  this constant review of his performance.  I

               3  don't remember if there was a specific

               4  incident or not.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Now, did Dr. Holland have

               6  many conversations and meeting with you about

               7  his concerns about discrimination, based on

               8  race or national origin?

               9          A.   We had frequent meetings on

              10  concerns about referrals, but I don't -- I

              11  don't really remember race or ethnic origin

              12  really coming into that discussion.

              13          Q.   If Dr. Holland had testified that

              14  you told him there was nothing you could do

              15  about his complaints of discrimination, would

              16  that be an accurate description of anything

              17  you've ever told him?

              18          A.   No.

              19             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

              20  to the extent it mischaracterizes

              21  Dr. Holland's testimony.

              22          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did you ever

              23  tell him you could not do anything about his

              24  concerns about referrals, because of

              25  Dr. Andrabi?



                                                               345


               1          A.   I didn't really -- I don't think

               2  I would have said that, because I don't really

               3  think Dr. Andrabi was very involved with

               4  referrals for cardiac surgery.

               5          Q.   Did you ever tell him his call

               6  agreement was being pulled because of his EEOC

               7  charge?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   What is your race?

              10          A.   Caucasian.

              11          Q.   What is your national origin?

              12          A.   USA.

              13          Q.   Did Dr. Holland ever once discuss

              14  with you that he felt that he was being

              15  discriminated against, and in terms of

              16  receiving referrals based on his race or

              17  national origin?

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

              19  to the extent it's been asked and answered.

              20          A.   I don't ever remember that coming

              21  up.

              22          Q.   Okay.  I got no further

              23  questions.

              24                    REEXAMINATION

              25  BY MR. ARCHINACO:



                                                               346


               1          Q.   Mr. Bertke, I have some follow-up

               2  for you.

               3          A.   Okay.

               4          Q.   Then we'll get you out of here.

               5  You'll be out of here by 6:30.

               6          A.   Okay.  I appreciate it.

               7          Q.   No problem.  Today you used the

               8  words, in description of the St. Patrick's Day

               9  meeting, you used the words baiting and

              10  setting up, correct?

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   Okay.  And at no point during the

              13  conversation with Dr. Holland that day, did

              14  you ever use the words baiting or setting up

              15  with him, correct?

              16          A.   No.  It would be a retrospective

              17  call, based on the fact I now realize it was

              18  taped, but no, during the call, no.

              19          Q.   Okay.  So well, do you --

              20          A.   Or during the meeting.

              21          Q.   Right.  That's just speculation.

              22  Maybe the reason that he taped the

              23  conversation wasn't to bait or set up, but

              24  instead because he figured that you would just

              25  change your testimony after meeting with



                                                               347


               1  Mr. Wiencek, as other people have done?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.  Go ahead.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Are you -- go

               4  ahead.

               5          A.   No.  What is your -- what is the

               6  question?

               7          Q.   Maybe -- maybe Dr. Holland was

               8  concerned your testimony would change, because

               9  you would meet with Mr. Wiencek, or other

              10  people at Mercy, and you might get threatened

              11  or intimidated into changing your testimony.

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              13          A.   That could be a reason.

              14          Q.   Did you ever hear that Adam

              15  Carruthers believed that he was being

              16  intimidated, when he was -- when counsel was

              17  hired by him, by Mercy, and it was insinuated

              18  to him that depending on how he testified, his

              19  job could be at issue?

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, gross

              21  misrepresentation of the record.

              22          A.   I -- I have no knowledge of Adam

              23  with any legal action.

              24          Q.   All right.  You didn't give any

              25  directions for Adam to be retaliated against,



                                                               348


               1  correct?  You have not done so?

               2          A.   No.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Now, there was a mention

               4  of -- there was a time period mentioned of

               5  March 1st to May 1st, having to do with call

               6  agreement.  And you mentioned the committee

               7  that might need to -- you mentioned a

               8  committee that approves the call agreements.

               9  Do you recall that generally?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And then you would expect

              12  that if there was such a committee meeting to

              13  approve a new call agreement, there would be

              14  documents generated from such a committee,

              15  correct?  Whether they're emails, or a memo,

              16  or anything like that, correct?

              17          A.   Could be.  It's the same

              18  committee that you had the minutes from.  You

              19  had minutes of an exhibit --

              20          Q.   Yes.

              21          A.   -- that is the same committee.

              22          Q.   Got it.  Now, in terms of -- you

              23  pointed out that towards the end of

              24  Dr. Holland's tenure, the frequency or

              25  occurrence of reports of safety, safety or



                                                               349


               1  quality concerns increased, correct?

               2          A.   It seems that way.

               3          Q.   And am I right that Dr. Hashmi

               4  was getting older day by day, correct?

               5          A.   As we all are, yes.

               6          Q.   Okay.  And do you know whether,

               7  for example, in the month of December of 2016,

               8  that five of Dr. Hashmi's patients returned to

               9  the OR, due to complications, including three

              10  of those because of bleeding?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You aware of

              13  that?

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  -- form and

              15  foundation.

              16          A.   I have no knowledge of that.

              17          Q.   And that -- that those type of

              18  complication rates, in a one month, or a

              19  couple of week period, was enough for what

              20  should be the normal complication rates for an

              21  entire year?

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You ever heard

              24  that?

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  -- to form and



                                                               350


               1  foundation.

               2          A.   I'm not aware of any of that, no.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  Now, if you

               4  can turn to Exhibit 32 for a minute, please.

               5          A.   Okay.

               6          Q.   This is -- this is

               7  Mr. Porterfield's email from May 7, 2015 to

               8  Dr. Holland.

               9          A.   This is from Scott to

              10  Dr. Holland, okay.

              11          Q.   Yes.  And if you could just

              12  please review this and then ....

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection for

              14  foundation.

              15          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Now, did you have

              17  generally a good relationship with

              18  Mr. Porterfield overall?

              19          A.   Generally, yes.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Did you have any issues

              21  with his veracity, that you were aware of?

              22          A.   His honesty?

              23          Q.   Yes.

              24          A.   Not that I encountered, no.

              25          Q.   Okay.  And then we had talked



                                                               351


               1  about, I'm going to ask you some more

               2  questions about it in a second, we had talked

               3  about an arrest in or about September of 2014

               4  with Dr. Holland, correct?

               5          A.   We talked about a what?

               6          Q.   An arrest of Dr. Holland -

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   -- in or about September of 2014.

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   Okay.  Now, here, this email is

              11  from May of 2015.  Do you see that?

              12          A.   Okay.

              13          Q.   Okay.  So that's after the

              14  arrest?

              15          A.   All right.

              16          Q.   Okay?

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   Approximately, eight months

              19  later, okay?

              20          A.   Okay.

              21          Q.   And Mr. Porterfield has verified

              22  the contents of this document, and that

              23  Mr. Arquilla did say to Mr. Porterfield that

              24  when Jamie's contract was up, that he would

              25  like to renew it, and that he was very aware



                                                               352


               1  of the political arena that Dr. Holland was

               2  stuck in.

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               4  foundation.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Okay?

               6          A.   I can see the words on the paper.

               7          Q.   So is that inconsistent with what

               8  you're saying, that after this arrest,

               9  everybody was talking about when is, you know,

              10  talking about maybe getting rid of Dr.

              11  Holland?  Here, Mr. Arquilla looks like he's

              12  saying I want to renew the contract?

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              14          A.   If -- if -- if Scott is reporting

              15  correctly, it seems a little inconsistent.

              16          Q.   All right.  I want to come back

              17  to the arrest for a second.  I mean,

              18  definitely after you learned of the arrest,

              19  you felt less favorable towards Dr. Holland,

              20  at least to some degree, correct?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   Now, what did you ever learn

              23  about whether or not the allegations contained

              24  in the -- in the report were discredited, and

              25  that the charges were dropped?



                                                               353


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               2          A.   I believe I know the charges were

               3  dropped.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Were you ever made aware

               5  that the officer who was involved may have

               6  faced discipline over various statements that

               7  were made in the report that were untrue?

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.  A gross

               9  misrepresentation.  That's a fantasy.

              10          A.   I have no knowledge --

              11             MR. ARCHINACO:  I don't know if the

              12  --

              13          A.   I don't --

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- opposing counsel

              15  just had a fantasy or what.

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Lack of foundation.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Go ahead.

              18          A.   I -- I don't -- I don't know of

              19  that, and I don't, you know, so ....

              20          Q.   Okay.  Just coming back to it for

              21  a second.  In terms of the timing of when that

              22  person made the complaint about Dr. Holland,

              23  the criminal, that resulted in the criminal

              24  complaint, when do you recall she interviewed

              25  for a job with Mercy, before or after that



                                                               354


               1  criminal?

               2          A.   Before.

               3          Q.   Before.  Okay.  Now, so according

               4  to what she told you, she interviews for a

               5  position at Mercy.  And she is told that the

               6  position will be with Dr. Holland.  Correct?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   And then after that --

               9          A.   Well, she was told that

              10  Dr. Holland was one of the surgeons at

              11  St. Anne's, not necessarily with him, but --

              12          Q.   And so at that point, she said, I

              13  don't want to work here, instead of --

              14          A.   She said, you know, I've already

              15  -- he's my neighbor.  We've already had a

              16  run-in, this -- that's not going to work.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Now, she said they had a

              18  run-in, and this was prior to the arrest

              19  issue?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Okay.  Did she recall what she

              22  said the so-called run-in was?

              23          A.   It was -- no, I don't know.  I

              24  don't --

              25          Q.   Okay.



                                                               355


               1          A.   -- I didn't interview her, so I

               2  don't remember what it was.

               3          Q.   Fair enough.  Do you -- is there

               4  any reason you would think that the so-called

               5  run-in that was had with Dr. Holland, that she

               6  referenced, was in fact that she complained

               7  about Dr. Holland playing music in his own

               8  house, before she moved into her house, or

               9  even into the neighborhood, that she --

              10          A.   I recall it had -- I do recall it

              11  had something to do with music, but --

              12          Q.   Okay.

              13          A.   -- I think on both occasions.

              14          Q.   Fair enough.  And just to be

              15  clear, in terms of the timing, I want to show

              16  you something from another document.  What is

              17  our next one?  Exhibit 155.

              18             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 155

              19  was marked for identification.)

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Now, first --

              21  well, 155.  Just let me know when you've had a

              22  chance to review it.

              23          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Now, first, in terms of

              25  the -- there, at the bottom, there is a Megan



                                                               356


               1  Manahan who is writing you an email,

               2  September 23rd, 2014, about Mercy-St. Anne and

               3  various potential marketing.

               4          A.   Yeah.  I think it's around

               5  celebrating the first surgery at St. Anne's.

               6          Q.   Got it.  And then you write back,

               7  Might want to co-focus on Holland and Nahhas.

               8  Our focus -- or focus on the whole care team.

               9  I can explain why.

              10             Do you see that?

              11          A.   Yep.

              12          Q.   Okay.  She says, Got it.

              13             Do you recall what your -- what

              14  your explanation was about you want to focus

              15  on the whole team?

              16          A.   Not really.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Now, coming back to the

              18  arrest issue for a second.  That was -- that

              19  arrest happened literally just as you're about

              20  to start marketing Dr. Holland and the

              21  St. Anne program, correct?  Just right

              22  beforehand?

              23          A.   Okay.  The arrest happened on

              24  what date?

              25          Q.   September 1st.



                                                               357


               1          A.   1st, okay.

               2          Q.   2014, Labor Day.  Labor Day.

               3          A.   So early September --

               4          Q.   Okay.

               5          A.   -- sometime.  Okay.

               6          Q.   And did you change any marketing

               7  because of that arrest?

               8          A.   I don't think so.

               9          Q.   Okay.  The -- and so in terms of

              10  the arrest, just -- just to be clear -- oh,

              11  strike that.

              12             Did the woman who -- did the nurse,

              13  who moved in next door to Dr. Holland, did you

              14  ever learn what her husband did for a living?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   And do you recall whether or not

              17  she attempted to apply a second time at Mercy,

              18  yes or no?

              19          A.   I'm not aware of that.

              20          Q.   But that arrest had the

              21  potential, had it gone forward, potential of

              22  derailing what you were building with

              23  St. Anne's cardiothoracic program, if went in

              24  the wrong direction, correct?

              25          A.   It had the potential, yes.



                                                               358


               1          Q.   Okay.  You were handed Bertke

               2  Exhibit A.  I want to go over some other

               3  things.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Bertke Exhibit A was this

               6  little --

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   -- money chart.  I just wanted to

               9  look -- I noted there were some payments made

              10  to Dr. Holland in 2017.  It looks like -- it's

              11  hard to read, because the font is small.  It

              12  looks like less than $3,000; is that right?

              13          A.   Yeah.  It looks like that.

              14          Q.   They could be added up, if we

              15  kind of zoom in on it, but --

              16          A.   Yeah.

              17          Q.   -- it looks like it's actually in

              18  the 2000s, but I said less than 3000, fair

              19  enough?

              20          A.   Fair enough.

              21          Q.   Okay.  And then Bertke Exhibit B,

              22  which had to do with the Ameer Kabour email

              23  from June 22nd, 2017?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   At the top, you talked about



                                                               359


               1  getting Dr. Tita involved in a retrospective

               2  review, correct?

               3          A.   Correct.

               4          Q.   Now, you had never, at least from

               5  what I have seen, you had never received any

               6  type of email like this from Dr. Kabour prior

               7  to June of 2017, correct?

               8          A.   I would say correct.

               9          Q.   So then this was at a time period

              10  after Dr. Holland had already filed the claim

              11  of discrimination, correct?

              12          A.   So he filed the claim in -- yes.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And so --

              14          A.   This is after --

              15          Q.   Right.

              16          A.   -- the complaint, yes.

              17          Q.   And you knew that -- you knew

              18  from your, you knew personally from your March

              19  meeting, that at least from what he told you

              20  in that meeting, he was making claims of

              21  discrimination and referrals, correct?  At

              22  least from that meeting itself?

              23          A.   I -- if I remember correctly from

              24  the transcription of that event, yes.

              25          Q.   Now, just to be clear, you're --



                                                               360


               1  are you aware that Dr. Holland has never made

               2  any claim of racial or national origin

               3  discrimination against any of the doctors at

               4  the Toledo Clinic?  You're aware he's never

               5  accused them of any of that, correct?

               6          A.   I'm not aware of it.

               7          Q.   Okay.

               8          A.   But you're telling me it, so

               9  okay.

              10          Q.   Fair enough.  In terms of the

              11  referrals, how the office procedures worked at

              12  Dr. Holland's practice with Dr. Hashmi, and

              13  whoever else was in the practice at various

              14  times, you're not familiar with how the office

              15  procedures worked with how the referrals were

              16  supposed to occur, were you?

              17          A.   No.  That was a separate, kind of

              18  separate division.

              19          Q.   Other than -- and I say this

              20  other than conversations with Dr. Holland,

              21  where he would complain about referrals, other

              22  than what we've already talked about?

              23          A.   I have no knowledge of the --

              24          Q.   Okay.

              25          A.   -- process within their office.



                                                               361


               1          Q.   In terms of the type of cases

               2  that Dr. Holland performed at St. Anne's,

               3  you're aware that lots of cases were kept,

               4  that records were kept of the type of cases

               5  that were performed, correct?

               6          A.   Logs?

               7          Q.   Yes.

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   And you're aware that there were

              10  high-risk procedures performed at St. Anne's

              11  by Dr. Holland; isn't that right?

              12          A.   High risk is generic, but as time

              13  went on, we did higher-risk cases there, yes.

              14          Q.   But you would defer to whatever

              15  those log of cases would show for the years

              16  that were there in terms of the types of

              17  cases?

              18          A.   Yeah.  Again, the logs would

              19  probably indicate the type of surgery, meaning

              20  was it a three vessel, was it a valve, was it

              21  a valve/vessel combo, but I don't think it

              22  would -- I don't think it would necessarily

              23  say if the patient had other comorbidity,

              24  comorbidities, and what that might mean in

              25  terms of risk of, you know, readmission, or



                                                               362


               1  back to surgery or mortality, so it's -- it's

               2  not a complete picture, but there is a log.

               3          Q.   Dr. Hashmi performed some

               4  surgeries at St. Anne's as well, correct?

               5          A.   Very few, but yes.

               6          Q.   Dr. Phillips did as well; is that

               7  right?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Okay.

              10          A.   Still does.

              11          Q.   And do you know whether or not

              12  Dr. Hashmi had any deaths while he operated at

              13  St. Anne's?  And if you don't know, don't

              14  speculate or guess.

              15          A.   I'm not 100 percent sure.

              16          Q.   Almost done.

              17             In terms of criticism of doctors,

              18  you indicated Dr. Holland criticized doctors

              19  generally.  Am I correct that most of his

              20  criticism focused on Dr. Hashmi?

              21          A.   Yeah, most of it, but you can

              22  kind of -- this email from Kabour is kind of

              23  the -- he keeps insisting he knows more than

              24  the pulmonary and the radiologist, so that was

              25  kind of consistent.



                                                               363


               1          Q.   He had never --

               2          A.   But, to his defense, it's his

               3  patient, he's responsible for it, he's

               4  ultimately accountable, so ....

               5          Q.   But, by that point in time in

               6  June, there has already been a discrimination

               7  claim that basically says there is

               8  discrimination in referrals that is happening

               9  here, at least that's what Dr. Holland has

              10  asserted, so now Dr. Kabour is writing that in

              11  a time period after the discrimination claim

              12  has been made, correct?

              13          A.   That's the timing of it.

              14          Q.   Okay.  But you had not received a

              15  written email like that from Dr. Kabour --

              16          A.   Not that I recall, no.

              17          Q.   -- prior to that date?

              18          A.   Not that I recall, no.

              19          Q.   Okay.  And then couple of things

              20  back to the transcript, which is Exhibit 151.

              21  I had a couple more questions about it.

              22          A.   Okay.

              23          Q.   And I think we'll be done.  It's

              24  6:11.

              25          A.   You're doing good.  You're --



                                                               364


               1          Q.   I'm trying my best.

               2          A.   You keep saying you're done, but

               3  ....

               4          Q.   Well, you know when an attorney

               5  says that, it's just --

               6          A.   Yeah.

               7          Q.   -- like dog years, you know, a 7

               8  to 1 ratio, or something like that.  That's

               9  what you can think about with attorneys.

              10          A.   Okay.  We're on the transcript --

              11          Q.   Yes, please.

              12          A.   -- 151?

              13          Q.   Just want to turn to page 10/11.

              14  The part -- the part where it was indicated,

              15  where you said that's not what I said about so

              16  that agreement is off.

              17          A.   Right.

              18          Q.   Dr. Holland says, oh, okay.

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   Then to the next page it says,

              21  then the bottom on line 25 of page 10, New

              22  Speaker:  This is getting -- I think -- yeah,

              23  for certain the medical director thing is

              24  going to be kind of hard to push through from

              25  Mercy's perspective with what is going on.



                                                               365


               1             But, you know, and then the call,

               2  which is another item.  But I didn't really

               3  say that.  I'm just -- I'm just kind of

               4  alerting you to some things I wasn't aware of

               5  and then saying, well, what's the implication

               6  for this?

               7             Did I read that part correctly?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And then in terms of where

              10  you're referencing the medical director thing,

              11  what were you referring to that was going to

              12  be kind of hard to push through from Mercy's

              13  perspective?

              14          A.   Yeah.  I think, in -- in the end,

              15  he ended up with what I would describe as a

              16  medical directorship in the consulting

              17  agreement.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Then finally, I asked you

              19  some questions today about, you know, if

              20  Dr. Holland reapplied for a job, or things of

              21  that nature.  Do you recall those generally?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   And I want to ask you similar

              24  questions.  There is a legal term called

              25  reinstatement, which is something that could



                                                               366


               1  potentially happen.  A Court could potentially

               2  reinstate Dr. Holland.

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Wiencek

               5  does not agree that that type of remedy is

               6  available here.  But just to be clear, that is

               7  something that has been requested.

               8             If Dr. Holland was reinstated,

               9  leave aside whether he was selected by a

              10  voluntary process of applying for a job, the

              11  Court reinstated him, do you believe that you

              12  would be able to work with him, if he came

              13  back and was reinstated?

              14          A.   Well, I worked with him for two

              15  or three years, so I think we could manage

              16  again.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And just to be clear,

              18  there is nothing I have done, at least during

              19  the course of today, that would cause you to

              20  not want to work with Dr. Holland again, or --

              21  or be open to that?

              22          A.   Anything that you have done?

              23          Q.   That I have done, correct, as his

              24  counsel.

              25          A.   Not that --



                                                               367


               1          Q.   Okay.

               2          A.   --  not that immediately comes to

               3  mind, no.

               4          Q.   Fair enough.  I appreciate your

               5  time today.

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  I have one question.

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  That's what I have.

               8                   RE-REEXAMINATION

               9  BY MR. WIENCEK:

              10          Q.   Bertke B.  At the time Ameer

              11  Kabour wrote this on June 22nd, 2017, do you

              12  have any personal knowledge that he was aware

              13  that there had been an EEOC claim filed

              14  against Mercy?

              15          A.   I don't know if he knew anything

              16  of that nature, no.

              17          Q.   Okay.  No further questions.

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  You're not -- any

              19  follow-up?

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  That's it.  Thank

              21  you.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  We'll read, and I'll

              23  take a copy.

               1             CERTIFICATE OF THE REPORTER

               2             I, Angela A. O'Neill, a Registered

               4  certify that the above-named witness was by me,

               6  sworn to testify the truth, the whole truth, and

               7  nothing but the truth to questions propounded at

               8  the taking of the foregoing deposition in a cause

              10             I further certify that the deposition

              11  above-set forth was reduced to writing by me by

              12  means of machine shorthand and was later

              14  this is a true record of the testimony given by

              15  the witness; and that said deposition was taken at

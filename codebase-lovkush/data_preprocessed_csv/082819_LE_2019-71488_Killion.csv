We did a little runaround to find out what we were up against and how they wanted it handled. I suggested we cut the valve out and do away with it.  It was unable to be used anyways from being hit and the fact that it was probably never used in the last 100 years.  At that point, we got permission to cut it out. Jim bought the stock.  We had it delivered. And then the fire department said, ""You're not fixing that water main until that building comes down."" We said we don't want to take the building down at that present time.

797,1811,71,9,"Sometimes a spotter can get in trouble too.  When we're digging in something like that, it's not too smart to have a spotter. God forbid you move a timber, and the ground ten feet over, a hole opens up, a spotter would be at the bottom of the hole.  It wouldn't be good -- too good a clear practice to do that.

It's just that the tunnels were -- what they were built -- how they were built and a structural plan was not available.

Because I didn't want to talk to no workers.  But prior to meeting Mr. Daley, I did meet a foreman there or somebody that couldn't say anything.  And I told him, ""Look it.  I just want your boss.

And when you talk about having this meeting with Mr. Daley -- or Dealy, whichever it is -- from the water department, and talking to the foreman before him, and going through the Dig Safe process, what I'm trying to understand is did you understand from the water department that there were no water lines in this area, or that they didn't have any maps of the area so that they didn't know?",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
967,2270,88,9,"From my own experience, I knew there was no water lines in my dig area because they would have went through the building.  The water main was out the other side of the building.  It's encased in concrete.  There's a part of it sticking out.  It's very visible. I walked with Dan Kadlic right to that area.  That's where it came in and out.  That's what Dan told me.  I walked the whole foundation with him.  Me and him were pretty sure that there wasn't a water main out there. Dan was confident for me to dig.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
968,2282,88,21,Dan said he was confident for you to dig?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
969,2284,88,23,Dan was confident that there was no utilities in that area also.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
970,2289,89,1,"Okay.  Again, I'm not talking about Dan.  I'm trying to draw the distinction --",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
971,2291,89,3,"No, I understand that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
972,2292,89,4,"I'm trying to draw a distinction related to the -- well, let me ask a different question.",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
973,2295,89,7,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
974,2296,89,8,You've dealt with cities and towns --,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
975,2297,89,9,Yep.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
976,2298,89,10,-- in Massachusetts and in New Hampshire; right?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
977,2300,89,12,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
978,2301,89,13,"And generally speaking, they have plans of where their --",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
979,2303,89,15,Every town.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
980,2304,89,16,-- water lines are?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
981,2305,89,17,"You get as-builts, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
982,2306,89,18,"And things don't always correspond exactly to those plans, do they?",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
983,2308,89,20,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
984,2309,89,21,"But when you go to a Town and ask for the maps, or ask for where their water lines are, they have a map of --",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
985,2312,89,24,"It's called an ""as-built.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
986,2316,90,1,They have the as-built plans of everything in town?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
987,2318,90,3,"Well, for the most part.  When you start getting around 1920s and down, it gets tough.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
988,2321,90,6,They don't always have the plans for 1920 and before?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
989,2323,90,8,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
990,2324,90,9,"The as-builts? What I want to know is did the City not have any plan for the area along Canal Street, not have any as-builts for the area along Canal Street?",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
991,2329,90,14,"After we hit the water main, a young engineer showed up with plan.  It showed the water main very clearly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
992,2332,90,17,So was it prior to hitting the thing?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
993,2333,90,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
994,2334,90,19,It was your understanding that they just didn't have any maps for that area?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
995,2336,90,21,Correct.  They didn't have any maps until --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
996,2338,90,23,Until after?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
997,2339,90,24,Yeah.  And a young guy found it in the archives after about ten hours of research.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
998,2344,91,2,"You had the opportunity to -- well, you were involved in repairing the water line after the fact; right?",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
999,2347,91,5,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1000,2348,91,6,So what was broken on the water line that was causing water to leak?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1001,2350,91,8,"Right at the valve, there was a chunk missing out of it.  And my suspicion is what happened when I caught that cog on the top, it pulled the valve back a little bit, and one of the bolts leaned down on the pipe or pulled up on a pipe and broke the pipe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1002,2356,91,14,You saw the break in the pipe?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1003,2357,91,15,"Yeah, there was a hole in the pipe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1004,2358,91,16,How big was it?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1005,2359,91,17,"Oh, boy.  Four or five inches round, I'm thinking.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1006,2361,91,19,"And when you got to see that section of pipe, by then, the water had been turned off; right?",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1007,2364,91,22,"Oh, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1008,2365,91,23,Was that a process that took a while?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1009,2366,91,24,"Yeah.  It took them about, hypothetically, between six to ten hours to get the water off, and then -- yeah, about six to ten hours to get the water off.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1010,2373,92,4,So was it the next day when you were back there repairing the pipe?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1011,2375,92,6,"I don't believe so.  No, it wasn't the next day because the building had to come down. I think it took a couple days to make arrangements for Bogie to come up and take the building down, and then I think we fixed it after that.  But I just don't remember.  I really don't.  I didn't know I was going to be sitting here or I would have written it down.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1012,2383,92,14,Was there a police and fire detail at the place?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1013,2385,92,16,"I don't remember, but I'm sure there was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1014,2387,92,18,Okay.  Who paid for that?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1015,2388,92,19,Mr. Coskren.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1016,2389,92,20,Okay.  Did you get paid for the work that you did at 400 Canal Street?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1017,2391,92,22,Absolutely.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1018,2392,92,23,Mr. Coskren doesn't owe you any money for that work?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1019,2397,93,1,"Oh, no.  Jimmy's the best.  Pays me every day.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1020,2399,93,3,You've continued to do work for him since then?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1021,2401,93,5,Absolutely.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1022,2402,93,6,And he's always paid you for that work?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1023,2404,93,8,"I do work for C.I.L., not Jimmy directly, but Jimmy's the owner.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1024,2406,93,10,Right.,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1025,2407,93,11,And I'm sure he okays everything.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1026,2408,93,12,Right.  Did you charge him for taking down that portion of the building that had to come down before the pipe could be fixed?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1027,2411,93,15,"I think when I got my friend Bogie involved, there was a small fee with it.  I don't know what Mr. Coskren worked out.  If I was involved, I just don't remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1028,2415,93,19,You don't know one way or the other whether you charged him for that?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1029,2417,93,21,"Personally, I don't know what we worked out.  I just don't remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1030,2419,93,23,"Yep.  At the time you started digging in May or June of 2015, you believed that you knew where the -- you believe that you had enough information about where water lines were under the ground in the work area to go ahead and work?",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1031,2428,94,5,"When I started digging there, I believed the only thing in that ground was them trestles.  Other than that, I didn't think there was anything else in the ground there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1032,2432,94,9,The trestles being the tunnels?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1033,2433,94,10,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1034,2434,94,11,And that's because you had had -- you'd called Dig Safe.  You'd gone through that whole process with respect to gas and electric and all that?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1035,2438,94,15,I went through every process.  It took a couple of weeks.  It wasn't like we just rolled the dice.  We did all our homework there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1036,2442,94,19,"But specifically with respect to water lines, based on what you understood from the water department from Mr. Daley -- or Dealy, whatever it is -- you thought there were no water line in that area?",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1037,2447,94,24,"Correct.  I knew about the hydrant.  I knew about the six-inch main running down the road, well outside our dig area.  Other than that, I was under the impression there was nothing but the trestles.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1038,2455,95,5,"Have you -- in your 17 or so -- 17 to 19 years of work doing excavating, have you come across buried water lines before that you didn't know were going to be there?",q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1039,2459,95,9,No.  Everything's well marked today. We don't -- them problems don't exist.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1040,2461,95,11,Have you ever encountered anything subsurface that you didn't expect to be there?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1041,2463,95,13,Sometimes irrigation lines. Landscapers don't have a law.  Let's say it that way.  Or they don't play by the rules. It's not too many lines that we -- that ain't marked that we don't know about.  There's no lines that we don't know about.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1042,2469,95,19,You ever damaged any utility lines before?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer

1044,2472,95,22,What have you hit?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer
1045,2473,95,23,I never hit anything.  A rock will fall in a hole and hit it.  One time I had a street plate fall in the hole.  Car jumped on the brakes.  Hit it.  Stuff like that.  Never hit it with a bucket.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1046,2481,96,4,The equipment's never contacted anything before?,q,MR. MCCARTHY,start_answer

1061,2514,97,10,"We caught the cog on the surface.  It jammed the pipe.  Cast iron or ductile iron is very weak.  It's more like glass.  It's fragile.  It shatters.  I think we put a crack in it at the time.  And then as time progressed, the crack let go, and that's how you got your water leak.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

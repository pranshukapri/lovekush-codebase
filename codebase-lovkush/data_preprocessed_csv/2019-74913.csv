I told Nick, I don't have any money.  I haven't got any more money to loan you.  I stayed in there.  He kept saying he needed a loan. Mark Royce was insisting, Perry, it's a very good deal.  You won't get hurt, and I would do the deal.  And I still didn't want to do the deal. But I was in there about an hour. And Nick had tears in his eyes.  Mark Boyce was there.

That one I felt very nervous about.  But I knew I had been in for quite a bit of money.  I went up to his place in Littlefield [sic], New Hampshire, or whatever. I saw the place. It looked like a terrific business. Nick wasn't going to just take his money and throw it away.  He said he had a gentleman that knew the restaurant business very well.  And then when Nick wasn't paying me at the time -- because I gave him -- before I had gone to the hospital because I wasn't feeling well, they told me to get my account out of the Santander Bank. There was a man that was the manager six months in North Andover -- I don't know what his name is or whatever -- but the man in North Andover, I talked to him on the phone.  I don't know what it was about.  But meanwhile, after I talked to him on the phone, he told me he wanted me to get all my money out of the Santander Bank. I was happy with the Santander Bank. I had been there for years.  Out of the blue sky, the gentleman told me, Get every penny out of here in three days or five days or whatever. So then I went to Bank of America, which I had done business with many years ago.  But I was very happy with Santander Bank.  I had no intentions of leaving there, nothing.  Even with Kakouris at the time.  Paul knew nothing about it. And Mark and I were pretty -- we got friendly.  I'd see Mark every day.  I'd go up and say, Hi, Mark.  How are you.  Have a cup of coffee. And I used to tell him to look at my account.  Am I all right, this and that and everything.  And he'd say, You're all right there, you're fine.  I was always worried about going broke because I had nothing when I started. So even to this day, I still think about going broke.  It scares the hell out of me.  I'm 73 years old.  I'm not a young man.  What am I going to do now at 73 years old?  So it just -- I started with nothing, I had nothing.  When I started saving my money, I never took no trips, never did nothing.

Meanwhile, he was paying Santander Bank at the time, he was giving them money every week. And I wasn't feeling -- I was not feeling too well at the time.  And I gave Nick Kakouris my checking account number and I told him, go to Bank of America every week, the way you went to Santander Bank every week, and put the money in Santander Bank. Meanwhile, I used to call Santander Bank up, ask if Nick put the money in there and they'd tell me he did.  When I gave him my checking account number, I was having awful anxieties.  I wasn't feeling well.  And meanwhile, I think he made -- I think I had gone to the hospital or something, I think he had made five payments at the Bank of America.  I think he made five payments there. So then I confronted him, I called him and said, Nick, you haven't been paying me.  What's going on?  You know, put the money in the bank like you're supposed to.  And he told me how he ran into a lot of trouble, owed money, couldn't pay me. I didn't force it.  I told you, I liked the guy, this and that.  We were friends.  He told me he was in a lot of trouble. Meanwhile I didn't know -- I thought, when I gave him the money, I was the only one that gave him money.  I never thought anybody else ever gave him any money.  That's why I gave him the money.  I could afford to give it to him.  He was a nice guy, but I never knew that he had a lot of money borrowed everywhere. And all the money supposedly, he told me -- I believe him -- that this guy that was going to run the place up there for him, which I put all the money in, was a dope addict, he was shooting heroin in his arm, cocaine, everything.  He went to his family, went to them for his money.  Nobody helped him, nobody gave him back.  And the man, like I said, he's broke, he doesn't have any money.  He doesn't have a dime.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

8,122,5,3,"This is just my opportunity to ask you questions regarding this accident.  There's just a few things to remember about a deposition that are different than the course of a normal conversation. Oftentimes in normal conversations we tend to answer questions by making hand gestures or nodding our head or saying mm-hmm.  In a deposition we have a court reporter, so everything you say has to be audible so she can record it.",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer

10,132,5,13,"Also, during the course of normal conversation sometimes we tend to anticipate the end of a question and we start to answer before the other person is finished.  Once again, because we have a court reporter, she has to record everything we say, so we both can't be speaking at once.  So just try to wait until I'm finished before you answer the question.",q,MS.

447,991,39,22,"I don't like to get cut or anything like that.  But at one point I thought that that was a possibility, that they were, like, torn ligaments or something like that.

481,1052,42,8,"I probably saw him at least, like, two times.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
482,1054,42,10,"And you probably started seeing him in 2017, correct, because prior to that you were seeing Dr. Sheehan?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
483,1057,42,13,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
484,1058,42,14,"So just to summarize, you don't have any future appointments scheduled with him or it's not something you regularly do, just when the pain intensifies --",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer

491,1068,42,24,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

493,1074,43,5,"The pain in the back here right now, I would say it's a -- it's ongoing, so you become numb to it.  It's an eight.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
494,1077,43,8,What about your head?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
495,1078,43,9,"The head is -- It's the same situation with my head.  It's just like -- when I get into like a, it's like a stressor.  If I'm under stress, I start to get a throb in the back of my head that I didn't get before the accident.  So, any time that I can have anything that, I guess, makes me stressful or puts unusual stress on me, then I feel like this throb in the back of the neck and head area.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
496,1086,43,17,And how would you characterize that pain on a zero-to-ten pain scale?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
497,1088,43,19,"When it happens, it's an eight.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
498,1089,43,20,"And it happens when you're stressed, so not just sitting here today?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
499,1091,43,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
500,1092,43,23,"With your back, when you said it was an eight, does that also occur when you get stressed or is that a constant eight?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
501,1096,44,2,"When I try to do something like outside of my normal range of motion, I would say, or like how I used to be able to do things.  If I'm trying to move something, then I have to, like, get my body ready to do it.  Because I think I'm a fit person, so when I'm ready to move something, I got to think -- like you got to think twice, Hey, can I really move this right now, or do I have to get my wife to help me or a friend to help me move something that I would normally be able to move, because I don't want to get this sharp pain. And if I get this sharp pain, then that feels like all my muscles tighten up around my back and my head.  And then, it's like, okay, then I'm under stress, and then all of those things are just like a -- just like a stew, you know, like you just add an ingredient, add an ingredient, and then it will just all blow up.  Then I go to the chiropractor.  Then it releases that stress, you know, until the next situation happens.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
502,1116,44,22,"So I think basically maybe to summarize what you said, when you are doing something out of your normal routine, such as lifting something up or doing something that requires heavy lifting, that's what aggravates the pain?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
503,1122,45,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
504,1123,45,4,"Just sitting here doing your normal everyday activities, do you feel pain in your back?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer

507,1127,45,8,No.  No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

509,1131,45,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
510,1132,45,13,Have you thought about seeking any other treatment for your head or your back pain?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
511,1134,45,15,"I have.  I constantly think about it because any time that -- any time that I have any stress, I'm like, Oh, man, this is going to make me require a $50 payment back to the chiropractor again.  It's an annoyance is what it is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
512,1139,45,20,"Have you taken any more steps, other than thinking about it?  Have you looked into it at all?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
513,1141,45,22,"Yeah.  I know that that's the only relief that I get is when I go to the chiropractor.  So I could either continuously pay for the chiropractor and go like once a month or whatever it may be, but like I said before, I just go when it intensifies. So I try to keep myself from dealing with high stress situations, definitely for the back of my head, and I try to stay away from any heavy lifting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
514,1150,46,6,"Okay.  Outside of seeing a chiropractor, have you ever thought about seeing another doctor and having other tests run regarding your head or your back?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
515,1154,46,10,"I haven't -- I haven't sought out any additional help, because I saw like three or four people and they all said the same thing, so it's like throwing the towel in, just like giving up and knowing I'm just going to have to deal with this.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
516,1159,46,15,"When you said you saw three or four people, were those the people we have already spoken about?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer

532,1188,47,19,Why did you see him?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
533,1189,47,20,"Because I believe that when I went to Sheehan, he said, Hey, you need to see this other doctor maybe to get some relief.  Go see this guy and let him do some testing on you that he couldn't do at his facility.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
534,1195,48,1,Do you remember what those tests said?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer

546,1213,48,19,And why not?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
547,1214,48,20,Because I don't like to get poked with anything.  I can't even get my blood drawn without freaking out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

597,1321,53,2,"I mean, it's the back of my head, so it's not like the top part.  It's just like the lower part.  So, you know, at some point your head becomes your neck, so it's that whole section right there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
598,1325,53,6,"So any time that you were mentioning you had pain in your head, you meant the pain in your neck/head area?  Is that correct to say?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer

611,1355,54,11,When was that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

617,1364,54,20,"She -- Let me see.  Oh.  She was driving; I was on the passenger side.  We were off of an exit on Route 30 and a tractor trailer backed into the front of us.  Like he had pulled too far into the intersection and then he started to reverse, and we were, like, stuck in the middle.  And then he, like, ran into the front of the car.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
618,1372,55,3,And were you injured in that accident?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
619,1373,55,4,"I didn't seek any, like, extra therapy, but the insurance company recommended that I should go see somebody if I felt any more worse -- like if I felt any additional pain.  I went in and then I felt like I was -- I felt like I was okay.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
620,1378,55,9,I think it mentions in the note that the emergency room recommended that you see your primary care physician in two to three days. Did you ever end up doing that?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
621,1382,55,13,I'm not sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

627,1392,55,23,What's your question again?  Sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
628,1393,55,24,"What could you do prior to this accident that you can no longer do because of the injuries sustained in this accident?  So, basically how this accident affected your life.",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
629,1398,56,4,"So the way this accident has affected my life is that it's frustrating that I can't focus as well as I used to be able to focus.  I felt like a lot of things were more sharp.  I feel like where -- I even feel like sometimes my rate of speech used to be a lot faster and now it's slower.  I feel like I can't formulate my sentences regularly, like I can't get across what I'm thinking in my head.  It makes me like almost, like, I don't know.  It's just all jumbled up. So that, and then like if I tried to just go move some furniture around, I have to think twice.  And then if I go ahead and do it, then sometimes I can get a sharp pain and then I have to stop, you know, stop doing that and just wait or get some help.  But it's just a continuous situation that I have to think before I do everything that I do now.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
630,1416,56,22,Anything else?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
631,1417,56,23,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
632,1418,56,24,"Regarding when you said that it was frustrating with your rate of speech and stuff to that effect, have you ever thought about seeking out a doctor to get some tests done regarding your head to see why that's happening?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
633,1424,57,5,"Well, I just thought that -- I just thought it was a new way of life.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
634,1426,57,7,Is there anything that you can't do now because of this accident?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
635,1428,57,9,That I can't do?  I just can't move like I used to be able to move.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
636,1430,57,11,But nothing specific?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
637,1431,57,12,"I haven't tried to test myself to a higher degree to see where my actual limitations are.  I can just visually look and say, Oh, this dresser, or this desk, or this TV, like I may not want to do that because I know that it's going to -- it's almost like if I move heavier objects, something around like 40 pounds, 50 pounds, that I feel like my back, like, collapses and pinches on a nerve and just shoots a straight pain to my head. And it's just like, Put that down.  And it's like, Okay, let me put it down.  And then sometimes I can pick it up and then I'm just, like, careful, like, trying to keep myself, my posture straight so that I don't pinch anything.  I just try to move straight without flexing or turning to the left or to the right too much to cause like -- to get an inflammation or something like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
638,1449,58,5,Do you have to move heavy things often?,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer

641,1453,58,9,Yeah.  Just stuff around the house.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
642,1454,58,10,"And outside of having to move stuff around the house, does anything else you do cause this pain?",q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
643,1457,58,13,"Like sometimes when I'm -- even if I'm mopping or something like that, and I try and, like, twist to mop, you know, something simple like that can just trigger it also.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
644,1461,58,17,Anything else?  I'm just trying to get a list of all the triggers that would cause the pain.,q,MS. EAGER,start_answer
645,1463,58,19,"Yeah, yeah.  Triggers are like moving objects.  Triggers are like walking for like a real extended period of time. Yeah, just, you know, like walking sometimes just makes my back hurt after a while. Moving objects, walking.  What else? Going up the steps is critical, because I -- especially when you're trying to go up the steps and you're standing there, like, stretch your leg out, stretch your back out, and then I go up the steps. It's just more I try to take the elevator.  I'm always looking for the elevator versus the steps where I used to be able to take the steps without a problem, where I used to enjoy taking the steps.  Now it's like, Do you want to really do that?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

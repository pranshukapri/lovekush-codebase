The plaintiff's attorney is under no obligation to ask all my questions. Certainly, I'm not going to ask my questions that I would ask at trial. As of right now I don't intend, for example, to go through catalogs or brochures, similar that I did with Jack Seidman.  I reserve, obviously, the right to do so based on certain questioning that might be asked by certain defendants, but since there's a product ID deadline of the 27th, I believe, I will certainly ask certain questions of companies that I'm aware of that I believe need to be brought out. But again, this is a defense questioning, so some of the defendants who are here who's had the opportunity to ask if this witness was familiar with their company's products, they have not done so yet, so I will ask questions.",side_chat,MR.

71,672,186,24,"Yes, I do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

96,717,188,19,"That caught my eye, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,718,188,20,"Okay.  Now, the reason I say that is that since you're talking about 44 years of working with ovens and all the other things, slicers and meat grinders, and all the other pieces of equipment that you went over, no one showed you a catalog of their products, did they?",q,MR. DEATON,start_answer

112,752,190,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

116,759,190,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,760,190,12,"Okay.  So if, for example, if we're going back that many years, you heard the name of the company, might that refresh your memory of whether or not Seidman Brothers worked with it?",q,MR. DEATON,start_answer
118,765,190,17,"It may refresh it, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,766,190,18,"Okay.  And so also, I believe, and the defense has received this information, but at the site inspection, I believe when you walk in Seidman Brothers, there's a desk behind the counter there, right?",q,MR. DEATON,start_answer
120,771,190,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

661,1769,230,21,"They would put it out in the warehouse until it was time to go.  We only made the hoods and the ductwork only if we had the job. We wouldn't make any other hoods. Like, say, if we got a sketch that said a 10-foot hood, we would make a 10-foot hood.  We would make the pipe for it and make the collar for it, and Allen would go up and install it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

665,1786,231,13,"Yeah, it would be a spec job.  Allen would go out.  And like I say, if a restaurant was opening, they didn't have no equipment in it.  They would buy the equipment, plus they would buy the ventilation hood that went over it, and then Allen would measure for how high the ceiling was to the roof, we'd make the pipe to go to the roof collar, and then we'd install a fan on top of it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
666,1795,231,22,"Got you.  Now, did Sonny go out and do all those measurements and stuff like that?",q,MR. DEATON,start_answer

673,1805,232,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

679,1817,232,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
680,1818,232,20,Okay.  And then you would --,q,MR. DEATON,start_answer

I represent the Plaintiff in a case that he brought against you for injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident on December 30th, 2016 on Route 309 around Quakertown.

5,85,5,5,"All right.  There's several rules I want you to follow during the course of your deposition.  I don't anticipate we'll be here long. First of all, obviously, tell the truth.  Number two, this is done on a question and answer basis, so I ask a question, you give an answer.  I ask a question, you give an answer.  Try and wait for me to finish my question before you answer, and I will try and wait for you to finish your answer before I ask another question.  In other words, the court reporter can't take down both of us talking at the same time. If you do not understand a question, please ask me to rephrase it, and I'll be happy to do that.  If you answer a question, I will assume that you understood the question.  If a question calls for a yes or no answer, say ""yes"" or say ""no."" Don't shake or nod your head.

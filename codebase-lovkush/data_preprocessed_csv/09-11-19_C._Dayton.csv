ZALKA,start_answer
21,285,9,16,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
22,286,9,17,"Okay.  So let's just talk a little bit first about, can you describe your professional background.",q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer
23,288,9,19,"Yes.  I'm a principal compliance engineer.  I work for Fujitsu.  It's a Japanese company.  Been there for 22 years.  I handle all the regulatory compliance work for market strategy, market -- or of deployment into different regions of the world for our particular project. And I'm an expert in regulatory compliance testing, which I've been doing for 37 years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

25,297,10,2,Principal compliance engineer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
26,298,10,3,And what -- what actually does that mean?  Like what is principal compliance engineer?,q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer
27,300,10,5,"Okay.  So let's say you design this -- we design this computer, so various countries have regulatory -- they have regulations, that you have to meet certain criteria, such as electromagnetic interference, product safety.  For their tier one customers here in the U.S., for central offices, such as Verizon, AT&T, CenturyLink, they require approval to the NEBS standard -- and NEB -- N-E-B-S standard -- and that particular standard, it costs about $100,000 to run all of the tests for that.  And it's everything from ESE to electrical magnetic compatibility, product safety, bonding, grounding, earthquake testing, fire testing, operational temperature and humidity testing, transportation vibration testing.  Like if you put the box in -- you know, you're shipping a box, you want to get it there without it being damaged.  Storage temperature testing.  It goes on and on. Hygroscopic dust, airborne contaminants.  So that's the testing that we do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

32,325,11,4,Okay.  How many people do you have reporting to you?,q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer
33,327,11,6,"So I am no longer a manager.  I used to be a senior manager for 17 years at Fujitsu.  And three years ago -- that was in Pearl River, New York.  And Fujitsu came in and closed down the R&D facility, laid over 100 people off, gave five people the opportunity to relocate to Richardson area.  I was one of the five people.  I didn't want to be 58 years old looking for another job, so I decided to relocate and I bought a house here, and I settled in. So I was the senior manager then, but the fact that they laid off my entire team, I had nobody to manage anymore, so I became an individual contributor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,339,11,18,"Got it.  And prior to your time with ju- -- jujitsu -- Fujitsu, where did you work?",q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer
35,341,11,20,"I worked at a company called EIS, and I did the same thing, regulatory compliance.  There I was a senior compliance engineer.  Then prior to that, I worked at another company, Micrognosis, M-I-C-R-O-G-N-O-S-I-S, and I was a senior compliance engineer there. I've pretty much been a compliance engineer from the beginning.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
36,349,12,2,Okay.  Have you ever worked in any way in the financial services industry?,q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer
37,351,12,4,"Only for Micrognosis, but it wasn't financial services.  They developed and built computerized trading systems.  So we would -- you know, we had many of the big accounts, the JPMorgans, and Prudential base, many accounts in Europe, Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo. So -- and that was just a trading system to -- you know, the price of stocks, bonds, money markets, futures.  But I was in the engineering end of it, not the -- the procurement or managing stocks, bonds, money markets.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
38,361,12,14,"So outside of kind of the engineer -- being responsible for some of the aspects of the engineering that related to a system that was being used by financial services companies, in your professional career, you haven't had any direct experience in financial services?",q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer
39,366,12,19,No.  Not -- just installing the equipment.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
40,367,12,20,Got it.,q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer

47,378,13,5,I'm a member of the IEEE.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
48,379,13,6,"For those of us that aren't in the engineering space, what does that stand for?",q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer
49,381,13,8,"It's Electrical Engineering Association -- yeah. It's I-E-E-E.  So -- and I'm in the electromagnetic compatibility section.  They have different sections under the IEEE, and I'm under the electromagnetic compatibility, which has to do with area of my line of work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
50,386,13,13,Okay.  Any other professional organizations?,q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer
51,387,13,14,"Well, I mean, I'm on various committees.  One is ATIS, A-T-I-S, and that is where we develop industry standards for telecommunications and communications equipment, as well as a tel- -- I'm on telcordia committees, which develop standards for the NEBS. N-E-B-S, that's the testing I explained to you earlier.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,393,13,20,Uh-huh.,q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer

55,400,14,1,"Right.  Well, I went to a community college, Orange County Community College.  I got an associate's degree.  And I started going to the New York Institute of Technology.  But instead, I -- the company I had started working for earlier in the summer wanted me back so badly that I went directly to work for them, and I had -- I wanted to go to school at night to finish up, but it didn't transpire out that way, because I ended up traveling so much in this particular -- particular line of work.  There is a lot of traveling involved; typically, 40 to 50 percent of the time is traveling. And for that company, it was back in the days with the analogue telephone lines, and any -- anytime we sold a product into a particular country, I would have to go to that country and do the testing to get approval to hook into the telephone network. And so I have been -- and I've been doing that ever since.  But now -- there's no analogue telephone lines now; everything is digital.  So they have memorandums of understanding between various countries that now we don't have to travel to that country to get approval to hook into the telephone line.  We can just go to an accredited laboratory, either local or, you know, somewhere in the U.S., and have the testing done.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,424,14,25,"I know this can be hard sometimes, but I think just if you -- my question was just kind of when -- when did you get which degrees.",q,MS. ZALKA,start_answer

It was a couple of months be -- it was prior to -- I believe it was prior to when they ended up having to formulate another plan to divest the -- to go from, I think it was $9 a share to $7 a share or $6.50 a share. It was -- they felt that they weren't going to get the approval by the Federal Trade Commission, so they lowered the expectations on -- prior to that, I thought they would get the approval.  And they were working towards getting the approval, from what I say, based on the -- Fred's was going to buy 380 of their stores, of Rite Aid stores. So they were trying to sell some of the assets, which made sense to me.  And then Fred's was also willing to take on more stores if the Federal Trade Commission came in and said, you have to sell more stores in order for this merger to go through. And then it started looking like it wasn't going to -- may not happen, but it still gave, you know -- there was still hope and gave indication that it was still going to happen.

632,1752,66,1,"When I read -- and don't quote me on the time or the date -- when I read a Bloomberg article.

It was -- it was around the -- it could have been around the time that they announced the -- their second plan, which was to -- to lower the number of stores that they were going to purchase and to lower the stock price to the $7 or $7.50. And I thought they were doing that so they could obtain the FTC approval, because the number of stores that they were initially going to buy was too many and, thereby, perhaps forming a monopoly.

And then when they announced it, I said to myself, oh, well, they're going to have to get the shareholders to vote on that.  And then I was completely wrong; no shareholder vote on that. How can you break a company in half without having a shareholder vote?  I'm still scratching my head over that one.  But, you know, I'm not a lawyer, especially in that particular area of expertise.

So I thought that they were just trying to level the playing field, per se, to lower the number of stores.

And I got some information about it, but I wasn't -- I wasn't following Fred's all the time.  The only time I would follow Fred's is if more than one company was mentioned in the news articles, it would come over to my e-mail.

So they wouldn't have had to lay out as much capital, which would be a benefit to them, as well as not causing the -- have less effect of the stock going down.

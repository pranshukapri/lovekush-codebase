104,418,15,18,"There was two issues.  One was some stealing and missing items that were happening.  And the other issue was at the time clock where people were punching, like they would come in and punch in at 6 o'clock and they would punch someone else at 6 o'clock that wasn't in yet.  So there was an issue with the time clock, so I know that's why we had wanted the time clock.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,428,16,3,Okay.  And who did the work to install that video system?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

108,434,16,9,"Well, I know we had one in the office, and I know that we had one at the time clock.  And then I believe that there was one at the loading dock, as I recall.  I think there was only four, four cameras?  That's all I recall, I'm sorry.  I don't remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,440,16,15,That's okay.  Was there ever any discussions before the fire about the company upgrading the interior of the building or upgrading the equipment that you were using?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
110,444,16,19,"Well, we were in the process of making plans that the people that were in the second end building were going to move to the end unit, and we were going to be taking over another, the other section.  So we were going to move them over.  But that was just in the planning stages, nothing was started with that yet.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,453,17,3,"And what was it you were then planning to do after the tenant moved over, what was Clemens, what were the Clemens people going to do, what was going to change?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
112,457,17,7,"So what was going to change was, we wanted the more automated sorting system, and that took up a lot of floor space, and so that was -- that was the reason that we wanted to, because where we sort was just like this little area, so we needed more space to be able to sort the garments with this new automated system.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,465,17,15,"And what would the advantage have been for you of the automated system?  Not for you, but for the company?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

115,469,17,19,"Would it have occurred faster, the sorting?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
116,471,17,21,"Yeah, I mean, that's what was it supposed to be, faster, more efficient, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,473,17,23,How far had you gotten in the process of planning for that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
118,476,18,1,"So we started putting the microchips in the garments, because they had told us that that took a long time till you get like all the chips in.  So we had started putting the chips in the garments.  And we had bought the computers that were needed for the sorting and the scanning.  And we had the portal that read that, we had that, and that had arrived and that was in the back building for lack of space, so then that wasn't destroyed in the fire.  And so we had purchased, I guess we had purchased all of the equipment, but we had not actually set any of it up yet before the fire occurred.  But we had purchased everything that we needed to set that up.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,491,18,16,"And did that include like what I'll call the physical rack system, whatever, for the sorting system that you had?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
120,494,18,19,No.  That was going to have to be installed yet.  That was not installed.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,496,18,21,And did you have estimates at that time about how much it was going to cost to install all that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
122,499,18,24,"Randy took care of that, so he would have had that.  I didn't have that information.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,503,19,3,Okay.  But you had gotten that far that you had talked about what the estimates were to put that in?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
124,506,19,6,"He would have that, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

131,517,19,17,And where did you sit in the facility?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
132,519,19,19,"So my office was in unit, like we called it Unit 3, in the front.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

217,747,28,22,"Well, I am going to ask about that and I'm concerned about that.  But what I really want to know the answer to is what is Clemens Cleaning Village claiming that it was not paid for?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
218,753,29,3,Okay.  I assembled that documentation.  Is that what you're asking?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

232,790,30,15,"That is the way the, our executive wear, we had to send out to a dry cleaner because the shirts and pants are pressed.  And so that was the executive wear, and that's the way the dry cleaner gave us, that's the bill he gave us like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,796,30,21,"And would the period, say 8/7, it doesn't have a year?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

236,806,31,6,"Actually, I'm pretty sure that we continued using his services in September, but we did not claim that because we were operating everything in this building, but we just didn't get the shirt equipment going. And so we didn't include that in this claim.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,812,31,12,All right.  So is it accurate then that in terms of time the last claim is for 8/25?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
238,815,31,15,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
239,816,31,16,All right.  Can you take a look at page 3218 for me.  What does page 3218 represent?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

And this K Cleaners did that work for us because we didn't have a dry cleaning machine anymore.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
241,827,32,2,"So is it accurate that what page 3218 and 3219 represent are the portions of that expense for K Cleaners -- I'm sorry, just page 3218 is for K Cleaners for the period when the insurance company did not reimburse you?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

248,844,32,19,"Okay, so that's what this is, this Town Valet, this was his invoices.  And I think that this whole packet doesn't include, we had like copies of all of the invoices, and then this was missing, and so then that's why that was included in here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,851,33,1,"Okay.  So you used the words ""this"" and ""that"" quite a few in there.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
250,853,33,3,I'm sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,854,33,4,"That's okay, because then on the record it's not clear. So what you're talking about is the handwritten pages at the beginning of Exhibit 9 end up being totaled on your QuickBooks report on page 3219?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
252,860,33,10,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,861,33,11,"I should have asked you this question before.  Beginning on page 3218, is this a report that you ran from your QuickBooks account?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

258,872,33,22,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
259,873,33,23,And did you limit the dates on that report to certain dates?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
260,876,34,1,"I did, because we just wanted this period.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
261,878,34,3,Okay.  So the period you ran it from was what?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
262,880,34,5,"Was 6/19 through the end of August, because the insurance company for their continuation paid prior to that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,883,34,8,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
264,884,34,9,So we had lots of invoices for K Cleaners that were paid from the business continuation.  But then it stopped.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
265,887,34,12,And then you ended it on August 30th because at that point the operations were back in the new building?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
266,890,34,15,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,891,34,16,Could you take a look at page 3220 for me for a second.  Can you tell me what was the services that Absorbtech was providing?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

274,907,35,7,"We have quite a few, like, Gemalto is one big one, it's now Thales.  I'm trying to think of those, the other ones that would be big.

282,930,36,5,It was the only way we could keep in business.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,932,36,7,"I understand that.  But when you gave the work to someone else to do, your company in turn would have saved some money; isn't that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
284,936,36,11,"We wouldn't have had, obviously, the utilities and that kind of thing, if that's what you mean.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,939,36,14,"Well, utilities, there would have been people who did the work; correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
286,941,36,16,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,942,36,17,There would have been wear and tear on equipment; is that correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
288,944,36,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
289,945,36,20,"Okay.  What, if anything, have you done to calculate those savings?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
290,947,36,22,I did not include that in here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,948,36,23,"To the best of your knowledge, has anyone taken any steps to calculate those savings?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
292,952,37,2,"No, I don't believe so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,953,37,3,"Okay.  If you could take a look at page 3224 for me, please, what is your understanding of what this page represents?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
294,956,37,6,"So when we, after the fire we lost quite a few of our trucks in the fire, and so we had to rent trucks until we could get replacement trucks in.  And some of the -- the insurance does not cover renting bigger trucks, so they had -- they could rent -- you could rent a truck and they would pay the rental cost, but they didn't cover it on any of the bigger trucks that we had to rent. And then there was also a time period that they would not pay the rental, it was -- and I'm sorry, I don't remember that right now, how many days it was, it escapes me.  There was a certain period that it covered, so this was what we paid to lease the trucks that we needed until we could buy new trucks. And then I put what the insurance covered on that, so the total on the truck rental on the back, on 3228, that total came from the other page, $40,862.84, and then received from insurance, that's the amount that we received from the insurance.  So then that was the amount that was unreimbursed for the truck lease.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
295,982,38,7,"All right.  So the unreimbursed expense is $29,202.14 and that's what you're making a claim for?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
296,985,38,10,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
297,986,38,11,"So let's go back to page 3224, the trucks that went out of service that you lost, were they owned by the company or leased by the company?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
298,990,38,15,They were owned by the company.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
299,991,38,16,And I notice that some of these expenses run all the way into November.  Why did it take so long to get some of those trucks replaced?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
300,995,38,20,"That's how long on those, on the big box trucks, that's what the lead time is when you're ordering a truck.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
301,998,38,23,And how many of the big box trucks did you have?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
302,1001,39,1,I don't have that number in front of me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
303,1003,39,3,Do you have invoices in the documentation you have to back up all of these rental truck expenses?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
304,1006,39,6,"That was there, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
305,1007,39,7,"Okay.  Let's take a look at page 3225, if we could.  Can you tell me what this represents?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
306,1010,39,10,That was -- I don't think that represents anything.  I think that was just like an error because that doesn't have anything on it.  I think it's the next page that has the information.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,1015,39,15,"Okay.  So page 3226, tell me what that represents?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
308,1017,39,17,That represents the cost that we had to run back and forth to the subcontractors after the business continuation stopped.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
309,1020,39,20,"And how did you incur, what were those costs for?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
310,1022,39,22,"We had one truck that we rented from DelVal, there was a big box truck, and we rented that just to come back and forth to the subcontractors.  And that was covered by the business continuation until that stopped.  So I just was looking on here, so this is like on 3227, that's summarized there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
311,1030,40,5,All right.  So are pages 3227 and 3228 a summary of all the unreimbursed expenses that you are claiming in the case?,q,MR. BLUM,start_chat
312,1033,40,8,"For clarity, you means Clemens Cleaning Village?",side_chat,MR. SLATTERY,start_chat

314,1036,40,11,Okay.,side_chat,MR. SLATTERY,start_answer
315,1037,40,12,"Yes, that was the total that we had put together.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
316,1039,40,14,And did you personally prepare pages 3227 and 3228?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
317,1041,40,16,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
318,1042,40,17,"Okay.  So I just wanted to run through these.  So from page 3227, the subcontractor block is actually a summary of all the subcontractors you went through in the beginning of the document; correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
319,1047,40,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
320,1048,40,23,"And that totals $230,000 plus?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
321,1049,40,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
322,1051,41,1,"All right.  The cost of transport to the subcontractors, is for that extra box truck?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
323,1054,41,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,1055,41,5,"All right.  And then total for that section of damages is $239,660.31; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
325,1058,41,8,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,1059,41,9,"Now the next section says ""Replacement cost.""  Okay?  And that wasn't really documented in the beginning portion of this document.  Tell me what you did to come up with these numbers for replacement costs?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
327,1064,41,14,"I had gone on the QuickBooks account and looked at what the total amount that we charged when we were doing all these replacements, that the invoices -- we actually had all the invoices for those to back up these items, like stacks of invoices.  But I had taken this from QuickBooks, that this is what was charged to the accounts that we incurred to replace everything after the fire.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,1073,41,23,"And when you say everything, I want to be a little bit careful about that.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
329,1076,42,1,"Okay, I'm sorry.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,1077,42,2,"No; that's okay, I mean, that's a normal way to say anything.  I just want to be a little more precise at the moment. So what types of replacement items are you talking about here?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
331,1082,42,7,"Okay.  So like on the uniform replacement, it would have been everything that we -- the uniforms that were lost in the fire that we had to put replacement orders in to replace the garments that were lost in the fire. The towels and mops, whatever that would have been, all of the bar towels and aprons and everything for the kitchen accounts that we did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,1092,42,17,All right.  And would it be appropriate to use the word inventory?  Was this all the company's inventory that was lost?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
333,1096,42,21,I guess it depends what you're meaning by inventory.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,1098,42,23,"Okay.  Tell me how you personally, you as a person working here at Clemens, would have described all these items?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
335,1102,43,2,"Yeah, it's what we -- yes, I guess inventory would be what you would call it, what we needed to service the accounts, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,1105,43,5,"And the inventory that was lost in the fire, was all of it used or was some of it new material?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
337,1108,43,8,"Well, for the towels, I mean, we always definitely would have had, you know, like bales of towels that would have been new. But obviously the items that came back from the customers would have all been, you know, used items.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,1114,43,14,"Okay.  And so in the towels or the mops that you replaced, can you tell me the percentage of those that were new versus used, the ones that were lost?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
339,1118,43,18,I'm not sure I understand the question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,1120,43,20,"Okay.  So let's just stick with, let's go to the uniforms, if we could, for a minute, I think it's a little bit easier.  The uniform replacement you have $264,861; correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
341,1126,44,1,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,1127,44,2,All right.  So you replaced everything that was lost in the fire of the uniforms; correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
343,1130,44,5,"We didn't really replace everything that was lost in the fire because we had a whole like -- like when people return stuff, you know, like it goes into inventory.  And then we have that to use again.  We didn't replace -- that doesn't include anything, we didn't replace any of that inventory.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
344,1137,44,12,"So tell me, the 264,000, what does that represent?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
345,1139,44,14,That represents what we had to replace for the garments that were in service at accounts.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
346,1142,44,17,And all those garments that were in service were all used garments at that point?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
347,1144,44,19,That would be correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
348,1145,44,20,"Okay.  And let's go back to the towels and mops.  So the towels and mops that you replaced as part of this that you're making this claim for, were they all used equipment?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
349,1151,45,1,"The towels and mops, like I said, there would have been -- we always had like bales of towels, you know, that would have been brand-new that weren't even in service yet, that would have been that.  But everything that would be out at the customers, yes, that would be used.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
350,1158,45,8,"So tell me in the claim that you're making in this case, what of the towels was used and, like in a percentage, how much was used and how much was in a new bale sitting in your inventory?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
351,1163,45,13,I would say as my best guess would be 75% would have been used.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
352,1165,45,15,Okay.  And what are you basing that number off of?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
353,1167,45,17,Just my best estimate of what it is.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
354,1168,45,18,"Okay.  So is it accurate that you did not go back to try to do any specific analysis to say, this is the number that we're sitting here -- that we know were brand-new, you haven't done anything like to actually verify that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
355,1174,45,24,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

362,1185,46,10,"Garment chips, were those all that were already employed in use?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
363,1187,46,12,"No; because we had, like I said, we were just starting this program, so we had purchased 20,000 of those like right before the fire that would have been burned in the fire.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
364,1192,46,17,"Okay.  Are those, the claim that you're making, the 15,927 was all for new chips, or is that some used chips that were also lost?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
365,1196,46,21,It would have been some that would have been in garments to begin with.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
366,1198,46,23,And do you know what percentage were in garments and what percentage weren't?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
367,1201,47,1,"We had just started putting those in, so I would say that, I'm going to say 75% would have been ones that weren't in garments yet.  They would have been new.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
368,1205,47,5,"Again, is that your best estimate?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
369,1206,47,6,That's my best estimate.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
370,1207,47,7,"Okay.  Now, you have listed in there total replacement cost, the 674, is that a total of all those items?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
371,1210,47,10,"Yes, it is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
372,1211,47,11,"All right.  And then it says ""Insurance valuation,"" 456,000 plus change. Is that the amount you collected from the insurance company?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
373,1215,47,15,"Yes, it is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
374,1216,47,16,"And do you know, did the insurance company in their valuation, was that their valuation of what the actual value of those items were that were lost?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
375,1220,47,20,"I don't know how they came to that valuation, I'm not sure if it was just that we were up at the $2 million limit anyway.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
376,1223,47,23,"Okay, I understand.  But, at any rate, the difference is whatever listed there, 218,282; correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
377,1227,48,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
378,1228,48,3,"Now can we switch to the upper right-hand column of the document for a minute.  It says there ""First day sales,"" and I understand there was not coverage for the first day after the fire.  Tell me what you did to calculate that $15,000 number?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
379,1234,48,9,"That was the loss that we had calculated because -- and I took that, that was a Wednesday, so we had looked at what the Wednesday sales would have normally been to compare it to what the sales that we lost for that day.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
380,1240,48,15,"Okay.  And so tell me how did you come up with that actual calculation, 15,000?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
381,1242,48,17,"I took the sales that we actually booked on 6/15, which was nothing because we couldn't go out that day.  And then I looked at what a normal Wednesday would be, and a normal Wednesday, like I averaged the previous four, and it was 15,000 was the normal.  So our normal Wednesday sales at that point would have been 15,000, and we didn't have any sales that Wednesday.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
382,1252,49,2,So the number that you calculated was the gross sales for the day?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
383,1254,49,4,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
384,1255,49,5,"Okay.  And the 15,000 is the average of the four Wednesdays before the fire?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
385,1257,49,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
386,1258,49,8,And would the company have had any savings for not operating on that day?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
387,1260,49,10,"I'm trying to think of a nice way to answer this question.  Thinking back to that day, the last thing that I was thinking about was, we really saved a lot of money.  I'm sorry, that just really -- maybe we can move on to another question.  I don't want to answer that one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
388,1267,49,17,Okay.  So that's your best answer for that question?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
389,1269,49,19,That is my best answer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
390,1270,49,20,"Okay.  The ""Fire-related extra expenses,"" it says ""Accounting 11,401.""  Can you tell me what that is for?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
391,1273,49,23,"So our accountant had to do a lot of extra accounting work with, because our fiscal year ran to September and the fire was in June.  And we got the $2 million to buy, you know, like to replace stuff, but that money wasn't spent in that fiscal year, so they had to do a lot of extra accounting work.  I'm not -- I'm not into what the CPAs do, but they kept track of the extra work that they had to do to document all of this and file the extra IRS paperwork or whatever that was needed concerning that.  And that was, they gave us a separate invoice for that extra work and that's what that was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
392,1288,50,13,"And underneath there it says ""Received check,"" is that $10,000 a check that you received from the insurance company?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
393,1291,50,16,"That is true, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
394,1292,50,17,"So the amount claimed for that is the difference, the $1,401?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
395,1294,50,19,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
396,1295,50,20,"Now, if we go back to the left-hand column, there's the property loss over the 2 million limit.  Do you see that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
397,1298,50,23,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
398,1299,50,24,"What, if anything, did you do to come up with that number?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
399,1302,51,2,I believe that was taken from the insurance company valuation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
400,1304,51,4,So all you did is you took the valuation that the insurance company gave you and minus the 2 million that you were paid?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
401,1307,51,7,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
402,1308,51,8,"Okay.  Beneath that, this ""Unreimbursed lease expense"" is actually the -- we've talked about that item, correct, and it leads to the 40,000?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
403,1312,51,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

406,1316,51,16,Okay.  And the final section is totaling all of the unreimbursed expenses; correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
407,1319,51,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
408,1320,51,20,"Did you personally do anything to calculate any losses related to lease payments?  I'm sorry, I'll be more specific. Lease payments from tenants in the building?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
409,1324,51,24,That's not -- that's not my -- I don't do anything with that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
410,1327,52,2,"All right.  And I take it from what you said also already, you did not do anything to calculate any losses pertaining to the actual structure itself, the building?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

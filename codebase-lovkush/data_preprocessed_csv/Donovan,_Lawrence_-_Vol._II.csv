872,1813,163,14,"You didn't report to anybody.  You reported on the job, and they told you where to go.

884,1840,164,16,"Yes, from the start of the job, say here.  We just go back to the same place we were working before. You know, it wasn't a daily instruction to go here, do this, do that.

1186,2412,187,13,"Okay.  My understanding from when you were speaking with Frank was that it's a brand of valve that you recall seeing during the time you worked as an insulator, but you can't place it at any particular jobsite where you worked with either Benny or Peter Crescenzo; is that correct?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
1187,2418,187,19,"Well, mostly the powerhouses, the Jenkins, they are big valves, the big -- so, I mean, I would say they are probably in every powerhouse, Jenkins, as far as I know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

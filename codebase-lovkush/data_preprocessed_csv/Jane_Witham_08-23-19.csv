6,176,6,9,"Thank you.  Just to do some ground rules before we keep going.  The goal today is to create a written transcript of everything we say, and to do that, it's important that we let each other finish our questions and answers even if we have a pretty good idea what the other person is going to say.  So I ask that you let me finish my questions, and I'll let you finish answering.  Is that okay?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer

35,234,8,15,Objection.,side_chat,MR. MCLAUGHLIN,start_answer
36,235,8,16,"When I was driving on 290 for -- I did see vehicles stopping ahead of me after I came up over a hill.  It was, like, a small incline, and then when I got to the top of the incline, I looked down and I saw brake lights.  So yes, at that point, I saw brake lights.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,241,8,22,Is it fair to say the first time you saw the brake lights you're describing was at the top of that hill?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
38,246,9,1,Yes.  When I got -- when I could see over the top of the -- yeah.  And then it sloped downward afterwards.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,249,9,4,And why could you not see brake lights before you got to the top of the hill?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
40,251,9,6,"Because I was coming up the hill, and when I got to the top, there was, like, an incline down, and that's when I saw the cars putting on brake lights, and it was kind of still at dusk because it was early in the morning.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,256,9,11,Could you say that last part again?  I think the phone broke up.,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
42,258,9,13,"It was kind of, like, at dusk, you know, like, at the beginning of the morning.  So it still was kind of dark outside at that point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,261,9,16,And what did you do when you saw the cars' brake lights ahead of you?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
44,263,9,18,"I went ahead and I applied my brakes, as I normally would, and my brakes did not -- I guess my car was on the ice.  I didn't realize there was ice under me, which is why -- so when I applied them, my car just kind of skidded.  I went into a skid, and then I looked up a little further, and then I saw that there was actually a tractor-trailer truck, like, over going across the entire road, the interstate.  So then I had to try to find my way over to -- I just wanted to try to find a way to stop.  I think I answered your question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,276,10,5,Thank you.  When did you --,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
46,277,10,6,Do you want me to keep going?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

48,279,10,8,Go ahead.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,280,10,9,Thank you.  I just want to ask about the truck you just mentioned.  When did you first see it that day?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
50,283,10,12,"The first time I saw the truck was, like I said, I came up over the hill, and everything just happened -- everything just happened in, like, seconds, you know.  I saw the brake lights.  I applied the brakes to slow my down.  My car was starting to skid.  I saw the truck.  So everything was just kind of happening, like, one after another. Obviously, the first thing I saw was brake lights.  I applied my brakes on my car, and then I saw that the truck was right there blocking, and I was, like, oh, my gosh, I have to figure out what I'm going to do because I have my family in the car.  How am I going to slow down?  I kept trying to apply the brakes to try to get it to stop, but it wasn't working.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,299,11,2,You mentioned there was ice --,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
52,300,11,3,"Yes.  I applied my brakes.  I tried to stop with the brakes, but they weren't working because I was sliding, and even though I tried to re-apply the brakes, I just wasn't getting any traction to stop the car.  Does that make sense?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,305,11,8,Yes.  Did you notice any ice on the roads prior to driving on the hill?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
54,307,11,10,Huh?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,308,11,11,Did you notice --,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
56,309,11,12,"Yeah, like, when I was -- no.  No.  No.  I didn't notice any of that the whole trip.  You know, the rest of it was fine.  I just want -- it wasn't really a steep incline.  It was just enough to not be able to see.  So when I made it so I could see, then there was a slight incline down, but, again, the roads were fine prior to that.  It was just that, I guess, section.  I don't know how far it went after that because, you know, there was cars all in an accident.  So, obviously, there was, like, a bunch of cars, I guess, on the other side of the truck that were -- that I saw afterwards that were -- there was an accident.  You know, so it was, like, several accidents.  I just happened to be in the middle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,325,12,2,"When you first saw the truck, what was it doing?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
58,327,12,4,It was just at a dead stop across the whole road.  So it had jackknifed.  I guess that's the correct terminology.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
59,330,12,7,I'm sorry.  You broke up there.,side_chat,MS. THEBAUD,start_answer
60,332,12,9,I didn't see the truck -- I didn't see the truck --,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
61,334,12,11,Can you say -- you broke up there after you said the truck was at a stop.  Then what did you say?,side_chat,MS. THEBAUD,start_chat
62,337,12,14,Regarding the truck?,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
63,338,12,15,Yeah.,side_chat,MS. THEBAUD,start_chat
64,339,12,16,"When I first saw the truck, it had already -- it was already at a complete stop blocking the road.  Like, I didn't see that take place, but, you know, after I saw the brake lights when I applied my brakes, I looked up and I saw a truck, like, sitting across the whole interstate.  So there was no way around that truck.  Does that make sense?",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
65,347,12,24,Yes.,side_chat,MS. THEBAUD,start_question
66,351,13,2,"And when you applied your brakes, were you able to stop your vehicle?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
67,353,13,4,"No.  I wasn't able to stop the vehicle. Even as I kept trying to apply them going over, I didn't want to go under the truck.  So it made me nervous because I didn't want to, like, decapitate anyone in my car.  I was kind of freaking out.  I did my best.  I thought maybe if I merged over to the median in the middle, I could maybe slow down my car by using that, again, while trying to apply brakes. The car was just sliding on the ice.  So I tried to bump into it just to try to stop the car, but at the same time I have all this stuff going through my head.  My kids are in my car.  I'm sorry.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,365,13,16,That's okay.  Thank you for explaining.  I sent some pictures.  Do you happen to have those available?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
69,368,13,19,The pictures you sent me?  Did you send me a text?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
70,370,13,21,Do you have access to e-mail right now by any chance?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
71,372,13,23,"I do.  This is a new phone.  I don't know how it works, but I could try to pull up an e-mail.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

74,381,14,6,What I'd like to talk about is your vehicle that day.  What vehicle were you driving?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
75,383,14,8,I was driving my brother's vehicle.  It was a blue -- I don't even know what the make and model of it was right now.  I apologize.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,386,14,11,Do you know what kind?  Was it an SUV or a car?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
77,388,14,13,It was a car.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

80,391,14,16,Do you know where the car was registered?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
81,392,14,17,My daughter -- I was going to say my daughter said she has pictures if you had needed me to look at it.  So ask me your next question.  I apologize.  I interrupted you.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,396,14,21,What do you have pictures of?  What does your daughter have pictures of?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
83,398,14,23,"You have pictures of the car?  Yes, she does.  She has pictures of the vehicle and the accident and, like, the surroundings.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,403,15,2,"What I want to ask is the vehicle you were driving, how did it stop?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
85,405,15,4,"Well, I went ahead and I hit the side to stop it, but it did end up going into the car in front of me.  It ended up sliding into the person in front of me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,409,15,8,Do you remember what kind of car was in front of your car when you came to that stop?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
87,411,15,10,"I do not because there was -- like I said, it was still kind of, like, dusk.  Kind of dark.  I don't know.  Let me see.  Can you see if there's a picture of the car in front of me?  Hang on a second. My daughter was checking to see if she has a picture of the car that was in front of us, if that would be helpful?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,418,15,17,Sure.,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
89,419,15,18,"At the end, we were underneath the trailer.  Because of the way I had turned my wheel, I ended up in the middle of the intersection, like, right underneath the tractor-trailer gas tank.  I was, like, right there right behind his cab.  That's where I ended up at the end, but there was a car that was in front of me that a guy got rammed into, like, a couple of times because I was hit from behind, I think three times, and they kept pushing me into the car in front of me, and then my car would slide back. My car would slide forward, and then at the end of everybody hitting me from behind.  I was kind of, like, in the middle at a diagonal.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,434,16,7,"So that diagonal position colliding with the truck, how did you end up there?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
91,436,16,9,"I didn't hit the truck.  Thank the Lord, because it was -- the gas tank was right there, but it was, like, a dark -- so I ended up there because when I banged into the wall, I got nervous from hitting the wall.  I didn't want my car to spin, and it was on ice.  I didn't know which direction my car was going to spin, so I kind of cut the wheel back, and then every time a car would hit me, my car would bounce back, and because of the angle of my -- the way I had turned my wheel all the way over, my car was just -- every time it bounced back, it would just push further into the middle. Because I put my wheel to the right.  I started off over to the left, and then I didn't want my car to go into a spin, so I cut my wheel, but there was really nowhere to go at that point because there was a car in front of me, which, you know, I couldn't stop the car.  I tried to stop the car by hitting the guardrail, but it did not work.  The cars were just kind of banging me from behind, and I was just kind of -- my car just started sliding back and forth, which ended up pushing me out to the middle.  That's all I know. My daughter gave me a picture of the two cars that were kind of already crushed into where the tractor-trailer was, and it looks like there was a gray car.  It could have been, like, a charcoal gray car.  It might have been the one that had initially hit mine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,467,17,14,And you have these pictures in digital format?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
93,469,17,16,It's on a phone.  A cell phone.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

100,482,18,3,You're welcome.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,484,18,5,"So before the accident, before you were hitting the brakes, what lane were you driving in?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
102,486,18,7,"I think it was, like, in the middle lane. I think there was were four lanes there.  I don't know.  I'm pretty sure it was, like, four lanes.  I was in the middle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,490,18,11,"If there's four lanes, which middle?  The left or the second or third?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
104,492,18,13,"To the right.  You're absolutely correct. Whether it be three or four, I was just, like, to the second one over from the passing lane.  So you have the passing lane, and then I was the next one over. So one away from, like, the guardrail from the middle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,498,18,19,Okay.  So you started --,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
106,499,18,20,If that makes sense?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,500,18,21,"Yes.  Thank you for explaining. So you start there, and then at some point your vehicle starts to skid on ice; is that right?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
108,503,18,24,"As soon as -- yeah, because I came over the hill.  I saw brake lights.  I applied my brakes. And then my car started sliding, and then at that point, I saw that the truck was going across the interstate.  I saw -- obviously, I realized there was an accident there, but at first I guess the other cars -- that must have just happened before I made it over the hill.  All I saw was the brake lights that were in front of me from the car that was in the lane in front of me because it was still kind of dark at that point, if that make sense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,516,19,11,Sure.  How far away was the truck when you first saw it?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
110,518,19,13,"Quite a bit aways.  I'm trying to think of how many car lengths was between there, but there was quite a few because there was the top of the hill and then it -- I'm trying to think.  There was multiple -- probably multiple cars ahead.  So if there was no ice on the road, I definitely would have had plenty of time to brake -- you know what I'm saying -- to avoid it, but because of the ice on the road, there was, like, no time because my car was just kind of sliding.  It was out my control.  You know, I was just doing my best to do less damage to my vehicle, everybody else's vehicle, and more or less the people in front of the vehicle.  You know, I didn't want anyone to get hurt. So there's just a lot going through your mind as a driver when you have, you know, your family in the car and trying to figure out the safest way to stop your car when you can't stop your car.  It was, like, out of my control, the whole situation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,539,20,8,Right.,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
112,540,20,9,"But there was plenty -- if there was no ice on the road, I could have just stopped, and then none of that would have happened.  The cars in front of me, they could have just stopped because they had -- they were jammed in between the truck in the -- like, in between the truck in the media.  So, like, the car I impacted, they were stuck because they hit -- you know, there was no room for them to go through with that truck the way it was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,549,20,18,So I want to ask --,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
114,550,20,19,"The whole thing was out of people's control.  It was a no-fault accident, is what the police had told me because I was, like, well, you know, I have these medical bills, and the police was, like, it's a no-fault accident, so you just have to claim it through your insurance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
115,558,21,1,I object and move to strike certain nonresponsive portions of that testimony.,side_chat,MS. LOPEZ,start_question
116,561,21,4,So when did you first speak to the police about the accident?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
117,563,21,6,"Really it was, like, kind of after I had gotten home because during this scenario it was just so traumatic that, you know, hey, we're just going to get you to a safe place, and, you know, they might have touched base with me.  I'm, like, what about insurance and all this other stuff?  Then I was, like, you know, when I got home, I had more questions.  I'm, like, what the heck, you know.  Is anybody going to cover everything because I was feeling like a victim as well.  We were all victims that day on the road. And I got home, and I'm, like, what the heck? You know, so I called the state and to be, like, hey, is the state going to do anything to cover all this damage because the roads were icy, and then I really didn't get anywhere with that because they said it was a no-fault accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,580,21,23,So about the police --,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_chat
119,581,21,24,Move to strike.,side_chat,MS. LOPEZ,start_question
120,585,22,2,"So I want to ask more specifically, did the police contact you with questions about the accident?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
121,588,22,5,"No, nobody contacted me.  Other than -- except for, you know, when I got paperwork from the attorney's office about the thing, which then I called my brother, and then he called his insurance company.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,593,22,10,"So after the accident, did you speak with other people there?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
123,595,22,12,"After the accident?  The only people -- I'm not from around there.  They said that they were going to escort us all to a hospital.  So we all loaded on buses or some in ambulance.  I went on the ambulance with my mom, and then my kids went on a bus.  They were separated from me, and they were driven to the same hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,602,22,19,How old were your kids?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
125,603,22,20,"There was no, like, conversation against the police officers.  The police officers were basically there to direct us all off the interstate into a safe location at the hospital to be checked out.  That's what the police's job was pretty much there for that day.  I mean, there was one lady.  She was just sitting there.  She found dry pavement, and she was just sitting there in her car.  They made her get out of her car and escorted her off the interstate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,615,23,6,I'm sorry.  What kind of car was that person driving?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
127,617,23,8,"She had some type of SUV, and it was, like, in the middle.  Like, I didn't want to take the middle because of the fact that that truck was right there, and I didn't want -- like I said, I was so worried about maybe decapitating -- you know, driving under the truck because I couldn't stop.  So I just didn't know which route was the best way to take.  I just knew that the guardrail was there, and then maybe I could slow my car down if I maybe tried to go up against it.  I didn't know how to slow my car down besides applying brakes, which there was no friction on the ground.  So I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
128,629,23,20,Did you observe any vehicles that were further down the road from the truck that you've been describing?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
129,632,23,23,"No, because the truck just blocked everything.  The truck literally took up all the road even the end two rows.  There was, like, a car that was kind of smushed in between.  Like, the one that I ended up impacting, it was already smushed up because it couldn't go past that one car and the truck.  I don't know if the truck actually hit that one car or if those two cars were at the same time trying to stop and impacted there together.  I don't know how that happened.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
130,644,24,9,And then from where you were --,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
131,645,24,10,But I don't think there was --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
132,646,24,11,"So from where you were, did you see other cars colliding?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
133,648,24,13,"I couldn't see any other cars colliding. All the cars were colliding into me because they kept coming over the hill and then hitting me.  The only thing I could see was that one tractor-trailer truck. There was another family actually, but they were all the way over to the -- they took the right side, or at least I kept to the inside.  But they were already there as well before -- you know, I didn't see anything that had happened with them.  I just know when I was facing at the diagonal, that, you know, I knew that there was another family off to the right. I didn't see them hit or anything.  I don't know what was going on with them.  I was just, you know, in a state of shock.  It was pretty traumatic. So I didn't see anybody impacting.  It was just my car.  I saw the cars up ahead come to a stop.  I saw brake lights, but after I saw the brake lights on the truck, then I was just in a panic mode because I kept trying to brake and I couldn't brake no matter where I was braking, and that's when I tried to go over to the side.  And so everything else -- there were just cars that came up over that hill.  They just kept colliding into -- you know, into the next car, which was me, because I think they all had the same idea, and they -- I just kept getting rammed, like, three more times from behind. And then the last time I thought I was going to get hit again, another truck had jackknifed at the top of that hill.  So then there was probably cars on the other side of that that didn't know what was going on, and they were just hitting that truck, and then people could see at that point.  So I think that's where it kind of came to an end.  It was a backup of traffic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
134,684,25,23,"So going back to when you talked about trying to slow your car by driving towards the median, I think you said at some point you turned your wheel back to the right; is that correct?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
135,690,26,3,"I did.  Yeah, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,691,26,4,And why did you do that?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
137,692,26,5,"Because I didn't know if I had -- I was just really concerned about hitting the median too hard and then my car spinning and then my car getting hit from a side angle because, you know -- I don't know.  Because I knew the people behind me -- I wasn't even thinking about the people behind me, but I didn't want -- I don't know.  I didn't want anyone to be hurt in my car.  So I was trying to keep my car straight, but maybe just to slow it down or stop it by just going against the rail, and then I found out that it really wasn't doing anything.  I cut my wheel back quickly, and then that's when I ran out of space because there was nowhere for me to go.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,705,26,18,Does your car actually come into contact with the median?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
139,707,26,20,"Yeah, it did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,708,26,21,"And then at some point, you decided to move to the right?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
141,710,26,23,"I hit the median -- when I hit the median, I freaked out because -- you know, there's so much going through your mind.  I don't know what would happen if I hit the median too hard.  So I hit the median.  I cut my wheel back, and then I just ended up sliding into the car in front of me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,718,27,5,So when you cut your wheel to the right --,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
143,719,27,6,"And then from there -- I mean, I was there, and I thought this was the end, and then that's when the next car came and hit me from the back, and then when they hit me, I guess their car slid back.  My car had slid back, and then my car slid forward, but because my wheel was cut, it impacted the car in front of them, and then after that, another car came behind them, hit that car, which hit my car again.  And then my car slid back again, and as it kept moving, it being pushed back on the ice, I was just kind of sliding back and forth on the ice, and so the third hit, that's when I got pushed all the way out to under the -- by the tractor-trailer kind of underneath their gas tank right there. And then that was the last hit that I received, like I said, thankfully.  Then that's when, I guess, the truck at the top of the hill must have jackknifed because no more cars were coming down, and then there was some more crashes that followed that I heard, but that was just the cars, you know, from that truck jackknifing, and then the cars there just, you know, kind of last minute probably not expecting a truck to just jackknife on an interstate.  So I don't know.  I don't know what happened behind me.  I just know -- all I know is that three more cars had hit me.  Not three more cars but -- you know, because we're kind of back to back.  Like, I guess the car behind that car was hitting the car in back of me.  It was just kind of -- it was rough.  I don't know.  It was pretty traumatic.  I don't know if you understood anything that I said.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

146,758,28,19,"I didn't really collide with the truck. Like, my car just stopped, like, right at its gas tank.  It was, like -- because I wasn't -- so when my car moved forward, it just stopped right there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,762,28,23,Do you know whether your vehicle ever actually came into contact with any part of that truck?,q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
148,767,29,2,"No, it didn't.  My car didn't hit that truck, but it was just, like, if it went any further, I would have hit his gas tank.  Yeah.  So the only car that I know that my car came into contact was the one that was in front of me, and then I hit that car, but I did see that there was another car from the pictures.  So I don't know if my car was bounced into that car as well or --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,775,29,10,"The car that you say was in front of you, do you know what kind of car that was?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
150,777,29,12,"No.  I just saw the picture.  My daughter just showed me.  There was, like, a black charcoal car and then there was a black car.  So that was the -- that was the one, like, in between -- stuck in between the big truck that was kind of across the whole interstate, and then there was a black car that was kind of in there, too.  Those kind of seemed to be smushed together in that area because clearly both of them couldn't make it past there because the median was on the other side and then in front of the other truck. So I don't even think I hit that black car because that car was pushed a lot more further than the gray car.  So I was probably clear of that car. It doesn't look like there was any damage to it.  But the car that I was pushed into that was in front of me, that one I probably hit a couple of times, and then that car just slid out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

284,1124,42,21,"Are you saying going from, like, the top of the hill going down when I was going over to the median?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,1127,42,24,Yes.,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
286,1130,43,1,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,1131,43,2,Okay.,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
288,1132,43,3,"I had pretty free rein.  That's why I kept just trying to stop my car, and I just couldn't stop my car.  So I went all the way over and tried to stop it with that --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
289,1136,43,7,Great.,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
290,1137,43,8,"-- but, again, there was ice on the ground.  I didn't hit no cars, if that was your question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,1140,43,11,Thank you.  It was.  So the first thing that you came up against was that left median?,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
292,1142,43,13,Say it again.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,1143,43,14,The first thing -- I think you said you bumped into something.  The first thing you bumped into was that left median strip?,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
294,1146,43,17,"Yeah, that's the only thing.  That's the only thing I made contact with when I first got there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
295,1149,43,20,"When you came up over the incline, I take it it started to descend?  The road started to descend?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
296,1152,43,23,I don't understand that question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
297,1153,43,24,"Sure.  When there's an incline, there's a decline.  So when you came up the --",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
298,1157,44,2,There was a decline.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
299,1158,44,3,"And the accident that you've described, that occurred on the declined portion of this roadway?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
300,1161,44,6,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
301,1162,44,7,Yes?,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
302,1163,44,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
303,1164,44,9,"When you first got over to the crest of the incline, I know you mentioned you saw some brake lights ahead of you?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
304,1167,44,12,"When I got to the top of the hill, that's when I saw brake lights.  That's when I applied my brakes and realized I didn't have any.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
305,1170,44,15,"And was it you just saw brake lights from the car ahead of you in your lane, or did you see multiple brake lights ahead of you?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
306,1173,44,18,"Yes.  All I remember was just seeing brake lights, and that's obviously brakes.  It was pretty normal at that point, and then I realized when my car started skidding, you know -- I don't know.  I was just taking it all in at once.  Everything was just happening so fast.  So everything was, like, in seconds.  It's not, like, there was a moment and then there's another moment.  No.  Everything is, like, in seconds.  I applied my brakes at the same time I was viewing -- because I saw brakes, and at the same time I was applying my brakes, my car was skidding.  I was seeing the truck across the road, and then I was moving over.  So it wasn't like there was pauses in between.  That's not the case.  Everything was just automatic. So I was multitasking.  The first thing I saw was brake lights.  So I applied my brakes.  At the same time I was viewing the rest of the area, and I saw the truck all the way across, and that's when I started freaking out and trying to figure out where I was going to go in all of this.  There was no place for me to go.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,1197,45,16,Hold up a second.  It would be really helpful if you just answered my question.,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
308,1199,45,18,I apologize.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
309,1200,45,19,"It happens all the time.  It's just more difficult on the phone. I guess my point is, I want to know, did you -- you saw brake lights which caused you to apply your brakes, right?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
310,1205,45,24,Right.  Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
311,1208,46,1,"When was the first -- did you ever actually notice why the car was starting to brake? For example, did you notice any accident ahead of you?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
312,1212,46,5,"When I came up over the hill, I just saw brake lights.  I applied my brakes, and that's when I noticed that there was an accident sitting before me. I noticed it all -- it was all taken in when I saw the brake lights.  I automatically applied my brakes, and then I obviously had a visual of the truck all the way across the interstate.  Everything just happened instantly.  It was all instant.  Brake lights, applied brakes, saw everything laid out in front of me, and my next step was where am I going to go.  If my brakes aren't working at the same time, where am I going to go to try and not hurt people in my car.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
313,1225,46,18,I get that.  Is it fair to say you had no recognition that an accident had happened ahead of you until the point that you got to the incline?,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
314,1228,46,21,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
315,1229,46,22,So is it fair to say that the incline impeded your view of what was going on ahead?,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
316,1231,46,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
317,1234,47,1,The 11 photographs that you've reviewed that your daughter took at the accident scene --,q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
318,1236,47,3,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
319,1237,47,4,"-- I understand that you're going to forward those to your attorney, right?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
320,1239,47,6,"Yes, I can do so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
321,1240,47,7,"Great.  Those 11 photographs that you've testified to, are they a fair and accurate representation of what the accident scene looked like immediately following the accident?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
322,1244,47,11,The one that you had showed me or the other ones?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
323,1246,47,13,"The other ones that your daughter took.  I just want to know -- to be able to use these at trial, I have to know if they show what they're supposed to show or show something relevant.  So my question to you is these 11 photographs that we're going to get, are they fair and accurate representations of what that accident scene looked like while you were still on scene?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
324,1254,47,21,"Again, they were pictures taken by my daughter when she was -- when she had gotten out of the car with the policeman to escort her or whatever. So I really can't answer that question.  I mean, they were pictures of the accident, you know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
325,1261,48,2,"Well, ma'am, you reviewed the photographs as we were taking this deposition?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
326,1263,48,4,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
327,1264,48,5,"And as you looked at those photographs, did they appear to be good pictures of what was shown at the accident scene?",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
328,1267,48,8,"Yes.  I really don't know what you're looking for when you're asking me these questions, so -- they are of the accident that had taken place.  So when you say ""good,"" I don't know --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
329,1271,48,12,"Well, I just want to make sure they represent the accident scene.  That's all.",q,MS. LOPEZ,start_answer
330,1273,48,14,They do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

334,1281,48,22,I have one last question.,side_chat,MR. LOVEALL,start_question
335,1286,49,1,"At any point after the accident, did you go in front of the truck further down the road from where your car was?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
336,1289,49,4,"I have seen pictures afterwards, but during the accident, again, the only person I spoke with, I believe, from my recollection and my memory, was the police officer who told me that they were going to help my family out and escort us off out of our vehicle into another vehicle, and they got us off the road.  So I wasn't trying to walk around.  I wasn't trying to see anything.  I was pretty much in shock mode.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
337,1298,49,13,"So just to be clear, so you didn't actually go in front of the truck further down the road from where you were; is that right?",q,MR. LOVEALL,start_answer
338,1301,49,16,I didn't have any means of making it down that way nor did I have -- yes.  Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

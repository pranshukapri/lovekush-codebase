5,154,6,13,How long have you been a doctor?,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
6,155,6,14,I graduated medical school in 1981.  I received my certificate at that time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,157,6,16,You said DO.  What is your specialty?,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
8,158,6,17,I practice in the areas of orthopedics and pain management.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

11,165,6,24,What is a curriculum vitae?,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
12,167,7,1,"It's basically a resum√©.  It has my background, training and participation in activities as a physician both in the internship and residency program and as a treating individual, having started my practice 1986 and thereafter. It contains my board certifications, certificates and fellowships that I hold, some teaching affiliations that I have, subspecialty rotations and some of the courses that I've participated, appointments I've had and some editorial activities, as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,180,7,14,Is Yarus-1 accurate and up to date?,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer

15,182,7,16,I'm going to ask you to refer to it as needed as we go through your qualifications. Can you tell us a little bit about your educational background.,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
16,186,7,20,"I graduated medical school in 1981. After that, I did what's known as a one-year rotating internship.  You go through all the subspecialty areas in medicine, family practice, and you actually get the opportunity to see individuals in the hospital setting, work with various types of physicians in subspecialty areas. After that, I started my orthopedic residency, which is specific to the subspecialty of orthopedic surgery, and that was a four-year program.  I completed that as chief resident in 1986.  At that point, I started my practice.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,201,8,10,Can you tell us about your professional experience.,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
18,203,8,12,"As far as what I do on a daily basis, I operated on individuals for over 30 years, provided conservative care for injuries and some disease states that have to do with joints, particularly where they wear out and you have to address that.  I took call in the emergency room for that amount of time and also treated individuals in the office setting. In the early 1990s, I started doing more formalized pain management, particularly injecting more areas of the body in the spinal column and joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments and nerves and doing that kind of work along with the individuals who have not only metabolic diseases again but injuries, as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,221,9,5,"This seems like a silly question, but I have to ask. Are you licensed to practice medicine in the state of Pennsylvania?",q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer

23,230,9,14,Can you tell the jury what you're board certified in and what it means to be board certified.,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
24,233,9,17,"I have two certificates that designate me as being board certified.  There are three recognized boards in orthopedic surgery.  I'm certified by one of them. The process to get there entailed, in the first certificate, three years of taking tests and the last year actually being observed doing surgery in the operating room by two board certified individuals.  I reviewed records in the hospital and office setting.  That was all compiled, and I received my first certificate in 1989. The process after that is just to take written tests, and I did that successfully three times to the current time.  I hold a certificate that still designates me as an orthopedic surgeon. I stopped doing surgery in 2013.  I still see individuals because of the pain management side of treatment who have injuries, so it goes hand in hand, so to speak. Basically, for pain management, I do interventional techniques, injecting individuals and also treating and designing programs for people who require therapy and also modalities, such as medications, as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,262,10,21,"You've already touched on this a little bit, but can you please describe for us in a little more detail your current orthopedic practice. What do you do on a day-to-day basis?",q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
26,268,11,2,"On a day-to-day basis, I see people who have injuries, metabolic diseases that are pain oriented.  Again, I see individuals who have issues with all types of injuries that occur for various reasons, such as motor vehicle accidents, trip and slip-and-falls, people who have Workers' Compensation injuries and those individuals who have sports injuries, as well. My role is to still figure out what's going on and design, as I said, a program for treatment.  A lot of times people are in therapy.  I'll go one step further and ask if they want to treat with other options that I have available, particularly with medications and injections.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

38,303,12,12,"Absolutely.  I've taken courses to learn how to interpret, but I'm not the person who puts out the report that has to do with the study itself. I certainly have to be able to discern the morphology, which means what's on that study and what significance it has to the person that has the study done for whatever reason, particularly injuries that are sustained.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Also, on the scenes, we have to determine whether there is a crime along with the detectives who are out on the scene when there is a gunshot wound and those kinds of findings. All of that comes under forensics, and we rely on forensic pathologists to do the ultimate evaluation of the individual in their lab.

First, the general comment I'd like to make is this objection is being made because counsel made a similar objection at the time of Dr. Fras' deposition, his trial deposition. I believe it to be a frivolous objection.  However, I wanted to reserve my right to argue it in this context, if necessary. The objection being that, given that the doctor has conceded that he is not an accident reconstructionist, that he cannot render a conclusion as to what injuries were sustained during this accident because that would require his ability to understand how the body would operate or change or be affected in a fall or whatever Mr. Mularczyk is claiming happened as a mechanism in his accident.

124,568,23,2,"Fr. Mularczyk injured two areas of the body.  One is the low back.  We call that the lumbar spine. The other is the right shoulder. I broke down the types of injuries that were sustained into soft tissue injuries.  Then we'll talk about the discs in relation to the nerves that come out and supply motor and sensory functions. For the low back, he had a strain and sprain; a term I use, lumbar myositis, which is a covering of the muscles, which was inflamed.  I actually used an osteopathic term, that is somatic dysfunction.  It just means that, because the muscles, tendons, and ligaments are injured, the motion and function of the lumbar spine becomes altered. I also used a term called enthesopathy.  The enthesis -- and I'll show this on a model in a couple seconds here -- is the area of bone in the spine where these ligaments and tendons attach so that we can get motion and stability of the spine. Going to the discs, at L3-4 and L4-5 -- we designate the levels by two vertebrae and the disc is in the middle -- those had protrusions.  At 4-5, there was sequestration of the disc fragment that was going caudally to the left of the midline with encroachment. Breaking down all those terms, basically the disc came out of its containment area.  If we think about a jelly doughnut, putting pressure on the doughnut and the jelly coming out, this jelly actually goes away from the doughnut and it starts to go toward the top part of the vertebral body, which is called -- I'm sorry, caudad is lower; it goes down below.  Cephalad would be the upper.  Caudad is low, my apologies. Anyway, the disc went down away from the level where it would usually be situated.  At L5-S1, there was also a protrusion, as well.  This was going to the left. All these discs from 3-4, 5-S1, which stands for sacrum, that's the next bone below the last vertebrae in the spinal column, they were going left. The radiculopathy on the left comes from pressure on the nerve from the discs.  This was identified clinically at L4-5 and L5-S1 by my examination. In regard to the right shoulder, there was a contusion.  Then there was an MRI that was done, and it showed one of the four tendons of the rotator cuff to be torn. That's called the supraspinatus. Lastly, I said that Fr. Mularczyk had chronic pain secondary to the incident of April 19, 2018 and also a decrease in the activities in which he participated secondary to that incident, as well.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

128,639,25,23,"I believe the disc injuries as well as the tear in the rotator cuff, supraspinatus tendon, to be the most serious.  The soft tissue injuries are certainly permanent in nature.  They're higher grade, but I will classify those below those injuries that are disc oriented and the shoulder injury involving the actual structure that's part of the cuff.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,649,26,8,Do you have an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty whether any of these injuries that you just discussed pertaining to the accident that brings us here today are permanent?,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
130,654,26,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,655,26,14,Which ones?,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
132,656,26,15,"Well, if we talk about soft tissue injuries, a lot of times sprains and strains and muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries will go away if they're low grade.  So we grade them up to a Roman numeral 4.  These are fours.  So what happens in the collagen fibers of the muscle particularly is it scars.  That's permanent.  It's not going to go away. In regard to the discs, the discs are out of their containment fibers.  They're pressing on the nerve, so that creates the radicular pain, the reproduction of that symptom and finding. Irrespective of what you do to correct that, even up to and including surgery, the effects of surgery are still there.  Some of the known effects of surgery, such as scarring particularly, will still be there, so it's permanent, as well. You may be able to help the person and improve their situation by doing it, but the effects are still there.  So I will classify that as permanent, as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,681,27,15,Let's talk about some of the terms that you used in discussing the injuries that Fr. Mularczyk received as a result of this subsequent. Let's start with the lumbar spine.,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
134,686,27,20,"In order to understand what I was talking about, this is a representation of the lumbar spine.  It contains four vertebral bodies.  There is actually five in total, but the concept is that each vertebral body has a disc in between.  We'll number them 4, 5, et cetera. What happens with the disc is that it's surrounded by containment fibers.  I mentioned that.  They're called annular fibers.  They have nerves in them, and they will send the signals that there is pain. When the disc comes out, this is what it looks like, and the nerves are right behind that supply motor and sensory functions to the extremities.  If disc is coming out at one level or more than one level, it will have an affect of the extremities at various levels, particularly for the sensory component of the nerve that supplies that function.  That's the front part of the person. As we keep turning, we see holes where these nerves come out.  At each level on the right and left, the main nerves -- I'll call them main nerves because there's other nerves we're going to talk about -- they come out and supply that sensory and motor function. As we keep turning, we're now at the back of the person.  This is the bone you can feel at the center of your back and all the way up to your neck.  This is true of the whole spinal column. There are motion segments here.  I'm putting the needle in the left side.  This will be the right side for that level.  These are called facets.  They are actually joints. This is where motion occurs. I mentioned the enthesis or enthesopathy, where I'm putting the needles where the ligaments attach, another smaller structure that help move the spine at these areas. One other thing to mention because we're going to talk about treatment, there are small nerves, where I'm putting the needle, situated under the facets.  These are called medial branch nerves.  They're the nerves that send the pain signal to the brain when there is injury at these levels.  We can knock out those nerves by burning them.  The reason we can do that -- not the main nerves, but these little nerves -- is because they will regenerate or come back. We can give the person pain relief by doing that particular procedure, which is called a rhizotomy or ablation.  That's the anatomy of the low back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,747,30,6,"Can you explain to us -- you used the word protrusion, I believe?",q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
136,749,30,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,750,30,9,What is a protrusion?,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
138,751,30,10,"There are three faces of disc that can come out of the containment fibers.  The first is a bulge.  Sometimes bulging is normal because the disc is designed to absorb forces, but when it comes out, that's the first type.  I have a model for that one, too. What it looks like is basically just coming out a little bit.  The next phase would be a protrusion, which is what we're talking about here for Fr. Mularczyk, and then a herniation, which is totally a disc that's out. Fr. Mularczyk has a disc that actually came out and then went downward as far as where it ended up being situated.  Once that disc comes out, the nerve is right there, and when it sits up on a nerve or compresses it, that's when you get radicular symptoms. When we talk about radiculopathy, it's coming from this mechanical phenomena of the disc itself sitting up on the nerve, as I like to say.

146,785,31,19,"Radiculopathy is a person complaining of radiating symptoms in an extremity; in this case, the lower extremities.  That comes from the disc sitting up on the nerve.  Once the nerve is compressed, it doesn't fire correctly. When I examined Fr. Mularczyk, he had reproduction of radiating symptoms, so I gave clinical diagnosis.  We don't have any testing to show that.  There is electrical evaluation that can be done.

152,806,32,15,"Yeah, I can.  This is a representation of a right shoulder.  We're talking about the right for Fr. Mularczyk.  What I'm showing here is the bone that we call the humerus. This is the square bone you can feel on the outside of your shoulder.  This comes off of the wing bone, that's the scapula. That particular part of it that we can feel here is the acromion.  The acromion is acutely related to the collar bone or the clavicle.  There are ligaments that span those two bones to stabilize them, all these three ligaments here. This is the first tendon of the rotator cuff that attaches into the outside of the humerus bone.  That's called the supraspinatus.  There is three others in the whole cuff.  It spells the words, sits, SITS. This is the one that Fr. Mularczyk had a tear in from the incident, and this is the one that's most typically torn.  It sits right underneath that square bone.  As the shoulder moves upward, when there is a tear, it's going to cause pain because it's going to get crimped between the head of the bone of the humerus and the undersurface of the acromion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

That was the last part of my conclusions; that he had a diminution or decrease in his ability to function, not only the low back, but from the shoulder itself.

He did tell me that the injections helped somewhat.  He had had pain in the shoulder that was still present.  Then I asked him particularly how he was feeling, and he told me that his pain level was 6 out of 10 on what we call the analog scale.  That includes the low back and the right shoulder. The pain was at its worst then.  When resting or not performing activities, 1 to 2 out of 10.  He had radiating pain to both lower extremities.  That's the radicular component we were talking about.

He did have the two prior low back issues; one in 2010 without injury.  2012 he had spinal stenosis, which is a term that just means arthritis, and that was causing difficulty for him, and he had surgery for that, which improved him. He said he had minimal residuals up to and including the incident of April 19, 2019.

186,979,39,13,Can you walk the jury through your examination.,q,MS. MCCARTHY,start_answer
187,981,39,15,"Yes.  I did a complete full exam, but I'll stick to the areas of chief complaint. He was 6-foot-2-inches tall, 240 pounds.  From the low back, he had a loss of lordosis.  This is a manifestation of what happens when muscles, tendons, and ligaments and those soft tissues are injured.  The natural curve that we see in the low back becomes flattened.  I observed that. In touching the muscles, he had hypertonicity from L3-4 to L5-S1.  Left greater than right.  I did what's called a sitting root and straight leg raising sign. There is various degrees of raising in terms of looking at the number of degrees. His left showed 15 and 15.  Right was positive as well at 20 and 25 degrees.  That just means, when I lifted, he had reproduction of his root signs.  That's where I got the radiculopathy diagnosis from. His motion of the spine was 40 percent of normal, and that includes going forward, backward, side to side, and rotating.  There were no cord signs.  We call those long-tract signs.  Those were not evident, so his spinal cord was fine.  The vasculature in his extremities was okay, so we didn't have any issues there. The next thing I did is reflex testing.  This is the most important thing as far as examination because when there is abnormality, as there was here, it reflects back up to the spine.  By that I mean those levels that I showed, those nerves that come out, those are the ones that will show me or anybody doing this test whether or not there is a particular problem at a particular level. We do the kneecap reflexes, and those were okay, so that covers L3-4.  Then we did the extensor hallucis.  There is no tap reflex for L4-5, so we ask the person to lift the great toe.  There was a left deficit 4 out of 5.  The right was okay at 5 out of 5. The last one we do is the Achilles reflex.  That reflects to L5-S1.  The right was 2 out of 3, that's abnormal.  The left was 1 out of 3. Next, I test that sensory component of the radiculopathy by doing pinpricking down along the back all the way down the extremity.  There are bands that will correspond to the level.  When there is a deficit or the person tells me they can't feel it as well as they did upper or lower or side to side, comparing right or left, it's abnormal.  For Fr. Mularczyk, it was abnormal on the left at L4-5; abnormal at L5-S1 for both the right and left. Next, I did the extremity examination. No edema.  No other abnormalities or painful masses.  Neck area was okay.  He had had surgery for the shoulder, so I would say that the shoulder was improved after that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

191,1052,42,11,"For the low back particularly, because that was the focus here, there is abnormalities on a lot of levels.  When we look at the soft tissue.  That was abnormal. That corresponds to my diagnosis for that area in the low back. Then the motion was deficient, so that comes along again with the soft tissue injury.  Looking at the reflexes, those are abnormal.  I said they're the most important because when you have protrusions, going back to that explanation and discussion, those protrusions are discs sitting up on the nerves.  The nerves become affected, and then we have abnormal reflexes as a result of that. That's what I was talking about when I gave those numbers 1 out of 3, 2 out of 3.

I'll tell you that what the radiologist read was pretty accurate as far as my interpretation on my own.  I agreed pretty much with what was seen as abnormal, particularly on both of those studies. For the right shoulder, an actual tear in the supraspinatus tendon, which was partial thickness.  No evidence of inflammation in the bursal sacs that are situated between the bones.  The glenoid labrum, which is a lip that surrounds the socket where the head rides, that was okay. The biceps tendon was okay.  Some arthritic changes in the AC joint.  We see that all the time.  That wasn't an issue for Fr. Mularczyk.  It was just an incidental finding. For the low back, just to make it simple, the three discs that were protruding that I saw and one other one that the radiologist indicated; L2-3 showed a protrusion on the left.  I don't think that's an issue clinically.  I'll acknowledge that it's there, but I don't think it's causing the symptomatology that the other three are. I agreed there, and basically those discs are going to the left.

233,1274,51,8,"I talked about interventional care for the low back, and that includes the burning of the small nerves that knocks out the pain. Certainly, there are epidurals similar to what Dr. Levinstein did.  You can repeat those in a series of three at six-month intervals.  Lastly, operating on those areas where the discs are out, to take out the disc and relieve the nerve of its compression. For the shoulder, I talked about arthroscopy, which is a procedure that he had done.  Because these areas scar as a way of healing, you can't get back what was originally there.  It's not like the skin. If you cut skin, skin will repair itself, maybe with some help of suturing perhaps. But if you suture or you address the tear in the cuff, the only way the body has to heal it is by scar.  That's why I said it's a permanent injury.  You still have to go back in and clean it up, which will give the person better range of motion. I talked about therapy after any of these procedures are done.  That's for a short period of time.  I talked about various types of medications that can be used, including pain medication, anti-inflammatories.  There are more sophisticated medications that address the nerves.

316,1536,61,20,"Doctor, when you assigned those specific levels, is it because you saw something traumatic on the MRI film that caused you to render that conclusion?",q,MR. RONG,start_answer
317,1540,61,24,"No, not at all.  You don't really look at morphology on an MRI and characterize traumatic versus atraumatic etiology.  The only thing you can describe is what it appears to show from your perspective.  As I said, I agreed with the radiologist. Interesting, there is no postoperative findings, such as laminectomy or a bone that was removed or anything that would indicate surgery.  I'm not sure that there was a particular surgical procedure.  I haven't seen any records, but this MRI didn't show any post-op changes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
318,1554,62,13,"Doctor, a moment ago, you were shown Exhibit-4, which is a report from Dr. Rosin. In that report, he also comments on the MRI taken April 23, 2018.

323,1571,63,5,"Yes.  I don't think there were very many findings, so I didn't elaborate.  He had had surgery, so I think it was successful from the standpoint of the function of the shoulder.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,1576,63,10,"Doctor, is it your opinion that Fr. Mularczyk sustained a partial thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon in the right shoulder as a result of this accident?",q,MR. RONG,start_answer
325,1580,63,14,"I believe that to be true, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

332,1596,64,5,There is also no hemorrhaging or bleeding that was noted on the MRI?,q,MR. RONG,start_answer
333,1598,64,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,1599,64,8,"Doctor, given those lack of signs, would you agree with me that partial tears of the supraspinatus tendon are generally not associated with traumatic changes but rather in the context of chronic wear on the tendons of the shoulder?",q,MR. RONG,start_answer
335,1605,64,14,"No, that precept is ill-founded.  In fact, we don't see those kind of things because the tendon itself has a terrible blood supply.  Bleeding will come from muscle, if it's injured.  This was actually a tendon of the cuff.  So I wouldn't expect to see those particular changes, and not everything that's torn has edema or swelling associated with it. The concept that it comes from other than trauma is again, with all due respect to you, ill-founded.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,1618,65,2,"Doctor, would you agree that partial tears can result from the AC joint becoming arthritic and bone spurs eroding the rotator cuff tendon?",q,MR. RONG,start_answer

If the muscle -- at the junction of the tendon, muscle becomes tendon, tendon inserts some bone.  When that occurs, you may see some bleeding.  But after a month, the body has an amazing ability to shut that down. Any bleeding that occurs in the muscle itself will stop just from coagulation standpoint.

732,1506,74,24,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
733,1508,75,1,"Then you would need, obviously, a block and tackle or a chain fall to hoist the engine up. You didn't just pick the engine up.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
734,1511,75,4,That's not something you just kind of grab and pull out?  Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
735,1513,75,6,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

741,1523,75,16,Those were preformed gaskets.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
742,1524,75,17,"You talked about with the exhaust when you had to use a hammer and a chisel to remove that older gasket.  When you were removing the one between the transmission and the engine, did you have to do that same thing, or did that just come right off?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
743,1529,75,22,No.  You had to -- you had to scrape.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
744,1530,75,23,"Okay.  And the gasket is essentially kind of creating a seal between the engine and the transmission, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
745,1534,76,2,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
746,1535,76,3,We've got kind of two pieces of metal that come together?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

749,1540,76,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
750,1541,76,9,"So if you're removing that gasket from either one of the metal portions where they meet, you want to do that carefully because you don't want to kind of, you know, gouge any of the metal on either the engine or the transmission; is that fair to say?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
751,1546,76,14,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
752,1547,76,15,"Okay.  Because when you put the new one in, again, you want that nice, tight seal?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
753,1549,76,17,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
754,1550,76,18,Okay.  So you would have to remove the old gasket.  How long does that process take?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

756,1553,76,21,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
757,1554,76,22,"It wasn't that big, and it was in the open.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
758,1556,76,24,"Gotcha.  And the tools that you would use, you talked about a hammer and a chisel for the muffler.  What about, what kind of tools would you use --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
759,1561,77,4,Mostly a chisel just for scraping.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
760,1562,77,5,Uh-huh.  Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
761,1563,77,6,Because you didn't want to gouge the metal --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

763,1566,77,9,-- in any means.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

785,1602,78,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

787,1605,78,23,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
788,1606,78,24,"And with respect to the brake work, you just went through how you did the brake job on the old Ford.  Was that also something that you learned through your father?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
789,1611,79,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
790,1612,79,5,"All right.  So he would have been doing brake work when you were a younger child, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

795,1621,79,14,Farm equipment.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1914,3635,160,3,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1915,3636,160,4,Is the life of one of these about the same?  So maybe another 20 years?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

1925,3655,160,23,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1926,3656,160,24,And that's why the third one -- I wasn't going to put the second one back in again.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2260,4330,187,23,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2261,4331,187,24,"From there, they took and opened up the negatives so they could set these negatives on a plate, and pulled the vacuum so they could -- it would burn the negative right into the plate or the image.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2262,4337,188,5,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

2272,4358,189,1,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2273,4359,189,2,"Then from there, they would turn sheets over and cut out -- when I say ""cut out,"" the image area of the negative.  So then they could put that on a plate and burn it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2274,4363,189,6,Okay.  Were you responsible --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2275,4364,189,7,And expose it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2277,4367,189,10,No.  No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2279,4371,189,14,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2280,4372,189,15,"So your involvement, at this stage anyway, was simply -- and not to minimize it -- but simply to kind of lay these negatives out in whatever order they told you to and tape them down?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2281,4376,189,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2282,4377,189,20,How long were you a stripper for Murray Printing?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

2303,4417,191,10,I didn't operate any.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2319,4444,192,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2326,4458,193,1,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2327,4459,193,2,"So when it was exposed with light, they wouldn't spread out or anything.  They would be as close to an exact duplicate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2335,4476,193,19,"-- that you had, and if you had a half a dozen, well, you'd -- when you were all said and done, you took the half a dozen, and in my case where I was at, you take them down back and put them on a shelf, and the girls would take them from there, and they would cut the golden rod out around the image area.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2567,4924,211,17,"When you talk about having to readjust, what type of work had to be done to readjust a system?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2568,4927,211,20,"Basically, it's like anything.  Whether it's brake shoes in a car or -- they wear down.  If they wear down, you've got more space.  You've got to take up that space and readjust the gap to -- if that space gets too big, it won't operate properly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2569,4933,212,1,And how did you learn how to -- maybe we'll talk about the braking system.  How did you learn how to perform this yearly maintenance work?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2570,4936,212,4,Manual.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2571,4937,212,5,"Okay.  And as between the four presses in the pressroom, did you have to perform this yearly maintenance on all of them?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2572,4940,212,8,"The die cutter took very little because that was an older machine, and there was a lot of mechanics involved.  Obviously, they did have a brake system, but it didn't take as much maintenance.  It ran much slower and didn't wear out the pads, so it took a lot less.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2573,4946,212,14,"As part of the work on your maintenance, would you ever remove and replace the pads, or were they -- or was there just an adjustment?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2574,4949,212,17,Just adjustments.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2575,4950,212,18,"Okay.  The hour that you talked about that it would roughly take to do the maintenance, is that for the braking system and the clutching system?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2576,4953,212,21,"You'd do one or the other, and that's to do one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2577,4955,212,23,"And would you do, like, the braking system one year and the clutching system the next year, or would you do them both within one year?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2578,4959,213,2,No.  You'd do them separate times.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2579,4960,213,3,"Okay.  Again, because you don't want the system down that long?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2580,4962,213,5,"Well, basically, they didn't both need work or repair at the same time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2581,4964,213,7,"Do you differentiate maintenance versus repair?  Like, In other words, I know the maintenance, you need, for example, you talk about having to once a year clean out the systems of the presses.  I consider that to be maintenance because it's something you're going to do at a scheduled time, for example.  ""Repair"" means if something breaks.  Did you ever perform any sort of repairs on any of these presses?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2582,4973,213,16,"Most of them were repairs, meaning the system was giving you trouble --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2583,4975,213,18,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2584,4976,213,19,-- and you knew you were going to have to do it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2585,4978,213,21,"Okay.  So when you did a repair, is that different at all from a maintenance?  I mean, in other words --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2586,4981,213,24,"No, not really.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2587,4983,214,1,"So if the machine is giving you trouble, it's generally kind of take it apart, clean it up, lubricate it, whatever adjustments you might need, and put it back together?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2588,4987,214,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2589,4988,214,6,"Okay.  And those were done, again, maintenance-wise once a year, and then on an as-needed basis, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2590,4991,214,9,I'm saying the year as a rough estimate.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2591,4992,214,10,Gotcha.  Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2592,4993,214,11,It was not you did it every December 1st --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2593,4995,214,13,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2594,4996,214,14,-- type of situation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2595,4997,214,15,Okay.  And it would only happen if the machine was acting up?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2596,4999,214,17,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2597,5000,214,18,Gotcha.  And the only time you would be doing it is if someone else in the pressroom couldn't get to it?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2598,5003,214,21,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2599,5004,214,22,Okay.  Do you recall the names of any of the other folks that worked in the pressroom?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2600,5006,214,24,"Obviously, there was Bob Godfrey.  Richard Cushing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2601,5009,215,2,Are either one of those gentlemen alive?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2602,5010,215,3,I think both of them are.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2603,5011,215,4,Okay.  Do you know where they live?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2604,5012,215,5,"Lunenburg, Rick Cushing.  Bob Godfrey, he's moved on to other companies.  So he used to live in Shirley, but I know he doesn't anymore.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2605,5015,215,8,Do you ever keep in touch with either one of these guys?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2606,5017,215,10,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2607,5018,215,11,"Other than the work that you just described on the machinery in the pressroom, do you have a memory of personally performing any other type of maintenance or repairs on those pieces of machinery during your time there from '73 to what, '85?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2608,5024,215,17,Not those.  I did some work in the bindery.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2609,5026,215,19,"Okay.  Well, I'm kind of going down the system, right.",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2610,5028,215,21,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2611,5029,215,22,"So kind of the way we're making a brochure, we're going to prep it?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2612,5031,215,24,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2613,5033,216,1,We're going to press it?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2614,5034,216,2,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2615,5035,216,3,"And then, actually, my wife, when she was in high school, worked in a bindery.  Because I know that's kind of like the end process of putting it all together.  What types of machinery was in the bindery?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2616,5040,216,8,"They had a Rosback.  They had a Stahlfolder.  They had a Baumfolder.  They had a Challenge drill, three-hole.  And they had shrink-wrap equipment.  Pretty -- oh, a paper cutter.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2617,5044,216,12,"Right.  It's kind of hard to bind it without it.  And there were certain employees, kind of like with the prep area and with the press area, that were assigned specifically to the bindery?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2618,5048,216,16,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2619,5049,216,17,"And, again, you'd be called in if there was something going on in the bindery that needed your assistance?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2620,5052,216,20,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2621,5053,216,21,Did you operate any of these particular pieces of machinery?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2622,5055,216,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2623,5056,216,24,"Okay.  And was there any one of them that you operated more than the other, or at some juncture you might operate all of them?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2624,5060,217,3,Wherever it was needed.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2625,5061,217,4,Gotcha.  Okay.  Did you ever have to conduct any sort of -- we talked about this maintenance and repair work that might be done in the pressroom.  Did you ever perform any of that type of work in the bindery?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2626,5066,217,9,Yes.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2627,5067,217,10,"And what type of work, and on what pieces of equipment?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2628,5069,217,12,"Basically, the folders had filters, which the filters had to be cleaned because it would pick up dust from the paper that it would run through.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2629,5072,217,15,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2630,5073,217,16,"So -- and then the same with the Rosback, it had filters that you had to clean.  Rosback had a three-knife trimmer that you had to change the blades every once in a while and readjust them.  And then also the larger paper cutter, you had to change that blade almost on a monthly basis depending on how much use it got.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2631,5080,217,23,Right.  Do you know who manufactured the paper cutter?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2632,5083,218,1,"Heidelberg.  I can't think of the -- the brand name.  I can't think of it, but it was -- that was made by Heidelberg.  I know that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2633,5086,218,4,"And this particular paper cutter, your involvement in terms of maintenance and repair would essentially have been to change out the blades as needed, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2634,5090,218,8,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2635,5091,218,9,Okay.  And you talked about Rosback?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2636,5092,218,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2637,5093,218,11,"All right.  Again, my wife might know this.  I don't know exactly.  What is a Rosback?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2638,5095,218,13,"Basically, that would take the signatures. It would gather the signatures.  It would stitch the book, and then it would go through a three-knife trimmer.  So at the end of the Rosback, you would come out with a finished product.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2639,5100,218,18,Okay.  Do you know who manufactured the Rosback?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2640,5102,218,20,"That was -- that was -- I know that was United States, but I don't know who manufactured it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2644,5112,219,5,"Right.  Like, Heidelberg, you know, that's Germany.  I know the Rosback was United States.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2645,5114,219,7,Okay.  But the only work that you would have done in terms of on that machinery is to clean out those -- the filters?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2646,5117,219,10,"The filters, and you would have to change those blades as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2647,5119,219,12,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2648,5120,219,13,Those were small blades.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2649,5121,219,14,Do you know who made the blades that you had to swap out?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2650,5123,219,16,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2651,5124,219,17,"You talked about Baumfolders and Stahlfolders, and the work that you did involving those in terms of the maintenance would have been, again, cleaning out the filters, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2652,5128,219,21,Correct.  Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2653,5129,219,22,I guess what kind of filters were they? How big were they?  What did they look like?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2654,5131,219,24,They were basically a canister filter.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2655,5133,220,1,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2656,5134,220,2,I don't know if you'd know what the size of a spray paint can.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2657,5136,220,4,Sure.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2658,5137,220,5,"Like, a quart.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2659,5138,220,6,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2660,5139,220,7,"It had a filter in it, and that was also attached to the vacuum hose.  You know, as the vacuum sucked the air through, it went through the filter and cleaned the air and blew it up.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2661,5143,220,11,Gotcha.  And so part of the maintenance would be to remove those filters and replace them with new ones?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2662,5146,220,14,"Basically, just take the air because we have the hose with compressed air, and we'd blow those filters out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2663,5149,220,17,Gotcha.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2664,5150,220,18,"So they got used many, many times.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2665,5151,220,19,"Okay.  What -- I know you mentioned the company made a lot of colored brochures, but do you have a memory of the types of paper that these brochures were printed on and where they got their paper from?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2666,5156,220,24,The Mead Paper Company.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2667,5158,221,1,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2668,5159,221,2,"It's been so long, but they -- Mead was one of the big ones, and there's been so many paper companies that have gone out, I really don't.  But Mead, you know, rings a bell, and we used a lot of that product.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2669,5164,221,7,"The Stahlfolder and Baumfolder, do you know who manufactured the Stahlfolder?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2670,5166,221,9,"No.  The Stahl -- actually, I think Heidelberg did, but I'm not a hundred percent sure on that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2671,5169,221,12,Right.  Okay.  And what about the Baumfolder?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2672,5171,221,14,I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2673,5172,221,15,"Okay.  And, again, with either one of these folders, though, your only real involvement in terms of any sort of maintenance would be to use the air to clean out those filters?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2674,5176,221,19,"Clean out the filters with a -- obviously, you had some grease fittings and some oil fittings or routine maintenance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2675,5179,221,22,"Okay.  Were there ever times that you would perform, or did you perform any sort of more sophisticated repairs on any of these pieces of machinery in the bindery?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2676,5184,222,2,"Yes.  On the Stahlfolder, it was replacing the rollers because you had a series of rollers that made the fold in the paper, and depending -- you had up to four racks, meaning you could make four folds, and you had three different sections of rollers like that.  Each one would have -- on that particular floor, four racks on each system.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2677,5191,222,9,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2678,5192,222,10,"And, yes, I -- in other words, that's rebuild.  You buy new rollers.  It comes with new bushings, bearings, and the whole shebang to put in a whole set of new rollers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2679,5196,222,14,What are the rollers made of?  What type of material?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2680,5198,222,16,Steel and a fiber.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2681,5199,222,17,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2682,5200,222,18,I don't know what the fiber was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2683,5201,222,19,"And the fiber, where was this located?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2684,5202,222,20,"In between.  They were, like, sleeves to hold the paper and keep it from sliding one way or the other.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2685,5205,222,23,Gotcha.  Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2686,5206,222,24,So it took the sheet of paper and held it square so your fold didn't come out over the place.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2687,5209,223,2,"So you had steel rollers with, like, this type of fiber just on the outside, thin, to just kind of make -- hold the sheet of paper in place?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2688,5212,223,5,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2689,5213,223,6,"Okay.  And when you were replacing the old rollers, does it come out as one complete unit, the roller itself?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2690,5216,223,9,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2691,5217,223,10,How does it come out?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2692,5218,223,11,They came out single rollers.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2693,5219,223,12,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2694,5220,223,13,"There was bushings that held the rollers in, and they would slide out either one side or the other depending on the folder.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2695,5223,223,16,"All right.  So you'd remove the old roller, throw them away?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2696,5225,223,18,Yup.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2697,5226,223,19,And then you'd take the new rollers and just basically slide it right back on?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2698,5228,223,21,"After you put in your new bushings and whether it was bushings, bearings, and some of them were actually wood.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2699,5231,223,24,"Oh, really?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2700,5233,224,1,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2701,5234,224,2,"Okay.  But was this more kind of a maintenance thing, again, when they would kind of wear out?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2702,5237,224,5,"Yeah, they wear out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2703,5238,224,6,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2704,5239,224,7,But it was -- they last years.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2705,5240,224,8,Sure.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2706,5241,224,9,"So in other words, you were not doing this -- I only did it several times.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2707,5243,224,11,Okay.  Do you have any memory of being around anyone else doing any other type of maintenance or repairs other than what we've talked about in the bindery?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2708,5247,224,15,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2709,5248,224,16,"Okay.  The building itself, do you recall how that was heated?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2710,5250,224,18,Forced hot air.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2711,5251,224,19,Okay.  Was there any sort of insulated piping at all anywhere within the facility?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2712,5253,224,21,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2714,5258,225,1,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2715,5259,225,2,"Okay.  And as I understand, it looks like from your records here you worked there through '85. Does that sound about right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2716,5262,225,5,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2717,5263,225,6,Okay.  And why did you leave Hale -- Moore & Hale in 1985?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2718,5265,225,8,Because I seen the writing on the wall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2719,5266,225,9,Writing on the wall.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2720,5267,225,10,That was number one.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2721,5268,225,11,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2722,5269,225,12,"And the other reason is at that point in time, I was 40-something years old, and I realized that if I was ever going to do it, and the kids were just getting out of college, so it was either do it and go on my own, which I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2723,5274,225,17,"Okay.  Now, if you flip to the next page on your -- on Exhibit Number 1, you see up top there it says something blank Tech Graphics.  It looks you just did some -- maybe some part-time work in '80 and '81.  I can't make out what that -- it's something blank Tech Graphics.  Does that ring a bell there on Crawford Street in Fitchburg?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2724,5281,225,24,"Yeah, Crawford Street.  Yes.  I went to work there.  I was going to leave Hale & Moore Printing, and I could see that wasn't going to work out.  So I went back to Hale & Moore Printing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2725,5286,226,4,"Okay.  Yeah.  Because if you flip back to the Hale & Moore, in 1980, it looks like you only made about $7,000, and then in 1980 here at -- and what was the name of the company, because it looks like something was cut off?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2726,5291,226,9,"Yeah.  Well, there is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2732,5298,226,16,It was a funny situation.  They thought they were going to buy out Hale & Moore Printing Company.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2733,5301,226,19,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2734,5302,226,20,Or at that time it was The Hale Company.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2944,5645,240,13,A year or two.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2945,5646,240,14,"Okay.  And did the second one replace the KOMORI, or was it in addition to?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2946,5648,240,16,"Existing.  I mean, add.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2947,5649,240,17,Okay.  So now you had the two working simultaneously?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2948,5651,240,19,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2949,5652,240,20,Anything else that you've purchased since you moved over to Nashua Street?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2950,5654,240,22,"Yeah.  On this one -- yeah.  I made a large computer-to-plate where it did away with the camera, the stripping end of it.  There was no more negatives involved.  No more platemaking involved. It went directly from computer to plate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2951,5660,241,3,"Okay.  So you've kind of eliminated the prep work, so to say?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

2954,5667,241,10,Times go back.  I couldn't believe how long I did have it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2955,5669,241,12,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2956,5670,241,13,"Ten years at least, if not more.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2958,5672,241,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2959,5673,241,16,Okay.  Do you recall who manufactured that computer-to-plate?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2960,5675,241,18,No.  I can't even think of the trade -- the name on the thing.  I'm sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2961,5677,241,20,"That's okay.  So anything else that you have purchased in terms of equipment -- major pieces of equipment, aside from the presses that we had -- that you brought with you, the two color presses that you bought once you opened up in Nashua, and then the computer-to-plate piece of equipment, has there been anything else that MTC has purchased as part of major equipment for its printing industry?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2962,5686,242,4,"There was one more piece of equipment, which was a colored proofer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2963,5688,242,6,What does a colored proofer do?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2964,5689,242,7,It was made by Epson.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2965,5690,242,8,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2966,5691,242,9,"And it took a roll of material, and it would give you a colored proof of everything that was going to wind up being on the plate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2967,5694,242,12,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2968,5695,242,13,So it was a proofing system.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2969,5696,242,14,Do you recall when you purchased that?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2970,5697,242,15,That was just about in the same time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2983,5722,243,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2984,5723,243,16,"Okay.  We're just going to kind of wrap up for the day.  We're going to talk a -- finish up with the MTC Printing, and then we're going to call it a day and come back and finish with Groton Refrigeration on Thursday.",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2985,5728,243,21,That sounds good to me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2988,5734,244,2,We're sitting here with no windows.  I want to go back and ask you just about a couple of pieces of equipment that you first got for the Culley Street address of MTC.  One was -- was the Mealy press?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2989,5739,244,7,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2990,5740,244,8,"And, again, that was a used piece of equipment that you purchased for your new company. Did you yourself ever have to operate that piece of machinery?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2991,5744,244,12,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2992,5745,244,13,"Okay.  And what sort of operation would you be responsible for with that particular press? Like, in other words, how would you personally operate that?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2993,5749,244,17,"From start to finish.  In other words, my -- I only had one pressman.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2994,5751,244,19,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2995,5752,244,20,So he was out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2996,5753,244,21,Yup.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2997,5754,244,22,I had no choice.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2998,5755,244,23,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
2999,5756,244,24,"And I would have to do it from ground zero, set the press up.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3000,5759,245,2,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3001,5760,245,3,Adjust the ink fountains properly and do the actual printing of the piece.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3002,5762,245,5,"And, again, for someone who is not familiar with the process, just in general and briefly can you kind of describe what a pressman does?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3003,5766,245,9,"Well, basically, you -- first of all, you've got to put the paper in the press.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3004,5768,245,11,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3005,5769,245,12,"Then a press has what they call a blanket, and after every job you've got to clean that blanket because it's got residue on it from the job before. Then you would have to adjust the ink fountains to get the proper amount of ink in different areas. Where you've got real solids, you've got to open the fountain more.  Where you don't have too much coverage, you've got to cut the fountains down so there's very little ink going in that area.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3006,5778,245,21,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3007,5779,245,22,So that's a timely thing that you've got to get just right to wind up with the proper colors that you want.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3008,5783,246,1,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3009,5784,246,2,"Then it's a matter of making sure that you've got your plate on straight.  You've got to do -- depending on how difficult it is to how many tests you pulled because each test you run about 15, 20 sheets.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3010,5789,246,7,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3011,5790,246,8,You check your -- make sure your -- you've got the image on the sheet straight and there's no other mistakes that you can find.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3012,5793,246,11,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3013,5794,246,12,"And when you get that all said and done, you run the job.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3014,5796,246,14,"Okay.  And so, obviously, each job is going to be slightly different in terms of the amount of ink that is needed?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3015,5799,246,17,Every one is a different setting.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3016,5800,246,18,"Okay.  And then, like you said, you kind of make -- you do little test runs and adjustments are made here and there?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3017,5803,246,21,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3018,5804,246,22,And then once you've got it set exactly how you want it --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3019,5806,246,24,Then --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3020,5808,247,1,-- then you run the job?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3021,5809,247,2,Then you run the job.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3022,5810,247,3,Okay.  You mentioned there's this blanket inside the press itself?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3023,5812,247,5,"Basically, you've got to transfer the image from the plate --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3024,5814,247,7,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3025,5815,247,8,-- which is a positive form.  It goes to the blanket.  Now it's a negative form.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3026,5817,247,10,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3027,5818,247,11,"Now, it goes to the paper, and you're back to --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3028,5820,247,13,Back to positive?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3029,5821,247,14,-- positive.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3030,5822,247,15,What is this blanket made out of?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3031,5823,247,16,It's made out of a rubber material --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3032,5824,247,17,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3033,5825,247,18,"-- with a -- like, a canvas backing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3034,5826,247,19,"And between each job -- so if you do a different job, does that blanket have to come out and be cleaned?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3035,5829,247,22,No.  You wash it right on the press.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3036,5830,247,23,Gotcha.  And do you wash the rubber portion and the canvas portion?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3037,5833,248,1,"You wash the rubber portion of the blanket.  That's what accepts the ink, is the rubber portion of the blanket.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3038,5836,248,4,"And this canvas portion, do you know what that was made of?  The material?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3039,5838,248,6,All I know is it's canvas material.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3040,5839,248,7,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3041,5840,248,8,"It was just the backing, I guess, to hold the rubber.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3042,5842,248,10,Was this canvas material affixed to the rubber?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3043,5844,248,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3044,5845,248,13,And so did you ever have to change the rubber blankets?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3045,5847,248,15,No.  You changed -- it was all one piece.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3046,5848,248,16,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3047,5849,248,17,"In other words, when they manufactured it, somehow they bond.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3048,5851,248,19,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3049,5852,248,20,Which I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3050,5853,248,21,"And then during the course of the operation of this press, through wear and tear, would you ever have to put in a new rubber mat?  A new rubber blanket?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3051,5858,249,1,"A new rubber blanket, yes, you do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3052,5859,249,2,"And how -- what's the average life span, you know, barring, you know, it ripping or something like that, of a rubber blanket?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3053,5862,249,5,It's hard to say.  As long -- because every once in a while there would be a foreign object in the paper in between the paper --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3054,5865,249,8,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3055,5866,249,9,"-- which you would never see.  And once that ran through, it smashed the blanket.  We call it smash the blanket.  It made a low point in the blanket, and that would not accept the ink from the plate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3056,5871,249,14,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3057,5872,249,15,So naturally it wouldn't transfer to the paper.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3058,5874,249,17,"Right.  So any subsequent plates would have, like, some sort of hole, or there would be some sort of --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3059,5877,249,20,Yeah.  And then you'd have to change that blanket.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3060,5879,249,22,"Okay.  Okay.  In terms of maintenance or repairs on either one of the press that you brought -- well, when they were at Culley Street, did you ever personally do any sort of maintenance or repairs on either one of the presses that were there?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3061,5885,250,3,Yes.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3062,5886,250,4,"Okay.  What kind of -- and, again, I'm kind of differentiating between maintenance, which is, you know, kind of a yearly thing that you might need to make adjustments versus something broke. That would be a repair.",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3063,5891,250,9,"Culley Street, there wasn't that much because we were not there that long.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3064,5893,250,11,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3065,5894,250,12,You're looking at maybe a two-year span.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3066,5895,250,13,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3067,5896,250,14,So there was not a lot of maintenance done there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3068,5898,250,16,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3069,5899,250,17,"Other than your routine greasing and lubricating, that was about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3070,5901,250,19,"And is that something that you yourself performed, this greasing and lubrication of either one of these presses?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3071,5904,250,22,Usually not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3072,5905,250,23,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3073,5906,250,24,That would be done by the pressman.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3074,5908,251,1,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3075,5909,251,2,And that's something he would do when the next job wasn't ready.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3076,5911,251,4,"Gotcha.  The Baumfolder at -- while still at Culley Street, do you remember performing any sort of maintenance or repairs on that particular piece of equipment?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3077,5915,251,8,Not there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3078,5916,251,9,"Okay.  You're there at Culley Street for a couple of years, and then those three pieces of equipment, the two presses and the folder, come with you to the Nashua Street address, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3079,5920,251,13,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3080,5921,251,14,"All right.  And, again, there's just more room at Nashua Street.  So the prep room is a little bit -- there's a little bit more prep room.  There's a little bit more pressroom, and there's a little bit more bindery room, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3081,5926,251,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3082,5927,251,20,"Okay.  And so the two presses go into, obviously, the pressroom.  The folder goes into the new bindery, and at some point we also add in the two color presses, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3083,5931,251,24,Yup.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3084,5933,252,1,"Okay.  But while we're now at Nashua Street looking just at the two presses, the Mealy and the Heidelberg press, did you perform -- you yourself perform any kind of maintenance or repairs on those presses while they were at Nashua Street address?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3085,5938,252,6,At Nashua Street --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3086,5939,252,7,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3087,5940,252,8,-- yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3088,5941,252,9,"What kind -- and, again, do you differentiate repairs versus maintenance, or is it all kind of together in your mind?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3089,5944,252,12,It all sort of comes together.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3090,5945,252,13,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3091,5946,252,14,"As I say, what you call repairs and maintenance, usually you get to the point where you are having trouble, and then you would do -- you can say maintenance or repair.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3092,5950,252,18,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3093,5951,252,19,But we did not have a set list --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3094,5952,252,20,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3095,5953,252,21,-- of when certain things had to get done.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3096,5954,252,22,"Okay.  Was there ever an instance, for example, that either one of these presses might be operating just swimmingly, and you go, oh, it's been a couple years.  Let's make some adjustments.  Or was this just one of those, we're leaving it be unless something goes wrong?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3097,5961,253,4,"Most of it was leave it be, but -- yes, most of it was leave it be, and as long as it's working well --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3098,5964,253,7,Don't mess with it?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3099,5965,253,8,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3100,5966,253,9,"So if you were to conduct some sort of repairs, slash, maintenance on either one of these presses, what would that type of work entail?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3101,5969,253,12,The biggest part was the adjustment of the brakes and clutches because they got the most use.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3102,5971,253,14,"And when you say ""adjustment,"" what would you do to adjust the brakes and clutches of the presses?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3103,5974,253,17,"Basically, you would expose the clutch or brake depending on -- when I say ""expose,"" you take the jacket off the steel plate so you can get at the clutch or brake.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3104,5978,253,21,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3105,5979,253,22,"And you would blow them out with a compressed air hose, and you would lubricate them and readjust your either clutch or brake depending on which it was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3106,5984,254,2,"In terms of their location on these pieces of equipment, is the brake and clutch in the same area, or are they on different areas of the machines?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

3111,5995,254,13,That's where the clutch comes in and out all the time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3112,5997,254,15,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

3114,6000,254,18,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3115,6001,254,19,"Because, as I say, the thing is kicking in and out like a rachet type of situation, and there's one on both ends of the press.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3119,6009,255,2,"The brake, it goes to the main motor, and it's connected to the main motor because when you hit the stop switch, it shuts everything down.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3120,6012,255,5,Okay.  All right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3121,6013,255,6,So that's got to stop the whole press.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3122,6014,255,7,Okay.  And is there just one brake for the whole press?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3123,6016,255,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3124,6017,255,10,"And that's connected to the stop mechanism so if there's something going on that the operator of the press needs to stop the process, he or she will just hit a button, and the whole thing just ceases?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3125,6021,255,14,The whole thing shuts down.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3126,6022,255,15,"Okay.  And so if there was -- if you were having issues with the way that the paper was fed in or removed from the machine, that would be a clutch issue to work on?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3127,6026,255,19,"The clutch, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3128,6027,255,20,"Okay.  And if you were having trouble with the machine stopping, obviously, then that's the brake?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3129,6030,255,23,"That's the brake, and because that was not used like the two at the end of the press --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3130,6033,256,1,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3131,6034,256,2,-- and the feeding of it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3132,6035,256,3,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3133,6036,256,4,So you were not constantly dealing with that as much.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3134,6038,256,6,"That was going to be my question.  It seems to me that if anything, there was more movement of the machine versus stopping of the machine?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3135,6041,256,9,Right.  Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3136,6042,256,10,"Okay.  And in terms of the adjustments that you would have to make, whether it be to the clutch or the brakes of these machines, is -- what I'm hearing is essentially you take the jacket or the plate off to expose the particular component?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3137,6047,256,15,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3138,6048,256,16,You blow it out with air.  You might make some lubrication to it?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3139,6050,256,18,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3140,6051,256,19,And some sort of adjustments?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3141,6052,256,20,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3142,6053,256,21,And those adjustments -- where would those adjustments be made?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3143,6055,256,23,They would be made on the clutch.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3144,6056,256,24,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3145,6058,257,1,Usually to pull the clutch in closer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3146,6059,257,2,All right.  Was there ever an occasion when you had to remove or replace either the brakes or the clutches on either one of these machines?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3147,6062,257,5,We did not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3148,6063,257,6,"Okay.  So any work that you or anyone might have performed on these would have been these adjustments that you talked about, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3149,6066,257,9,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3150,6067,257,10,"Okay.  And, again, the only time that that work would have been done was if the machine was kind of acting up, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3151,6070,257,13,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3152,6071,257,14,All right.  And is it possible to give us an estimate on how often these adjustments had to be made?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3153,6074,257,17,All -- at least once a year.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3154,6075,257,18,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3155,6076,257,19,"As I say, we didn't have a particular time, but I think to answer your question, I'm going to say about a year.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3156,6079,257,22,All right.  And if the brake was operated less --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3157,6081,257,24,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3158,6083,258,1,-- would it be less than once a year for -- to work on the brake?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3159,6085,258,3,"Oh, yeah.  The brake, two years or better.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3160,6086,258,4,Okay.  So that might go for a while?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3161,6087,258,5,Yeah.  That was not a thing that you did that often.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3162,6089,258,7,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3163,6090,258,8,Put it that way.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3164,6091,258,9,"Okay.  Aside from that type of maintenance or repair on the presses, any other types of maintenance or repair that you recall performing on those pieces of equipment while they were at MTC?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3165,6095,258,13,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3166,6096,258,14,"Okay.  With respect to the folder, did you have to perform any sort of maintenance or repairs on the folder that was in the bindery?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3167,6099,258,17,"At MTC, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3168,6100,258,18,At MTC.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3169,6101,258,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3170,6102,258,20,What types of work was done to the Baumfolder?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3171,6104,258,22,I put in a new set of rollers.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3172,6105,258,23,Okay.  And those were kind of like those steel rollers we talked about?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3173,6108,259,1,Yeah.  Steel and rubber.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3174,6109,259,2,Yeah.  Were they -- okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3175,6110,259,3,A combination.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3176,6111,259,4,Did they have that felt covering?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3177,6112,259,5,"No, not a felt covering.  It was like a sleeve.  It was probably an inch and a half.  A groove was cut in the steel, and the rubber would be embedded into that groove.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3178,6116,259,9,"Okay.  And so the rubber would be what was then basically holding that paper square, straight?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3179,6118,259,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3180,6119,259,12,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3181,6120,259,13,The rubber actually stuck up just a little higher than the steel.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3182,6122,259,15,"Uh-huh.  Okay.  And other than changing out the rollers, then, on the folding machine -- on the folder, any other repairs or maintenance work you recall?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3183,6126,259,19,"Basically, it was just the routine filters that had to be cleaned out --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3184,6128,259,21,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3185,6129,259,22,-- occasionally.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3186,6130,259,23,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3187,6131,259,24,And --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3188,6133,260,1,Right.  We talked about that at the other place.  You kind of air them out?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3189,6135,260,3,Yes.  Yup.  Blow them out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3190,6136,260,4,"These -- the two color presses, the KOMORI and the Mitsubishi --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

3192,6140,260,8,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3193,6141,260,9,And one is a four-color.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3194,6142,260,10,"Right.  And I apologize if I asked.  When you bought these, you had already moved to Nashua Street; is that correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3195,6145,260,13,I already moved to Nashua Street.  That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3196,6147,260,15,And how long after you moved to Nashua Street would you think that you purchased the first of the two colors?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3197,6150,260,18,The first was a KOMORI.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3198,6151,260,19,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3199,6152,260,20,That was only several years afterwards. That was shortly after we moved.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3200,6154,260,22,"Okay.  So if you started your business in '85, you moved to Nashua Street in '87, '88 --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3201,6156,260,24,Yeah.  So you're looking close to 2000.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3202,6158,261,1,"Oh, okay.  Okay.  And then the Mitsubishi was purchased after that?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3203,6160,261,3,That was purchased after that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3204,6161,261,4,"Okay.  And then we had the colored proofer in about '06 and the computer-to-plate in about '07, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3205,6164,261,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3206,6165,261,8,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

3209,6170,261,13,That's -- yup.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3210,6171,261,14,All right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3211,6172,261,15,That's when I sold the business and closed the doors.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3212,6174,261,17,And were you still at Nashua Street when you closed the business?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3213,6176,261,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3214,6177,261,20,And is there any particular reason why in 2014 that you decided to close up shop?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3215,6179,261,22,"Basically, business in the commercial printing had changed so much, I was either going to have to invest in newer and more color proofing that replaced these presses, so I was just too old.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3216,6184,262,2,So did you wind up selling -- is the business still in existence?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3217,6186,262,4,What's that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3221,6192,262,10,I sold it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3222,6193,262,11,Okay.  And it was still operating at the time that you closed shop?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3223,6195,262,13,"It was operating at the time, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3224,6196,262,14,"It was good, solid equipment.  We're -- we're going to wrap up for the day, and on Thursday I'm going to ask you about Groton Refrigeration.",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
3225,6199,262,17,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

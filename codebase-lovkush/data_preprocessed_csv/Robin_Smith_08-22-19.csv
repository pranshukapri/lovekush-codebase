I'm not always looking for what they're looking for, and they're not always looking for what I'm looking for.  I do drug tests on all my employees.  It's just a preemployment practice.

674,2067,80,24,"So it looks as though I inquired with Matt Sullivan at Burnham Associates just looking for payment on outstanding invoices, and I immediately got a response back from Craig on the same day shortly thereafter just saying that we're processing payment, but he was also inquiring what the fuel levels were.  Since the fuel was on Burnham Associates, they were responsible for the fuel.  And so I just thanked him for that information. And I then got in touch with those in charge of the fuel logs, which would have been Matt -- at that point, Matt Plauche.  Let me back up a minute.  Craig also inquired what the status of the claim was, if I had heard anything about the claim. And so I sent an e-mail to three individuals, to J.P. asking what the status of the claim was so that I could get back to him, and also to Matt and Andy about the vessel fuel and what was on board.  My Matt, Matt Plauche, indicated to me or e-mailed to me that the next person on board would give me the readings so I then could relay that back to Craig and adjust the invoice as necessary either issuing a credit or charging for the fuel that he needed to. And the final response to that was we were up 900 gallons.  We were up 900 gallons on Burnham, meaning that when we arrived back in Boston, and we had 900 gallons more than when we took the reading at the beginning of the job, and --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
675,2099,82,4,So did that mean that Smith Marine owed Burnham a credit in this transaction?,q,MR. FITZPATRICK,start_answer
676,2101,82,6,"Yes.  We said we would then apply that -- I'll wait for the next amounts.  We have readings for him as I'm sure he'll want exact -- basically we need the day it left Chelsea and the date it arrived back from whoever was on the Meridian next.  It may be easier to determine that credit and apply to an open invoice now or do an IOU for the -- maybe tow-down, I think that's supposed to say, instead of town down. I think that's just a typo on my part.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

It could have been a little later.  The end of December.  A day in which there was no work being done because the barges were being -- or the barge was being dewatered, and he didn't want to pay a full eight-hour minimum day rate for the barge that day.  There were also then the two days in question, the 10th and 11th, that were also charged eight hours $3,000 a day for days in which the incident occurred. At that time, we didn't know what the incident was so we had all just been discussing it as an incident.  I immediately responded back to Craig and suggested that in interest of time and getting the balance paid off that we just hold those three days, and I used the word ""retainage,"" until the claim was settled.  And Matthew -- I think Matthew responded back to me.  I didn't get a response back from Craig. I got a response back from Matt, who, I assume, was discussing it with Craig that even though they didn't agree with it, they were going to go ahead and pay the per diem on that day, but they would agree to hold on to the $3,000 a day, which was a total of $9,000 until the insurance claim was settled or until this was taken care of by insurance.

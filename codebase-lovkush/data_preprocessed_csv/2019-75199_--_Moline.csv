66,380,14,2,"Well, that's an impossible question to answer, since the 45 articles referenced on the household abstracts are not the sum total of everything I've ever read in my life with respect to asbestos and its health affects. So I don't know quite how to answer your question as you phrased it, specifically related to the Stewart case, I haven't reviewed additional documents specifically. But I've certainly read articles that go to the fiber release from joint compound that are not referenced in the marked exhibits or things along those lines.  Some of them should be on my reference list. It's actually just a reference list.  It shouldn't say reliance list.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

78,440,16,10,"To be honest with you, I don't know what the most recent addition was.  There are some omissions on here that should have been listed on here.  I'm not quite sure why they are not, but maybe they are somewhere I haven't found them. The most recent addition would be the article that was in press, in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, but there should have been a couple of other things added that are not on there that I'm happy to share with you.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

87,492,18,10,And what was the context of yesterday's discussion?,q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
88,494,18,12,"That I would be deposed by some very nice lawyers and, basically, that he didn't think it would go too long, and just to make sure I had the received the documents since some of them were sent more recently related to fiber release from various products.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

96,528,19,20,"I think that, in general, yes.  I spend, apart from when I'm being deposed or at trial, most of the litigation work is done on off-hours or on vacation or -- you know, nights and weekends or before or after the normal workday.

I mean, that's -- I have industrial hygiene training, and occupational medicine is a multidiscipline profession where Jacqueline Moline we work with industrial hygienists all the time, so we work with them in that setting.

If it was they stepped by it, I think it would probably be more in the de minimus category, but again, it would depend on the exact scenario. If they are shooting the, whatever, with somebody while they're manipulating floor tiles, then it could be meaningful exposure.

I think if someone is walking by and has -- you know, someone who is working with a floor tile that they are serving, that's a de minimus exposure compared to somebody who is standing there and working or talking to them for a while.

You don't need an industrial hygiene measurement of the countless, hundreds of thousands of exposure scenarios that have occurred in the United States alone.

301,1337,50,23,"I thought it was .2 fibers per CC over 30 minutes, but I haven't looked at the excursion limit for a while.  I thought it was Jacqueline Moline less.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
302,1343,51,3,"Okay.  Do you have any reason to believe that any of Mrs. Stewart's individual exposures exceeded that limit, the .2?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
303,1346,51,6,"It's certainly possible, based on the literature with respect to what the fiber concentrations have been measured doing laundry, that they would have been above .2 or even one fiber per CC.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
304,1351,51,11,"And that's just based on literature review, nothing specific to this case; correct?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
305,1353,51,13,"Well, again, there's no exposure-specific information with respect to the dosimeters or actual dose that Mrs. Stewart had, so I have to rely on the literature in these cases.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,1358,51,18,"Understanding that OSHA sets an exposure limit over an eight-hour time weighted average of .1 fibers per CC -- Well, first of all, am I correct, is it your understanding of the OSHA eight-hour time weighted average is .1 fibers per CC?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
307,1364,51,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,1365,51,25,And you would agree with me that Jacqueline Moline Mrs. Stewart was not exposed to asbestos eight hours a day in an occupational setting; is that correct?,q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
309,1371,52,5,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
310,1372,52,6,Do you have anything on which you can rely to opine that her exposures would have exceed that OSHA standard?,q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
311,1375,52,9,"Again, first of all, OSHA has absolutely no relevance to Mrs. Stewart's particular exposure since she was not employed and she would fall under, so OSHA doesn't apply to her exposure as a take-home exposure. With respect, again, there's been no actual measurements that were done at Mrs. Stewart's home or the laundromats while she was shaking out the clothes.  With respect to what the actual measurements were, there were no actual measurements done, but based on the literature, the numbers are certainly higher than .1 fiber per CC, and they have been reported as higher than the excursion limits.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
312,1389,52,23,"And that's during the act of washing the clothes, correct, or shaking them out?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
313,1391,52,25,Correct. Jacqueline Moline,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
314,1394,53,2,"All right.  Doctor, we talked about occupational exposures and background exposures. There's also the opportunity for what I'll describe as environmental exposure to asbestos; is that correct, for example, living near a factory using or emitting asbestos fibers?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
315,1400,53,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
316,1401,53,9,And it's possible that someone that lived near a factory or other plant or shipyard that emitting asbestos fibers may have a higher exposure to asbestos from the background air than someone who does not live near such a central location?,q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
317,1407,53,15,That's correct.  Someone who lives near a factory that's emitting asbestos into the air would have a potential for a higher exposure than someone who is not living near a factory that is not emitting asbestos.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
318,1412,53,20,And shipyards are one of those types of locations we are understood to emit asbestos fiber into the surrounding areas; correct?,q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer

322,1428,54,10,Are you aware of any studies suggesting that the rates of mesothelioma may be higher in areas near shipyards?,q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
323,1431,54,13,"Well, it depends on who they are measuring, because of the people living near a shipyard are also working at a shipyard and their family members are dealing with the fact that their spouses or children are bringing home their asbestos-laden clothes from the shipyards, so the rates are going to be higher in the community. So it depends if you're asking me is it from the general environment versus the people who work and live near the shipyard.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,1442,54,24,"Sure.  I'm asking in the general environment, so not people that worked there or Jacqueline Moline were exposed to those that did work there, but someone living in the community. Are you aware of any studies suggesting that incidents of mesothelioma may be higher for those that fit that description, that live near shipyards?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
325,1452,55,8,I'm aware of various factories.  I'm sure there probably are studies related to the shipyard.  I can't specifically think of one now.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,1456,55,12,"And would it be fair, Doctor, that, in your opinion, in looking at potential environmental exposures to those living near a shipyard, there would numerous factors to consider, including distance from the shipyard, wind direction, things of that nature?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer

339,1491,56,21,I wouldn't be able to comment on what they did there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,1493,56,23,"And from your experience, would you agree that the construction of those ships and overhaul of ships likely utilized asbestos Jacqueline Moline during that time period?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
341,1499,57,3,"Within the ships themselves, yes.  I mean, it's not like asbestos was used on top of the ship.  It was used in the engine rooms, the boilers rooms, on the pipes in the ship, on the bulkheads, and confined spaces in the ships.  It wasn't like the ship was painted with asbestos or the masts or the deck was made of asbestos. Certainly, within the ship itself, in the below-deck, there would have been asbestos.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,1508,57,12,"If you were made aware or informed that the town where Mrs. Stewart grew up and spent most of her life bordered Quincy, Massachusetts, in the area where the shipyard was present, would potential environmental exposures from the ambient air from the shipyard be something that you would consider in your assessment of her cumulative exposure to asbestos?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_chat

347,1532,58,10,"Okay.  Specific to this case, and we may have covered this, and I apologize if we did, if you feel we did -- But did you review any specific articles or studies regarding exposure to asbestos from roofing products as part of your review of this case?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
348,1539,58,17,"Only -- I mean, I was provided with the Bird document.  That's Exhibit 5. Other than that, I don't believe I looked at any specific article in the past three weeks.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
349,1543,58,21,"So if you may have read articles related to incidents of mesothelioma or asbestos exposure in roofers, for example, in the past, but not in the three weeks that you've been retained in this case? Jacqueline Moline",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
350,1550,59,2,"That's correct.  I certainly have read articles where exposure to roofing, I've had patients who were roofers, so I've studied it in the past. Specifically related to this case, I haven't reviewed any articles recently apart from the Bird document.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
351,1557,59,9,"And I think we've covered it, but you'd agree with me, in terms of occupation, Mr. Stewart was not a roofer; correct?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer

356,1571,59,23,"He worked selling the Bird felt paper. He had to cut the rolls with a hand saw or a circular saw and also sold joist paper, which Jacqueline Moline was described as the same as felt paper.

360,1590,60,16,"Well, it's rampant in the medical literature that roofing materials contained asbestos. With respect to an individual product, I would need to look at a material safety data sheet or other document that would give me the information related to the asbestos content of a particular brand or product, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
361,1598,60,24,Okay.  And have you done that for any of the Bird roofing products at issue in this Jacqueline Moline case?,q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer

444,1921,73,9,"That a variety of different Kaiser Gypsum products -- Actually, it cemented my knowledge that Kaiser Gypsum joint compound, cement, and other products, contained asbestos since they gave the percentages of asbestos in the various products, of which I had been familiar in the past, but it provided additional information about the percentage of asbestos in the various products that Kaiser Gypsum manufactured. Some of them or many of them I was aware of before, but not specifically related to this Stewart case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

446,1937,73,25,"That they sold Kaiser Gypsum products, Jacqueline Moline and sometimes the bags would break, and he would describe it as a cloud of dust.  He would have to clean up the spills.  Sometimes the bags would break and they would tape them over, if they could; that the bags, in general, were dusty. He noticed that when he was dealing with the dry joint compound it would, even in the closed bags, there would be dust when they were unloading the pallets onto the shelves. He described about 30 percent of the joint compound they sold was Kaiser Gypsum.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

450,1960,74,22,I have not seen a study that has looked specifically at sealed bag dust puffs.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

You're asking me to assume that the dust could have come from other places, other than the manipulation of the bag?  Is that what you're asking me?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

461,2006,76,16,"Understood. Would you, based on his description of only 30 percent of the joint compound bags was Kaiser Gypsum, would you have reason to disagree with the assumption that, of the 25 or 30 times that the bags ripped open, only 30 percent of those occasions involved Kaiser Gypsum?",q,"ADAM MARTIN, ESQ",start_answer
462,2013,76,23,"I mean, it could have been that Kaiser Gypsum made bad bag and those were always the ones that always ripped. Jacqueline Moline I don't have any way of knowing what the exact percentages of Kaiser Gypsum bags ripped as opposed to another company.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

476,2057,78,15,"In general, yes. Although, if he had super dusty clothes and she's shaking them out, then it could be very similar to what he was exposed to at the time, based on the literature showing that the exposures can actually be relatively similar to what the worker was exposed to when the laundering person is shaking out the clothes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I just directed them to go against the wall which was farthest from the window on the opposite side. They all gathered.  They went over. They were pretty quiet, and then I heard the helicopter.  I guess it was a police helicopter.  You don't hear helicopters over the building too often.  It was up there and it was up there and it was up there.  I don't know if there was two, one, three.  I don't remember. Then my students started getting texts saying there is a shooter in the building.  I was in the room looking towards that door because all I could see was that hand coming through because the shooter must have known that there wasn't any glass in that door.  I just felt that way. I didn't know what to move.  I knew I had to barricade something.  The file cabinets were all full.  So I had my students move that locker to block the door because it was the only piece in the room that would have been movable and cover up to the top of where the opening was in the glass or where the glass would have been. I just felt that that would be a deterrent for the shooter.  Maybe if the shooter saw a wall, they would bypass the room.

116,431,17,12,"We just have a calendar printout.  I don't remember us ever having a practice drill.  I don't remember that.  I don't remember that.

If they had said police, I would have felt better.  They just came through, so I just thought I was going die.

I remember getting the students over to the wall, turning off the lights, closing the door and just trying to keep them quiet.  I knew the windows on the other side, somebody could look in and see them.  So I just wanted them as quiet as possible.  Then we moved that locker to the door.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

369,1160,46,16,That's correct.  The only other signal was that helicopter in the sky that stayed in that place.  It wasn't like an airplane flying over.  It just stayed in that place. It was very eerie.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

375,1176,47,7,"Well, they didn't really say much. They busted in, as I said, which was shattering; best you could do, you could die in here. There was no other conversation, and they just cleared.  There are over 200 rooms in the building, and I understand they were going room to room.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
376,1184,47,15,Why do you believe they indicated that you were going to die in there?,q,MS. GRANT,start_answer

396,1243,49,24,You did not?,q,MS. GRANT,start_answer
397,1245,50,1,"I did not.  I did not receive a suspension.  I did receive a warning.  I did not receive a suspension or loss of pay.  The union did appeal that because the school didn't do, in a timely fashion, what they needed to do, so that's on appeal. We understand there's no mediator there at the school district, so it's going to take some time.  But everything was rectified.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
398,1255,50,11,What was the allegation against you that caused the warning?,q,MS. GRANT,start_answer
399,1257,50,13,There were a couple meetings that the assistant principal set up for me that I did not attend.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
400,1260,50,16,What were those meetings for and what did they surround?,q,MS. GRANT,start_answer
401,1262,50,18,"The assistant principal was new to our building.  There were certain procedures that we, in our department, would follow.  One of my students needed to have a more advanced Spanish class.  Within the department, we usually just take them to a teacher.  We talk about it first, and then the teacher takes them on.  We just make the changes from there. The parent, in the meantime, had come in to talk about the student being moved. She wanted her daughter moved.  We made the move for a day or so.  The student came back to me. When Mr. Greaves called me in to look at my lesson plans, my syllabus, the syllabus, as I told him, was online.  We use the same syllabus for world language.  My lesson plans, I always keep on my desk.  I know the school started to ask to have them e-mailed to them, but I always keep them on my desk.  That's what I've been doing for so many years.  I feel, if somebody walks in, they would be able to see them right there. In turn, I don't know what the meeting was.  I didn't go to that meeting.  I did have a meeting with Mr. Crowder, and then we did have a meeting.  That seemed to be okay. The school district came in. I think Mr. Greaves had some students write me up.  They had write-ups, and the representative from the school district said we see that everyone is saying you're teaching.  You're teaching.  We just need to see your lesson plans. Ms. McGowan, who is my union rep, said Ms. Visconi has been here so many years.  She leaves her lessons plans on her desk.  I just feel it was a miscommunication.  Those things happen all the time.  Mr. Greaves did re-evaluate me this year for my lessons and gave me two lovely evaluations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
402,1306,52,12,Was there any allegations that you cursed in class and sexually harassed a student?,q,MS. GRANT,start_answer
403,1309,52,15,"This was an incident, and the way that was portrayed in the writing wasn't actually correct.  I told Dr. Seidman.  I share so much with him.  He's doing the best with what I told him. I asked a group of young men to stop brushing their hair one day in class.  The one in particular got up and walked past me and said you're just a B.  Go F yourself.  I said please leave the room. That turned into, again, having a few students write me up; his friends, who agreed with him.  It ended up that Mr. Greaves had to get other students to submit paperwork saying I didn't curse at them. As I said to Mr. Greaves in our meeting, again with the school district and again with my union rep, I've always had a professional position; hospital industry and utility at PECO doing public service announcements, having my own office. For me to go into a school after 31 years of teaching -- first half of my life I was not in the school district -- I think to start cursing at students would be very much out of character.  If anything, as a language teacher, I teach them to speak with dignity, speak with grace.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
404,1338,53,19,What about the sexual harassment allegations?,q,MS. GRANT,start_answer
405,1340,53,21,"I don't know what that was about.  I guess he thought the young man was sexually harassing me through his language and through the words he would use in class.  But, no, no, no.  We just took that Act 126 test, so I know what that looks like.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
406,1347,54,3,You were involved in the grievance proceedings on or around the time of this January 2nd incident?,q,MS. GRANT,start_answer
407,1350,54,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
408,1351,54,7,"Now, as a result of those allegations of the students and dealing with your administration, that in and of itself, were you experiencing an increase in anxiety or depressive feelings, anything of that nature?",q,MS. GRANT,start_answer
409,1356,54,12,"No, because I've been doing this for years.  Students who fly off the handle -- I've been cursed at before.  I've had students say to me, why did you let so-and-so talk to you like that or say that.  I always go back to everybody has issues.  Everybody has their problems.  You don't know what they come to class that day. I have to be the stable one.  I have to be the one to take that brunt because they have nowhere else to vent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
410,1367,54,23,"What about having to go through that process with the administration, does that cause you any angst or anxiety, depressive feelings?",q,MS. GRANT,start_answer
411,1372,55,3,"It wasn't the most fun, but I know who I am.  I know what I present in the classroom because I'm very professional.  I knew that things would be resolved.  It might have taken time and been frustrating on the way, but I know the truth always shows through. It just doesn't compare to January 2nd.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
412,1379,55,10,"I believe you testified to this, but from January 2, 2019 you continued to work through the last day of the school year in June 2019?",q,MS. GRANT,start_answer

441,1441,57,22,"I was anxious about starting a new job in a new place with the school district because I was always there at Northeast High School.  It came as such a shock. I guess if I knew months ahead I was going out, you could make preparation. Finding out on such short notice and then looking through the chart and they said I had to come up with some combination to keep my job to keep working.  I had to match the schools, get the approval of the principals. It was a short window to get that done.  It was two weeks. Then readjusting to it.  It was elementary schools that were the only ones available.  So I had to change my whole curriculum.  I taught elementary Spanish before.  I'm certified K through 12 with language.  That wasn't the problem.  It was just getting accustomed to a new program.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

266,1161,40,17,It was a five-story building.  It had an elevator in the back.  The first floor was used equipment.  The second floor was used pizza ovens and electrical fryers.  The third floor was mainly just crap.  The fourth floor was the shop.  And the fifth floor was storage with more used equipment.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

279,1200,42,6,"Okay.  Which brings me to my second point of clarification.  When you and I were talking about you personally applying insulation to ovens and also separately mixing the insulation, you gave me two different approximations of where Mr. Seidman would be.

289,1243,43,24,Okay.  Were there times where Mr. Seidman was in a different location other than 5 feet away from the mixer while you were using the mixer for the insulation material?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
290,1248,44,4,"The most he could be further away from that would be 10 feet.  The whole center of the shop was nothing but hand brakes where we bent the metal.  Further away where we made the stove and we put the cement in the stove, there was two benches that we laid out the metalwork and we welded up the frames for the stove.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,1255,44,11,Okay.,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer

301,1284,45,15,Okay.,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer

319,1327,47,8,"No, the same type of mask.  When we moved to Chelsea, we still used the asbestos, but as we moved on to a different type, we used a different -- the same mask.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
320,1331,47,12,Okay.  So the same mask was used -- type of mask was used whether Seidman was in Boston or in Chelsea?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer

325,1340,47,21,Wetting it down.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,1341,47,22,Okay.  Were you given any instructions by any superior about any reasons why you were using these precautions being that asbestos was hazardous or it could cause a certain disease or anything like that?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
327,1347,48,3,Not at the time.  The foreman didn't say nothing to me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,1349,48,5,"All right.  At some point, did a superior or even a contemporary of yours say anything in connection with asbestos and hazards and disease or anything bad?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer

330,1357,48,13,Who told you that and kind of what was that scenario like?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
331,1359,48,15,"It was Sonny, because we had seen the bags and then the big warnings on it.  And he had said make sure you wear your mask, and that's what we did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,1363,48,19,So the warning was there when you started?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
333,1365,48,21,I can't remember if it was or not.  I don't remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,1367,48,23,At what time do you recall seeing a warning on any material that contained asbestos?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
335,1371,49,2,"I remember unloading the bags and bringing them upstairs and Tommy Dailey, he noticed it and I noticed it, but, you know, I was 22 years old.  I didn't pay any attention. You see on the cigarette labels can cause cancer.  Everybody still smokes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,1377,49,8,"Right, right.",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
337,1378,49,9,"Never paid any attention to it.  Never thought it could do anything serious that you know now, but we would mix it without the mask, you know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,1382,49,13,"So you start in '74.  Around what time -- you said you were, like, 23 or 24 when you saw this, so that would be when in relation to when you started?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
339,1386,49,17,"It would be close to the end of '74, maybe '75.  I'm not too sure.  I remember in '75 I had gotten married, and '76 I had my daughter.  And it would either be '74 or '75.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

342,1396,50,2,"Right, yes.  But whether or not you saw a warning on a bag of a material believed to contain asbestos, even from day one that you started in '74, a mask was provided to you and the wetting down was done?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
343,1401,50,7,"The wetting down was done, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

345,1406,50,12,"We would get a flat top and it had -- it depended on the size holes, how many woks that would go in the stove.  If it was a three-hole wok, we'd put three holes.  We'd make a tank and we'd put bricks in it, and then the top of it we would cope with the asbestos. So when the flames come up and hit the bottom of the wok, it wouldn't hit the top of the stove. And then we made a back.  We completely made everything, but it first came in in a flat piece of steel, and we build it into a stove.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

351,1431,51,12,"It -- they were always bringing back used equipment.  Allen never threw away nothing.  If it was a wok stove or a pizza oven, it was up on the fifth floor. We were the largest manufacturer of the Chinese ranges.  We'd probably build two stoves a week, depending on the hole. Sometimes there would be a five-hole, which would be about 10 feet long down to a single-hole, which would be about 30 inches wide.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
352,1442,51,23,"So during your time as a sheet metal helper, you're working on Chinese ranges, pizza ovens.  Any other type of oven or piece of equipment?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
353,1447,52,3,"Pizza ovens, you know, Allen would take out the stones.  One thing about Allen, if he sold used equipment, he would make sure that it was perfect.  He would take the whole pizza oven apart.  He would check the valves and make sure the gasket was on the valve and make sure that was new. If it wasn't, I've seen him scraping it off, you know.  And he used to get pissed off because it would take him a while to scrape it off.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
354,1458,52,14,So these are tasks that you saw Mr. Seidman performing?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
355,1460,52,16,All the time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
356,1461,52,17,Okay.  Can you tell me the brands of pizza ovens that you observed Mr. Seidman performing work on?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
357,1464,52,20,It was Blodgett.  I just had it in my mind.  I can't recall it now.  I can't recall it right now.  I had it in the back of my mind. I just forgot it right now.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
358,1468,52,24,"Okay.  Now, with the Chinese ranges, these are things that Seidman Brothers is building themselves, so is there a brand name to the Chinese ovens or not because it's an item that Seidman Brothers is making?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
359,1474,53,5,"It's an item that they were making. If it was a one-hole, they would call it an SB1 or a two-hole, SB2.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
360,1477,53,8,"Got it.  And I'm trying to keep it to these different time periods based on your duties, so are there other types of work that you recall seeing Mr. Seidman performing while you were in this 10- to 15-year period as a sheet metal helper?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
361,1483,53,14,"He would always take apart electrical Frialators.  If it had to do with restaurant equipment, Allen took it apart.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
362,1486,53,17,Okay.  Do you recall the manufacturer of any of the Frialators that you saw Mr. Seidman take apart?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
363,1489,53,20,Hobart.  My mind is going blank.  I can't recall it right now.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
364,1491,53,22,"Okay.  If anything at any point -- you know sometimes things pop in your mind, you by all means stop me and say, oh, I just remembered.  Okay?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
365,1496,54,2,"Excuse me, the other type of oven was Bakers Pride.  And excuse me, the other type of Frialator would be Pitco.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
366,1499,54,5,Can you say that one more time?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
367,1500,54,6,Pitco.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
368,1501,54,7,Is that P-I-T-C-O?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
369,1502,54,8,"I believe so, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
370,1503,54,9,"Okay.  Do you believe that there were other types of pizza ovens that you don't recall their name, or do you believe it to be these two that you recall right now?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
371,1507,54,13,"There were quite a bit of different names.  That was Allen's thing.  I just worked, you know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
372,1510,54,16,"And that's understandable.  And you're doing exactly what I've asked you to do.  I really am concerned about something that you did and Mr. Seidman was around or what you saw Mr. Seidman doing. So we've covered you doing your work and where he was.  And now we're kind of transitioning to what he was doing and what you saw. So we talked about his pizza oven work, taking apart a Frialator.  Anything else that sticks in your mind, again, trying to contain it to the sheet metal helper time that you saw Mr. Seidman do?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
373,1525,55,6,"He would be working on -- one good thing about Allen, he was very good at refrigeration.  So if a unit came in and it needed to be reserviced with Freon, he would do that.  He often did my cars, would put Freon in my cars.  There was always something up at the platform that Allen was working on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
374,1532,55,13,"Okay.  So did you yourself work on refrigeration?  Again, we're just talking about sheet metal helper time.  Did you do that work?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
375,1535,55,16,"No, Allen did that.  If something came up the elevator, I would help him put it up on the platform.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
376,1538,55,19,But you saw him reservicing Freon in refrigeration units?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
377,1540,55,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
378,1541,55,22,Okay.  Do you recall the manufacturer of the refrigeration units that you saw Mr. Seidman do this reservicing of Freon on?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
379,1545,56,1,I remember Tecumseh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
380,1546,56,2,Any other brand?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
381,1547,56,3,I can't think of any right now.  My mind is blank.  I'm kind of nervous.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
382,1549,56,5,"By all means.  This is not a normal day for you.  Totally understandable.  We do this all the time, so we're trying to make it as normal as possible for you and trying to make it as unnerving as we can.  All right?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
383,1554,56,10,Thank you.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
384,1555,56,11,"Again, if another brand pops in your mind, stop me and we'll get it down.",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
385,1557,56,13,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
386,1558,56,14,Anything else during your sheet metal helper time that you saw Mr. Seidman doing that you can tell us about?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
387,1561,56,17,"Other than going out on the road, I'd go out on the road with him a lot of time and we'd install pipes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
388,1564,56,20,Sure.,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
389,1565,56,21,"Ventilation, ductwork.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
390,1566,56,22,"All right.  So let's talk about the times you're now out of the facility on the road with Mr. Seidman and you're, you said, installing pipe or ductwork?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
391,1571,57,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
392,1572,57,3,"Are those two different tasks, or are you saying that that's essentially a different way of saying the same thing?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
393,1575,57,6,We made ventilation hoods.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
394,1576,57,7,Okay.  So you fabricated sheet metal at the shop to make a ventilation hood?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
395,1578,57,9,"Yes, we made the hoods.  We made the pipes.  We made the curves that go on the roof where the fans were.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
396,1581,57,12,"The materials used to make the ventilation hoods would be what, sheet metal parts?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
397,1584,57,15,"The hoods would be made out of stainless steel, and the pipework would be made out of galvanized.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
398,1587,57,18,And now you have to go on the road to install the hood?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
399,1589,57,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
400,1590,57,21,And would Mr. Seidman participate in the installation process?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
401,1592,57,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
402,1593,57,24,"If you were installing a ventilation hood, would Mr. Seidman be doing anything aside from helping or assisting in the ventilation hood installation process?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
403,1598,58,4,"He would be mainly probably cutting a hole in the ceiling and the roof, and we would be hanging the hood down below.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
404,1601,58,7,Okay.  Any materials involved in that process other than galvanized steel or stainless steel?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
405,1604,58,10,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
406,1605,58,11,"And again, I'm literally trying to exhaust your memory here, so if I get to the point where I have done that, just tell me to stop, but I'm going to keep asking is there anything else you remember. So are there any other tasks that you recall seeing Mr. Seidman perform while you were a sheet metal helper?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
407,1613,58,19,"Other than delivering refrigerators and repossessing restaurants.  He would always go out -- he would buy out a restaurant.  We would bring back like a pizza oven or Frialators, and they would go up on the fifth floor. When Allen wasn't out on the road, he'd be working on maybe a pizza oven or an electrical fryer. He basically wasn't really in the office that much.  He was mainly upstairs or he was out on the road.  Because I remember he always used to yell at me because the Expressway ran in front, so I would be always looking out the window taking a break, and he would call me on the phone and say, stop looking out the window because he'd be driving by.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
408,1632,59,13,"That's funny.  He could see you. So in these instances where let's take you buy an old restaurant and you're taking equipment out, you're taking an oven out and bringing it back to the shop, do you remember the manufacturers of those ovens that he would repossess?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
409,1639,59,20,The Blodgett and Bakers Pride. There's one other name I can't really recall right now.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
410,1642,59,23,And you also told us about a memory of -- an instance where Mr. Seidman would then install a refrigeration unit at a restaurant. Is there anything other than connecting metal to metal involved with installing refrigeration items?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
411,1649,60,5,"Refrigeration unit would be like a salad unit.  If you got a salad unit back, you would take the compressor out, and he'd recharge it and put it back in there.  If it was a repair, he would ship it out.  If it was to be sold, he would put it out in the showroom on the second floor.  He was quite good at the refrigeration.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
412,1657,60,13,So do you think we've covered kind of your memories of things that Mr. Seidman was present for you doing and things that you saw Mr. Seidman doing while you were a sheet metal helper?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
413,1662,60,18,"Pretty much, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
414,1663,60,19,Okay.  Anything you feel we need to cover that we haven't covered?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
415,1665,60,21,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
416,1666,60,22,"All right.  So now I'm going to move on to instances where or the time period where you were a middle man, and we're talking about essentially a 25-year period?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
417,1671,61,2,(Nodding.),a,THE WITNESS,start_question
418,1672,61,3,"So during the 25-year period, there would be a point at which -- as a middle man, were you in Boston or Chelsea?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
419,1675,61,6,I was in Boston for the first part of it and then went to Chelsea.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
420,1677,61,8,"Okay.  And again, you put the move in or around '82?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
421,1679,61,10,I believe it's around '82.  I'm not really sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
422,1681,61,12,Okay.,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
423,1682,61,13,Because I thought we were in Boston for a longer period of time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
424,1684,61,15,But that's your best estimate?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
425,1685,61,16,"Yeah, I can't recall, but we were excited because Boston still was small and the Chelsea store was huge and the shop was humongous, so we just wanted to get there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
426,1689,61,20,Yes.,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
427,1690,61,21,Because it was a great place.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
428,1691,61,22,"Okay.  Tell me, were your duties the same or different when you were a middle man versus a sheet metal helper?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
429,1695,62,1,"The sheet metal helper is I went out on the road with Allen sometimes, a lot of times maybe.  If the foreman told me to cut pieces of steel, I would cut the steel.  I would help him weld them together.  If he told me to weld up the pipe, I would weld up the pipe. When I gradually got over to Chelsea, it was different.  The shop was bigger.  We started doing more stuff.  I started making sinks, countertops, hoods out of stainless steel. And like I said, Sonny come in one day and said, I'm going to make you the foreman. It didn't mean nothing to me because all the people in the shop were my good friends, and that was it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
430,1712,62,18,"So when we kind of delineated and separated out your period as middle man and foreman, essentially, now we can talk about those two things together because you did the same type of work?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
431,1717,62,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
432,1718,62,24,"All right.  And if you could explain for me how it was, if it was, any different when you were a middle man versus a sheet metal helper?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
433,1723,63,4,"It was actually no difference at all because I did the same thing as when I was a helper except it was in a bigger form, and I got to make my own decisions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
434,1727,63,8,"All right.  Now, you and I have talked about things that Mr. Seidman was present for when you were working and things that you saw Mr. Seidman doing, and that was during your time as a sheet metal helper. So same series of questions about when you were a middle man and a foreman.  Did you see Mr. Seidman doing any other different tasks than what we've already talked about?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
435,1736,63,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
436,1737,63,18,Okay.,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
437,1738,63,19,"The only different task was when he repaired like the stoves or something, he had his own bench out in the warehouse.  He did his own thing out there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
438,1742,63,23,Okay.,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
439,1743,63,24,"If he completely rebuilt a pizza oven, the gas was right there, he would test it. There was an overhead fan where he'd get the heat out, or if he did an electric stove, he had plugs on his bench.  He had his own bench out there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
440,1750,64,6,Okay.  Were there -- and you've told us about work that you did that Mr. Seidman was present for when you were a sheet metal helper. So was there anything in addition that you did when you were a middle man and foreman that we haven't talked about that Mr. Seidman would have been present for for you doing yourself?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
441,1758,64,14,"No, Allen wouldn't come in.  Allen was out of the office all the time -- not all the time, but he was out there with Sonny.  When Allen came in in the morning, he had the job schedule.  They would load up the trucks. Allen would be gone for most of the day, then Allen would come into the shop and check out what we were doing. He would make sure everything was going fine, and he would hand me slips to hand out to the guys.  Other than that, he was in the warehouse repairing stuff.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
442,1771,65,2,"Now, when you moved to Chelsea, was your primary workstation in the machine shop area?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
443,1774,65,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
444,1775,65,6,And where would Mr. Seidman be doing his work?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
445,1777,65,8,"Allen would be out probably about 25 feet from the door where my bench was, and that was where his bench was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
446,1780,65,11,"Okay.  Like I said, we were all there this week.  So if you walk in the warehouse -- we're in the warehouse area and there's an entry door into the machine area.  And as you walk in, there seems to be like a workstation as you immediately walk through the door.  And then at the far end of the room, there's also some stations towards the back?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
447,1788,65,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
448,1789,65,20,Can you tell me where your station was and where Mr. Seidman's was?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
449,1791,65,22,"I don't know if you went in the side door, but if you came in the side door, my bench was right there.  Did you go through the bifolded doors when you walked out of the office?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
450,1797,66,3,I don't remember.,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
451,1798,66,4,"You probably did.  You come out of the office, and the bifold doors are right there. Allen's bench was right there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
452,1801,66,7,How far away was your bench from his bench?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
453,1803,66,9,"I was in the shop right before that door, probably 30 feet.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
454,1805,66,11,"Okay.  Were there any different -- I may have asked you this already, and pardon me if I did, but were there any different safety precautions taken in Chelsea aside from what was done in Boston?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
455,1810,66,16,"Yes, but after a few years after we were in Chelsea, we did away with the asbestos, and we started using Ramcote.  And they always made sure that we had welding gloves, safety glasses, mask, and that was it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
456,1815,66,21,"At what -- if you can give me an approximation of a year, when would you say your memory is of a date when asbestos was done away with at Seidman Brothers?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
457,1820,67,1,"I forget.  It was -- I believe it was banned in '85.  I'm not too sure, but maybe a little while after that.  I can't recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
458,1823,67,4,Okay.  Tell us how it was that you have a memory of asbestos being done away with at Seidman Brothers.  Was there a meeting?  Was it a memo that came out to employees?  Do you remember anything in connection with that event?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
459,1829,67,10,I remember Sonny saying that they're doing away with it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
460,1831,67,12,"Okay.  And when you say ""they,"" are you talking about they, Seidman Brothers?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer

463,1835,67,16,"Seidman Brothers, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
464,1836,67,17,"Okay.  When you were a middle man and a foreman, did the amount of time that you were out on the road with Mr. Seidman increase, decrease, stay the same, any change?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
465,1840,67,21,"It stayed the same.  If he needed me, he would take me out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
466,1842,67,23,"Okay.  When you were a middle man, were you working with any other people aside from Tom Dailey and Paul Gagnon who you've already told us about?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
467,1847,68,3,"At the Chelsea store, there was a gentleman named Rob.  He worked there.  The sons were in there, Ricky, Jack, and there was quite a bit of people that came in there because we looked for people that were qualified.  If they weren't qualified, then we'd let them go.  That's just the way it was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
468,1854,68,10,"Now, tell me what Rick's job was or is with Seidman Brothers?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
469,1856,68,12,"Rick was -- he went out on the road a lot.  He did a lot of installations, and he would work in the shop.  If he had nothing to do, Allen would tell him to go in the shop.  He would tell me to give him something to do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
470,1861,68,17,Would you say then that Rick was more on the road than in the shop?,q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
471,1863,68,19,"I would say so, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
472,1864,68,20,"Okay.  How about Jack, did he have a variation on outside work versus inside?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer
473,1866,68,22,"Jack ran the Boston store.  There was a store in Chinatown in Boston.  They sold just equipment, you know, silverware and dishes and stuff.  Jack ran that store.  He was there for quite a few years. And when the brothers parted, Jack took over the office.  He ran the office, and Allen still went on the road.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
474,1875,69,6,"So what I'm hearing is -- for how long was there, like, a showroom equipment only area in Chinatown?",q,MS. RIORDAN,start_answer

484,1893,69,24,"What it was, Sonny had retired.  Glen had started off working in the Chinatown store. When Sonny retired, Glen came back and took Sonny's place over, then Jack went into the Boston store and started running that for a while. When they closed down when they found out that they weren't doing that much business because other companies were making the same stuff we were making, then Jack came back.  And then Glen left the company, and Jack took over the office.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

490,1915,70,21,"Like I said, he worked on every type of restaurant equipment.  He was a man of many talents.  I mean, other than working in the restaurant, he loved his boats.  Other than that, he loved the boats, but I mean, he was always on the road.  If not, coming upstairs, he was working on, like I said, ovens or pieces of equipment. He would go up on the fifth floor, take something down.  He'd go through the whole thing.  If it was fixed, he'd put it down in the showroom, and it would be sold.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
491,1928,71,9,"So the types of equipment we've talked about thus far, and I want to make sure -- if I don't mention one, it's my fault, but I'm trying to get a whole list here. We've talked about pizza ovens, the Chinese ranges that were Seidman Brothers' products.  We've talked about some refrigeration units.  We talked about ventilation hoods that were fabricated.  What else?  You mentioned the mixer itself.  We talked about the insulation material. Is there other equipment that we haven't covered that you know Mr. Seidman worked with or around?",q,MS.

If he'd see that we were getting behind, he'd grab the metal and he'd start bending it, but he didn't know how to weld. And basically, if we needed angle iron cut, he would cut it.  I don't think he liked being downstairs with Sonny is what I think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

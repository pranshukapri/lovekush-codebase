19,202,6,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
20,203,6,18,"Okay.  So counsel was appointed to you through the former employment, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
21,205,6,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
22,206,6,21,"Okay.  So basic ground rules are there is a videographer here, but the court reporter is the official transcript.  She cannot take down two people speaking at the same time.  So essentially the way it works, almost like a television screenplay, except for one thing, which is, first, there is a question from me.  Then there is a potential objection from counsel.  If Mr. Wiencek makes an objection, normally you'll be allowed to answer.  However, please wait until the objection is done.  If he instructs you not to answer, that would be normally because of attorney-client privilege, then you normally are going to follow the instruction of counsel.  But please listen.  So first, it's question, then it's potential objection, so allow that to come out. Also, the reason I also say that to people is what can happen is we get a little conversational here, or we start talking over one another -- one another, people get excited, whatever the reason.  And so if you give a pause for an objection to potentially be stated, you give yourself a second to think before you answer a question.  And that keeps the transcript a lot cleaner. Also, you have to be affirmative in answers, yes and no, not shakes and nods of the head ultimately, because shakes and nods, although the court reporter can write those down, it has to be audible for an answer.  So you say yes or no, keep it audible. If for some reason you don't hear or understand a question from me, just simply tell me that.  Otherwise, if you answer a question, I'm going to assume you both heard it and understood it. Do those general ground rules, understood by you at this point?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

1360,3880,148,3,"Okay.  Holland was on call.  The issue was Dr. Holland didn't want to follow Coumadin regulations on his patients, but the other doctors did.  So Dr. Holland is on call.

And he said that we do not follow Coumadin regulations on our patients.  He was rude to them.  Do not -- so rude, that they didn't want to talk to him again.  He was verbally abusive to them.  How do you have a relationship with a visiting nurse, to take care of our patients, if they don't want to speak to the doctor because of how he treats them? So my -- my question here was, well, how do we handle these sort of situations?

So what he did was he contacted the PAs and the front office staff, and told them to tell the patient to go to the St. Anne's ER and complain of chest pain, so that she could be admitted and have surgery by him.  And that is insurance fraud.  That I -- I couldn't -- I was -- that -- I couldn't believe it.  So -- so I directed them to absolutely do not do that.

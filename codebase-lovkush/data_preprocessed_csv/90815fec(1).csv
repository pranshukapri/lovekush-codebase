The first is that all of your responses must be verbal.  Madam court reporter cannot take down nods of the head or nonverbal responses like uh-huh.  So all of your responses must be yes, no or whatever the answer may be. Secondly, we cannot talk over one another.  I know it's natural in conversation that we anticipate each other's responses, but we have to act like it's a shortwave radio and keep the record clear for madam court reporter.",q,MS.

103,307,14,8,"Okay.  Now, I've noticed -- very briefly, I've noticed that there are a lot of doctors who focus on the knee and shoulder together, and those aren't necessarily body parts that you would think go together.  Is there some reason why those two things tend to be?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
104,314,14,15,They're two parts of the body that are commonly treated arthroscopically.  So a lot of people who have some extra training in arthroscopy or a particular interest in arthroscopy end up focusing on those joints because they're some of the more common joints in the body that end up getting arthroscopic treatment.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

108,331,15,9,"You know, it's pretty common.  I would say certainly every day I see people with knee and shoulder problems.  I don't know beyond telling you it's a frequent complaint how to answer that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,336,15,14,"Okay.  Now, we are obviously here for a lawsuit, so I know that you do some medical-legal consulting work.  Can you tell me how often you do medical-legal work?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
110,340,15,18,"So I don't really keep a tally or a count, but I have estimated in the past that in terms of what I do seeing patients maybe 10, 15 percent, somewhere in that neighborhood is -- would be evaluations for things like this, and the balance would be treatment of patients who have been injured.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,348,16,3,So about 10 or 15 percent of your patients are here for things like IMEs?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer

117,363,16,18,Can you give me an estimate as to what percentage of your medical-legal work is for plaintiffs versus defendants?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
118,366,16,21,"The significant majority is for plaintiffs or claimants.  I mean, I've estimated in the past, and again I don't have a count, so it's just an estimation, you know, 5, 10, 12 percent defense and the balance would be plaintiffs or claimants.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,373,17,5,Do you remember when your last defense case was?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
120,375,17,7,The last defense evaluation that I did?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

188,512,23,6,Do you know if you provided any input in any way in drafting that statement?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
189,514,23,8,"I don't remember talking about it. Perhaps it came from my report, but I didn't talk about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
190,517,23,11,Okay.  Are you keeping them all over there?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
191,519,23,13,That's what I was doing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
192,520,23,14,"Okay.  Moving on, I would like to direct your attention to your evaluation of Ms. Vaughn on March 19th of 2019, earlier this year.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
193,524,23,18,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
194,525,23,19,I see you have your report.  That's fantastic.  I'm also going to mark a copy of that report as Deposition Exhibit 4 for when I need it.,q,MS. KYLIS,is brackets
195,530,24,1,(Deposition Exhibit Number 4 was marked for identification.),brackets,,start_question
196,533,24,4,"Now, Doctor, on March 19, 2019, in what capacity did you treat Ms. Vaughn?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
197,535,24,6,I didn't treat her.  I evaluated her.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
198,536,24,7,What is the difference?  If you could --,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
199,538,24,9,"Sure.  So this was an evaluation. Treatment is different.  Treatment we're all familiar with.  The patient goes into the doctor.  You have a problem.  You want to figure out what the problem is generally and you want to get it treated to feel better. An evaluation is a visit where the patient comes in generally sent by an interested party, an attorney, an insurance company, and you're not treating the patient trying to make them better, but you're evaluating them, talking to them in order to answer questions about a case typically or an injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
200,551,24,22,"Okay.  So in performing an evaluation where you're not treating the patient, how do you arrive at your evaluation?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
201,555,25,3,"Well, you review the records, talk to the patient, get a history, do a physical examination, review the imaging studies and then you using your experience, knowledge and the information that you've gleaned, you come up with an opinion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
202,561,25,9,"Great.  Now, do you have an independent recollection of the visit with Ms. Vaughn in March of 2019?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
203,564,25,12,Not much.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
204,565,25,13,"What do you remember, if anything?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
205,566,25,14,I really -- I'm going to rely on my medical records for answering your questions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
206,568,25,16,"Oh, understood.  I was just wondering if there's -- if you remember anything about her in particular.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
207,571,25,19,Not particularly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
208,572,25,20,"Okay.  Now, when you saw her on March 19, 2019, the date of the accident that you were evaluating her for was June 11, 2015, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
209,576,26,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
210,577,26,2,"So in March of '19 you were almost four years post-accident, right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
211,579,26,4,"Approaching that, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
212,580,26,5,"Yeah, not quite four years.  So before you saw her on March 19th, you received the records that we've talked about, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
213,583,26,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
214,584,26,9,And you reviewed those records before seeing her?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
215,586,26,11,"So I kind of glanced through them as I go in.  I don't usually review all the medical records before the patient comes in because sometimes they don't come in.  So I review them a bit as I'm getting ready to go see the patient, and then I go see the patient, I talk to the patient and I'm kind of glancing through the medical records as we talk and discuss the case.  And then afterwards, I make sure I thoroughly review all of the records.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
216,596,26,21,"So at the time that you see the patient, do you get a history from the patient?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
217,599,27,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
218,600,27,2,"And so during your evaluation, I know you're glancing at the records, but are you also relying on the patient's verbal history?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
219,603,27,5,Very much so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
220,604,27,6,Okay.  And when generally do you review records after having seen the patient?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
221,606,27,8,As soon as I can after I see the patient.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
222,608,27,10,"Okay.  Now, in this case before you -- or when you saw Ms. Vaughn on March 19, 2019 when you reviewed her records, do you recall reviewing records that predated her date of accident of June 11, 2015?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
223,613,27,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
224,614,27,16,"Okay.  So at the time that you saw her or when you reviewed those records, you were aware that she was already undergoing physical therapy treatments?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
225,618,27,20,I was aware that she had a previous injury that had been treated and was in the course of being treated.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
226,622,28,1,"Okay.  And when you say in the course of being treated, is it fair for me to characterize that as ongoing?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
227,625,28,4,I think that's fair.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
228,626,28,5,"Okay.  Now, when you reviewed those records, did you pay any attention to her complaints of pain in particular?  And forgive me, I didn't word that terribly well.  When you were reviewing the records that predated her June 11, 2015 incident, did you pay any particular attention to her pain ratings that she had provided to her doctors based on their notes?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
229,635,28,14,"I mean, I read the notes.  I tried to take everything into account.  I don't remember specifically what her pain number ratings were.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,638,28,17,But is that something that you would pay attention to when you're reviewing them?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
231,640,28,19,"I mean, I try to pay attention to everything that's pertinent, and I think that's pertinent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
232,643,28,22,"Okay.  So based upon your review of Ms. Vaughn's records that predated the June 11, 2015 incident, are you familiar with her prior diagnoses of chronic pain and previous surgeries and other medical procedures?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
233,649,29,5,I am.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
234,650,29,6,Okay.  I'd like to just go through some of those with you quickly.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
235,652,29,8,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
236,653,29,9,"Now, you're familiar with her prior diagnosis of a musculoskeletal disorder, right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
237,655,29,11,"What do you mean by a musculoskeletal disorder?  That's kind of a big, all-encompassing term.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,658,29,14,I was hoping to ask you to explain that one to me.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
239,660,29,16,"Well, you'll have to show me where it was and I'll try to.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,662,29,18,I don't know that I can.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
241,663,29,19,Because that can mean a lot of different things.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,665,29,21,"Okay.  Well, what can it mean?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
243,666,29,22,"I would say it could mean almost any orthopedic problem.  I mean, a musculoskeletal disorder is pretty nonspecific.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,670,30,3,"Okay.  Well, let me back up.  Based on your review of Ms. Vaughn's records that predate the incident, you are aware that she was experiencing what I'd like to call as chronic pain issues?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
245,675,30,8,That's true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,676,30,9,"And those chronic pain issues that she was experiencing prior to June 11, 2015 were pretty much throughout her body, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
247,679,30,12,"So it looked to me like in the period of time most immediately before this injury, her complaints were largely related to neck, shoulder, upper back sort of areas.  Now, she told me that she did have problems with her low back that she was still having.  So I know that that's true, but she told me that they became dramatically worse after this injury. So although the notes don't really reflect a lot of treatment directed specifically at her low back, I know she was having some pain in the low back because she told me that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
248,692,31,2,"Okay.  Are you familiar with her prior -- with her diagnosis of like spinal stenosis or facet disease, and please correct me if I'm conflating diagnoses, that predated the June 11, 2015 incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
249,697,31,7,"Well, she definitely had some degenerative changes in her low back that predated this injury, and the things you're mentioning are degenerative.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,701,31,11,"Okay.  So spinal stenosis and facet disease, are they one and the same or are those two different?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
251,704,31,14,"So interesting.  So stenosis refers to a narrowing of the space available for either the cord, the spinal canal or the nerve roots. Okay.  And facet joint disease can help to produce that stenosis.  So stenosis is just the narrowing and that can be contributed to by many things, including facet degenerative changes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,711,31,21,"Thank you.  I will use the correct pronunciation. Now, along with those diagnoses, are you familiar with her prior complaints of diagnosis of neuropathy related thereto?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
253,717,32,4,"She didn't tell me specifically about neuropathy, but I knew that she had radiating complaints previously, especially from the neck and into the shoulder area.  I don't know that I remember specifically seeing neuropathy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,722,32,9,"Okay.  Now, based upon your review of the records and, of course, your visit with her on March 19th, is it fair to say that she had a diagnosis of chronic neck pain prior to the June 11, 2015 incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
255,727,32,14,"Well, I wasn't really evaluating her neck specifically, but I think that's fair to say.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
256,730,32,17,"Okay.  How about chronic low back pain, is it fair to say that based upon your review of the records and your evaluation of her that she had a prior diagnosis of chronic low back pain prior to the June 11, 2015 incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
257,735,32,22,"I think that's fair to say, too.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
258,737,33,1,"Okay.  Now, how about chronic hip pain, based upon your review of the records and your evaluation of her, is it fair to say that she had chronic hip pain prior to the June 11, 2015 incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
259,742,33,6,No.  I will tell you that I didn't focus on hips or many other different body parts.  I don't remember seeing that.  That's possible I guess.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,746,33,10,Okay.  Do you remember seeing that she had had trigger point injections that I believe were directed at that lower extremity pain?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
261,749,33,13,Was that by Dr. Barletta?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
262,750,33,14,I believe so.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
263,751,33,15,I think I remember seeing some trigger point injections.  I'm not sure I can tell you where they were given.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
264,754,33,18,"Okay.  Now, you mentioned earlier that Ms. Vaughn definitely had some degenerative conditions.  Based upon your review of the -- or the degenerative changes, I'm sorry, was how you phrased it.  Based upon your review of the records and your evaluation of her, is it fair to say that she had I think what we generally refer to as degenerative disc disease diagnosed prior to the June 11, 2015 incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
265,764,34,5,"Yeah, I think that's right.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
266,765,34,6,"Okay.  Now, she had also -- if I could just briefly focus on cervical spine issues that she had.  I know your report is mostly focused on her low back, but she had prior issues and complaints regarding her cervical spine before the June 11, 2015 incident, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
267,771,34,12,That's true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
268,772,34,13,"Great.  And those issues included -- I'm going to butcher the pronunciation, but radiculopathy?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
269,775,34,16,"That was not bad.  Yeah, I believe she had some radicular complaints.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
270,777,34,18,And did she also have cervical disc displacement?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
271,779,34,20,She definitely had I believe some cervical degenerative changes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
272,781,34,22,Okay.  What about a cervical disc bulge?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
273,784,35,2,"I can look.  She -- yes.  She had mild to moderate cervical spondylosis, which is degenerative change, and some disc osteophyte complexes, which is more degenerative change, and specifically degenerative disc disease.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
274,789,35,7,Thank you.  And she also had a prior diagnosis of polyarthritis I believe.  Do you recall that?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
275,792,35,10,I do know that she had some arthritis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
276,793,35,11,"If I see the word polyarthritis, what does that mean?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
277,795,35,13,That usually means in more than one joint.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
278,797,35,15,"Perfect.  Okay.  Now, based upon your review of the records and your evaluation and your visit with her on March 19, 2019, are you familiar with her prior need and treatment with pain management?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
279,802,35,20,I saw some of those records.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
280,803,35,21,Are you familiar with how long she has been -- had been in pain management when you saw her?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
281,807,36,2,I don't remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
282,808,36,3,"Okay.  If I told you that she testified that it had been about two decades, does that sound about right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
283,811,36,6,That could very well be.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
284,812,36,7,"Okay.  And are you familiar with the fact that she has testified that she was taking pain medications as of the June 11, 2015 date?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
285,815,36,10,"No, but it wouldn't be surprising to me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
286,817,36,12,Would that knowledge change your opinion in any way?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
287,819,36,14,I don't think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
288,820,36,15,"Now, Doctor, what is your understanding of the mechanism of injury alleged in this case?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
289,822,36,17,"So she described it to me as slipping on a wet floor with one -- and I asked her if she fell.  She said she didn't fall.  So one leg she said kind of slipped out in front of her and she ended up sort of extending her back, I guess to try to keep her balance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
290,829,37,1,"Did she tell you, if you remember, how far apart her feet were during this slip event?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
291,831,37,3,"If she did, I don't see it in my notes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
292,832,37,4,"Okay.  If she testified in her deposition that her front foot slipped out about two to three feet from the back foot, does that sound familiar?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
293,836,37,8,"She told me the leg went out in front, but I don't think I asked her how far.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
294,838,37,10,Okay.  Does it matter how far apart her feet separated when she slipped to your review and analysis?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
295,841,37,13,"I mean, if she slipped a foot and a half or two feet, I don't know that that makes a difference.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,844,37,16,Why not?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
297,845,37,17,"Because what I'm looking at is the mechanism of injury that's consistent with something that can cause this type of problem, and I thought her explanation of the episode sounded like something that could cause a problem in her back the way she was describing it to me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
298,853,38,2,Would you explain that to me?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
299,854,38,3,What do you mean?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
300,855,38,4,What about her explanation made you -- or is the basis for your opinion that the mechanism of injury was consistent with her injuries as alleged?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
301,859,38,8,"Well, when she described it to me, I mean, I can think of times myself when I slipped and I kind of jerked my body to catch myself. We know she didn't have a completely normal lumbar spine before that and I thought that sort of quick jerking trying to save yourself movement when your leg slips out in front of you could certainly cause a low back problem.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
302,867,38,16,Okay.  Thank you.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
303,868,38,17,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
304,869,38,18,"Now, Doctor, what is your understanding of her complaints based upon your review of the records and your evaluation of her immediately after the incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
305,873,38,22,"So what I saw from the Bowie Health Center where she was seen on the day she got hurt is that she had complaints of pain in her right shoulder, right low back and right hip.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,878,39,4,"Now, those complaints, is it fair to refer to them as subjective complaints?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
307,880,39,6,"Sure.  When the patient is making complaints about pain, that's subjective.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,882,39,8,"When she was treated at Bowie Health right after the incident, there were no objective findings of injury?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
309,885,39,11,"Oh, I don't know.  I have to look at the reports.  I'm not sure if there were any objective findings or not, but those complaints are certainly subjective.  I can look if you want.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
310,890,39,16,If you have it handy.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
311,891,39,17,I have it right in front of me.  I don't see any objective findings here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
312,893,39,19,Thank you.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
313,894,39,20,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
314,895,39,21,"Now, you have reviewed Ms. Vaughn's diagnostic imaging as part of your review of her records, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
315,899,40,2,I have.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
316,900,40,3,"Now, I would direct you to -- and you note this in your report, on June 18, 2015, so about a week, exactly a week after the accident, she had an MRI of her thoracic and lumbar spine.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
317,904,40,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
318,905,40,8,"Now, based upon your review of that MRI, is it fair to say that the findings were degenerative changes?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
319,908,40,11,I think that they were largely degenerative changes.  I didn't see any findings here that I would say were caused by this injury in particular.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
320,912,40,15,"So, in other words, is it fair to say that there was no evidence of a traumatic injury in that MRI?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
321,915,40,18,I couldn't point to anything in that MRI and say that that was traumatic.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
322,917,40,20,"Okay.  And in the June 18, 2015 MRI, there was no -- I'm sorry, I just lost my place -- there was no indication of a bulging disc or a herniated disc; is that right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
323,922,41,2,"So, yeah, there was a bulging disc at L3-4 to the left into the foramen, and at L4-5 there was a left foraminal disc protrusion with an annular tear.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,926,41,6,Where are you getting that?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
325,927,41,7,"Well, it's in my report right here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,928,41,8,"Oh, okay.  So if you could explain -- we're about what, seven, eight lines down?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
327,930,41,10,Yeah.  You see where it says was noted to reveal left neural foraminal HNP?  That's a disc herniation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,933,41,13,Okay.  So a disc herniation at L4-5? No.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
329,935,41,15,"It was at L4-5, yes, and then there was a bulge at L3-4.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,937,41,17,"Okay.  Now, Doctor, if I could direct your attention down a few more lines where you're talking about an MRI obtained on 10/22/16, which was then compared to her prior scans.  It says that one revealed the interval development of disc herniation at L3-4.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
331,944,42,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,945,42,2,"Is that different from the disc herniation you were just explaining to me with regard to the June 18, 2015 MRI?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
333,948,42,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,949,42,6,How is that different?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
335,950,42,7,It's a level above.  It's at the level where there was a disc bulge before.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,952,42,9,"I'm sorry, could you say that again?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
337,953,42,10,"Sure.  So in the first MRI scan from 6/18/15 at L3-4, there was -- the radiologist said moderate left foraminal narrowing due to a disc bulge.  So there was some bulging there, but not something that the radiologist called a frank disk herniation. When that scan that you were just talking about on 10/22/16 was done, they felt that there was actually -- the radiologist who read it felt that there had developed a disc herniation on the left side at L3-4, whereas the prior MRI scan had shown a bulge at that level.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,965,42,22,"Thank you, Doctor.  So is it fair to say that this problem starts out as a bulge and can, if it gets worse, become a herniation?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
339,969,43,3,It can.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,970,43,4,"That's the progression of the disease, the complaints or the -- I'm not sure what word I'm looking for here.  Please forgive me.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
341,973,43,7,"Let me help you.  So a disc bulge doesn't have to become a frank disc herniation. They don't always, but they can.  Like you just said, they can progress and it can become a herniation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,978,43,12,"Okay.  And based on the review of these MRIs, it looks like that's what happened to Ms. Vaughn?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
343,981,43,15,I think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
344,982,43,16,"Okay.  Now, how does a disc bulge become a herniation?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
345,984,43,18,"So through wear and tear, walking around, activities of daily living can put stress on the discs and that can cause the bulge to progress.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
346,988,43,22,"Okay.  Now, about -- I'll take you just a couple more lines down when you reviewed her updated MRI from July 21, 2017.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
347,992,44,3,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
348,993,44,4,This time it looks from your report like it revealed very mild multilevel degenerative spondylosis?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
349,996,44,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
350,997,44,8,"Can you explain what that means in relation to what you saw on the prior two MRIs, how it's different, if it is?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
351,1000,44,11,"So I'm not sure that it's actually very different.  So one of the things you have to be aware of is that different people can look at the same MRI scans and you can get different readings.  Okay.  It's an interpretation thing and not everyone interprets the findings on an MRI scan in exactly the same way. So it's hard sometimes to compare findings based on reports.  Sometimes it's easier.  Like this, we're talking about a disc herniation and before we were talking about a disc bulge.  I think that's significant.  But, I mean, I think the bottom line is she definitely has some degenerative changes and she has, again, the left L3-4 disc herniation and protrusion and now they're describing it actually as an extrusion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
352,1018,45,6,And what is that?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
353,1019,45,7,So an extrusion is where the piece of disc actually breaks off from the main disc and it's extruded.  It's separate.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
354,1022,45,10,"Thank you, Doctor.  Now, the July 21, 2017 MRI was right before she had her surgery with Dr. Schreiber on August 31, 2017, right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
355,1025,45,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
356,1026,45,14,"So was that surgery to -- well, tell me what that surgery was for.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
357,1028,45,16,"So in that surgery Dr. Schreiber addressed the two levels of concern, that being the L4-5 level and the L3-4 level, that we were just talking about.  So he decompressed basically the areas where it looked like there was some narrowing and compromise of the neurologic structures with that surgery.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
358,1036,46,1,Okay.  So did he repair the extrusion or is that unrelated?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
359,1038,46,3,He removed it.  That's what the discectomy is.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
360,1040,46,5,"I see.  So the discectomy is removing the one that had come out of place, what we call the extrusion.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
361,1043,46,8,"Yes, it's removing the herniated disc.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
362,1044,46,9,Understood.  And the laminectomy is creating space?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
363,1046,46,11,"The laminectomy is removing the lamina, which is the bony part of the back of the spine. So to get down to this area, you have to take off some of the ligaments and then you have to either remove a part of the lamina, which is called the laminotomy, or you can remove the whole lamina if you need to get a really wide exposure, which is called the laminectomy, and just allows access to the area where you need to do your work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
364,1056,46,21,Okay.  And what work?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
365,1057,46,22,"So he did -- he removed the L4 lamina. He did foraminotomies at L5 on both sides, which means that he opened up the space in the neural foramina for the nerve roots.  He did L4 foraminotomies and then he did the partial laminectomy at L3 and the discectomy where he removed the disc.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
366,1065,47,7,Thank you.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
367,1066,47,8,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
368,1067,47,9,"All right, Doctor.  I'm going to skip a page and move to your evaluation of Ms. Vaughn on page 3 of your report.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
369,1070,47,12,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
370,1071,47,13,If you could look at the bottom where I believe you have your opinions laid out.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
371,1073,47,15,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
372,1074,47,16,You say in your report that it is your opinion that it is more likely than not that the slip on the wet floor in Walmart contributed to the need for the surgery that was subsequently performed.  Which surgery are you referring to in that statement in your report?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
373,1080,47,22,"Well, I think she's only had one lumbar surgery.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
374,1083,48,2,So it is the lumbar surgery specifically.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
375,1085,48,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
376,1086,48,5,"Okay.  Now, you are aware that Ms. Vaughn also had shoulder surgery in the time between her accident at Walmart and the time that she saw you, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
377,1090,48,9,I am.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
378,1091,48,10,And that shoulder surgery is in no way related to the Walmart incident based upon your review of the records and your evaluation of her.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
379,1095,48,14,I don't think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
380,1096,48,15,"Okay.  Sorry, I got myself out of order.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
381,1098,48,17,No problem.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
382,1099,48,18,"Okay.  I skipped over what I wanted to ask you about the August 31, 2017 surgery.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
383,1101,48,20,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
384,1102,48,21,"So, first, that was two years after her incident at Walmart on June 11, 2015.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
385,1105,49,1,That's true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
386,1106,49,2,And is it fair to say that it was -- the purpose of that surgery was to treat the bulging disc and herniated disc that we talked about?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
387,1110,49,6,"Well, it was to treat the anatomical problems that were causing her symptoms that she was having, but really the surgery is for the pain and symptoms and the problems that she's having.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
388,1115,49,11,"I see.  But the symptoms and the problems are caused by the bulging disc and herniation, or no?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
389,1118,49,14,"So, yeah, I think that they were, but you have to understand that there's -- there are people who have changes that look like this that don't have any pain and they don't get surgery. So surgery is for the pain that's associated with these changes that we saw on the imaging studies.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
390,1125,49,21,"Okay.  And when you refer to them as changes, this is degenerative changes?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
391,1128,50,1,"Degenerative changes, disc herniations. You know, those all can be degenerative.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
392,1130,50,3,"Okay.  Now, based on your review of the records and your evaluation of Ms. Vaughn, she had the changes that this surgery was used to treat prior to the June 11, 2015 incident, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
393,1135,50,8,Some of them.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
394,1136,50,9,Okay.  What was new?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
395,1137,50,10,"Well, that L3-4 disc herniation that we were just talking about and the extrusion developed after the injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
396,1140,50,13,"Are those kind of problems, can they be characterized as degenerative changes?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
397,1142,50,15,"They're sometimes degenerative. They're sometimes traumatic.  As I told you, I wouldn't be able to call relation of these changes as traumatic, so -- I mean, they happen in different ways.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
398,1147,50,20,"Okay.  Thank you, Doctor.  I apologize for getting us off track there.  If I could go back to your opinion about the slip on the wet floor contributing to the need for surgery. When you use the word contributed, is it fair to say that you would agree with me that the incident at Walmart is not the sole cause of her need for surgery in this case?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
399,1156,51,6,That's completely true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
400,1157,51,7,What other causes or contributing factors can you point to that are at play for Ms. Vaughn?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
401,1160,51,10,"Besides the fall?  Or not the fall, but the slip thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
402,1162,51,12,Right.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
403,1163,51,13,"Yeah.  So I think her degenerative changes that preexisted this and the fact that she was having some symptoms before this point to the fact that this incident was not the only thing that contributed to her back problems, which ultimately required surgical treatment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
404,1169,51,19,"Based upon your review of her records and talking with her in your visit, are you able to apportion in any way by percentages or any other means how much the Walmart incident is a cause for her needing the surgery as compared to the other contributing factors that you just described?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_chat
405,1177,52,4,Objection. You can answer.,side_chat,MR. KOLKER,start_chat
406,1179,52,6,"So that's a good question, and the answer really honestly is I didn't think of apportioning it and I didn't really think about that.  I mean, I'd be making up a number, which I don't want to do.  I think part of it was -- I think it was contributed to by the injury because she told me things got so much worse after the injury, but clearly it wasn't, you know, a perfectly normal back before that.  So, I mean, there's a contribution of both and I can't tell you exactly what the percentages are of each.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
407,1192,52,19,"Based on your review of the records and these prior conditions that she was already complaining of, do you think it's more likely than not that she would have had the back surgery anyway?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
408,1198,53,2,"I don't know that I could say that because there are a lot of people running around with a lot of degenerative changes and findings who live with them, and sometimes they're asymptomatic, sometimes they're minimally symptomatic, but they for sure don't all end up with surgery.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
409,1205,53,9,But it's true that Ms. Vaughn was not asymptomatic before the incident.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
410,1207,53,11,That's true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
411,1208,53,12,"Okay.  All right.  Now, it looks like the second part of your opinion here in your report, if I could point to the last sentence on this page 3, is that the patient has sustained a permanent impairment, a portion of which also has been contributed to by a slip at Walmart. Am I reading that mostly right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
412,1215,53,19,I think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
413,1216,53,20,"Now, when you talk about a permanent impairment, can you tell me what you mean by that?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
414,1220,54,1,"Sure.  So an impairment is a term that we use to refer to a body part system, body function that's not working normally as it should.  The person is not a hundred percent, in this case with regard to her low back.  And then there's a related concept of disability, which is not really the medical determination which refers to how an impairment affects a person's life, activities of daily living, the ability to earn a living, you know, things like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
415,1230,54,11,Did you do a disability -- what's the word for that?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
416,1232,54,13,Evaluation?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
417,1233,54,14,Yeah.  Disability rating in this case?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
418,1234,54,15,No.  I don't do disability ratings.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
419,1235,54,16,Why not?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
420,1236,54,17,"Because, again, so impairment is the medical thing that we look at and disability is a judgment that someone else makes about what effects they have.  That's not really a medical judgment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
421,1241,54,22,"Understood.  Thank you, Doctor.  So where you state in your report here that it's a portion of the permanent impairment is contributed to by the accident at Walmart, can you quantify portion in any way based on the way you've characterized the permanent impairment in this case?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
422,1249,55,7,"My answer would be the same as it was for the need for the surgery.  So, you know, you take her as she is today and she certainly has an impairment, and I think part of it was contributed to by this slip and part of it was contributed to by what she had before, and I haven't thought about or tried to give an estimation of percentage contributions from each of those.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
423,1258,55,16,"Understood.  Since you've called it a portion, I'm guessing your answer is going to be the same as last time, but are the other contributing factors that would round out the rest of the pie that leads you to opine that she has a permanent impairment?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
424,1264,55,22,"Sure.  So, again, yeah, you're right, it would be the same.  So her preexisting degenerative changes, you know, she had some prior problems with her back.  Those would be the other things that go into the impairment that she has.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
425,1271,56,6,"Now, based on your review of the records that predate her injury, we've already discussed that she had these diagnoses of prior chronic pain, she had many, many complaints of pain and back issues and issues in other areas of the body.  Based on your review of those records, is it -- would it be fair to say that she had this impairment before the incident at Walmart?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
426,1280,56,15,"Well, I don't think she had the same impairment before this incident that she has now.  She's had surgery.  She's had alteration in her anatomy.  Things are different now than they were before.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
427,1285,56,20,"Okay.  Now, did the surgery -- was the surgery successful?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
428,1287,56,22,"She told me that she had some improvement from it, but not complete, so I think it helped some she said.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
429,1291,57,3,Okay.  And your evaluation of that is simply based on her subjective history to you?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
430,1293,57,5,Completely.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
431,1294,57,6,Okay.  There are no diagnostic imagings that you've reviewed to compare before the surgery to after the surgery.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
432,1297,57,9,So are you asking me if her imaging studies improved from before to after surgery?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
433,1299,57,11,Yes.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
434,1300,57,12,I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
435,1301,57,13,"Okay.  Now, it's true -- so, Doctor, did you see Ms. Vaughn before March 19, 2019?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
436,1303,57,15,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
437,1304,57,16,Yes.  When did you see her?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
438,1305,57,17,"I had seen her before on February 16, 2018.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
439,1307,57,19,And what was that visit for?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
440,1308,57,20,That was another evaluation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
441,1309,57,21,"And that was in 2018, February 2018, so 2.5ish years after the June 11, 2015 incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
442,1312,58,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
443,1313,58,2,"Okay.  And what was Ms. Vaughn seeing you for on March 19, 2019?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
444,1315,58,4,She was complaining about her right shoulder and low back.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
445,1317,58,6,Was there a particular incident that was the root of that visit?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
446,1319,58,8,"She was talking to me about an injury that had occurred on July 20, 2014 in a Rose's store when she sat down in a chair that fell apart causing her to fall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
447,1323,58,12,"Do you recall the circumstances of that fall?  And what I'm getting at is like how she fell, onto what area of her body she fell?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
448,1326,58,15,I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
449,1327,58,16,"Okay.  Now, when she came to see you on February 16, 2018 for that evaluation, she was also complaining about low back pain, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
450,1330,58,19,She was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
451,1331,58,20,"Okay.  Sorry, Doctor, just one --",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
452,1332,58,21,No problem.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
453,1333,58,22,"Oh, did I ever -- I did give this.  I may not have.  Forgive me, Doctor.  Very, very briefly, I'm showing you what's been marked as Exhibit 4.  Is that your March 19, 2019 report?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
454,1338,59,4,It is.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
455,1339,59,5,Great.  Thank you.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
456,1340,59,6,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,is brackets

458,1344,59,10,"Doctor, I'm showing you Deposition Exhibit Number 5.  Is that your report from your evaluation of Ms. Vaughn on February 16, 2018?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
459,1347,59,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
460,1348,59,14,"Thank you.  Now, in -- I think I was just asking you before I realized my little mistake there that one of her complaints that you detail in your report as the chief complaint is the low back; is that right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
461,1353,59,19,True.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
462,1354,59,20,"Okay.  And so during that evaluation, did you -- in addition to focusing on the shoulder, which I know you've mentioned, did you also focus on the low back?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
463,1359,60,2,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
464,1360,60,3,"Okay.  And what was your evaluation of her low back pain as of that visit, if you recall?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
465,1363,60,6,Do you mean my conclusions?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
466,1364,60,7,"Well, so, yes, yes, I do, but it seemed to me that you didn't really make any opinions in here about the low back, so I was hoping you could tell me what conclusions you did find about the low back in this report.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
467,1369,60,12,"Well, I said I was unable to causally relate her ongoing back pain or the need for her low back surgery to this injury from 7/20/14.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
468,1372,60,15,Do you remember why that was?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
469,1373,60,16,"Yeah.  I mean, she commented on and complained of some low back pain initially for, I thought, a relatively short period of time and then there's not much mention of it, and so there was a pretty long time when she wasn't complaining about it and then it came up again after this other injury that we're talking about.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
470,1382,61,2,"Okay.  Now, when you saw her on February 16, 2018, you had her medical records beforehand or at the time of your evaluation to review, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
471,1386,61,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
472,1387,61,7,"And I think we already went through just a couple of times that she -- well, you agreed with me earlier that she had been complaining about low back pain earlier in 2015, right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
473,1392,61,12,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
474,1393,61,13,"Okay.  So that was after the July 20, 2014 incident at Rose's, but before the Walmart incident, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
475,1396,61,16,"Yeah.  You know, I'm not sure if it was 2015 or two-thousand -- most of them with regard to her neck were in 2014 I believe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
476,1399,61,19,"Okay.  Well, if her records did show that she was complaining of pain in her low back in early 2015, so after the incident at Rose's but before Walmart, would that change your opinion as to whether the low back pain at that time was causally related to the incident at Rose's?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
477,1407,62,4,I don't think so because I already knew she had a long history of ongoing back pain.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
478,1409,62,6,Before the incident at Rose's?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
479,1410,62,7,"Before the incident at Rose's, I think you told me she had had pain in her back for 20 years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
480,1413,62,10,"I think it was pain management for 20 years, but, yes, I think that's fair to say.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
481,1415,62,12,"I mean, she told me she had, you know, a long history with regard to her back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
482,1417,62,14,"Okay.  And when you saw her in February of 2018, were you also aware of the Walmart incident that she's complaining about?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
483,1420,62,17,"Yes.  I don't know that I knew it was in Walmart, but I had talked about the episode that she had.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
484,1423,62,20,Okay.  Did that factor into your evaluation of her based on the low back complaints that she was still treating for when you saw her in 2018?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
485,1428,63,2,I think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
486,1429,63,3,How did that factor in?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
487,1430,63,4,"Well, it seemed like a much more reasonable explanation for her ongoing low back pain than the fall in Rose's.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
488,1433,63,7,"But the fall in Rose's, she was seated in a chair, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
489,1435,63,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
490,1436,63,10,"And fell down striking the floor, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
491,1438,63,12,"She fell back, yeah, from the chair that broke she said.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
492,1440,63,14,"Okay.  So if she fell backwards, inevitably she landed on her back and/or shoulder, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
493,1443,63,17,"I mean, I don't know what she landed on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
494,1445,63,19,"Right.  But if she fell backwards, there's -- I mean, the law of physics means that she had to have fallen onto her backside in some way, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
495,1450,64,1,Maybe.  I don't know how she fell. Sometimes people fall forwards.  I don't know how she fell.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
496,1453,64,4,"Okay.  Well, either way she did make -- she fell onto the floor, so she made impact with the floor.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
497,1456,64,7,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
498,1457,64,8,"Okay.  And why is it your opinion, if it is your opinion, that falling and landing on the floor is not as consistent with the low back pain as a slip in which you do not fall?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
499,1461,64,12,"Well, it is consistent with low back pain and she had low back pain, and then it was -- she was treated, but her treatment notes reflect treatment in the vast predominance for her neck and shoulder.  And if you look at the notes from the Multi-Specialty, they're really talking about her cervical/thoracic spine, neck/upper back and they're really not talking about her low back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
500,1470,64,21,"Okay.  Now, looking back at the records -- well, I'm sorry, let me start that one again.  You reviewed records obviously after her incident at Walmart, too, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
501,1475,65,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
502,1476,65,4,"And that included a lot of physical therapy treatment records, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
503,1478,65,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
504,1479,65,7,"And in those records, if I may characterize the bulk of them, reference treatments to both her shoulder, which I believe in your report that we've marked as Exhibit 5, you causally relate to the incident at Rose's and her low back pain.  Isn't that -- is that right, is that fair to say?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
505,1486,65,14,"There's a lot of notes that reflect treatment to both, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
506,1488,65,16,"And so based on your two reports, if I could combine them for just a second, it seems to me that your opinion -- and tell me if I'm wrong, your opinion is that her shoulder issues are all attributable to the incident at Rose's, and the low back is attributable to -- with the exception of the underlying chronic pain that she had before, attributable to the Walmart incident.  Is that fair to say?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
507,1498,66,3,"Well, the shoulder I also think was related to some preexisting problems.  But of these injuries we're talking about, I would relate that to the one from 2014.  And the ongoing low back issues, I would relate to the incident at Walmart.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
508,1504,66,9,"Understood.  So given that and given that her physical therapy treatments were for both of those body parts, do you have an opinion as to how -- well, let me start that over.  Is there a way for you to parse out what of that treatment is related to the Walmart incident versus the incident at Rose's or her underlying degenerative conditions?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
509,1512,66,17,"Well, I would say that the treatment to the low back, I would relate to the Walmart incident and the treatment to her shoulder I would relate to the Rose's problem.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
510,1516,66,21,"And is there -- can you tell me how you would apportion that, if you could, based on your review of the records?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
511,1520,67,2,I don't really know how I would apportion it beyond saying that a portion of it is related to this other injury and a portion of it is related to this Walmart problem.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
512,1524,67,6,"Is there any way for you to quantify that, like 50/50, 30/70?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
513,1526,67,8,"I mean, I suppose it would depend on how much time, effort and service was done to each of those body parts in each individual therapy session, which probably would be pretty hard to figure out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
514,1531,67,13,"Okay.  I haven't been able to figure it out, so.  But I am not nearly as smart as you are, Doctor, so --",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
515,1534,67,16,I'm not sure about that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
516,1535,67,17,Don't sell yourself short.,side_chat,MR. KOLKER,start_question
517,1537,67,19,"All right.  Let me get myself back on track here.  Okay.  So we've talked about your visits with Ms. Vaughn on March 19, 2019 and February 16, 2018.  Do you recall any other visits with Ms. Vaughn for any reason?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
518,1543,68,2,"So, again, I'm relying on my records. I don't see any other visits in my notes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
519,1545,68,4,Okay.  Have you spoken with Ms. Vaughn since March 2019?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
520,1547,68,6,Not that I recall.,a,THE WITNESS,is brackets
521,1548,68,7,(Deposition Exhibit Number 6 was marked for identification.),brackets,,start_question
522,1551,68,10,"Okay, Doctor.  Let me mark as Deposition Exhibit 6 this -- I'll represent to you this is the report authored by Dr. -- I think it's Mark Rosenthal, I should know that, Mark Rosenthal about Ms. Vaughn in this case. Have you seen that before?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
523,1557,68,16,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
524,1558,68,17,Would you like to take just a moment to read it?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
525,1560,68,19,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
526,1561,68,20,"Thank you, Doctor.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
527,1562,68,21,Sure.  Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
528,1563,68,22,"Thank you, Doctor.  Now, do you know Dr. Rosenthal, either personally or professionally?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
529,1567,69,3,"I mean, I've seen his name on reports before.  I don't know him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
530,1569,69,5,Never met him?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
531,1570,69,6,I don't think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
532,1571,69,7,"Okay.  Now, as you just read, Dr. Rosenthal has done a records review in this case and has provided his opinions in this report, and one of those opinions is that her complaints and physical findings are the same after the event as they were before the event, and that's based on his review of the records that he puts forth in his report.  Do you agree with that assessment?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
533,1580,69,16,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
534,1581,69,17,Why not?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
535,1582,69,18,Because of what she told me about her pain and how she reacted and how her pain changed after the injury.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
536,1585,69,21,"And can you describe that for me, please, like what about it.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
537,1588,70,1,Sure.  She told me that her pain was dramatically increased by this slip and that it remained at a significantly elevated level throughout her treatment.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
538,1592,70,5,Okay.  So is it fair to say that your assessment on that point is simply based on her subjective complaints as opposed to any specific findings in the records?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
539,1596,70,9,"Sure.  I mean, it's based on her history that she gave me and I'm taking her at her word.  If her history was different, I could have a completely different conclusion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
540,1600,70,13,Understood.  What I'm going to refer to as the second part here of Dr. Rosenthal's opinions is that she had a new onset of symptoms -- this is in the third paragraph from the bottom -- in 2017 and that's what led to the surgery that she had in 2018.  Do you agree with that assessment?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
541,1607,70,20,"So let me just point out something that I noticed which is that, you know, Dr. Rosenthal doesn't appear to have had all the medical records when he did this review.  He says she does eventually have an MRI of the lumbar spine July 21, 2017. There were two MRI scans before that he doesn't seem to be aware of having been done, and I don't know that that might not have changed some of his conclusions.  I don't know because I'm not him, but to know that there was an MRI done, you know, in the neighborhood of a week or so after this injury and that there was another MRI done in 2016 and that this MRI that he's talking about was far from the first MRI of her low back since this incident occurred, so the bottom line is I disagree.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
542,1625,71,15,"Okay.  Well, since you mentioned the prior MRIs, it is true, isn't it, that those MRIs showed different levels, I think is how you characterized of problems in her spine, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
543,1629,71,19,"Well, they showed different degrees of problems at a couple of different levels of her spine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
544,1632,71,22,Okay.  And so if -- is it fair for me to say that the degree of problem in 2017 was worse than in 2015?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
545,1636,72,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
546,1637,72,4,"Okay.  So then is it also fair to say that if it's worse two years later, it could be characterized as a new onset of symptoms?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
547,1640,72,7,No.  To me worse is not new.  Worse is an increasing level of symptoms.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
548,1642,72,9,Okay.  And explain to me why it would get worse.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
549,1644,72,11,"Well, if her changes in her lumbar spine got worse, she had a disc extrusion -- well, she had a protrusion, then she had an extrusion.  That certainly is consistent I think with a worsening.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
550,1649,72,16,"And what generally causes that, those worsening stages this quick?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
551,1651,72,18,"The worsening of -- I'm not sure what you mean.  The worsening of symptoms, the worsening of the MRI findings?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
552,1654,72,21,The changes that I believe we see on the MRI.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
553,1657,73,1,"So I think we talked about that. That's -- you know, you can have changes like that if there's a problem with the disc, degenerative or injury to a disc, with time, with wear and tear.  Although it doesn't always happen, that can progress, can worsen and can develop into a herniation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
554,1664,73,8,"Understood.  So if we see a progression here in her MRI findings that you've reviewed from the 2015, 2016, 2017, that progression is it fair to say that that is related to the degenerative wear and tear kind of life changes as opposed to a traumatic injury?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
555,1670,73,14,"It could be, and this is where you have to go to the history, talk to the patient about how she was doing, what sorts of changes she experienced in her symptoms relative to the timing of these injuries.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
556,1675,73,19,"Okay.  Thank you, Doctor.  Let me just run through your opinions real quick and then I think we'll be all set here.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
557,1678,73,22,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
558,1680,74,1,"So if you are subpoenaed to appear at trial, will you be offering an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to what caused Ms. Vaughn's alleged injuries?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
559,1684,74,5,I think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
560,1685,74,6,And what is that opinion?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
561,1686,74,7,It's the opinion that she had an underlying degenerative condition and that this fall aggravated that condition and contributed to her ultimate need for surgery.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
562,1690,74,11,And what is the foundation for that opinion?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
563,1692,74,13,"I mean, I think that's what we've been talking about the whole time.  The foundation is the fact that she had some preexisting problems and some preexisting pain and some preexisting changes on MRI scans, and she had this slip in the Walmart and developed significantly increased pain at that time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
564,1699,74,20,"Thank you, Doctor.  Now, if subpoenaed to appear at trial, do you intend to offer any opinions to a reasonable degree of medical certainty or probability as to her damages?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
565,1704,75,2,What do you mean?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
566,1705,75,3,"Well, you told me earlier you hadn't reviewed any medical bills.  Do you intend to offer any opinions related thereto?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
567,1708,75,6,"I mean, I could have opinions if I reviewed the medical records and bills, but I don't think -- I haven't so far.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
568,1711,75,9,Okay.  Do you intend to offer any opinion if subpoenaed to appear at trial as to Ms. Vaughn's pain and suffering?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
569,1714,75,12,"I mean, I can talk about the problems that she had that she talked to me about and the symptoms that she has and the activities in her life that are affected.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
570,1718,75,16,Okay.  And what would that opinion be?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
571,1719,75,17,"Well, she told me that -- so she told me that she had intermittent and dull, sometimes sharp pain in her low back.  It ranged from a 3 to 7 over 10 level of intensity.  That's a scale I ask them about where zero is no pain at all, 10 is the worse pain they could ever imagine. Pain radiating into both lower extremities, more marked on the right side than the left, numbness, tingling and weakness in both legs, more pain with prolonged sitting, standing, walking.  Attempted jogging, repetitive bending, stooping and lifting, she had problems with stiffness and weakness. Pushing, pulling, twisting activities bothered her back, and I think that's mostly the functional kind of stuff that we talked about.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
572,1736,76,11,"Great.  Thank you.  Well, one thing we did not talk about if subpoenaed to appear at trial, do you intend to offer any opinions as to the need for future treatment that you would relate to the Walmart incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
573,1741,76,16,"So I didn't say anything about that, but my recommendation would be home exercise, stretching, strengthening, core strengthening program.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
574,1745,76,20,"Okay.  So then if you would recommend a home exercise program, is it fair to say that you would not offer any opinions at trial as to future medical costs?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
575,1750,77,2,That's fair to say.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
576,1751,77,3,"Okay.  Now, I noted in your report I believe you noted that she, Ms. Vaughn, was not working at the time you saw her, correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
577,1754,77,6,"No.  So she told me she was unemployed at the time of the injury.  When I saw her, she told me she was working at customer service.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
578,1757,77,9,"Forgive me, I meant to say at the time of the incident.  So -- and then she was working.  Okay.  So if subpoenaed to appear at trial, do you intend to offer any opinions as to whether Ms. Vaughn had to miss any time from work as related to this injury?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
579,1763,77,15,"No.  She was unemployed, so I don't really think about time missed from work because she wasn't working at the time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
580,1766,77,18,"Very good.  Doctor, have we talked about all of the opinions that you would offer at trial if subpoenaed to testify in this case?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
581,1769,77,21,"I mean, I don't know.  If you ask me another question, I might have a different opinion.  I mean, I think these are most of them that we're talking about.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

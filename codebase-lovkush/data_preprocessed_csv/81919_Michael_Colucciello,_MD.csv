3,177,7,7,"Good evening, Doctor.  We met just before this deposition began; is that right?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
4,180,7,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,181,7,11,And you and I have never meet before or spoken before?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
6,183,7,13,Never met or spoken before.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,184,7,14,You understand that I'm here to take your deposition because you've been identified as an expert witness in the case of Cook versus Wang?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
8,188,7,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,189,7,19,"And because I know you take that oath very seriously, I just want to have a couple of agreements with you.  If I ask a question that you don't understand or that you don't hear or that is confusing, will you let me know that?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
10,195,7,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,197,8,1,"I will be happy to repeat the question or rephrase the question, but I'm going to need for you to let me know that you don't understand it.  All right?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
12,201,8,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,202,8,6,"And if you answer my question, can I assume that you understood it?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
14,204,8,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,205,8,9,"Also, as we go through the deposition, it is important that we not talk at the same time.  The court reporter needs to take down a good record.  So please let me finish my question before you start your answer, and I will be careful not to begin my next question until you've finished; is that okay?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
16,213,8,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,214,8,18,"If per chance I think that you're finished and you're not, just say, hey, I wasn't finish, and I will be happy to let you say whatever you need to truthfully answer the previous question.  All right?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
18,219,8,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,220,8,24,"Also, it's not an endurance contest.  If you need to take a break, you can take a break.  I will try to move along and explore your opinions as quickly as I can, but I do have some questions to ask you.  You also understand that I'm going to hold you to the answers that you say today when you appear at trial or when the remaining portion of your testimony is played for the jury.  I'm going to expect you to tell the truth consistently throughout this case.  All right?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
20,232,9,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,233,9,11,Have you ever given a deposition before?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
22,235,9,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,236,9,14,How many occasions?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
24,237,9,15,I'm not going to be able to answer that accurately.  If I may give you an approximation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,240,9,18,Sure.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
26,241,9,19,"It would be less than ten, and I've been in practice since 1992.  So that's 27 years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,244,9,22,"In the approximately ten or less depositions that you've given, have any of them been in medical malpractice cases?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
28,247,9,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,249,10,1,Have all of them been in that subject?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
30,251,10,3,"As an expert witness, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,252,10,4,Have you ever testified in a case where you are a party?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
32,254,10,6,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,255,10,7,Okay.  Have you ever been a party to a lawsuit?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
34,257,10,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,258,10,10,What kind of case was that?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
36,259,10,11,"This was in the late 1990's.  It was a retinal detachment repair, which was done on an emergent basis successfully. Postoperatively, the patient had strabismus, crossed eyes.  I referred the patient immediately to the appropriate specialist.  The eye was saved from the retinal detachment. The crossed eye specialist, strabismologist, elected to observe the patient rather than treat the patient surgically.  The crossed eyes did not improve so the patient sued me along with her husband for lack of consortium.  The case dragged on for approximately a year and a half.  When it was time to name the expert, I named my expert and they, at that time, dropped the case saying that I didn't do any harm, didn't do anything wrong.  That was entirely dropped at that time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,278,11,4,Did you give a deposition in that case?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
38,280,11,6,"No.  It never got to that point. I met with the lawyer that was representing me several times.  Again, this was approximately 20 years ago, and it was my only experience in malpractice cases.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,285,11,11,"All right.  And you can certainly relate to the fact that sometimes a patient may be dissatisfied with the result of care and chooses to file a lawsuit, which may or may not have merit, true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
40,290,11,16,Object to form.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_question
41,293,11,19,You can still answer the question.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
42,295,11,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,296,11,22,"In working on this case, I would like to know how you were first contacted and what you were told about the case and then how you embarked on your review and analysis of the case to reach the opinions that you've expressed.  So who contacted you?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
44,303,12,3,I was contacted by Mr. Akins.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,304,12,4,And what did Kelly Akins tell you?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
46,306,12,6,He gave me a broad overview of the case and asked whether or not I felt that I could render an opinion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,309,12,9,All right.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
48,310,12,10,I said I could review it and render an opinion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,312,12,12,"All right.  When he spoke with you and asked you if you would review the case, you didn't make up your mind until you had all the materials sent to you?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
50,316,12,16,I made up my mind that I would be able to review the case prior to that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,318,12,18,Sure.  But as far --,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
52,319,12,19,But I said I wasn't sure which way I would go until I had the opportunity to review the documents.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,322,12,22,"Okay.  Because you've testified in other cases, you know that the jury system that may evaluate evidence and decide factual disputes and evaluate the credibility of witnesses, needs to have individuals who are careful in the way they analyze and testify to make sure that they have a sound basis for their opinions.  Would that be true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
54,331,13,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,332,13,6,"And I take it that when you undertook this responsibility to review the case and let Mr. Akins know what you thought, there is some certain ethical principles that you used to guide you as to how best to do that.  Would that be true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
56,338,13,12,I'm guided by medical principle.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,339,13,13,Okay.  For example --,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
58,340,13,14,"In evaluating a case, the most important aspect of that is evaluating based on sound medical principles, which of course have ethical underpinnings.  Is that what you're getting at?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,345,13,19,"Yes.  And just simple facts that you want to make sure that if you're offering opinions, it falls within the area of your expertise.  Would that be true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
60,349,13,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,350,13,24,You wouldn't review a case that was outside your area of expertise?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
62,353,14,1,I would not review a cardiac case.  You're correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,355,14,3,"And, likewise, when you get the materials, you want to review those in a fair and honest and objective way as the care that you're reviewing unfolded in the day-by-day process of treatment.  Would that be true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
64,360,14,8,Can you repeat that again.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,361,14,9,"I can.  What I would like to say, you don't look at the result and then go back in hindsight.  You try to view the facts as they unfolded to the clinician or the doctor that is trying to make decisions in order to fairly evaluate their judgment based on the circumstances that they confronted?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
66,368,14,16,"It's very important to look at the dynamics of the case and the setting of the case.  Not only with regard to the flow, but what the pervasive treatment is at the time the case was occurring.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,373,14,21,Okay.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
68,374,14,22,"So that's very dynamic because the way that they treat something nowadays, may be different than the way we treated it years ago.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,379,15,1,Okay.  And why -- I know you've eluded to some reasons as to why it's important to look at the circumstances that you're evaluating at the time they occurred.  Are there any other reasons other than the fact that treatment may change or that new modalities may surface?  Any other reasons why it's important to carefully look at the facts and circumstances that were known at the time clinical judgments were made?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
70,389,15,11,"That's very important.  I try to look at it very objectively, but I also realize that I'm in the unique position, having practiced retina, a retina subspecialty, and most uveitis in the United States today is treated by retina specialists, as you may know. Having practiced for 27 years and having many patients who present in a similar fashion, that I'm able to be in a position to not only have studied the particular issue at hand, having seen it evolve over the years and how we treat this now versus how we treated it before, but also having had several similar patients.  So I'm able to evaluate it from that standpoint as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,405,16,1,Would it be true that every patient has their own unique presentation?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
72,407,16,3,"Every patient has unique presentation, unique luggage, unique characteristics that we have to take into consideration.  Unique medical histories, medications, surgical histories, immune status, and background that we need to take into account when we're evaluating the patient as a whole in order to assimilate the picture and synthesize it to approach the problem in the best way for each individual patient.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,417,16,13,"Okay.  And in the practice that you have, you're in a group of other ophthalmologists that have different areas of specialty; is that true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
74,421,16,17,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,422,16,18,"And is almost all of your practice -- in your subspecialty of retina and then even some other subspecialty areas of interests, is almost all of it referable practice for you and your group?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
76,427,16,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,428,16,24,So --,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
78,429,16,25,"I'm so sorry.  Not only within the doctors in the group, but referrals that I get from outside of the group.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,433,17,3,Okay.  Are you familiar with Texas Retina Associates?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
80,435,17,5,I am familiar with their names. It all depends on what you mean by familiar.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,437,17,7,Yeah.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
82,438,17,8,"I know that, you know, I've seen over the years attending meetings the American Society of Retina Specialists.  I've seen Dr. Fuller, I believe it is.  I think he's got a couple of sons in the group, if I'm not mistaken.  Dr. Spencer has been there for a number of years.  But outside of that, I'm really not familiar with them.  I just know of them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,447,17,17,"Yeah.  It wouldn't be surprising if, like your specialty, they have individuals in different parts of Texas and beyond that refer the most complex cases to them, just like people up here refer the puzzling cases, the most complex cases to your place?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
84,453,17,23,Object to form.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_question
85,457,18,1,Would that be true?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
86,458,18,2,Object to form.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_question
87,461,18,5,You can answer.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
88,462,18,6,"It's very difficult to attempt to make an analogy in that situation because -- and I see where you're trying to come from, but there are so many excellent groups in Texas. That for me to assume that all of the most complex cases are going to go to Texas Retina Associates, I think, would be incorrect because there is a lot of excellent doctors in Texas and in that environment that -- you understand what I'm saying?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,472,18,16,Sure.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
90,473,18,17,It's difficult for me to make a definitive analogy.  We all have difficult cases.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,476,18,20,"Okay.  Let me just ask the facts of this case.  Obviously, there was a physician in Paris, Texas, which is a number of miles away from the Dallas, Fort Worth area and was referred to this group.  Then the patient was first seen by Dr. Spencer and then referred to Dr. Wang.  I mean, you saw that in the records; is that true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
92,485,19,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,486,19,4,"And that's something that may happen in your group in almost a very similar way.  An outlining doctor may refer to your group once it's evaluated by one person in the group, they may say I think you would be best treated by another physician that has a different area of expertise.  Would that be fair that's how it works?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
94,494,19,12,"I think that that would be appropriate, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,496,19,14,"In this case, I know in your letter you listed the things that you had to review.  Do you feel like you had an adequate amount of information upon which to base your opinions in this case?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
96,501,19,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,502,19,20,Was there any information that you felt like you needed and you didn't have?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
98,504,19,22,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,505,19,23,"Okay.  With respect to reviewing records, I know that in medical legal cases the information contained in medical records is often the subject of great interest.  My question is, do you recognize that there are some things that clearly occurred in the course of treatment that may not be specifically documented in the record, but you know that those things occurred simply because of the way the records read and the events that happened? And I can give you an example if you need it.",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
100,517,20,9,Object to the form of the question.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_question
101,520,20,12,Can you answer that?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
102,521,20,13,Same objection.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_chat
103,523,20,15,"When I see a patient, I'm very, very careful in documenting my thought process, the differential diagnosis, and when I'm treating a patient I make sure that I have the medication or the laser or the surgery, the dosage.  These things are critical and I don't want anybody to assume or read between the lines because that's not the way it should be.  It's not the way I was taught.  So I have to say, no.  That I look at the records and the records are what transpired.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,538,21,4,Okay.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
105,539,21,5,"If a dosage is written, that's the dosage and no other dosage is the dosage that was administered.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
106,542,21,8,"Gotcha.  Okay.  I think part of my question involved just the fact that it's impossible to document every word of history that is stated by the patient, but it's incumbent upon the doctor to ask the history and to generally document it.  Would that be fair?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
107,549,21,15,"It's important to accurately describe the history that a patient gives.  You can do that without a transcription of every word, comma, period, and semicolon that a patient is giving you.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,554,21,20,"Right.  And even some of the things, some of the treatments, like an interocular injection, there is certain techniques, sterile techniques, that are used that may obviously occur, but they are not always written down in detail, fair?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
109,561,22,1,"Are you using that as a specific example, intraocular injection, intravitreal injection, because the reason why I'm saying that is that it's critical not only from a medical standpoint, but from a medical legal standpoint that the procedure is documented accurately.  And in this era of electronic medical records, it's easier than ever to do that efficiently and correctly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,570,22,10,"All right.  My question is a little bit different so I'm just going to say responsiveness for the record.  But let me ask it a bigger picture.  When you reviewed the records, did you review them from a fair and realistic standpoint trying to understand what actually occurred?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
111,577,22,17,Object to form.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_chat
112,579,22,19,"I always strive to be fair and realistic.  So I'm biased in my answer saying that, yes, I feel that I was fair and realistic.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,584,22,24,All right.  And you do agree that it would be inappropriate to retrospectively judge the conduct as a Monday morning quarterback?  It's important to judge the conduct based upon the facts and circumstances when the judgment or the action was taken.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
114,592,23,6,Object to form.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_question
115,595,23,9,True?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
116,596,23,10,Same objection.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_chat
117,598,23,12,"So when I read the records, I read the records in what I was trying to perceive as realtime.  You necessarily look back and you, as a normal individual, look back and say what if that didn't occur, what would have happened?  Would the patient still have had his eye?  I think that's human nature.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,608,23,22,Sure.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
119,609,23,23,"And if I didn't, it wouldn't be truthful.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,611,23,25,Yeah.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
121,613,24,1,"So of course I read it in realtime, looked at the pictures that were available in realtime.  Then I did look back and say, if that Methotrexate wasn't injected in the eye, would the patient still have had their right eye?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,619,24,7,"Absolutely.  When you make evaluations of causation, you necessarily have to look back.  But as far as judging the conduct that's under the facts and circumstances, and that's what I think you've explained; is that right?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_chat
123,625,24,13,Object to form.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_chat
124,627,24,15,"I was trying to say that I was evaluating the circumstances as if they were occurring in realtime.  What would I have thought had I seen that patient, which I've seen several times in my career, and what differential diagnosis would I have formulated, and what testing would I have considered, and then what treatments would I have done given the data that was given at the time.  That's why I believe I was asked to review this.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,641,25,3,"Okay.  Let me just ask, when you would attempt to give me your definition of what the standard of care is, that you believe is the standard that is required of a specialist like Dr. Wang.  Would you give me your definition as you have used it in making your opinions.",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
126,648,25,10,So you're asking -- I need you to ask me that again because I'm probably misunderstanding your question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,651,25,13,Okay.,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
128,652,25,14,And I want to make sure that I'm understanding it correctly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,654,25,16,"Okay.  Well, the reason -- one of the reasons I ask it in the manner in which I did was in your last answer you said, I try to put myself in that position, what would I think, what would I do, what would I -- what would be my thought processes.  And would you agree that the standard of care is something different than what just one physician may do. It is what a reasonably prudent physician may do under the same or similar circumstances, and there can be different shades of conduct that are still within the standard if it's not specifically what you would do.  Would you agree with that?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
130,669,26,5,Your last -- I'm sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
131,670,26,6,Just a form objection.  You can answer.,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_chat
132,672,26,8,"Your last question had nothing to do with the standard of care, at least my interpretation of your last question had nothing to with the standard of care.  Your last question asked me whether or not I looked back at it as a Monday morning quarterback or how did I view the case, how was I assessing the case.  That's not to say that others may look at it differently.  Maybe some others would look at it in retrospect. Under the retrospectoscope, if you want to use that word.  I think that's quite a different question than what do you feel the standard of care is.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,symbols

I just want to know, what did you bring with you to the deposition today in response to the subpoena?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer

These intravitreal injections have changed the practice of retina dramatically. When I first started my fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania in 1990, and I did a two year fellowship there as you may have seen, in medical and surgical retina.  None of these anti-VEGF medications were available.  We were treating macular degeneration with thermal laser, which was notoriously destructive, but it was really the only thing we had until July of 2000 when we had available verteporfin photodynamic therapy. That was the main agent for treatment of macular degeneration between the years of 2000 and 2005.  We used that extensively for our patients.

Instead, we're given these prefilled syringes, which the technician hands to me and I inject.  And so these prefilled syringes have the appropriate medicine dosage.  So there is not a lot of guess work that has to occur.  There is no calculation of dilutions.  There can't be dilution errors made by the staff.  It really has streamlined the situation. When we get the Bevacizumab from compounding pharmacies, likewise, it's in a prefilled syringe.  Ranibizumab is given in a prefilled syringe.

259,1104,42,24,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,1105,42,25,It is true that often even the prefilled syringes give you a little bit more medication than is the standard dose simply so you can clear the air out of the hyperdermic needle and inject exactly the amount of volume of that concentration or mixture of medication into the eye.  Would that be right?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
261,1113,43,7,"Yes.  And because also there is going to be residual medication in the lumen of the needle when you push the syringe down to the base.  So, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
262,1117,43,11,"Now, as I understand it, since we're talking about an eye that has a definite size and a cavity, when you add volume to that cavity, you want to be careful as to the amount of fluid you add to that cavity because it can create higher pressures inside the globe of the eye in the vitreous and you don't want to do that.  Would that be true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
263,1125,43,19,"Fortunately, the eye, although a relatively ridged structure, has normal mechanism for fluid outflow inside the eye -- and I'm not talking about tears on the outside -- I'm talking about fluid on the inside so that when you inject these volumes, it can tolerate even, you know, two times at least the amount of volume that we're injecting typically without causing harm. So while you're right, the pressure in the relatively closed system does increase for a short bit, there has never been any evidence that that increase and pressure for that short amount of time causes any harm to the inside of the eye.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Would that be true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
267,1151,44,19,"The dilution was made based upon the concentration of the medication that we're using.  If an increased volume was necessary, it could have been done.

Would that be true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
270,1170,45,12,Some patients have a lower tolerance to even the same amount of volume. So my answer had to do with the fact that .05 cc's was given based upon the concentration of the medication rather that than the tolerated volume.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

272,1177,45,19,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,1178,45,20,"Yeah.  And really it is a factor.  There are two different factors involved.  One is the concentration of the medication, true?  And one is the volume of the medication administered, true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer

289,1228,47,18,"Okay.  Although you say patients have different tolerances as to pain, and even some can get the .05 cc injection and still have discomfort, would you agree with me that in your experience most patients who receive .05 cc's of a medication seldom have complaints related to a transient increase of pressure?",q,MR.

290,1235,47,25,True.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,1237,48,1,"Okay.

Would that be true?",q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer

So the most critical portion of that -- and this is important because even though I have never treated it, it is important to recognize it or at least have it in your mind as a differential diagnosis when you see something like this.  It's important to be able to save lives, and the way that you save lives is not injecting Methotrexate in the vitreous. The way that you save lives is to initiate systemic treatment as soon as you feel that that's a possibility. That systemic treatment will often take care of the vitreoretinal component of the lymphoma.  And so you will have done two things at the same time.

490,1898,73,12,Was there any black scarring around the area of the toxoplasmosis?,q,MR. PATTERSON,start_answer
491,1900,73,14,"Since 2003, really we've recognized that toxoplasmic retinitis, the majority of toxoplasmic retinitis, is going to be acquired rather than congenital.  That really wasn't our thought process before 2003 where we thought most of the time toxoplasmic retinitis was going to be congenital in that the mother acquires the disease, transmits it through the placenta to the child, if there is no spontaneous abortion because it can be a significant serious issue, it often does go to the retina and the patient's immune system or the mother's immune cells fight off the retinitis and it forms a scar. But on the edge of that brown scar, which I think you're referring to, later on in life you can get reactivation and you'll see a white retinitis next to an inactive retinitis.  That's typical of congenital toxoplasmosis, which during a person's lifetime can reactivate.  But increasingly we recognize that most toxoplasmic retinitis is not congenital and will not be accompanied by such a scar that you're referring to and will present like this, as an acquired toxoplasmic retinitis. How do we acquire it?  Through inadequately cooked meat.  If we're asking for steak that's medium rare, real pink on the inside, it's got to be 145 degrees on the inside.  If we're not washing fruits and vegetables well.  We're not washing our strawberries, we're not washing our fruits. These bradyzoites of the toxoplasmosis can be ingested and result in this.  Handling cats, cat litter.  Certainly cats are the definitive host of toxoplasmosis.  Sexual reproduction of the toxoplasmosis occurs in cats.  So they are the definitive host.  We can acquire it through the kitty litter. So most of the cases of toxoplasmosis are acquired and unfortunately Mr. Cook acquired the toxoplasmosis, age 79, age 79, but it was not congenital.  You're right.  It has a telltale sign that it was not congenital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

503,1972,76,8,"Most patients that we see, just because of the numbers, are going to be immunocompetent.  It certainly can happen in immunocompromised patients, in which case it can be very aggressive.

The viral retinitis that is typically seen and the viral retinitis that I see is peripheral retinitis, not a midperipheral retinitis.  When I see it, I treat it with Valganciclovir, but I treat it as been recommended in the literature of two grams, three times a day, for a total of six grams a day, which has been shown to equal the intravenous dose in terms of bioavailability.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

517,2032,78,16,So the vitreous haze is because of white blood cells in the vitreous and the keratic precipitates are just an anterior segment manifestation of those white blood cells.

Answer, I personally remember getting on the phone because we didn't have the results and I really needed them.  We needed a preliminary report.  Question, all right.  If the MRI was negative, how did that affect your decision making?  Was the next question.  And the answer, well, it's like I mentioned before. It could be CNS lymphoma that goes into the eye or can it be eye -- goes into the brain.  So since it's not in the brain, that didn't give us any leads to go on.  So it didn't eliminate, unfortunately, CNS lymphoma.  It would have been great because then we would have figured it out that way.  So it still left two diagnostic possibilities on the table.  Out of highest and most serious was still lymphoma. When you look at the severity, lymphoma and the clinical appearance was still the highest.

693,2597,100,9,"We report dosage of medication. Total dosage is much more important, as I eluded to earlier, rather than volume.  800 micrograms was the amount of medication that was given.  You can take penicillin, for instance, in a certain amount in a tablet and it comes in various tablets.  The important thing is not how many tablets you've taken to ingest a given amount of penicillin, but the important thing is how much penicillin you have actually taken.  And you can take different amounts of penicillin based on different tablet sizes that are available.  And the of efficacy of that penicillin will not be dependent upon the number of tablets you happen to ingest of either, you know, 250 milligrams, 500 milligrams or whatever it happens to be.  The efficacy will be based upon the dosage.  And so it's the dosage rather than the volume. He's indicated on three occasions on this page 86 of injecting 800 micrograms of Methotrexate, and then he duplicates it here.  Intravitreal injection of 800 micrograms of Methotrexate, 800 micrograms. And then on the next page, amount, 800 micrograms.

Certainly, the reason why 400 has been given since decades instead of 800 is because 400 is efficacious and we try to avoid toxicity.  In my opinion, there could have been a couple of different mechanisms.  Number one could be that there would be a difference in the osmolality or osmolarity of the solution at the level of the retina and that would be damaging to the cells. It's well-known that if a substance is injected in the eye that has a vary high osmolarity, it damages the cells and can cause a toxic reaction. Alternatively, there are other possible explanations.  But just like you don't say if you hit somebody in the head with a hammer, why do you think they are hurt?

748,2840,109,18,"Secondly, it's a chemotherapeutic agent that interferes with cellular proliferation and normal cellular function.  We're injecting it at twice normal levels.  So it not only attacks abnormal cells, but it attacks the normal retinal cells, which can cause a hemorrhagic retinopathy, hemorrhagic retinitis. Another mechanism is that it caused the toxoplasmosis to proliferate because the local environment was -- you didn't have any immune system in the local environment and it could have caused the toxoplasmosis to proliferate.

None of these articles deal with what happens if we inject 800 because 800 has never been inject on a single dose, ever been reported.

805,3014,116,10,"This is a very important point you're bringing out because the patient was given the medication.  The patient was seeing 20/60 before he was given the injection and immediately thereafter in the next visit the vision dropped not to 2100, not to 2200, not to 2400, but to light perception.  It was dramatic.  It was a dramatic decrease in vision.  You're asking me -- and I know I'm expounding on this -- but this is the crux of the whole thing. The patient was given twice the normal dosage of a medication and then experienced profound vision loss right after that.  The appearance of the retina was distinctly different than that seen with the typical toxoplasmic retinitis that he had.  It was hemorrhagic and it was defuse whitening of the retina with profound vision loss.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

841,3131,120,23,There is no set blood pressure because elasticity of arterials vary.  But I can tell you you wouldn't get hemorrhages if you didn't have blood flow to the retina.

866,3216,124,4,"Without saying that it was incompetent surgery, because I don't think it was, but we all know that there are risks involved when you do surgery.  They did surgery to try to remove the vitreous opacities.  I was looking in the records to see if I could find a risk, benefit, alternative discussion and I was having trouble finding that.  Certainly, if you have a monocular patient, you have to treat it very seriously and I'm generally pretty conservative when it comes to that.  Especially if the patient is monocular. Apparently, they went ahead to try to remove the residual inflammatory debris in the vitreous.  There was no active retinitis.  The last note that I saw in the left eye, which I believe was in January for some reason, the retina was attached.  There was no active retinitis and there was just debris in the gel.  They did the surgery.  A retinal detachment ensued, which they needed to treat with the silicone oil.  There was some problems with the silicone afterwards. They had to do a laser in the office and then they finally did the silicone oil exchange and repaired a recurrent retinal detachment and the visual acuity was left at 20 over 200, unfortunately, in the left eye.  The proximate cause of that was not active retinitis from the toxoplasmosis, which was inactive.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

You can also get cytology and you can do culturing, bacterial, fungal culturing.  These things are typically done.  You can do staining as well, but you're trying to narrow down the differential diagnosis or come up with a specific diagnosis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

But this is the area in the eye called the pars plana, which is relatively avascular and is not part of the retina.  So you can place trocars in these areas.  Typically three are placed to get sampling of the vitreous.  An infusion canula and vitreous sampling is done by removing some of the vitreous hoping that the environment will glean the information that you need.  This way, you're not piercing the retina because you're anterior to the retina and you're in a relatively avascular area.  So you're not causing or hope not to cause a retinal detachment or anything like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1371,4498,173,12,"You're understanding is that when Dr. Wang took his initial testing, that initial biopsy, his position is that the sampling was so small and restricted that he couldn't test for toxoplasmosis.  Do you recall that?",q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer

1623,5091,196,7,"Yes.  There's always a risk because you can misunderstand what was said over the phone.  And when it's written down, there is no misunderstanding.  So you're adding a little bit more uncertainty when you're relying on a verbal report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1673,5201,200,13,And would you list all of the problems you had with the Methotrexate including the overdose.  What else was wrong with giving it?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1674,5205,200,17,"Methotrexate doesn't treat toxoplasmic retinitis.  It was given obviously twice normal dosage, which was toxic.  It was given without the official MRI reading, and it was apparently given or decided to be given a priori almost based on what we saw in the previous medical records.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1678,5218,201,4,"The other issue is that systemic treatment, if you're concerned about the grave prognosis of lymphoma, should have been given systemically rather than in the eye.  And the priority should have been given to systemic treatment rather than intravitreal treatment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1681,5229,201,15,What's the basis of that objection?,side_chat,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_chat

1698,5277,203,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1699,5278,203,12,All right.  Can you tell us what happened at that visit.,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1700,5280,203,14,The vision was recorded as light perception.  So there had occurred a profound loss of vision in the right eye and it was 20/70 in the left eye.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1701,5284,203,18,"What exhibit are you looking at, sir?",q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1702,5286,203,20,My report.  I have no -- I don't have the 7/1 office visit in front of me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1703,5288,203,22,Your recollection is on 7/1 that there was a significant event that caused him to lose sight in his eye?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1704,5291,203,25,No.  I think the event had occurred on June 16th and that was the injection of the Methotrexate.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1705,5295,204,3,Tell us why you believe that the Methotrexate caused the blindness in his right eye?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1706,5298,204,6,Because it was temporarily related.  It was profound.  It wasn't just a small drop in vision.  It went from 20/60 before the injection to only being able to see light out of the eye in a very short period of time.  That profound vision loss implies a catastrophic event rather than a subtle clinical event that occurred.  This catastrophic event is most consistent with the injection of the toxic amount of Methotrexate in that right eye.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1707,5309,204,17,Were you able to find any photographs that supported that position?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1708,5311,204,19,"Yes.  So the photographs taken on July 1st, show a distinct change in the retinal appearance in the right eye, and it shows a hemorrhagic retinopathy with predominance of retina whitening and retinal hemorrhage.  This hemorrhage is distinct from the typical retinitis that we see with toxoplasmosis. Hemorrhage indicates that it could not have been hypoperfusion from low blood pressure because if you have decreased circulation into an area, you just don't have the blood to bleed into the retina.  So this hemorrhagic retinopathy implies damage to the cells in the retina and the cells in the blood vessels in the retina.  The retina -- there is diffuse retinal whitening and a hemorrhagic retinopathy that's distinct in appearance from what we see with even more defuse toxoplasmic retinitis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1709,5332,205,14,"Okay.  So to put that more in my terms, hemorrhagic means it's bleeding?",q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1710,5334,205,16,"Yes.  There is blood.  There is a predominance of blood in the picture.  And if there is low blood pressure and you're trying to argue that it was from the hypotension, the blood is just not getting to the blood vessels. When you see a central retinal artery inclusion, for instance, in the retina, you don't see any blood.  It's just a white retina because the retina is dead.  Here, not only is the retina dead, the whitening, but there is a lot of blood there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1711,5346,206,2,All right.  Was there anything in between the Methotrexate and this picture that you believe may have caused that bleeding in his eyeball?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1712,5350,206,6,I think the Methotrexate did it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1713,5351,206,7,"Now, opposing counsel suggested to you that he had low blood pressure and was hospitalized for it.  Would that have caused that perhaps?",q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1714,5355,206,11,"No.  Because as I was trying to explain, the low blood pressure, the blood is not getting to retina.  So you're not going to get a lot of blood in the retina.  It's an absence of blood.  So this picture is different than an artery occlusion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1715,5361,206,17,Do you recall opposing counsel suggesting that the patient had not complained about the loss of eyesight until three days after the injection?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer
1716,5365,206,21,One of the notes it says three days.  In another phone conversation it says that it had been dark since the day of injection.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1717,5369,206,25,Is three days outside the realm of when the Methotrexate could have done its damage?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer

1956,5976,230,8,How so?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer

1964,5997,231,3,How do you arrive at that opinion?,q,MR. MASTROGIOVANNI,start_answer

1975,6026,232,6,"There did not appear to be any grounds to use intravitreal Methotrexate in the right eye.  There was no explanation of why it would have been bilateral, and there was no explanation as to why if you thought it was primary vitreoretinal lymphoma that he selected treatment of the right eye with the Methotrexate rather than bilateral treatment given the fact that there was an area of involvement with the left eye that was document.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

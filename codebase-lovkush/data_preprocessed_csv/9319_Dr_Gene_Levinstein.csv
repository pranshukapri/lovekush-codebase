3,149,6,6,"Good afternoon, Doctor.  How are you?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
4,151,6,8,Good.  Good afternoon.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,152,6,9,Could you please introduce yourself to the jury.,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
6,154,6,11,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  My name is Dr. Gene Levinstein.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,156,6,13,And what type of doctor are you?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
8,157,6,14,I'm a specialist.  My specialty is physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain management.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,160,6,17,"Now, in case the jury is unaware, could you explain a little bit more about what physical medicine and rehabilitation are.",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
10,164,6,21,"Physical medicine and rehabilitation is the names, kind of, that basically deal with the physical capabilities and providing rehabilitative care to patients. Physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors, also known as physiatrists, typically provide care to patients who either have undergone surgery or suffer from musculoskeletal neurologic conditions. This includes, traditionally, recovery after stroke, spinal cord injuries, cardiac rehabilitation after heart surgeries or transplants, and PT training for patients who were involved in neurologic conditions; the joint problems, total knee replacements, hip replacements.  Any other joint surgery such as arthroscopies, hips, knees, shoulders, or patients who suffer from neurologic conditions or spinal disorders; bulging, herniated discs, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis. Physiatrists also perform diagnostic studies, specifically EMG nerve conduction, and typically oversee physical therapy and occupational therapy departments.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,189,7,20,"Now, Doctor, I know you just mentioned a large number of things that doctors such as yourself treat.  Do you treat people who have been involved in motor vehicle accidents?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
12,194,7,25,"Yes.  I treat patients who are involved in either motor vehicle accidents or any other type of injury be it a lifting injury, work injury, or athletic injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,199,8,4,"Okay.  Do you happen to treat people with injuries to their neck, spine, and shoulders?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
14,202,8,7,"The nature of my practice, I treat approximately -- 70 percent of my practice involves treating patients who sustain spinal problems, be it either traumatic or chronic, be it degenerative with nature, just with age, or some type of trauma, fall, sports injury, just natural occurring discs, work related injuries, you name it.  Me being a subspecialist, such as pain management, that's what I primarily treat.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,212,8,17,"And could you explain a little bit more about that specialty that you were just mentioning, pain management.",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
16,215,8,20,"Pain management is a smaller subset where physicians only train in neurology, physiology, or physical medicine and rehab.  We are able to achieve this additional training.  It's typically an interventional specialty where you work with your hands and you preform primarily procedures such as injections.  But the nature of the disease or majority of the pain comes from the back, the spine, that's where the majority concentrates on. As I said, about 70 percent of my practice involves treating spinal disorders and remaining 30 percent I treat between other joints, small joints, hips, knees, shoulders. I'm sorry -- bigger joints; hips, knees, or shoulders.  Smaller joints; hands, elbows, wrists, and as well as nerve and muscle problems. I split my time between -- all pain management doctors typically perform a lot of procedures both using guidance such as x-ray, CAT Scan, ultrasound, but are also trained to perform injections just based on nerve stimulators or based on an anatomic location.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,242,9,21,"And, Doctor, if you could look at what has been marked as Exhibit-1, could you please identify that.",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
18,245,9,24,It is my curriculum vitae.  It is my CV.  It's my resume.  It is current and up-to-date.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,249,10,2,Okay.  And could you tell the jury a little bit about how you became a doctor.,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
20,252,10,5,"Following graduation from undergrad at Temple University, I completed medical school at Ross University.  Followed that with residency in the field of special -- internship the first year in the field of internal medicine at Graduate Hospital.  I followed that with additional training residency at Temple University Hospital where I served as a chief resident during my senior year, followed with additional fellowship training in my subspecialty of pain management.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,263,10,16,And could you let the jury know about your current practice and what you do on a daily basis.,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
22,266,10,19,"On a daily basis I split my time between seeing patients in the office, performing procedures, as well as working in the hospital doing hospital consults as well as performing procedures in the hospital.  The hospital work is reserved for patients who are really debilitated or have significant medical comorbidities or significant medical problems. They cannot be safe to do procedures in the office.  They have to be observed in the hospital for patients who require really complex procedures for which they have to be sedated, put to sleep.  Either myself providing sedation or working in conjunction with an anesthesiologist to put those patients to sleep. I work in the office long hours starting about 7:30, 8:00 in the morning and typically about 6:30, 7:00 at night.  I preform office consultations as well as in office injections.  And about a day and a half, two days a week I have dedicated time performing injections either under ultrasound or x-ray guidance primarily to the spine as the rest of the procedures I could do in the office. When I evaluate patients in the office, I perform what we call a full consultation where patients come to me, I review their diagnostic studies, I review their history, I discuss the condition that they are suffering from, what caused their condition, what can happen in the future.  It's really called a prognosis.  What's going to happen to them 5, 10, 20 years from now.  What's going to happen if they take option A, B, or C.  They can do nothing, they can do this, they can do that, and what's going to happen to them when they get older.  I give them their options and chances of one or another making them better or not and always you give the patient a chance of something making them worse or making them no different.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,310,12,11,"And I believe you touched upon this earlier, but as part of your practice do you routinely review medical records and diagnostic studies and images?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
24,314,12,15,"Yes.  Well, it's a two-part question.  First, regarding medical records, as a specialist I have no personal knowledge of a patient until they walk through my door at a specific point in time.  I don't know their history.  So it is customary medicine to rely on their physicians' medical records to help us formulate an opinion.  Meaning, other doctors' notes, ER records, therapy notes, diagnotic studies, reports.  It helps come up with a causation and come up with at least a chain of events or sequence of events to help me formulate my opinion and my diagnosis.  But as everything in medicine, it's a puzzle.  I have to put all the pieces together.  So history is one.  Diagnostics is two.  My own exam is three.  I guess records from other doctors is four.  So you put everything together, you come up with a diagnosis and prognosis and treatment plans.  This is regarding the medical records. In regards to the diagnostic studies, I am not a radiologist, but the nature of my specialty, I read MRIs, CAT Scans, and x-rays.  I limit myself to reading only the body parts where I'm going to perform procedures.  So either the joints or spine. I'm not good at reading soft tissue ultrasounds aside from me just doing the injection, which we call function ultrasounds.  So I don't fancy myself a radiologist nor do I bill for those readings. But if I'm the one sticking a needle a long in somebody's back, I need to make sure I know what I'm talking about.  I don't want my patients to be backseat passengers basically where a doctor just says it's a one-way street where everybody explains it.  I love to get their brain -- to bring the images.  In the old days we used to put them up in the viewing box.  Now I put them on my computer and I flip my laptop and I show it to the patient and discuss everything with them to make sure they understand the condition they are suffering.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,360,14,9,"And, Doctor, you're currently licensed to practice medicine here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; is that right?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
26,363,14,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,364,14,13,Okay.  And have you ever qualified to testify as an expert witness in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas before?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
28,368,14,17,"Yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,369,14,18,Okay.  And you were paid -- you're being paid to testify here today; is that right?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
30,372,14,21,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,373,14,22,Okay.  What is your fee for today?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
32,375,14,24,"$2,000.  And we agreed that this would be a mutual convenient time to testify and place rather than my office where we are not setup.  As I was working in Philadelphia today, but we don't have such a nice conference room.  It's a pure clinical space.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,382,15,5,"If you weren't here testifying today, what would you be doing?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
34,384,15,7,"I would still be seeing patients for a little bit over two hours, probably.  I usually get out about 7:00ish.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,387,15,10,"Okay.  So the fee that you charged, the $2,000 that you mentioned, compensates you for the money that you're missing by not treating patients?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
36,391,15,14,"It's for the time to be away from my practice, to prepare for today's testimony, and not being able to provide care for my patients.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
37,395,15,18,At this time I offer Dr. Gene Levinstein as an expert witness in the fields of physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain management.  Counsel?,side_chat,MS. STURGES,start_question
38,401,15,24,"Doctor, I just have a few questions for you.  First, I would like to go back and discuss a little bit about your education.  You went to Temple University for undergraduate education; is that --",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
39,407,16,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
40,408,16,5,And then you went to Ross University School of Medicine in the West Indies?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
41,411,16,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
42,412,16,9,And then you came back to Philadelphia to do your internship and your residency?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
43,415,16,12,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
44,416,16,13,And then your fellowship out in Pottstown; is that right?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
45,418,16,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
46,419,16,16,And the fellowship was with a place called Interventional Spine and Pain Management; is that right?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
47,422,16,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
48,423,16,20,"Okay.  Currently, you work at several different offices; is that right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
49,425,16,22,"Well, I have my own practice, Pennsylvania Pain Specialists, which is primarily located in Lehigh Valley.  I live in Bucks County so I live sort of centrally.  I love Philly.  I came here when I was a teenager and I grew up in Philly.  That's why I practice in Philadelphia about once every other week. Sometimes more frequently, sometimes maybe a little less depending on the volume of the patients.  I rent space from a place called Spinal Care in Philadelphia.  Otherwise, I have my offices in Lehigh Valley.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
50,438,17,9,"And is Spinal Care of Philadelphia, is that office location listed on your CV?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
51,441,17,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,442,17,13,Can you point it to me.  I'm sorry.,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
53,444,17,15,"Sure.  I guess -- I apologize. You're right.  It's not listed.  It's not my primary office, not the office that I own. It's one of the places where I rent space.  I apologize it is not listed as one of the primary locations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
54,450,17,21,"That's no problem.  So just to be clear, you have the office that you rent in Philadelphia and then another one in Allentown, another one in Bethlehem --",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
55,454,17,25,That's it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,456,18,1,Just those three?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
57,457,18,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
58,458,18,3,Okay.  You also list VitamedIV or is that Vitamed Four?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
59,460,18,5,No.  VitamedIV.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,461,18,6,Okay.  And what is that?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
61,462,18,7,"I'm no longer working there. It's a facility, medical IV infusion, where I was a medical director until May of this year.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
62,465,18,10,"Oh, I'm sorry.  I do see that it says until May of this year.  I misunderstood. Thank you.  Doctor, you've mentioned that you you've testified in the past in cases like this; is that right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
63,470,18,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
64,471,18,16,Okay.  How many times have you testified in an injury case similar to what we're here for today?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
65,474,18,19,"I can't say the total how many times I've testified or, I guess, whatever specific time period.  But I would say on the average for a personal injury case where I have to testify on video or live in court, probably about once a month or so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
66,480,18,25,How long have you been testifying about once a month or so?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
67,483,19,2,"It really fluctuates.  I can go for some months where I don't testify.  Then the next month I'm testifying two times.  But at most, I would say it's probably about once a month for, maybe, five, six years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,488,19,7,"Now, could you give us a percentage breakdown.  How many times do you testify on behalf of plaintiffs or plaintiffs' offices and how many times you testify on behalf of defendants or defense offices?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
69,493,19,12,"I would say 99 percent of the time, 99 percent plus, I am the treating doctor or I perform an Independent Medical Evaluation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
70,496,19,15,"And I understand -- so when you're the treating doctor, you've given some kind of treatment to the plaintiff in the case that you're talking about, right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
71,500,19,19,"I refer to them as patients, yes.  I testify on behalf of my patients.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
72,502,19,21,"Okay.  However, when you give an Independent Medical Evaluation, that's when you're not testifying on behalf of a patient, but rather someone that's been referred to you and somebody has asked for your opinion; is that correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
73,509,20,2,"Correct.  Independent Medical Evaluation is the name -- stands as independent.  You have no doctor-patient relationship.  So you see the patient once, you review medical records, a little or a lot, and you issue your opinion and you provide the report to the requesting party.  Usually an attorney or a case manager.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,517,20,10,How often do you do Independent Medical Evaluations?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
75,519,20,12,"Probably a few.  Two, three times a month.  It really depends.  Again, everything fluctuates.  I think this week I have two of them.  Last two weeks I had none.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,523,20,16,"Okay.  When you do Independent Medical Evaluations, so you're not working with a patient of your's, do you ever do them for defense attorneys or defendants?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
77,527,20,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,528,20,21,"What percentage do you do for -- of Independent Medical Evaluations, what percentage do you do for defense attorneys or defendants and what percentage do you do for plaintiffs or plaintiff attorneys?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
79,534,21,1,"Very small for defense. Primarily patients who either seek a second opinion or somebody who was injured in some type of an accident, whether it's work related or personal injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,539,21,6,So would you agree the great majority are for the plaintiffs?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
81,541,21,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,542,21,9,"In this case, you provided a report to the plaintiff's attorney, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
83,544,21,11,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,545,21,12,"And that report is dated July 25, 2019, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
85,547,21,14,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,548,21,15,Was there a fee related to that report?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
87,550,21,17,Yes.  Certainly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,551,21,18,What was that?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
89,552,21,19,$500.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,553,21,20,"And that's in addition to the $2,000 that you spoke about earlier, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
91,555,21,22,Correct.  The fee for the report is for me to review medical records and to generate my report.  Patient was referred to me by the treating doctors and those bills have nothing to do with the report and the fee for today's testimony to be away from my practice and be here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,563,22,4,"Doctor, earlier you talked about the procedures that you do and you mentioned injections.",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
93,566,22,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,567,22,8,What other procedures do you do?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
95,568,22,9,"Primarily injections, whether it's some, I guess, more common such as epidural injections, facet blocks, medial branch blocks.  Two more involved procedures such as rhizotomies.  Two more involved procedures such as percutaneous disc-decompressions, implantation of spinal cord stimulators, even percutaneous laminotomies, stem cell injections.  You can go on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,578,22,19,"Okay.  Well, let me ask you this, do ever do arthroscopic surgery?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
97,580,22,21,"No.  I'm not an orthopedic surgeon.  Although, a few of the procedures that I do perform carry orthopedic codes such as putting cement inside the vertebral bones for fractures, called vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty or percutaneous disc-decompression or even I can do the decompression of the carpel tunnel. I am not qualified to do an arthroscopic surgery, such as hips, knees, or shoulders.  If I felt one of those would be necessary, I would refer them to my orthopedic colleagues.  But that wouldn't be applicable to Ms. Gebeyaw in this case as she has no joint damage.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,596,23,11,"Okay.  How about open surgery, something, like, as I understand, a cervical fusion for example?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
99,599,23,14,"No.  I think the answer would be the same.  If the patient needs a fusion or even a more advanced laminectomy, whatever -- I'm going to go on surgeries -- or microdiscectomy, I would certainly refer to my orthopedic spine and neurosurgeon colleagues.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
100,605,23,20,"Those are all the questions I have.  Thank you, Doctor.",side_chat,MR. SHUEY,start_chat
101,607,23,22,Thank you.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,609,23,24,"Doctor, I just have one brief follow-up about that.  Counsel was asking you about the number of times you've testified or write reports on behalf of plaintiffs versus defendants.  In those situations, regardless of whether or not you're doing so for a plaintiff or a defendant in a legal matter, would that have any impact on the outcome of your report and testimony?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
103,619,24,8,"No.  You evaluate the patient. And frankly when I write the report, I don't really know who is requesting it.  If it's requested by an attorney, it's just a name with esquire after it.  When you issue a prognosis or a causation, it's based on the patient's evaluation, based on the review of records, based on the diagnosis.  Treatment recommendations would be essentially the same whether it's a plaintiff or a defendant because it's based on diagnosis sustained.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
104,630,24,19,"Thank you, Doctor. Again, at this time I offer Dr. Gene Levinstein as an expert witness in the fields of physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain management.",side_chat,MS. STURGES,symbols

107,640,25,3,"So, Doctor, we're here to take your testimony today on behalf of Mehret Gebeyaw related to her treatment following a motor vehicle accident that she was involved in on November 9, 2017.  During the course of your testimony here today, I'm going to ask you for some opinions, but I don't want you to give any unless you can do so to a reasonable degree of medical certainty; is that fair?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
108,649,25,12,"Yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,650,25,13,So you treated Ms. Gebeyaw; is that correct?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
110,652,25,15,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,653,25,16,Okay.  And you also did review some records at the request of my office; is that right?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
112,656,25,19,"In addition to the records available to me during her evaluation, yes. Your office provided some records when I was preparing the report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,660,25,23,Okay.  And you did prepare a comprehensive report that you have in front of you marked as Levinstein-2; is that right?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
114,664,26,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,665,26,2,I'm going to ask that you refer to that as needed during the course of your testimony.  Could you explain a little bit about your treatment of Ms. Gebeyaw in regards to her injuries from this accident.,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
116,670,26,7,"When I saw Ms. Gebeyaw on April 2nd of 2018, she presented to me with complaints of right neck pain going to the right shoulder and upper arm.  I reviewed the records from both Dr. Rosin with the EMG nerve conduction study, which showed radiculopathy or nerve damage on the right side.  I also reviewed and discussed the MRI results, which showed cervical disc herniations as well as some preexisting changes. I discussed with the patient how the accident happened and the prior treatment that she received.  I examined her and we agreed that the best course of care at this point, as she failed to progress beyond a certain point and certain time -- I think it was about six months at that point -- after accident she continued to be in pain.  So I felt it was reasonable, appropriate, and necessary to proceed to the next step in intervention such as injections, which I did on April 2nd of 2018.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,693,27,4,And what type of injection was that?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
118,695,27,6,"I performed a cervical epidural steroid injection.  This is a procedure where a physician puts a needle in the back of the spine.  Would preform this -- usually go from the back.  There is two ways of doing this. You can go from the side next to the nerve or you can go from the back of the spine. Neck injections are traditionally considered the most dangerous types of procedures because of the amount of skill level needed as well as really no margin for error.  You are literally sitting within half a millimeter or a millimeter away from the spinal cord in the neck so you don't want to spear it going from the back.  If you go from the side, you're away from the spinal cord, but you have to follow certain protocol of injection because you don't want to cause a blood clot, which can make the patient paralyzed. So different types of -- I'm sorry.  Similar injection, different type of risks.  And the goal of the injection is to take away inflammation, take away pain, help the body's natural healing process.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,721,28,6,"Now, one of the keywords that you mentioned as you were explaining was the term cervical.  What does that mean?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
120,724,28,9,Neck.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,725,28,10,"Okay.  And I have a very important question for you.  After your treatment of her with that injection in April of 2018, as well as the records that you reviewed both at the time of the treatment as well as after, did you find that she suffered any injuries as a result of the motor vehicle accident?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
122,733,28,18,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,734,28,19,Okay.  Could you explain to the jury what injuries you found.,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
124,736,28,21,"I felt that based on records reviewed, signs, symptoms, my own exam, as well as imaging, diagnostic studies such as the MRI and EMG which are objective findings, I felt that Ms. Gebeyaw sustained specifically five injuries that continue to bother her and one that I felt was resolved. I felt that the shoulder sprain and strain and the mid and low back sprain and strain, thoracic lumbar sprain and strain, has resolved and certainly did not bother her at the time of my evaluation and did not continue to present any issues. However, more importantly and more seriously, the injuries that continued to bother her was the right sided disc herniation as C3/4 with an EMG confirmed right C4 radiculopathy.  The occipital neurology or the pain in the back of the head.  Cervicalgia, also known as neck pain, cervical whiplash, and aggravation of preexisting cervical degenerative disc disease.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,759,29,18,"Now, what exactly is a herniation?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
126,761,29,20,"I really wish I had my model here so I'm going to subject the jury and his or her honor to my drawings.  This is the cross section of the disc.  I guess it's, like, a jelly or a Boston cream donut.  This is the jelly, this is the center of the disc, this is the ring (indicating). When the patient is healthy, the disc is fine.  When we're young, discs are nice and plump.  They are tall.  There is nothing bothering them.  However, when you get -- as you can see when you get in a car accident, such as this, you get hit and the spine suffers.  So disc can herniate out.  As you can see here, the disc herniates out and it's pressing on the nerve.  This is what is called herniation or radiculopathy.  When we typically describe the discs, we can say there is different degrees of bulging, protrusion, or herniation, and it gets progressively worse. Bulging can be signs of normal aging.  Three out of ten people in the room will have some bulges they may not even know about.  So if we have 12 jurors, you know, three, four of them may have disc bulges depending on their age, also depending what type of activity you do.  As you get older, you develop some arthritis and they can develop into protrusion. But herniations are not normal. It's never a sign of normal aging.  It just doesn't sit there where bulges can be there and what I described as asymptomatic.  Meaning, it's there.  You don't know how about it.  It's just there.  If you get an x-ray or MRI, you found the bulge so it doesn't bother you. Herniations are symptomatic.  They are painful. So that's the big difference.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,801,31,8,And one of the other terms that I wanted to ask you about was radiculopathy. Can you explain to the jury what exactly you mean by that.,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
128,805,31,12,"Radiculopathy is a fancy term for nerve damage.  We diagnosis radiculopathy based on the EMG.  So you really need both. When you do an MRI, MRI is an awesome test, but at the end of the day it's a snapshot in time. It's a picture.  That's all it tells you.  You can look at the MRI, you can try to put a timestamp on it.  You can say, well, there is some arthritis so that was there for a while. There is no arthritis surrounding disc herniation so it's newer.  It's fresher than the other stuff before.  But you can't put a specific timestamp.  You can't say that the herniation occurred on April 2nd.  You just can't do that.  Or whatever the date of the accident is. But you could say, it's acute, subacute, or chronic.  So that's where the EMG comes in.  Because what an MRI shows you, there is some pressure on the nerve root.  It doesn't tell you how much nerve damage is there.  EMG or nerve conduction study gives you a quantitative analysis of how much nerve damage is there without getting specific terms, like, all this fancy stuff.  You can call it mild, moderate, or severe amount of nerve damage. And you can give it, again, more, much closer timeframe, six weeks, three months, six months. So you can try to correlate it together.  You should probably never perform EMG when patient doesn't have pain down the arm or the MRI is negative.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,838,32,19,"Okay.  And, Doctor, out of all the injuries you listed, what are the most serious in your opinion?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
130,841,32,22,The C3/4 herniation with the C4 radiculopathy.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,843,32,24,And why is that?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
132,844,32,25,"Well, that's permanent in nature.  Radiculopathy means it's permanent because there is permanent nerve damage and a herniation that size just physiologically it's not going to resolve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,850,33,5,"Now, do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the extent or seriousness of any of the other injuries that you just described for the jury?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
134,854,33,9,"They are serious and they are related to this.  Aside from the sprain and strain in the low back and the shoulder, which has resolved, I would say they are a little bit less serious than the herniation.  I'm not sure I understood the question correctly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,860,33,15,"I think you answered, Doctor.  I know you talked about permanency just a minute ago.  Could you just clarify for the jury what injuries, if any, are permanent as a result of this accident.",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
136,865,33,20,C3/4 herniation with a C4 radiculopathy is permanent.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,867,33,22,And do you have any opinion as to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the cause of the injuries that you have described?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
138,872,34,1,"Yes.  Based on timing, based on records reviewed, based on the fact the patient did not have any significant preexisting medical history aside from one car accident a few years -- four or five years ago, she specifically denied any neck pain or any issues predating the car accident in question in 2017. We know that there was nothing else causing this.  So we have this one specific event, the car accident.  Then we have this pain going down the arm.  Get the MRI, which shows some preexisting arthritis, which was no doubt there before.  But the 3/4 herniation, which is large in size and does not have any disc osteophyte complex, meaning it doesn't have any arthritis surrounding that disc making it acute more than chronic, which means it's more likely to be correlated with the accident and then it correlates with the EMG, which again doesn't show that the nerve damage hasn't been there for years and years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,893,34,22,"Now, Doctor, I know you've already touched upon this a little bit, but could you explain for the jury just a review of the records that you reviewed pertaining to Ms. Gebeyaw.",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
140,899,35,2,"Aside from my own discussion of the car accident with the patient, how she was sideswiped, I reviewed the records from PennDel Rehab, from the therapy as well as a short summary from Dr. Whalen.  I reviewed the EMG nerve conduction study, both the raw data and the report from Dr. Rosin.  I do agree with his findings.  As well as the MRI where I reviewed the actual images of the study in addition to the radiology report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,909,35,12,"And in terms of reviewing -- for the EMG, I know you mentioned you reviewed the actual raw data, if you will.  Why is it important to review that?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
142,913,35,16,"Well, from me being a physiatrist because I do EMGs in my office, I am able to review the data and see if I agree with the other doctor or not, see if anything was missed.  If any other doctor reviewed it who doesn't know how to do EMGs, they probably just look at the report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,920,35,23,"And in terms of an EMG, I know you were talking about radiculopathy earlier, can you explain a little bit more in terms of radicular complaints.  Are they constant a occurrence or can they come and go?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
144,926,36,3,"Radicular complaints wax and wane depending on the amount of nerve irritation, depending on position.  For example, this patient had a positive Spurling's test.  Spurling's test is when you put a patient's head back and twist it and tilt it and you press on top of the head.  When you do that you compress spaces where nerves come out. If you do it on a healthy patient, you have enough space for the nerve to flow.  When you compress it, nothing is going to happen.  Maybe some, whatever, neck discomfort, but nothing shooting down.  A positive Spurling's test, when you compress it and the area is already compromised from the herniated disc, now you're really squashing that nerve.  So you will get the shooting pain down the arm.  And in this case, it went into the upper arm and the shoulder, which is the C4 nerve distrubution.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,946,36,23,"And in reference to the diagnostic testing that you've been speaking about, particularly the MRI and the EMG, are they objective tests?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
146,951,37,2,"As I testified earlier, objective tests.  Patient cannot fake those tests.  In medicine we have something called Waddell's testing.  Waddell's testing is the constellation of five tests that we use to see if the patient is faking, symptom magnifying, or exaggerating like they are trying to pull a fast one on you. At least in my practice I try to perform the same test twice.  Once when the patient knows it and another time when I'm pretending to examine something else and I'm still performing the same test.  And in this case, I didn't find negative Waddell signs. Meaning, patient's physical exam was consistent with the findings.  I try to objectify physical exam findings. And in contrast, the MRI and EMG, patient cannot fake.  MRI is an MRI. Patient as no effect on the discs.  EMG patients are asked to squeeze the arm or make and do biceps.  But if the patient is going like this and nothing is happening, you can actually see the lack of effort in the study. So you can call the patient out for faking that on there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,978,38,3,"And, Doctor, when she visited you in April of 2018, was Ms. Gebeyaw still having complaints of pain from this accident?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
148,981,38,6,Yes.  In regards to her neck going to the shoulder.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,983,38,8,Okay.  And did you make any recommendations for any future medical treatment?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
150,986,38,11,"Yes.  We discussed a need for future care.  Specifically starting with a cervical epidural because that would be the next appropriate step.  You never start with an epidural on day one.  You follow the treatment protocol, you go to the ER, you see a doctor, you get medications, antiinflammatories, muscle relaxers, you do some therapy, you do some studies.  And finally when nothing gets better about four, five, six months, that's when you should go for the injection. In this case, for future care, I described in my report that future care for this diagnosis specifically includes further diagnostic studies.  Meaning, depending on the progression of the disease, patient would be a candidate for an MRI and an EMG of the neck within three to five years.  Patient would be a candidate for repeat course of therapy, as well as a repeat course of epidural injections.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,1007,39,6,And why is it important that in instances like this you would recommend for repeat testing?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
152,1010,39,9,"Well, to see how much the condition progressed, how much has it changed. You don't expect it to get better, but you can expect it to get worse with age.  And to see if patient becomes a surgical candidate.  God forbid it starts pressing the spinal canal or disc herniation continues and goes further out, becomes a neurologic emergency or surgical emergency or emergency where you need to get a surgeon or perform an injection.  Maybe not a surgery, but an injection at least and it's not an option.  It's not, well, I'll think about it, but, hey, we need to do this or you're going to risk losing something.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,1024,39,23,"And, Doctor, did you come up with a prognosis for Ms. Gebeyaw?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
154,1026,39,25,"I did as I do for all my patients.  As I testified earlier on direct, when patients come to me as a specialist, they come to me for prognosis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,1031,40,4,And what exactly was your prognosis here?,q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
156,1033,40,6,"I felt my prognosis was guarded to poor as this condition is permanent and I don't expect it to get better.  Given her age, I actually expect it to get worse, impacting her further functional ability.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,1038,40,11,"And, Doctor, do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, as to the reasonableness and necessity of all the treatment that Ms. Gebeyaw received following this incident?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
158,1043,40,16,Yes.  I felt it was reasonable and necessary.  As we didn't jump to injections on day one.  We followed the treatment protocol from the least invasive to most invasive.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,1047,40,20,"Okay.  And one last question here, Doctor.  Have you given all of your opinions today to a reasonable degree of medical certainty?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer

172,1070,41,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,1071,41,18,"Okay.  So that was a year and five months ago, the only time that you saw the plaintiff.  Is that about right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
174,1074,41,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
175,1075,41,22,"And at the time we previously discussed you wrote your report -- I'm sorry. July 25, 2019, so that would be about a year and four months between the time you saw the plaintiff and wrote your report?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
176,1081,42,2,Correct.  I was trying to do the math on my fingers.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
177,1083,42,4,"Now, when you saw the plaintiff, how did you communicate with her?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
178,1085,42,6,"I don't recall.  I'm sure if patients don't speak English, we have a translator.  At this point, I honestly don't recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
179,1089,42,10,"Okay.  Do you know, is that translator normally a family member or somebody else or in this case you just simply can't recall?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
180,1093,42,14,"I don't recall, but we have an office translator 99 percent of the time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
181,1095,42,16,"In this case, Ms. Gebeyaw speaks a language from Ethiopia or Eritrea.  Would you have a language translator in your office for that?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
182,1099,42,20,"No, we don't.  It's funny you say -- actually, in Allentown I do.  But here, someone from the hospital -- we also utilize translation machines or hospital translators, but those are notoriously difficult in a situation like this.  Frankly, I don't recall which translator was utilized.  I guarantee it was family member.  Sometimes we even utilize a phone.  Like I said, I don't recall what we did in this instance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
183,1110,43,5,"Okay.  Now, from your review of the records in this case, would you agree with me that her last physical therapy was in March of 2018?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
184,1114,43,9,Correct.  March 27th.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
185,1115,43,10,"And then she had her EMG test, which you discussed, in March of 2018?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
186,1117,43,12,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,1118,43,13,"And the treatment she got from you, the injection the one time you saw her, was in early April of 2018?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
188,1121,43,16,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
189,1122,43,17,And since then she's had no treatment related to this accident?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
190,1124,43,19,I am not personally aware of any treatment that she had or she did not have.  I had no personal direction with this patient beyond my report and no additional records were provided to me regarding any additional care when I authored this report this summer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
191,1130,43,25,"So to your knowledge, all of her treatment ended with your treatment in April of 2018?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
192,1134,44,3,To the best of my knowledge.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
193,1135,44,4,"Now, the injection that you gave her, you gave her the injection the first and only time you saw Ms. Gebeyaw, right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
194,1138,44,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
195,1139,44,8,And that was done under local anesthesia?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
196,1141,44,10,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
197,1142,44,11,Can you just explain for the jury the difference between local and general anesthesia.,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
198,1145,44,14,"Absolutely.  Actually, the Medicaid, Medicare guidelines recently strongly suggest that based on evidence that we don't utilize sedation such as anesthesia sedation, MAC, monitored anesthesia care, for this type of procedure.  As when you put a patient to sleep you have to intubate them or least put an airway because you're significantly increasing risk of aspiration.  So risks outweigh the benefits despite significant fear of needles, pain with the procedure.  At the end of the day, it's still an injection.  It's still a needle.  So you can try to numb the patient up. So the difference between both, when we do local sedation, we can either give a patient a Valium to make them feel more relaxed and we use a smaller gauged needle to numb up the skin and then put the needle deeper to numb up as much as possible before you put a thick spinal needle in there.  So you at least numb up the track. So when you say, numb the patient up, it's not painless by any means. You still feel the needle going in because you have to go in with a needle to put the local anesthetic deep in.  You feel the burn of the local anesthetic, but you decrease the discomfort versus sedation or anesthesia.  You can either knock the patient out fully flaccid. That's when you have to intubate them.  They can't breathe on their own or can you do something I do in the hospital when I do my own sedition, conscious sedation.  Where we put in the IV and we put the patient in twilight state.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
199,1181,45,24,"Doctor, I think my question -- I'm sorry.  That was a very thorough explanation.  I appreciate that.",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
200,1185,46,2,At least it was educational.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
201,1186,46,3,"Yeah.  And I appreciate that. My questions was simpler.  So local anesthesia would be numbing the area, general anesthesia would be putting the patient to some sort of sleep; is that fair?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
202,1191,46,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
203,1192,46,9,Here you numbed the area?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
204,1193,46,10,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,1194,46,11,And you mentioned something about Valium.  In your operative report you don't mention using any Valium on this particular patient.,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
206,1198,46,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
207,1199,46,16,"And that injection was done in your office, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
208,1201,46,18,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,1202,46,19,"Now, you mentioned that you reviewed the MRI film from Advanced Diagnostics, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
210,1205,46,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,1206,46,23,And did you also look at the report of the MRI film?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
212,1208,46,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
213,1210,47,1,Do you disagree with the report?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
214,1211,47,2,"No.  I agree with the report that there was a herniation at C3/4, that there were preexisting degenerative changes and some osteophytes around the boney spurs.  I certainly don't disagree with the radiologist.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
215,1216,47,7,"Okay.  In your report, you list your diagnoses and one of those diagnoses is DDD, which I believe is degenerative disc disease.  Am I right about that?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
216,1220,47,11,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
217,1221,47,12,Can you tell the jury what degenerative disc disease is.,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
218,1223,47,14,"Degenerative disc diease means when the disc loses their height and discs lose their water content and get some arthritis surrounding the discs means they become weak. A situation such as this, such as the car accident, when you get hit makes them unstable or makes them hurt where they were, like, teeter tattering on the edge before and something pushed them over that edge.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
219,1232,47,23,Is degenerative disc disease a normal part of aging?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
220,1234,47,25,Yes.  100 percent.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,1236,48,1,You also mentioned spondylosis. Can you tell the jury what that is.,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
222,1238,48,3,"Spondylosis is also part of degeneration, part of aging.  It refers traditionally to other parts of the spine, the facet joints or the little joints in the back of the spine where you develop some osteophilic spurs or boney spurs and some overgrowth.  It's another part of arthritis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,1245,48,10,Can you explain for the jury what osteophytes are.,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
224,1247,48,12,"Osteophytes are boney spurs which grow as a result of just age, friction, friction where there is not supposed to be, and traditionally known as arthritic changes.  Just boney spurs, boney hooks, boney projections.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,1252,48,17,Is it fair to say those boney spurs aren't as a result of any car accident?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
226,1254,48,19,"No, no, no.  Not at all.  And that's why I specifically diagnosed this patient as number five under my diagnosis, aggravation of cervical degenerative disc disease and spondylosis.  I separated disc herniation and C3/4 and C4 radiculopathy because that did not have any osteophytes with degenerative changes associated with that specific disc herniation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
227,1264,49,3,"Okay.  I have a few more questions about degeneration in the spine, but I just want to be clear or if you could help me be clear about this.  Degeneration is different from trauma, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
228,1269,49,8,100 percent.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,1270,49,9,"So trauma would be from a car accident or something like that, degeneration would be just from the aging process?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
230,1273,49,12,"Correct.  And to have aggravation of degenerative changes, you don't have to have any structural abnormality. Aggravation just means something that wasn't symptomatic before becomes symptomatic now. Wasn't hurting before, hurting now.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,1279,49,18,I would like to refer to that MRI report.  If you need a copy of it I can give a copy.,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
232,1282,49,21,Got it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,1283,49,22,"It looks like you have a copy there.  On this report it says, all of the intervertebral discs demonstrate loss of signal in the T2 wave series indicating some disc desiccation.  Did I read that right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
234,1289,50,2,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,1290,50,3,"Desiccation, is that a degenerative condition?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
236,1292,50,5,"Yes and no.  Disc desiccation corresponds only to the loss of disc normal water content.  Means, as we age, discs start losing their water and will look less bright. In a 61 -- I think she was at the time of the accident -- old female, you would expect a loss of disc water content.  It only becomes degenerative changes when you start losing disc height or you start developing osteophytes or boney spurs at the end plates of the bones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,1302,50,15,"Let's talk specifically about the C3/4 disc.  That's the one that you said was impacted in this accident, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
238,1305,50,18,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
239,1306,50,19,"First of all, the report says that there is loss of height at C3/4 indicating further degeneration.  Did I read that correctly?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
240,1310,50,23,I don't see that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
241,1311,50,24,It's right above where it starts listing the individual levels.  The sentence right above that.  So right above C2/3 it says -- it starts with additionally.  Do you see that on this page?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
242,1317,51,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

244,1319,51,6,100 percent correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
245,1320,51,7,"And when specifically discussing C3/4, which is the disc at issue here, the first words here are degenerative end plate changes.  Can you explain what that means.",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
246,1324,51,11,"Yes.  Degenerative end pate changes refers not to the disc itself, but to the bones that it sits on.  I'm going to try to draw this.  Just bear with me for one second. And, again, in advance, I'm going to apologize for the quality of my drawing.  All right. On this side, I guess it's the jury's -- I can't figure out the reverse with the camera.  On this one over here you have a normal disc height.  The disc sits nice in the center.  Here you have the degenerated disc. So the disc, as you can see, the height is significantly less for the degenerated disc over here.  So bones are becoming a little too close to each other. So what happens, you may develop these little guys.  They are osteophytes because bone doesn't like to be too close to bone.  So that's what that means.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
247,1344,52,5,"Now, Doctor, I believe you testified earlier that the plaintiff had no prior injuries before this accident; is that right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
248,1348,52,9,"I testified that she had a prior accident before, five years before this one. But she denied any neck pain prior to the accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,1352,52,13,Would it surprise you then that at her deposition she testified she had had neck pain in the past?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
250,1355,52,16,Yes.  In the past it wouldn't surprise me because she did have a prior accident about four or five years ago.  But what I testified is that she did not have any issues ongoing immediately prior to this accident.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,1361,52,22,"Okay.  So when you were writing your report, however, you were not aware that she had ever had neck pain before; is that correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
252,1366,53,1,"If I remember correctly, yeah, I did not remember she had any significant issues that required or necessitated such evasive treatment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,1370,53,5,"Well, I just asked about any neck pain, Doctor.",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
254,1372,53,7,Understood.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
255,1373,53,8,Is your answer still the same?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
256,1374,53,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
257,1375,53,10,"Okay.  Now that you're aware today sitting here that she had had neck pain in the past, that's not changing your opinion, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
258,1379,53,14,"No, sir.  Because we have preexisting degenerative changes.  You have a car accident, what, five years ago.  I would understand why she would have some occasional neck pain.  Doesn't change the opinion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
259,1384,53,19,"Doctor, earlier you testified, did I understand you correctly that you testified that herniations cannot resolve?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
260,1387,53,22,"Majority of the herniations do not resolve completely.  If you have an extrusion, some of it can shrink or herniations can change in size, but herniations do not resolve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
261,1393,54,2,"Now, I'm a little confused by that answer.  So can a person who is symptomatic because of herniation, can they ever feel better, can they ever be not symptomatic?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
262,1398,54,7,"Yes.  And pain can fluctuate, pain can wax and wane as we were discussing on direct.  Depending on the amount of pressure on the nerve, depending on the type of herniation, the symptoms may change.  Sometimes you have a disc extrusion where there is a sequestered fragment.  There is an outside fragment of the disc not connected to the main disc portion and that can actually resolve.  But herniation such as this where it just protrudes back, that is unlikely to resolve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,1409,54,18,"Okay.  Was your injection, the injection you gave her, was that meant to help her?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
264,1412,54,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
265,1413,54,22,Did it?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
266,1414,54,23,"Since she did not come back for the follow-up, I could not tell you how much it helped.  But what I remember specifically is she was incredibly fearful of the needles, incredibly needle phobic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,1420,55,3,"That brings me to a different issue, Doctor.  In your operative report, you actually write that a follow-up has actually been scheduled for patient in our office in ten days, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
268,1425,55,8,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,1426,55,9,And she never came back?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
270,1427,55,10,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
271,1428,55,11,"Doctor, earlier you described how a motor vehicle accident can cause injury. Do you remember testifying about that?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
272,1431,55,14,"I don't think I went into great detail, typical motor vehicle accident.  Every accident is different depending on the type of collision, the angulation of the collision, whether the patient was restrained or not, degree of speed obviously.  But traditionally it's a hyperflexion, hyperextension type of injury with a sudden acceleration, a sudden deceleration.  Basic laws of physics. If you're traveling at a certain speed and you come to a sudden stop, bodies in motion tend to stay in motion.  Just because the car came to a stop, you continue to move, you get thrown against the seatbelt.  You stop, your organs continue to move and they get thrown inside and that's what causes disc herniations.  That's a general mechanism of a car accident.  I didn't -- I don't think I went in such great detail, but that's the gist.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,1451,56,8,"When you say hyper -- I believe you said hyperflexion or hyperextension, what do you mean?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
274,1454,56,11,"Neck is supposed to move at a certain pace, a certain motion.  Typically, when you get in a car accident you develop forceful, sudden extension beyond normal where your neck gets pushed down and then flipped back beyond a certain angle at a very fast pace, like a whiplash.  Which, I think, is typically described as a car accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,1462,56,19,"Now, the reason that people get hurt in car accidents, if I'm understanding you correctly, is because there is force applied to the car and force applied to the body of the patient; is that right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
276,1467,56,24,"Traditionally, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,1468,56,25,And that moves them around?,q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
278,1470,57,1,"Well, yes.  You might not move around if you're fully restrained in a five foot harness such as the race car drivers.  We don't have that in our everyday vehicles.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
279,1474,57,5,"Well, let's talk about Ms. Gebeyaw specifically.  Your testimony to the jury is that she was injured in this accident and that in fact a herniation was caused by this accident.  Am I understanding that right?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
280,1479,57,10,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,1480,57,11,"Okay.  So that would require force to her neck specifically, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
282,1482,57,13,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,1483,57,14,"Okay.  Doctor, in this case she testified that she felt nothing at all during the accident.  Are you aware of that?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
284,1486,57,17,"I'm not aware of her specific testimony that she felt nothing at all. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised by it.  But depending on the type of collision the disc was already, as we read through the report, was desiccated.  Means it was weak.  So if the disc is already weak, you may not feel any immediate pain.  It's actually very common for motor vehicle accidents for patients to be in a state of shock or don't feel much.  Then as the time progresses they feel significant pain or pain increases.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,1499,58,4,"Well, Doctor, certainly her body would have had to of moved for this accident to have caused a herniation, correct?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
286,1502,58,7,"I cannot tell you how much her specific body has moved as a result of the accident, but it's apparent that she sustained some type of disc herniation and torsion type injury due to being sideswiped and her body did move a certain degree.  Because no matter how, if you collide at three miles per hour, you're still going to feel something.  You feel a jolt.  So frankly, I find it hard to believe that she didn't feel anything.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,1512,58,17,"Doctor, you disagree with her testimony?",q,MR. SHUEY,start_answer
288,1514,58,19,Oh.  I'm nobody to disagree with the patient's own accord of what she's feeling. I'm just going by physics.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

294,1526,59,5,"You were mentioning a few terms. Particularly disc degeneration, osteophytes, arthritis, spondylosis, and you were explaining those terms to the jury when talking with counsel.  Could it be possible that somebody has those specific things, arthritis, spondylosis, and then become symptomatic after a trauma such as motor vehicle accident?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
295,1534,59,13,"That's what's described as aggravation of degenerative changes and that's what I listed as number five on my list of diagnoses.  Means, something was there.  It was predating.  It was preexisting, but it was not hurting before and it started hurting after.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,1540,59,19,"Okay.  And in terms of injections, as I know that you were speaking about the injection that you provided to Ms. Gebeyaw back in April of 2018, are injections a permanent fix?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
297,1545,59,24,"No.  Injections are not a permanent fix.  The medication that's injected is a combination of lidocaine and steroid. It's meant to take away inflammation, improve function, decrease pain.  Steroid is going to ware off.  The max shelf life of a steroid is about six months.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
298,1553,60,6,"And just so that I'm clear, in terms of your testimony earlier when speaking with counsel, is that one could become symptomatic after a trauma but not experience any pain at the time of the trauma; is that right?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer
299,1559,60,12,"Yes.  It is very common in motor vehicle accidents.  It has been very well reported in literature work that patients don't feel much pain or don't feel certain body parts hurt immediately after the accident.  And as the day or two days go by, they go to the ER because they feel severe pain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
300,1566,60,19,"And I know that you were speaking a number about the MRIs and the osteophytes and spondylosis, did you review any records or did Ms. Gebeyaw make any complaints about prior radicular symptoms?",q,MS. STURGES,start_answer

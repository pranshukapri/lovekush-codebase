7,158,4,20,All right.  So let -- how many times have you been deposed?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
8,160,4,22,"I don't know the exact number, but I would say roughly eight or nine times.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,162,4,24,All right.  I know we have a list of prior testimony from you.  Is that list exhaustive or is there some prior to that list?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
10,165,5,2,"I only started forensic work probably five years ago, so I think there is one or two more that need to be added to it since I last issued my report but . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,169,5,6,"All right.  So there's a couple that are more recent than the last one that shows up in your report, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
12,172,5,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,173,5,10,When were those?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
14,174,5,11,"Oh, I think it was around October of last year maybe, but I -- don't hold me to that.  I need to probably refer to my latest Rules 26.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,177,5,14,"Okay.  And so, in any event, you've deposed -- you've been deposed two times since then.  Do you recall generally the subject matter of the cases at issue?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
16,180,5,17,I'm trying to think.  I think one was a -- a mower rollover situation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,182,5,19,Okay.  And do you know what the other one was?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
18,183,5,20,"You know, I'd have to look at -- I'd have to look and see.  I can't remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

20,187,5,24,I'm sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,188,5,25,"Since it's only been so many times that you've been deposed, let me just go over some basic ground rules.  I'll do it quickly. Obviously, the Court Reporter here needs to take down everything that both you and I say.  So try to make sure, A, you keep your voice up; B, you give audible responses to the questions so that she can understand and type your testimony.  And try to let me complete my question before you answer the question so that she can take down everything that both of us say. All right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
22,199,6,11,Sounds good to me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,200,6,12,"Okay.  Things like nods of the head, uh-huhs and uh-uhs don't come out clear, so try to use yes or no when you can.  All right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
24,203,6,15,We'll try our best.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,204,6,16,"All right.  If I ask you a question that you're struggling to understand, it's very -- we're talking technical material here.  And if I ask a question that doesn't make sense in the context of how I ask it, please just tell me and I'll attempt to rephrase the question.  All right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
26,210,6,22,I will.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,211,6,23,"All right.  If you answer the question, I'll operate on the assumption you understood it.  Fair?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
28,213,6,25,"Not fair.  I don't -- if you ask me the question and I don't understand it, I may give you an answer so . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

34,225,7,12,All right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,226,7,13,"If I have a question pending, I may ask you to answer that question, but we'll certainly honor your need for a break.  Fair?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
36,229,7,16,I understand.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,230,7,17,"All right.  Let me just start with -- just quickly -- I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Exhibit A to -- for the deposition here today, which this is the Notice of Deposition that actually got issued yesterday and served on the parties.  Have you had an opportunity to review this Notice of Deposition?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
38,236,7,23,"I was actually on the airplane, so it came rather late for me.  But, yes, I did have a chance to read through it, look at the -- at the one before.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,239,8,1,It's -- it's similar --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
40,240,8,2,It's got a few changes in terms of dates and --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

43,246,8,8,All right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_chat

46,255,8,17,I'll hand you what has been marked as some billing records that were produced to us this morning which have been marked as Exhibit A-1.  Do you recognize those documents?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
47,259,8,21,"Honestly, they're available online.  So most of the times, I don't really look at these documents.  But they are, in fact, the ones I -- I, in fact, issued.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
48,262,8,24,"Okay.  And are those -- I haven't had a chance to scour them.  Are those billing records current through today, or do they stop at some point in time and you'll have additional billing to do?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
49,266,9,3,"I -- I bill to the end of the month.  And, basically, every first of the month, I issue my invoices.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
50,269,9,6,All right.  So if anything -- I haven't looked at them.  Do they include billing through the end of July?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
51,272,9,9,"They do, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,273,9,10,All right.  Have you done any additional work since the end of July to prepare for today?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
53,275,9,12,"I have, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
54,276,9,13,Can you estimate approximately how many hours?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
55,277,9,14,"I've done probably an hour and 75 minutes -- no, 1.5 --  1.75 hours.  I do it in quarter-of-hours increments.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,280,9,17,Okay.  So --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
57,281,9,18,"One and three-quarters, I would say.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
58,282,9,19,"All right.  So since the beginning of August, you've worked another hour and three-quarters?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
59,284,9,21,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,285,9,22,All right.  Did you have an opportunity to meet with counsel to prepare for today?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
61,287,9,24,I did.  So that would add another hour.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
62,288,9,25,All right.  All right.  So an additional hour to prepare?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
63,290,10,2,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
64,291,10,3,Okay.  Did you meet with Attorney Rosetti or Attorney Foti or both?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
65,293,10,5,I wrote -- met with Attorney Foti.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
66,294,10,6,Okay.  All right.  And you had -- you had issued a fee schedule as part of your disclosure and your report.  Are you operating under those terms for purposes of what you bill hourly and that type of thing?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
67,298,10,10,"I -- I do.  There is a discrepancy there, though, and it will be corrected on the next -- I've overbilled $30 an hour for some of the work.  It -- it -- what happens is my billing actually occurs with a number in it in terms of my billing hours, and it was assigned to a different activity but -- so I overbilled a little bit, but I will readjust that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,305,10,17,"All right.  So if I understand what you're saying, you have different billing codes for different types of activities?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
69,308,10,20,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
70,309,10,21,And you have a different rate for different types of activities?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
71,311,10,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
72,312,10,24,And something that you did mistakenly got billed to a certain billing code and there needs to be a credit of $30?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
73,315,11,2,"Per hour, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,316,11,3,Per hour?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
75,317,11,4,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,318,11,5,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
77,319,11,6,"So there's $195 that will show up in August, correction.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,321,11,8,Okay.  So the total amount that this is off by is $195?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
79,323,11,10,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,324,11,11,"All right.  Now, we had a little bit of a discussion before we got on the record about the production of your file.  Your file was produced previously to us when we were looking at possibly deposing you sooner.  Is there anything that remains -- that is part of your file now that it is your understanding has not yet been produced to the parties in this case?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
81,332,11,19,"I can think of any, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,333,11,20,"All right.  You mentioned an update -- well, you didn't mention it on the record.  You have an updated CV, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
83,336,11,23,I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,337,11,24,Do you know if we have your updated CV or if that is something we don't yet have?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
85,339,12,1,"Okay.  Well, part of this whole thing was I sent my complete file to Moore, Foti and -- I don't remember the -- whatever, the attorneys here.  And, in the process of that, they said, well, can you just have that information available to the other attorneys in the case.  So my -- my Dropbox is current.  So whatever is in my Dropbox is what is up to date right now.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,346,12,8,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
87,347,12,9,"So you have access to -- to all of the information that everyone else has on this case.  It -- whether you've gone in and taken a look at that, I don't know.  But it's available to you.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,351,12,13,All right.  Fair enough.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
89,352,12,14,So I don't know if you've gotten that or not is the answer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,354,12,16,"All right.  So just so I can get it clear on the record, there was the original production of a very, very large file.  And then you said there were a few additional things.  What are the additional things that have been added to that Dropbox say in the last six months?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
91,360,12,22,"Well, I wouldn't say the last six months. Essentially, I would say what happened in the last three -- three days, okay?  Because I added all the e-mails.  I think we had a June date that we were supposed to meet.  I've added all the e-mails from that June date on until yesterday.  I don't have today's or anything else.  So I've added all the e-mails to that. I've also added some material that I've acquired, two photographs and a -- a Microsoft page that has some URLs on them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,370,13,7,Okay.  All right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_chat
93,371,13,8,Let's go off the record for one second. VIDEOGRAPHER,side_chat,MR. ROBINSON,is brackets

96,380,13,17,"Okay.  All right.  So you mentioned that you updated it in the last couple of days with respect to the some e-mails back and forth between you and counsel, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
97,384,13,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,385,13,22,All right.  I presume that's predominantly just scheduling e-mails and things like that for purposes of coming to this deposition?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
99,388,13,25,"Well, basically most of the e-mails were related to whether or not I should release the Dropbox information directly to you guys, so that's --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,391,14,3,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
101,392,14,4,-- essentially the discussion that was doing on.  I would not release them generally to opposing counsel without getting permission from the ones who I'm working for.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,396,14,8,Understood.  And then you also indicated that there were two photographs.  What are the photographs?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
103,398,14,10,One is a photograph of a -- a floor in -- I was in Home Depot and I took a picture of the flooring in their wood shed.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,401,14,13,Okay.  And what's the other photograph?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
105,402,14,14,The photograph is of a -- from an Irish website where there's gentlemen working over the top of a staircase.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
106,405,14,17,"Okay.  Let's -- let's start with the first photograph.  Why, for purposes of this case, did you add the photograph of the flooring in a wood shed from Home Depot?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
107,409,14,21,It has a non-slip surface.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,410,14,22,"Okay.  All right.  And what, if any, bearing does that photograph have on your opinions in this case?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
109,412,14,24,"My opinions in this case were that the platform was -- had crawl boards on it and it had an aluminum surface that was not -- had no perforations or no -- well, it had holes in it, but the holes were larger than required -- than, you know, the standards and they also were not -- were not slip resistant.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,418,15,5,"All right.  And so how is the flooring in a wood shed in any way directly relevant to that opinion? Well, in their -- there are consistent -- people come in with mud on their -- on their boots and they have to use that particular area and it's of public interest.  And if, in fact, someone would slip or fall or hurt themselves based on that, then, of course, it has some relevance because you've got the same kind of conditions when you're climbing on machinery.",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_question
111,427,15,14,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
112,428,15,15,And there --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,429,15,16,Go ahead.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
114,430,15,17,"And, of course, the hole sizes that were in that area allowed for the mud to -- to clear and clean -- clean itself and -- and not contribute to the slippery conditions that would otherwise occur there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,434,15,21,"Okay.  As -- as it relates to your review of this case, you have absolutely no information at all that Mr. Wylie slipped on that platform when he fell, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
116,438,15,25,"I have information that I -- when I examined it, there are -- that the -- the surface was slippery and it was also noted in Mr. Wylie's deposition that it's slippery on Page 61 of his deposition.  So, yes, there is a connection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,443,16,5,"Okay.  Different question.  At the time Mr. Wylie fell, he testified that he walked backwards off the machine, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
118,446,16,8,"At the time, is that what you mean?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,447,16,9,When --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
120,448,16,10,What's -- what specific moment was that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,449,16,11,Sure.  What's your understanding of the actual mechanism of how Mr. Wylie fell when he fell that day?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
122,451,16,13,I understand that he fell off the back of the machine.  I don't have the details of what -- what occurred there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,454,16,16,So you don't remember from his testimony?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
124,455,16,17,He said he fell off backwards off that platform.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,457,16,19,Right.  And did he testify he literally walked off backwards off that platform?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
126,459,16,21,Can you show me what you're referring to?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,460,16,22,I'm just asking your recollection from the testimony.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
128,462,16,24,My reck -- I don't have a recollection.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,463,16,25,"All right.  Do you agree that Mr. Wylie, at no point in time, testified that he slipped and that, as a result of slipping, he then fell backwards off the machine?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
130,467,17,4,"Mr. Wylie was not specific about his exact moves.  In fact, if we look at those, he didn't tell us whether he had hit -- a toe slip or a heel slip.  We don't have that information.  We know that he fell off the machine backwards.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,472,17,9,"You just indicated in your testimony we don't know if he had a toe slip or a heel slip.  We actually have no information from Mr. Wylie that he slipped at all at the time he fell back off the machine, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
132,476,17,13,I don't have information that he slipped off the machine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,478,17,15,"All right.  So if -- if there's no evidence in this case that he slipped before he fell backwards off the machine, would you agree that the slipperiness has no bearing on the nature of his accident?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
134,482,17,19,"I can't say that, no.  Just because he didn't mention it doesn't mean that it wasn't a factor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,484,17,21,All right.  Well --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
136,485,17,22,So . . .,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,486,17,23,"-- you're an engineer, right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
138,487,17,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,488,17,25,"And in -- in assessing situations such as the current case, you have to look at the body of actual evidence that exists and then render opinions, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
140,491,18,3,"I look at the evidence that exists, and I apply the understanding of the engineering principles that I have to make an assessment of that.  My assessment is, in many cases, more likely than not.  It doesn't have to be a hundred percent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,496,18,8,Okay.  Is it more likely than not your opinion in this case that Mr. Wylie slipped as he fell back off the machine?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
142,499,18,11,"There's a question of slip and trip.  I talked about trip.  I think I -- if I didn't, I meant to.  A trip or a slip are two different things, of course.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,502,18,14,Okay.  Do you have an opinion more likely than not that either of those actually happened?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
144,504,18,16,Let me check -- check my report.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,505,18,17,Sure.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
146,506,18,18,I did not have -- I don't have an opinion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,507,18,19,"Okay.  So you -- let me just make sure I'm clear.  You don't have an opinion more likely than not that Mr. Wylie slipped as he fell off the machine, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
148,511,18,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,512,18,24,You don't have an opinion more likely than not that Mr. Wylie tripped as he fell off the machine?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
150,514,19,1,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,515,19,2,"Based on Mr. Wylie's testimony, do you have an opinion more likely than not that as he was working, moving in a backwards position, that he simply walked backwards off the machine?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
152,519,19,6,I believe he walked backwards off the machine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,520,19,7,"And that's your opinion more likely than not, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
154,522,19,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,523,19,10,"And, therefore, you would agree with me that the slipperiness and/or the potential trip hazard that you've identified would have no impact on the mechanism of Mr. Wylie's fall as it relates to your opinions from a more-likely-than-not standpoint?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
156,528,19,15,What they do is impress me as to how much detail was put into the design of these working platforms.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

292,846,32,8,"I -- I wore many hats, but I started as a -- an intern working in the -- in the machine shop areas around -- learning how to do lathes and so forth; worked in the foundry a little bit so I got some background and understanding of pouring and casting; worked in the heat treat area so I understood heat treating materials. Then I -- I moved into product design after I graduated from college and worked on a number of products, producing design drawings and working through design issues putting cabs on a -- on a tractor, putting egress and -- ingress, egress, considering all those elements of the design. I worked on various other activities; was chosen to be part of a worldwide team to -- to design -- define a -- tractor models that eventually resulted in the 6000, 7000 Series tractors; became the chief -- became a lead engineer for the chassis on that project; worked -- from there, I basically got involved in test and evaluation.  So I spent some time working with product testing. And then I was tapped on the shoulder to start the first precision farming test group that tested software and hardware together, and so I had responsibility for testing desktop applications as well as the embedded software on John Deere tractor -- tractors, combines where I -- I had access to and worked around a lot of tall equipment.  Like combines are tall, very tall equipment.  We had to put -- put the StarFire receiver up on top of those.  So I understood at lot about ingress, egress, but also positioning equipment, using handrails, things like that. Then I -- because of my background, John Deere was starting an initiative to define their processes more completely.  So I think you've probably heard of ISO-9000, things like that, that companies went through at that time.  So I was tapped to do that I -- of my broad background in different areas of the company. And so I worked on that for a while and then helped them with a study on CAD systems.  It was a -- over an eight million dollar project to decide what kind of CAD system we're going to use in the company. And so, after that, basically I decided to -- to find other employment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,889,34,1,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

322,950,36,12,Okay.  And --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
323,951,36,13,Any specific one?  Is your -- is that what your question was?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,953,36,15,"Well, I -- I'm just -- I'm asking you how -- how did the OSHA regulations play into your role when you were performing your various tasks for John Deere?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
325,956,36,18,"Well, I mean, I think I noted that I was involved in ROPS, okay?  OSHA, in 1975, came out with a regulation that every vehicle had to have a rollover protective structure; for example, tractors.  So I had to understand them in all the detail that I needed to to make sure that we designed a product that was compliant with all standards. I also to deal with the -- the European standards the same way.  We had to make sure that they were compliant with EC standards.  So that was just a part of the daily activities. If we wanted to sell in the European marketplace, we had to meet European requirements.  If we had to -- wanted to sell in the United States marketplace, we had to deal with the U.S. requirements. That was part of our job.  If we wanted to sell the product around the world, we had to deal with it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,973,37,10,"So as it related to, say, for example, selling to the European marketplace, did John Deere have branches of the company that were based in these European markets?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
327,977,37,14,"They did.  Of course, just -- their intent was to try to make their balance of trade because of the inflation rates that were going crazy at the time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,980,37,17,"Who -- who -- how was the delineation of responsibility as it related to comply -- complying with the European regulations for design and safety, who -- who was responsible for that?  Was it an entity based in -- in Europe or was it back here in the U.S.?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
329,985,37,22,"Well, of course, when you want to be involved in a worldwide marketplace, there's a lot of dynamics that are involved. I can say that in Europe, there's what's called the Certificate of Conformity that is required.  And their view is that if you provide a product in the marketplace that has been tested, if somebody doesn't -- doesn't fulfill or changes that and does not alert the authority having jurisdiction, then, of course, somebody goes to jail.  And, of course, it has to be European because that's in their purview.  They can do that. In the U.S., we let the product liability cases handle that.  And so there's -- there's a little different dynamic that's involved.  But we do -- if we want to sell in the marketplace, we have to understand what happens in all the marketplaces that we want to sell.  We can't just say, well, I did it good for EC but I don't -- can't -- I don't know what's happening in the United States so I'll sell my product anyway.  There's a -- there's a -- there's a real problem with that kind of thought process.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,1006,38,18,"Would the U.S.-based operations have specialists that would know what regulations and/or requirements applied in every given non-U.S. based location where the product would be sold; or would they rely on, for example, their -- their distribution arm in those given locations to provide them with the input?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
331,1012,38,24,"No.  We were required to know those.  If we were designing a cab, we had to know what the -- what the requirements were in all the marketplaces. Those were brought to us, of course.  I mean, we didn't do it by ourselves.  I mean, there was -- but there was a lot of -- a lot of information provided as to what the requirements were.  Before we started the design, we had to know those.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,1020,39,7,"Got it.  When you -- when you say those were brought to us, from where would they be brought?  Who would get it to you?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
333,1023,39,10,"The -- I'm sorry.  The -- we had a homologation set of folks that understood homologation and they met -- I mean, they go to these standards committees all the time, and they involve themselves in the standards committees.  In fact, they try to establish what the next standard's going to look like so they can make sure that it's as close to conformity across the world as they can. So there was a lot of people that are involved in these large companies, probably TEREX as well, that get involved in the standards committees that make the next set of stand- -- industrial standards that are eventually incorporated into law by either the EC or by the federal government.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,1037,39,24,"Okay.  In your involvement with John Deere, do you recall ever personally designing any -- any equipment with a catwalk on it where you designed it?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
335,1040,40,2,"Where I designed a catwalk?  I wouldn't say I had a -- anything to do with a catwalk, but I did have a lot to do with steps and how those worked and how you got in and out of a -- a cab.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,1044,40,6,"All right.  And there's actually specific regulations that deal with the cab, correct?  Like vehicles that have a cab with an operator that's going to be working in the cab, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
337,1048,40,10,"There's standards that -- that deal with a cab, but there's also standards that deal with the indust- -- industrial standards that deal with just working on a -- on a special -- a piece of equipment, industrial equipment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,1053,40,15,Okay.  All right.  So -- and you indicated that you recall having some involvement with designing equipment for -- for John Deere that had stairs on it. What specific types of equipment?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
339,1057,40,19,"I was mostly involved in my design career in agriculture tractors, so I have to do that.  But I did involve myself a little bit in how we had to install StarFire receivers on combines, cotton pickers, things like that.  I was called in to take a look at those sometimes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,1063,40,25,What's a combine?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
341,1064,41,1,"Combine is what goes through the field and harvests.  It's really the money maker, right?  I mean, it's the piece that actually takes the grain off the -- off the stalk or off the -- off the blade and puts it through the machine and that's what they take to market.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,1069,41,6,Okay.  Did you have any involvement in any design and/or safety aspects as it related to the stairs on a combine?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
343,1072,41,9,"If I -- in terms of what, design?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
344,1073,41,10,Yes.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
345,1074,41,11,"Okay.  I did use them quite -- quite often and was involved from a -- from a use point of view.  But if I felt that something was not safe, I would certainly have -- want that to -- I don't recall of any at this point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
346,1079,41,16,All right.  Do you have any recollection of any incident where you thought something was unsafe and brought it to anyone's attention?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
347,1082,41,19,"Oh, yes.  Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
348,1083,41,20,As far as the stairs?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
349,1084,41,21,"Oh, as far as the stairs?  You know, I don't think so.  I think most of the time, that was pretty well under- -- I mean, taken care of by our safety groups and so forth.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
350,1088,41,25,"Okay.  Turning back to the farm equipment, you said that your other involvement was on farm tractors. Did you personally design farm tractors?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
351,1091,42,3,"I did, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
352,1092,42,4,All right.  Did any of them have stairs?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
353,1093,42,5,"They did, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
354,1094,42,6,All right.  Describe for me the types of stairs they would have.  Why would they have stairs?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
355,1096,42,8,"They had stairs that would allow them to get into the cab, but there was a -- there was a landing in front of the cab door that we had to make sure people could get to. On occasion, the stairs would be used when there was -- the doors were open, so you had basically a step process to get into the cab.  During -- I can remember during some of those times when we were trying to design, there was always this concern about the rails because the steps were -- were much higher than the 30-inch limit.  So there was a concern that if the standards would go to the point where people would have to have a handrail, then we'd have to figure out how to do that on those stairs. We had -- had to -- in fact, I remember sometimes we had to design the bottom step so that it would -- flat so that we could get over an obstacle if -- if it was in the way.  So there was a lot of things that went into those kinds of designs. But I do remember mostly that our hand -- we were able to use hand -- handholds or hand grips, and those were always horizontal, as I recall, in our designs.  So if you wanted a hand grip, it would be above you, and then you would have to hang on to above you with one hand because there's what's called the three-point -- three-point contract.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
356,1122,43,9,"Okay.  Well, in these farm tractor situations -- and I realize they may vary.  I mean, how many different farm tractors were you involved with as it relates to the design?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
357,1126,43,13,"The design of the tractors themselves, probably four or five different generations.  Right?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
358,1128,43,15,Okay.  And were they different generations of a certain model tractor?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
359,1130,43,17,"No, no.  When I say generation, it's different than -- than the automotive -- we're -- we're kind of an automotive -- certainly I was part of SAE, so we're Society of Automotive Engineers, but the number of copies that we make a year were much -- probably like your -- the industry you're involved in, your client's involved in, very low-volume equipment.  So you don't necessarily redesign a whole model, if you will, every year.  It doesn't -- it's not like the auto industry that --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
360,1140,44,2,You'll make changes to the model as you go?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
361,1141,44,3,Correct.  And I think that's kind of what we see here is there was a model change occurring in the 2009 time frame.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
362,1144,44,6,"That's right.  And when you say what we saw occurring here, you're talking about the Powerscreen -- Powerscreen Warrior 1800, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
363,1147,44,9,That's what I'm talking about.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
364,1148,44,10,"Right.  And that model change was a scenario where they now had the option to raise the platform as it related to doing screen-changing activities, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
365,1151,44,13,I wouldn't put it in those terms.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
366,1152,44,14,What -- how would you put it?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
367,1153,44,15,I think they just decided to do that.  It wasn't their option.  It didn't -- they didn't provide you one that had that and one that didn't have that. They did the whole thing that way.  So . . .,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
368,1157,44,19,"Okay.  Let's -- let's -- let's start right there.  So the first -- the model that preexists this modification, okay --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
369,1160,44,22,Model designed in 2005.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
370,1161,44,23,"Right.  So -- but -- yeah, right, that prior model --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
371,1163,44,25,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
372,1164,45,1,"-- it had a stationary platform that could not be raised hydraulically, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
373,1166,45,3,"It used the same pivot point, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
374,1167,45,4,"Right.  And -- that's right.  And so, therefore, if -- and when you say use the same pivot point, there would never be a scenario where the stairs -- for lack of a better term, where the stairs were not separated from the platform like can occur in the newer model, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
375,1173,45,10,"I wouldn't characterize it that way.  I would characterize it that when you -- you have a pivot point, basically the angle can change, but you can't change the elevation.  So the step may have gone down a couple -- eighth inch or three-sixteenths.  I don't -- I'm just trying to be careful here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
376,1179,45,16,"No, that's fair.  That's a fair point.  What you're saying -- let's just --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_chat

380,1186,45,23,Go ahead.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
381,1187,45,24,"Well, I was just going to say that it -- there's a -- there's a completely -- there's a different scenario here.  I just want to make sure that we understood that there is some variation in the -- in the height.  I -- I just . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
382,1192,46,4,"I understand.  What you're saying is -- you were using your two hands, right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
383,1194,46,6,I was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
384,1195,46,7,"And the hand that was aimed to the -- toward the table would be the stairway, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
385,1197,46,9,It was stationary.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
386,1198,46,10,"Right, and that was stationary.  And the pivot point for the platform was -- was where the platform met that stairway and it would pivot, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
387,1201,46,13,I don't know if it was where the platform met. There's a pin there that we can see if we look at the side of the vehicle.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
388,1204,46,16,Right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
389,1205,46,17,And that pin was where it was rotating about.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
390,1206,46,18,"Right.  And prior to the modification, there were two screens on the Warrior 1800, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
391,1208,46,20,I don't agree with that characterization.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
392,1209,46,21,Was there an upper screen and a lower screen?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
393,1210,46,22,"There were -- my understanding, there was four upper screens.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
394,1212,46,24,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
395,1213,46,25,I'm trying to make -- be -- be precise with you.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
396,1215,47,2,"All right.  That's fair.  So there were upper screens on the Warrior 1800 and a lower screen on the Warrior 1800 prior to the modification where you could change the elevation of the platform, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
397,1219,47,6,"That's my understanding, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
398,1220,47,7,"All right.  And when the product existed in that fashion, both the upper and lower screens had to be changed while the platform -- while the platform was what in the newer iteration would be considered working position, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
399,1225,47,12,"No, sir.  I don't have that -- that is not the proper characterization.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
400,1227,47,14,All right.  How would you characterize it?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
401,1228,47,15,There's no definition as to which position it had to be in in the newer nor in the older.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
402,1230,47,17,"No.  What I'm saying, though, is you didn't have to elevate the platform on the former iteration to change the lower screen or the upper screen because you couldn't elevate the platform, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
403,1234,47,21,There was no way to elevate the platform except by using the rear lifting mechanisms.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
404,1236,47,23,All right.  And what was your understanding of why the change was made?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
405,1238,47,25,"Well, I don't know that it was ever described in the -- in the manual.  I don't think that was -- but I think there was a -- there is -- there was some kind of intent to try to make it easier for somebody to change the screens.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
406,1243,48,5,Which screens?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
407,1244,48,6,"Either one of them, I guess.  I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
408,1245,48,7,"Okay.  All right.  Let's go back to your CV. You're licensed in five states but not Connecticut, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

415,1257,48,19,"Correct, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
416,1258,48,20,"All right.  And it indicates that you conducted forensic investigation, failure analysis and testified under oath as an expert witness for a variety of products including the following example cases, and it indicates soil screener. Is that a separate investigation, or is that the instant case that we're here for?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
417,1265,49,2,"Since it dates -- since the date, I think, on this one is September of 2018, I believe it might have referred to this one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

At no point in time during your work at John Deere did you have any involvement with screeners like the product at issue in this case, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
423,1284,49,21,I wouldn't characterize it that way.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

425,1286,49,23,"We had screeners in our harvesting equipment. We were always concerned about what was coming through the screens on an -- of course, you can understand there's grain.  There's things that are moving through it.

426,1294,50,6,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
427,1295,50,7,So there were some -- some aspects of it that are clearly translatable.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
428,1297,50,9,All right.  You didn't design any John Deere screeners for farming; did you?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
429,1299,50,11,I don't understand the question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
430,1300,50,12,Sure.  I asked you whether you had any involvement with screeners.  Were they John Deere screeners?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
431,1303,50,15,"They were screens, yes.  We use screens in the harvesting equipment.  So when you say screeners, are you definitely wanting to see a power screener Warrior 1800?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
432,1307,50,19,"Well, I -- what I'm trying to get at is, did you have experience with designing anything that had similar -- similar characteristics?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

436,1318,51,5,"All right.  Did you have any involvement with any platforms or anything like that associated with those screeners as far as designing it, assessing it for safety issues, that type of thing?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
437,1322,51,9,I was always assessing it.  We were always asked to make sure that everything was safe and we had a safe work environment.  We were always asked to look at those.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
438,1326,51,13,Did you have any elevated platforms on those?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

440,1328,51,15,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
441,1329,51,16,"Those were elevated platforms.  You can see them on those big, huge combine machines, a lot of platforms.  Sometimes we had platforms to work on engines and sometimes we had platforms to do a lot of things on those machines.  Of course.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
442,1334,51,21,All right.  And they had stairways to get to those platforms?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

445,1340,52,2,Never.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
446,1341,52,3,Okay.  So you never had any involvement with that type of an issue?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
447,1343,52,5,No.  There would never -- I didn't see any platforms that were elevated.  All the platforms that I saw were all fixed and --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

487,1438,55,25,"Only one case that I can think of that was not purely lit.  It was to look to see whether a crane could be routed on the California -- from one place to another.  You have to have an engineering approval for moving a crane and making sure that it's not going to hold up traffic or anything, you know.  It has to clear -- it has to clear everything.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
488,1445,56,7,"Okay.  With the exception of that incident or that situation, is there a way for you to describe for me whether all of your litigation-related work was plaintiff work or all of your litigation was defendant work or a mix of both?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

500,1476,57,13,For -- for who?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
501,1477,57,14,"FACETics.  The word ""FACETics"" comes from two -- two terms, ""facet"" and I-C-S, which is a system of facets.  And I was doing a lot of work in regard to keeping track of artifacts, and people were having difficulty.  They -- they couldn't -- I don't know if you're familiar with the Dewey Decimal System. Basically, there's a list of things and you try to figure out which category they fit in out of the -- the best one out of that whole list. Well, with the advent of the -- of the computer, there was a gentleman over in India who worked for the library system that came up with a process called -- his name was Ranganathan, and he came up with a process where you classify them in different points of view.  His was PSMET or something like that which had to do with a lot of different categories. But the bottom line is it's hard to find things unless you classify them in a way that you can really understand them.  We were having problems in the company at John Deere trying to figure out how to find the software version that goes with this hardware and so forth.  So I was trying to help them understand how to do this classification system so that everybody could find what they were looking for in a different way, and it's basically seven -- seven facets that I pro- -- I propose.  So that was kind of the contract work that I was doing along with -- during that time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
502,1504,58,16,Okay.  So --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

507,1513,58,25,"There they might have classified me as an employee.  But, you know, I was under -- as it goes, I was working in my mind as working with smaller companies trying to help them understand how that works.  And you can see the work there was related to how to organize the -- their product.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
508,1519,59,6,"Okay.  And then -- so when you went to Augspurger to move into the field of forensic engineering, did you have to go through any additional training?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
509,1523,59,10,"Well, we -- I was all in-house basically, and I also -- I went to a lot of conferences, joined NSPE, National Society of Professional Engineers, and that allowed me based on -- the academy doesn't let you in until you fulfill a certain amount of forensic engineering background and can demonstrate your skills. So I became a member of the National Asso- Academy of Forensic Engineers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Essentially what you want to do is have a very flat surface where sod can grow.  So after they cut the sod the first time, sometimes they leaves scraps where it's -- the water -- the -- the grass isn't all that healthy and they go around it and they leave it there, but they have to come back and do what they call ""scrape."" Well, he was out scraping that day, and he saw a piece of sod bouncing on the -- on the metal track that picks it up and puts it into a roll.  And so he reached in with his gloved hand and tried to move it off, and his hand got caught and -- in between the roller and the track and it pulled him in. He was standing on -- balanced himself on the roller.  It took everything off him.  He was naked and he was bleeding profusely when they finally found him.

653,1833,71,20,I was supposed to conduct a safety assessment analysis from the documentation that he provided me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
654,1835,71,22,Were you supposed to conduct a full-blown analysis of the -- of any and all issues that you identified as a result of your inspection of the Warrior 1800 at issue?  Or was your assignment more limited that than that?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
655,1840,72,2,"I had already mentioned that my mode operendum (sic) is to look at any safety issue.  In fact, I've had to actually call into question whether something should be actually operated any further in several of my cases.  So if I see a safety issue, I will generally report that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
656,1846,72,8,"You've drawn that conclusion in this case, that this -- that the Warrior 1800 as it existed on the date of this incident should not continue to be operated; is that correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
657,1850,72,12,"I think I -- my -- my conclusions are on Page 60- -- I'm getting there.  On Page 64, I believe I -- I've already identified that due to the serious nature of the defects and nonconformance to federal code, this screener on track should not be sold to any U.S. customer without modifications to comply with all the compliant -- the applicable OSHA and MSHA regulations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
658,1857,72,19,Okay.  Should it be rented to others for use?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

661,1862,72,24,"What I mean is, under my -- as a professional engineer, I'm called upon when I see something that is -- that is a danger to the public, I'm called upon to take action to mitigate it, to get it done.  So --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
662,1866,73,3,All right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
663,1867,73,4,"-- under courtesy of my client, I'm careful not to necessarily raise this.  I've -- I've already brought the awareness -- with my report, I've brought the awareness to -- to the company that produced this machine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

672,1885,73,22,I believe the manufacturer has a lot of responsibility to recall those machines and make sure that they are correctly built properly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
673,1888,73,25,"All right.  So my question is, should an entity here in the United States that owns one of those machines as it existed at the time you inspected it, should that machine be rented to another for use?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
674,1892,74,4,Who is renting it to whom for use?  And what do they know about this particular case?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
675,1894,74,6,"What's the difference?  If your position is that it shouldn't be sold at all because of the nature of the defects that you find in it, don't you also agree that nobody should be renting it to someone else to use it?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
676,1899,74,11,I think the manufacturer should fix the machines before they put them out there.  They need to put a recall out so people understand that they're dan- -- using a dangerous machine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
677,1903,74,15,"Okay.  So let -- let me -- let me just ask you to answer the question that I posed.  Putting aside your opinion on what the manufacturer should do, if an entity in the United States, a U.S. entity, owns and possesses one of these machines, should it actively rent them to others for use?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_chat

680,1914,75,1,"Okay.  If they're aware of the issue, then they should not rent it.  On occasion, people are not aware that they've got a dangerous machine and they continue to do that.  I don't know that I can stop -- I think it's the owner -- owner and manufacturer that, when they know that there's something wrong, they need a recall. That's essentially the . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

689,1933,75,20,Do you know that as part of the way Graham Wylie has made a living since the accident is to either sell and/or rent the Warrior 1800?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
690,1936,75,23,"I think I read in his deposition that he had told a -- a new person that this machine is -- I don't think he used the word ""dangerous.""  I think he used the word if you don't have a gate on it, be careful of it. It will hurt you -- it could hurt you.  I think I remember reading that in his deposition, that he was warning his new clients that this machine had a problem.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
691,1943,76,5,"All right.  So -- but does that absolve -- well, hold on a second.  You said a moment ago that nobody -- nobody that's aware of the issue should either sell or rent this machine to someone else for use in -- in the condition that it's in, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
692,1948,76,10,"I think I said that the manufacturer needs to recall these machines.  If that's not my opinion here -- I think I've said it here, the -- should not be sold to any U.S. customer without modification to comply with all the applicable OSHA and M- -- MSHA regulations.

824,2199,86,11,"I did, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
825,2200,86,12,"Well, who else would you be talking about --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
826,2201,86,13,Well --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
827,2202,86,14,-- as far as who you would go consult with or advise of these issues?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
828,2204,86,16,Okay.  I am a -- a part of the ROPS Standard Committee with the ASABE.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
829,2206,86,18,Say that again.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
830,2207,86,19,"I am a member -- I'm a committee -- involved in committees in S -- ASABE, American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
831,2210,86,22,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
832,2211,86,23,"For example, they're responsible for the ROPS committee.  And in the case of a rollover, I was -- I approached them and I said, Look, I think your standard -- the standards we have today are getting outdated. They don't include a certain piece of equipment that's involved here. So I will go to those committees and try to see if there's anything we can do to make sure that if something hasn't been covered, that it is covered.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
833,2220,87,7,All right.  So --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
834,2221,87,8,"So that's -- that's how I start.  And then, if that doesn't go anywhere, then I'll -- I'll work with the -- with the authority on the jurisdiction. In this case, there's two cases.  The machine is used for wood products, which includes OSHA, and it's included in gravel and whatever for mines.  So essentially I wrote a letter to the -- to OSHA in regard to one of my cases --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
835,2229,87,16,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
836,2230,87,17,-- and I'll follow through on it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
837,2231,87,18,"All right.  And do you -- sorry I keep cutting you off, but I thought you were done. So you envision in this case writing -- first starting by communicating with the ASABE committee about your findings as it relates to this product.  And if that doesn't remedy the situation, you would report the issues to OSHA and/or the MSHA?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
838,2238,87,25,You've mischaracterized my statements.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
839,2239,88,1,"Well, then tell me how I'm mischaracterizing it.",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
840,2241,88,3,"Well, I -- I don't think the ASABE -- this is not an issue.  I was giving you an example of what I have done in the past.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
841,2244,88,6,What would you do in this case?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
842,2245,88,7,"Well, there certainly are standards that apply here, right?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
843,2247,88,9,"Right.  But as I understood your testimony, you indicated that if -- if the standards don't properly cover it, that you might go to that entity to see if the standards can be improved or updated to properly address the situation, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
844,2252,88,14,"That was what I gave you as an example, not this case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
845,2254,88,16,"Okay.  What, if anything, do you plan to do in this case?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
846,2256,88,18,I'll ask my counsel whether he wants me to advance the case.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
847,2258,88,20,So it's up to your lawyer?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
848,2259,88,21,"No, it's -- right now it's under litigation and I'm not going to -- you -- you and your firm are -- have my report.  You know what's -- what my opinions are.  So if there's no action taken, I will follow through and make sure that the public is safe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
849,2264,89,1,But that will depend on a conversation you have with Mr. Wylie's counsel?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
850,2266,89,3,"I won't do it until it's released because you -- your company now, the plaintiff, is aware of the issue.  Now they may not agree with me at this point --",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

854,2275,89,12,All right.  Well --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
855,2276,89,13,Because the people that need to fix it know about it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
856,2278,89,15,Are you saying that there's a question in your mind as to whether the regulations you've cited properly cover the situation?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
857,2281,89,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
858,2282,89,19,There's no doubt in your mind?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
859,2283,89,20,No doubt in my mind.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
860,2284,89,21,That all of the regulations you've cited for violations apply to this situation and this screener?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
861,2286,89,23,I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
862,2287,89,24,Okay.  And -- all right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
863,2288,89,25,But it's my duty as a professional engineer to follow through if I feel the public is at risk.  I lose my license if I don't.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
864,2291,90,3,"All right.  So just so I'm clear, so if and when you get to the point where you want to exhaust that public duty, the entities you would advise are OSHA and the MHSA (sic), correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
865,2295,90,7,"At this point, like I said, I think all the standards are there that identify that there is a problem here, so there wouldn't be no need to do that on this case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
866,2299,90,11,Then who would you publicize it to?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
867,2300,90,12,I -- I was just answering your question.  I know it's kind of a convoluted way but -- I think you're right; the only two entities that have -- fully have jurisdiction here right now are the -- are the MSHA and OSHA.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
868,2305,90,17,All right.  So it's your intent at some point to advise those two entities about the Warrior 1800 in its current iteration?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
869,2308,90,20,"Not if it's a recall.  I mean, if the recall takes place and you guys fix it, I mean the defendants fix it, no problem.  But I have an obligation under my license to do that.  That's the gravity of this conclusion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
870,2313,90,25,"As part of your investigation in this incident, did you become aware of a single instance of any other individual ever falling off the platform on a Warrior 1800?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
871,2317,91,4,"I know I'm not going to give you a direct answer here.  I'm just going to ask you -- in terms of Boeing 737, they had two incidents.  Now it's going to cost them 5.- -- 4.9 billion dollars in reparations. I'm sorry.  One incident is enough here.  You need to figure it out and figure out how to fix it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
872,2323,91,10,All right.  Obviously motions to strike are reserved but . . .,side_chat,MR. ROBINSON,start_question
873,2326,91,13,So the answer to my question is -- are you aware of any other incident where anyone else has fallen off the platform of a Warrior 1800?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
874,2329,91,16,"No, but I am aware of one and that's enough.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
875,2330,91,17,"Okay.  And this all started with a line of questioning where I asked whether you consulted any other experts, any other engineers, anybody at OSHA, anybody at MHSA (sic) before and as part of rendering your report in this case.  And I think your answer was no, you did not, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
876,2336,91,23,I haven't carried it out beyond the confines of my business at this point.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
877,2338,91,25,"All right.  Did you -- did you read any -- only just because of the qualification from counsel, did you re- -- read any other reports, incident reports, anything like that from OSHA or MHSA (sic) or from any other engineers or anyone as part of your analysis in this case?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
878,2344,92,6,I perused them but I didn't pick any of them out as something that I needed to include in my report.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
879,2346,92,8,"When you say you perused them, what did you peruse?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
880,2348,92,10,"I perused the -- the incident reports on MSHA and I found nothing that had Warrior 1800 in it, so . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
881,2351,92,13,"Okay.  And, therefore, you didn't include them as part of the materials reviewed in this case, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
882,2353,92,15,"Well, yeah, browsing through a lot of information sometimes is -- and it doesn't -- if it doesn't impact my opinions, I don't necessarily depend on it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
883,2357,92,19,You don't think that it mattered that you -- that you perused all the incident reports that you could look at from MHSA (sic) and found no similar incident?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
884,2360,92,22,"Well, it told me that my incident was one. Certainly that gave me a -- a data point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
885,2362,92,24,"But, nonetheless, you chose not to include all of that information that would show the lack of a similar incident in your report or in the materials reviewed, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
886,2366,93,3,"My report is 136 pages, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
887,2367,93,4,I get it.  So the answer is you made that decision?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
888,2369,93,6,"I made that decision, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
889,2370,93,7,"Okay.  Did you -- did you look at any OSHA incident reports, anything like that?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
890,2372,93,9,"No, I did not.  I didn't include that in my purview.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
891,2374,93,11,Anything else besides the MHA -- MHSA (sic) reports?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
892,2376,93,13,Not that I recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
893,2377,93,14,Where did you get the information as it related to Powerscreen Connecticut changing its name to Powerscreen New England?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
894,2380,93,17,"Oh, I see where you're going with that.  Yeah, I did include that.  Yeah, I think I included that in my report, too.  You should have that as a -- as an attachment here; isn't it?  Was it included here?  I gave you a website on that on page -- what was it?  I believe it was 88.  Was that your question?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
895,2386,93,23,What page are we looking at?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

901,2398,94,10,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

904,2402,94,14,Page 15.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
905,2403,94,15,"Okay.  All right.  Let's go back to Page 3 of your report.  In the -- right below the paragraph that I just referenced, it indicates that at the time of the incident, Mr. Wylie was helping to set up a demonstration screener.  What did you mean by that, set up a demonstration screener?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
906,2409,94,21,"I think he explained it well in his deposition. If you read it fully, you'd see that he was talking about there's a difference between what they do with a rental and what they do with a demonstration. The demonstration is their expectation that they will buy it, so they put it in for a certain period of time, try to make sure that the machine is operating properly so that they get the best results from the machine.  So they -- they handle them with a little more tender care than they a rental because their expectation is that some day it will be converted to a sale.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
907,2420,95,7,"Okay.  All right.  I just didn't -- I wasn't sure if you were trying to say that he was doing -- setting up a demonstration of the screener or if this was a demonstration screener.  I get it.  Okay.  It's the latter, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
908,2425,95,12,It's a demonstration machine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
909,2426,95,13,"Got it.  Now, on the next paragraph, you indicate on the date of the incident and by the time Mr. Wylie arrived on the scene, Mastro employees had already raised the screenbox to its mesh-change position.  This means that the front jack-up cylinders were in their extended position and they had secured the jack-up links in mesh-change position, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
910,2433,95,20,That's my understanding.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
911,2434,95,21,All right.  Where do you get that understanding?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
912,2436,95,23,From his deposition.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
913,2437,95,24,"Did you read the part of the deposition where Mr. Wylie said he didn't recall one way or the other whether the -- whether it was in the raised position or in the lowered, working position?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
914,2441,96,3,"You know, Mr. Wylie had a lot to say.  I had to assume -- I had to -- not assume.  I had to read into it with my judgment as to what was going on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
915,2444,96,6,How do you make a judgment whether he fell off a raised platform or fell off the platform in the lowered position?  How do you make that judgment without actual evidence of what happened?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
916,2448,96,10,"I think there was also evidence in Mr. Dan Witte's.  I have to look and see.  I'm sorry; I may be talking outside -- let me take a look, sorry.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

ROBINSON,start_answer
940,2499,98,11,No.  No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

When he came up -- he was being asked what he observed when he came up to the machine, and I have to trust what he thought was happening at that time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1056,2744,108,6,"All right.  So that's consistent with what we were just talking about.

1077,2804,110,16,"No, it's not my interpretation.  It's in that -- in the steps.  You can see the steps all say stop -- stop the -- stop the engine, start the engine, raise and lower the deck to do those things. There's no -- no step in there that states to put the -- put the -- the -- I'm going to say the screenbox structure down into the lower position to work on the -- on the nuts and bolts on the -- on the upper level.

I appreciate where you're going with your opinion, but I'm asking you a very simple question. Do you have any information about the instructions at -- that -- that appeared in the manual for the Warrior 1800 as it related to screen mesh changing prior to the implementation of the jack-up feature?",q,MR.

Now, if people in the industry had been familiar with the screen-mesh changing procedures prior to the existence of the jack-up feature, and then this change comes out which provides them with instructions about how to raise and implement the jack-up feature into its raised position, do you agree with me that those people in the industry that had that familiarity already knew how to change the screen?",q,MR.

1090,2854,112,16,It can be done either way.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1094,2865,113,2,"I think that's what he said, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1148,2966,117,3,There is a -- there is a label that is very confusing to read.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1149,2968,117,5,We'll get there in a minute.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1150,2969,117,6,Okay.  You asked the question.  I -- I gave my answer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1151,2971,117,8,Okay.  So you're saying it's not a clear instruction that it says do not climb?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1152,2973,117,10,"The word ""climb"" -- do not climb has a -- has a connotation that I think we need to explore because it could mean a lot of things to different people.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1153,2976,117,13,"If -- if the platform is in the jacked-up position and, therefore, the stairway doesn't have any form of a natural progression to the platform, wouldn't it be necessary to climb in some fashion to get up onto the platform?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1154,2981,117,18,"It would be necessary to climb up onto a step. I think we say we climb onto a step.  So the very fact that there's a step means that you have to climb. That's a part of the process of moving our -- our center of gravity up a particular item.  So the word ""climb"" can mean as simple as don't put your foot on this piece of metal if you -- if you understand what I mean.  So the confusion is very, very difficult here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1155,2989,118,1,"Okay.  Going back to Page 3 of your report, you -- you have a section at the bottom of Page 3 about Mr. Wylie's hospital course.  Is there anything about that that relates to your opinions in this case?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

I just simply understand that if he fell on his -- on -- on the step, he probably got injured in this way, and that's where I stop.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

It comes from different places, but it summarizes it for me so I know what's -- what's happened.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1177,3036,119,23,"If you look at the files, you'll see that it was just that manual.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1178,3038,119,25,Okay.  All right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1179,3039,120,1,They kept -- came in separate electronic files.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1181,3044,120,6,"I'm an expert in mechanical systems.  My whole development, whole education was involved in mechanical systems. I do have some experience, of course, in software.  I told you about that as well, testing software.  So there is a -- there is -- there's a span of things, but I've involved -- I've been involved in metal formation.  I've been involved in all sorts of different mechanical types of devices, and that's what I spend my time doing is looking at mechanical systems.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1184,3060,120,22,"All right.  The specific standards that are cited throughout your report -- and there's a lot of them, right? -- did you have personal prior experience in assessing products and applying these particular standards?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1185,3065,121,2,"I think the answer would be yes.  You know, having to apply steps and so forth to -- to the equipment that I was involved in designing, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1186,3068,121,5,"Okay.  OSHA and MSHA have conflicting -- or maybe that's not the right word.  They have -- they each have separate jurisdiction over certain circumstances, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1187,3072,121,9,"That's correct, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1188,3073,121,10,Which apply here?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1189,3074,121,11,This particular machine applies to both -- both of them apply because the machine is actually used for wood products as we know it as well as stone and gravel. So they would both have jurisdiction.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1190,3078,121,15,"Okay.  Now, you agree that both MSHA and OSHA actually are regulatory schemes that apply to employers, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1191,3081,121,18,I understand that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1192,3082,121,19,"They apply to employers and they apply to job sites where employees are working, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1193,3084,121,21,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1194,3085,121,22,All right.  They're not actually manufacturing regulations; is that fair to say?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1195,3087,121,24,"I think if you're going to use a part- -- particular piece of equipment by an employer that -- that somehow the manufacturer has an obligation to read those same -- those same standards and make it possible for those employers to use that.  So indirectly they are, yeah.  They're -- they're under the same jurisdiction.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1196,3094,122,6,"Well, the regulatory scheme applies to employers, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1197,3096,122,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1198,3097,122,9,"And, in fact, OSHA can only implement any kind of an action as it relates to an OSHA violation to an actual employer, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1199,3100,122,12,"That's correct.  But if  the equipment is -- that they're use- -- that they're implementing and applying doesn't meet the standards, then, of course, they're not going to be able to use that anymore, right?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1200,3104,122,16,"And that would be the employer's decision to use or not use that particular piece of equipment, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1201,3107,122,19,"The employer makes the decision, yes.  That doesn't -- but that does not preclude the employee from -- from stating that the equipment that the employer purchased was -- was -- was dangerous to him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1202,3111,122,23,"All right.  And Mr. Wylie actually had a crew of other mechanics or operators that worked with him on these machines both before and after this incident, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1203,3115,123,2,I don't understand your question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1204,3116,123,3,"Did you see from Mr. Wylie's testimony that he was the salesman, but -- but the company that he worked for also had other individuals, operators, that would perform things like screen mesh changes and do different types of activities on the machines?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1205,3121,123,8,"No, I didn't see that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1206,3122,123,9,Okay.  All right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1207,3123,123,10,I don't think that was true.  That was -- that's a mischaracterization of his statement.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1208,3125,123,12,Was Mr. Wylie -- was Mr. Wylie a supervisor of any other employees?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1209,3127,123,14,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1210,3128,123,15,"Okay.  And just if I wasn't clear, it's also true -- I think we were talking about OSHA predominantly, but the same is true for the Mine Safety Health Administration and its regulations.  It implies -- it applies to the employer, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1211,3133,123,20,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1212,3134,123,21,All right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1234,3168,125,5,"I want -- I want to follow-up on something we talked about earlier.  You indicated that there are problems with the machine regardless of whether the platform is in the jack-up position or in the lowered, working position, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1235,3173,125,10,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1236,3174,125,11,"And what you mean by that is, the machine is what it is.  If I've identified these problems, it doesn't mean that if you lower it, these problems don't still exist because the machine still has the capacity to be raised, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1237,3179,125,16,It has nothing necessarily to do with lowering and raising.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1238,3181,125,18,"All right.  Well, is -- is a gate required -- if -- if this platform was -- was secured and could not be raised to the jack-up position at the 55-inch height, would a gate be required?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1239,3185,125,22,"At that point, it becomes questionable whether or not it's an aerial lift.  As soon as you start jacking it up, it becomes an aerial lift.   At that point, it is required that there be a gate on it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1240,3189,126,1,"So -- but -- so let's back up.  If it's -- if it's not -- if it doesn't have the ability to be jacked up, right --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1246,3200,126,12,Does it require -- does it require a gate?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1247,3201,126,13,I think the issue is not so much whether or not it requires a gate.  It's whether or not the work area is secure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1248,3204,126,16,"Well, pursuant to your analysis of the case, would it require a gate if it was never going to be raised and it was secured there?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1249,3207,126,19,"Again, it's -- it's where the work needs to be performed that's -- that determines whether or not there needs to be a gate or not.  So, yes, it would have to have a gate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1250,3211,126,23,"What regulation would you rely on to state that in the 55-inch height, a gate would be required?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1251,3213,126,25,"Okay.  There needs to be some kind of way to protect the operator while he's in -- working on this -- in this particular mode.  It -- it appears to me that Powerscreen, their opinion was that as long as he could hang on -- hang out over the work area and reach these three bolts that extended past the platform, it was none of their concern.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1252,3220,127,7,What's the basis of your testimony that that's what Powerscreen thinks?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1253,3222,127,9,"I know it's very difficult, but at some point you have to assess where we are here.  There is no work -- the work platform does not extend the length of the task.  I think that's clear here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1255,3228,127,15,"Mr. Donnelly -- yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1256,3229,127,16,"All right.  And they testified about how you could change those three bolts that extend off the platform simply by standing on the first step of the stairs, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1257,3233,127,20,"You've got another standard though that you have to meet.  That is, you have to have a three-point -- if you're standing on the stairs, you have to have a three-point connection.  So either both feet have to be on the stairs and one hand attached or one -- one -- two hands have to be attached and one foot on the stairs. So there's a -- there's a problem by doing that.  By saying that you can do that, that's against the standards.  You can't do that with the standards. So you're required to have a three-point connection to the -- to the vehicle.  So how can you reach the bolt and tighten it if that's the case?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1258,3245,128,7,Where in -- where in your report do you talk about this three-point --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1265,3256,128,18,"I think it was an OSHA for sure and that -- if that's -- I mean, I -- we've established that it doesn't matter whether it's one or the other, MS- -- MSHA or whether it's OSHA, right?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1266,3260,128,22,"Okay.  So I don't recall reading anything in your report about any violation of a three-point attachment, but I might have missed it.  It's a long report.",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1306,3350,132,12,"I -- I would presume you could, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1307,3351,132,13,All right.  And you're saying that that C-shaped rod would prevent you from standing with both feet on the first stair?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1308,3354,132,16,No.  I'm saying at the second one.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1314,3366,133,3,"As I understood it, he was -- let me see if I can characterize it, and maybe you'll agree or whatever. But, anyway, he was standing on the platform with his back towards the entrance, and he had his hands on a spanner, which I believe is a wrench.  We call it a wrench.  And he was holding the wrench for Dan Witte who was in the screener above on the screens using an air gun on the bolt heads to tighten them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

They're climbing -- while you're -- as we've stated before, the word ""climbing"" is -- is -- you're trying to make it a legal term, and it's a -- it's one where you put your foot up on the step.  You're climbing the stairs.  We use that term all the time in a colloquial sense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1398,3533,139,20,"Well, it's -- like I said, it's potatoes, potadoes.  We don't know whether it's a stair, a ladder. Those -- that information is not clear to us because I don't have what the design standards were that they used to design this product. So if there's no -- if, for example, I take, for example, this aerial lift that we have, I don't see any controls.  But, in essence, if it was a real aerial lift, there would be controls that the operator could do and you wouldn't have to worry about communicating to somebody a long ways away for operating the machine. So, like I said, this -- without the design intent and without knowing what standards were being applied, at this point, it's my -- my estimate that it could be either or all of the above so . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1399,3548,140,10,"As an expert, for purposes of trying to define what this platform was, isn't the lack of controls on the upper platform an indicator to you that it's not an aerial lift?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1400,3552,140,14,"Well, isn't there a sign that says do not get on this thing while you're doing certain -- no, there's no -- there's no signs.  There's nothing that -- that tells me -- anybody on the machine to stay off that lift.  So it would be an aerial lift because it moves the person above.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1401,3558,140,20,"So back to my question, for purposes of the definition of an aerial lift, does the lack of -- of a control on that upper level indicate to you that it is not an aerial lift?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1402,3562,140,24,"I don't know what the intent of the designer was.  But if it goes up, it certainly has to have controls. But back to the -- I want to finish up.  I was going to continue that four-step issue.  There's -- there's a -- actually, the standard requires two things. One is whether or not it has four steps or whether or not the platform is 30 mill -- 30 inches from the ground.  So, in that case, it violated as well. So . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1403,3572,141,9,Which -- which regulation are you referring to now?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1407,3577,141,14,"We'll come -- we'll probably come back to it. Notwithstanding your opinions as it relates to whether there should have been a railing on this stairway, you agree that the lack of a railing on this stairway had nothing to do with Mr. Wylie's fall, correct?",q,MR.

1410,3587,141,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1411,3588,141,25,"And, therefore, the platform was elevated above the stairway and the stairway was down below off of the unit, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1412,3591,142,3,The stairway was down below off the unit?  The stairway is affixed to the chassis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1413,3593,142,5,"Right.  And so when the platform raises, the stairway does not raise, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1418,3602,142,14,"I don't see it that way.  I think you're mischaracterizing my -- I would say ultimately that the availability of a handrail is there so you can catch yourself as well.  So if -- it not being there, of course he had nothing to hang on to, right?  So as you move -- as you're falling, you can grasp at things that are still in your -- in your purview and reach, so I can't characterize it that way.  Your statement is -- is --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1424,3620,143,7,"It doesn't have a gate, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1425,3621,143,8,"Right.  And if you fall backwards through that open area where there's no gate, the -- the -- the stair railing that you're talking about would be attached down below --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

It has to go to the four -- Step No. 3 would have the beginning of the plat- -- of the handrail.  The handrail has to be on the open side based on the standard, and it has to have -- and you have to be able to grasp it, and that would have been a last chance had he been able.  So I don't agree with your characterization.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1433,3646,144,8,What do you mean by the width question is two parts?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1434,3648,144,10,"There's -- there's a width requirement if there's a single person on it, and there's a width requirement if there are two on it.  According to Mr. Donnelly, he felt that -- that somebody shouldn't be climbing on the screens, and I agree with him.  And I think I said that in my report.  So the platform should have been designed for two people; that's one question. The other -- the fact that Mr. Wylie was on the platform by himself, there is a -- they have a cover over this flywheel, and it restricts it to less than what the requirement is and the standard.  So there are two problems there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1467,3715,147,2,"Well, it -- it -- it determines how close in or how far out a -- a handrail would be.  So it's very important that you have -- maintain that width so that you can -- you can grab those things as you're -- as you're falling down a set of stairs.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I worked with a company called Henry Dreyfuss & Associates.  I don't know if you ever heard of them or not.  They were heavily involved with AT&T and others when they -- and we had to deal with a lot of those mechanical things that we do with our hands and our arms, especially when you're in the middle of operating levers on a machine.

Notwithstanding your opinion, which I recognize already is that it's not clear from the written materials that nobody should be on the platform when it's in the raised position -- I understand that that's -- that's your position. But if, in fact, the instructions, warnings, materials were sufficient such that everyone knew the only purpose of placing the platform in the jacked-up position was to perform the change out of the screens, the lower screens, and to perform whatever work you could otherwise do below the platform and, therefore, no one would ever be on the machine when it was -- on the machine platform when it was in the jacked-up position, would the machine be in violation of any of the regulations we've discussed?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

You know, the whole question is foreseeability and foreseeability of whether or not someone might violate that just to get the job done. You know, I think you have to physically restrict that from occurring or you'd have to put enough -- enough deterrent to make sure that nobody does that because you can do both screens at the same time.  It just makes it more efficient.  I mean, people go for the efficiencies. You're always being challenged to be efficient. So foreseeability, I think, is the issue here, and whether they took enough steps to avoid -- to eliminate -- I can go down through the list of the Z10 things to reduce their risk.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1563,3947,156,9,"Of course.  The platform lifts.  The -- the work -- work area doesn't continue along the task.  And I mean by that that there's three bolts still off the end of the work area, right?  We've got to understand that.  And if the -- if the platform doesn't go continuously, then we don't have a safe product here. So, yes, it would be in violation. You don't work over stairs.  You don't work over moving parts.

ROBINSON,start_answer
1565,3964,157,1,"No, sir.  I didn't -- you're mischaracterizing my testimony.  I would include a gate if -- if there were stairs that were down there and you needed to lean over those stairs to work on something if you were restrained and had a -- had -- I mean, there's a lot of things that have to go together.  It's -- that wasn't -- I -- I was not privy to the design intent here so -- and I'm asking for the design intent because I want to understand what was the intent.

Three, if you can't do that, the next step is to try to engin- -- to -- to put in engineering controls so that if somebody had a -- you had a -- you have a switch, for example, on the raise and lower.

1692,4248,168,10,"Again, I'll say I don't know the intent of the designer on this particular design.  It has characteristics of aerial lifts.  It has characteristics of scaffolds.  It has characteristics of walkways.  It has characteristics of all these.

1693,4256,168,18,Okay.  How -- why would it be an aerial lift?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1694,4257,168,19,"Well, because it's on a self-propelled machine and you can raise it, and that's what -- the definition of an aerial lift is a machine that has a platform that lifts up and carries personnel with it or could carry personnel with it.  So, to me, it's -- it could qualify, but what's absent is the controls.  So it's hard to distinguish which one of these we have.  So, therefore, we have to include all of them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1695,4265,169,2,"Unless, of course, the intent is not for it to carry personnel at all when it's in the elevated position.  Then it's not an aerial lift, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1696,4268,169,5,"It's an aerial lift.  It's a question of whether or not you -- you prevent people from being lifted on it.  So you'd have to sense where people are, and you'd have to sense what is going on on the machine and foreseeability. So I -- I think I've answered that question, but I know it's really hard because, as you look at it, it would seem that you could tell somebody don't get on that thing and it would be fine.  But if you're not there to tell them, nobody is going to know it.  They're going to use -- use whatever means that they have to make the operation efficient.  I think we've been through that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1697,4281,169,18,"Okay.  But, I mean, to qualify as an aerial lift, it has to have the intent to lift people, correct? It's not it just lifts cargo?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1698,4284,169,21,I -- I -- do you know what the intent was?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1699,4285,169,22,"I'm asking you, to qualify as an aerial lift for purposes of your -- of your opinions, would one of the requirements of an aerial lift be a lift that would actually lift people, for example, as opposed to just lifting . . .",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

You can carry a lot of things in an aerial lift, and so, you know, to just say -- for me to try to answer that question, I don't think -- again, I think what you have to do is -- is really try to figure out if that was the intent of the -- and, in my opinion, it was.  Basically, the intent was to -- again, I know there's -- there's information in -- in the documentation; you're going to say that. But I think foreseeabilitywise that there was no statement made do not get on this lift in their instructions.  There is no warnings that say don't get on this lift.  It says -- in fact, it says use this lift, according to the warning that I saw.  It says you need to get on this thing because that's what you -- what it's intended for.

1708,4316,171,3,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1717,4334,171,21,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1719,4338,171,25,"All right.  And then, below it, it says, Do not climb on machine, and there's a person climbing their way onto, you know, a structure with a red circle around it and a line through it, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1720,4342,172,4,"I think I see that, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1721,4343,172,5,"All right.  So clearly the warning is telling the user and/or someone approaching the machine not to climb on it, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1722,4346,172,8,It's saying that you should not climb on it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

So just so we're clear, you don't think the average human being would be able to comprehend that warning with that -- with that demonstrative diagram as to what they mean by don't climb on the machine?  Just for purposes of your opinion, it's not clear, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1730,4365,173,2,It's not clear.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Your counsel can ask you any questions he wants.  Or at trial, you can clarify anything you want.  Just answer my questions, please. All right?

1746,4400,174,12,Do I get to answer the question in full?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1747,4401,174,13,"Yeah, I asked you whether, throughout your report, you rely on this other diagram which shows the person on a lift and these words that say ""use a suitable lifting platform to service the machine"" for the proposition that what that's conveying to the user is that they should use the platform at issue in this case as a lifting mechanism, correct?",q,MR.

1754,4418,175,5,"All right.  So what it conveys is that -- that instead of climbing on the machine, they should be using a lift.  I've already pointed out there's several problems with the wording of it already, and so hinging everything on a word doesn't help this. ""Suitable"" would be a word that -- they wouldn't understand necessarily what a suitable -- how it differs from the lift platform that they're using already.  So I think it conveys the idea that you shouldn't be climbing.  You should be using -- you shouldn't be scaling.  You should be using the platform that we've provided here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1805,4522,179,9,"Okay.  So, now, back to this, Page 61, you actually state, This warning level conveys a message that the operator must use the aerial lift.  And you're referring to the platform that's part of the machine, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1806,4527,179,14,"That was the way I would interpret it, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1818,4545,180,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1819,4546,180,8,"Okay.  Should there be any kind of a warning sign, such as those that appear on Page 61, to tell the user not to climb up on the railings?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1820,4549,180,11,I don't understand your question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1822,4553,180,15,The -- the images do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1823,4554,180,16,Right.  Is there any kind of a sign that would be required to tell someone not to climb up on those railings?  Or would that just be common sense?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1824,4557,180,19,"It gets down to where it's physically -- the height of the railings are specified, and I have to admit, I did read one case where somebody put a -- put a -- a pipe across the midsection.  I was talking to you about the MSHA things I read where they actually put a beam across the midsection once, stood on top of that, fell off 56 feet to their death. So I'm sure there's probably cases where you need a sign, Hey, don't do something stupid here.  It's 4:30 in the afternoon.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1825,4567,181,4,"So do you think there's a sign that would apply to that situation, like, Hey, don't do something stupid. Don't put a beam across an obvious hazard.  It's 4:30 in the afternoon.  Is there a sign that you can use for something like that?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1826,4572,181,9,It's -- it's a matter of determining how to -- how to mitigate your risks.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1827,4574,181,11,"So under some circumstances, the sign I just described should be used?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1828,4576,181,13,"There's -- sometimes a gate is worthwhile. Sometimes a restraint system is worthwhile. Sometimes all these different things that we can do to try to mitigate.  I think I told you about the Z10, and we can down through that again if you want to.  Warnings are way low.  Warnings are way low.  We try to -- we try to eliminate before it gets down that low.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1829,4583,181,20,Right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1830,4584,181,21,"So you're asking me a question that I'm saying, well, I'm going down through my hazard reduction.  And at some point, you've got to say, look, I've done what I could to help the guy.  I've instructed him, whatever. And there may be training.  Again, we don't have that information.  I don't know what was talked about at all on that so . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1832,4595,182,7,"It caused one person's death.  It depends on the situation, right?  I think you've got to look at each -- each set of circumstances differently.  Here we're looking at a specific case.  You're asking me for a hypothetical, and I'm saying, well, it depends. Because you've got -- again, you've got to use the Z10 risk mitigation process in -- when you're developing and designing product.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1833,4603,182,15,"All right.  And one of the ways you can determine the foreseeability is if something actually happens and then you now know it can happen, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1834,4606,182,18,"Well, foreseeability is -- is taking proactive action.  And I notice they did have a risk assessment, but I'm not sure.  I can't recall what the dates were on that.  I doubt they went through that process and decided that there was a problem there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1835,4611,182,23,Did that risk assessment form the basis for any of your particular opinions here?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1836,4613,182,25,"Yeah.  I did look at it.  I did see the level of detail that went into it.  Again, I -- I failed to put it on a timeline, so I'm a little -- I can go down and look through it, if you want me to.  Anyways, it's on Page 7.  I can go look at it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

1859,4678,185,15,"When the screenbox is running, no one should be around -- on the platforms and the -- and the support should be lowered, yes.  The machine should not be operated when it's in the upper position.  That's why it's so confusing here because we don't have exact records or we don't have exact statements.  All of a sudden, it's up, and all of a sudden, it's down.  It's locked out and then it's not.  It's -- it's not proper instructions here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1862,4693,186,5,What do they do?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1863,4694,186,6,"Well, they -- basically, we have to start the machine up and run it and put it into its shaking mode. The screenbox has to be moving.  It's just like sifting flour.  You have to get the machine to move, and there's a crank in there that's a -- has an offset weight and that offset weight turns and causes the shaking to occur.  And we get -- you get a certain amplitude based on how much mass is being moved at what speed.  There's oscillations that occur because of this sinusoidal action of the -- of the mass, and that's what causes things to move through the screen.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1864,4705,186,17,"And in order to do that, the jack-up position needs to be removed down to the working position so that you can perform that vibration test, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1867,4710,186,22,"Now, you asked -- but I think the question was would a person with a -- that does it everyday know what to do about that.  I think that was what I understood. Now, if you're a brand-new person, you'd have to explain that to the.  But if you were using it all the time, you wouldn't.

1919,4828,191,15,"All right.  How do we know which governs?  And when you say federal regulations, which ones?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1920,4830,191,17,We've gone through the CFRs.  I think they -- I think those are all . . .,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1921,4832,191,19,"All right.  So the CFR conflicts -- so you've relied on this, J185, for various opinions?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1922,4834,191,21,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1923,4835,191,22,"But if it conflicts with what, OSHA or the MSHA, OSHA or the MSHA would govern?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1924,4837,191,24,"Again, it's a question of -- this is -- this is, in fact, a CFR as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1925,4839,192,1,I thought that you told us that OSHA adopted this?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1926,4841,192,3,"Well, don't we have that on the first page?  It says U.S. code has been adopted.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1927,4843,192,5,Okay.  So does this govern?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1928,4844,192,6,This governs along with everything else.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1929,4845,192,7,"Okay.  At Section 9.4 it states, Where an opening has been provided in a guardrail other than to provide access to a ladder or to steps, a device shall be provided across the opening that meets requirements specified in 4.3, right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1930,4850,192,12,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1931,4851,192,13,"And 4.3 is the section that talks about handrails, handholds, guardrails capable of doing a variety of things, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1932,4854,192,16,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1933,4855,192,17,Doesn't 9.4 assume the lack of something blocking the access to a ladder or the steps?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1934,4857,192,19,"It's for an opening, but the intent of the work space here, there were three more bolts off the end, so you had to work over those steps, and that's where it doesn't anticipate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1935,4861,192,23,"Okay.  Well, that -- okay.  So, but for the three bolts --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1936,4863,192,25,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1937,4864,193,1,-- this would apply?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1938,4865,193,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1939,4866,193,3,"All right.  And, again, you don't accept Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Witte's testimony about how you access those bolts is not from the platform?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1940,4869,193,6,"I don't accept that, no, because it doesn't -- you don't have the three-point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1941,4871,193,8,"Okay.  And, again, your point about not having the three-point is because it might be a ladder, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1942,4874,193,11,It might be a ladder.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1943,4875,193,12,"You had a document in your file called Safeguarding Equipment and Protecting Employees From Amputations.  It's an OSHA publication.  Is -- is that -- did that form -- anything within that form the basis of your actual opinions in this case, or is it the regulations that we've already talked about?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

1947,4885,193,22,"Give me a couple minutes.  I may be either done or very close to done.  Let me just look over a couple things. Okay.  Quick question:  Because Powerscreen -- you laid out in your report how there's Powerscreen in Ireland, and then there's the Powerscreen importer in the U.S., and then that gets sold to -- you know, product then can get sold to Powerscreen Connecticut who then -- who, obviously, Mr. Wylie works for, right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1948,4894,194,6,I don't believe he works for Powerscreen Connecticut anymore.  I think it's New England now.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1950,4897,194,9,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1951,4898,194,10,-- New England or Connecticut.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1952,4899,194,11,Okay.  I'm sorry.  I just want to make sure --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1953,4900,194,12,"But there's a -- your understanding is that, not withstanding Powerscreen Connecticut, there -- which is a separate company --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1954,4903,194,15,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1955,4904,194,16,"-- a different entity, that there is a Powerscreen entity affiliated with the Irish companies that is the American importer of the -- of the product, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1956,4908,194,20,"I'm not sure who is the importer, but I know TEREX is the overall parent.  So they would be responsible for what comes into the United States.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1957,4911,194,23,"I was wondering whether you have any opinion one way or the other as to whether the -- the arm of that company, the American importer of the product, or whether the Irish manufacturer of the product, Irish -- Ireland-based manufacturer of the product, would have the obligation to comply with these various regulations? Is it one or the other or both?  Or how do you -- how do you see the responsibility?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1958,4919,195,6,"Well, I'm not a -- I'm not a -- not an attorney, as you know, so my opinions would be based on what I've heard before or seen before in my -- my work. But a lot of times, you know, we get these -- we import a toilet.  I'm thinking specifically of a toilet hose that goes underneath from your hose -- from the spigot on your water.  You turn it off there and up to the toilet. A lot of times, it's hard -- very hard to trace who actually produced that particular product, but whenever we can, we try to trace it to the manufacturer and -- who imported it or the person who imported that product because they are basically bringing in a product that needs to comply with U.S. and federal requirements. So that's my understanding.  I don't know who in this case actually imports it.  I don't really -- I -- I think it fits under the parent company to -- to identify that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1959,4937,195,24,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1960,4938,195,25,For you.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1961,4939,196,1,What specific warnings and/or decals do you believe should have been on this machine that aren't there?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1962,4942,196,4,"Again, I don't know the design intent.  We've gone through the Z10 activities, and we can go down through that again if you'd like me to.  But I think there's a lot of things that could have been done to the machine prior to doing any warnings at all, and that's why I don't want to opine on which specific warnings should have been on the machine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1963,4949,196,11,Okay.  What should have been done to the machine prior?  What should they have done?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1964,4951,196,13,"Well, you need -- you need to make sure that the work platform is as long as the task.  In other words, you shouldn't stop three short because somebody's backing along trying to tighten nuts.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1965,4955,196,17,"Okay.  So that assumes the bolt work off the platform -- platform, so there's one issue.",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1966,4957,196,19,What's that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1967,4958,196,20,Assumes they're doing the bolt work leaning off the platform?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1968,4960,196,22,"In both cases, whether you raised or lowered the platform, you have that case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1969,4962,196,24,"Okay.  But my -- but, again, so what you're saying is one of the ways they should have designed it differently was so that the platform was actually directly below those additional three bolts?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1970,4966,197,3,"That's what I'm saying, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1971,4967,197,4,Okay.  That's one thing.  What else should they have done differently?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1972,4969,197,6,They can offset the staircase and not put it -- you wouldn't have to have a gate on an offset staircase because you wouldn't be walking right through the gate of off the back of the machine.  You can put it further out or perpendicular.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1973,4974,197,11,"So are you saying that if the -- instead of coming off the end of the platform, if the stairway came off the side of the platform, no gate would be necessary?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1974,4978,197,15,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1975,4979,197,16,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1976,4980,197,17,"Because you'd be walking past the -- all along your work area, you'd be walking past the bolts.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1977,4982,197,19,All right.  What else should they have done differently?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1978,4984,197,21,"I mean, I -- I'm presuming here.  If they made an area and if they -- for good reason, they wanted to raise it, then I would say put the controls on the aerial lift.  Make sure that the -- the -- the controls were in an area where the operator could use them. On this particular machine, the -- the controls were where the operator can't be seen if he's on the left -- on the left walkway --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1979,4992,198,4,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1980,4993,198,5,-- or --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1981,4994,198,6,"You -- you seem to qualify that opinion on, you know, if it's meant to be an aerial lift.  Are you saying that is a design they should have done on this machine?  Or it sort of depends; you're not sure about that?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1982,4999,198,11,"Well, I don't know the design -- I -- much as they -- much as people -- again, you can say a lot of things about your product, but if you really get down to it, in the United States here, if it's foreseeable, then you've got some problems here, and I think it's foreseeable.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1983,5005,198,17,Okay.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1984,5006,198,18,"I -- it's my opinion that it's foreseeable that people will get up on that platform.  There's -- there's various reasons I've stated.  I don't think we need to do through them again. But I think there's reasons why people would get up there and do that.  First, efficiencies. Second -- that -- that's a major driver in business. You want to get that thing done.  You want to get it out and get it -- get it cranking.  If no stones are rolling, there's no -- no money coming in. So, economically, I think you're -- you're -- you've got to look ahead and see what are the -- what are the impetus for people to be on that machine trying to get both screens changed at the same time so . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1985,5020,199,7,Okay.  So we have extend the length of the platform to cover the bolts.  We have change the direction of the stairway and then you don't need a gate.  And we have put controls up on the platform.  Is there anything else?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1986,5025,199,12,"Oh, yes.  Remove the chains.  Make sure that you've got solid -- that -- that when you apply the 4000 newtons to the -- to the chains that they don't deflect 80 millimeters.  That's completely wrong. Slip surfaces, all those things have to be accounted for in -- under the federal rules.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1991,5038,199,25,Something like that is what they could have used?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
1992,5040,200,2,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1993,5041,200,3,Okay.  Anything else besides what we've just covered that they could have done -- should have done differently with this machine?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

2116,5266,209,3,All right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2117,5267,209,4,But I think one of your problems is that pinch point can also act as a step?,q,MR. COYNE,start_answer

2130,5288,209,25,Because it's not vertical or horizontal.  It says that the -- the handle to use as a pull-up has to be vertical or horizontal.  You have to use --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2131,5291,210,3,"And why can't it be a railing?  Because railings, we know, follow the same angle as a stair.",q,MR. COYNE,start_answer

2188,5412,214,24,The platform is part of the machine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2189,5413,214,25,Okay.  And what is the platform -- the platform intended to be used for?  what maintenance is up there that you would use that platform for?,q,MR. FOTI,start_answer
2190,5416,215,3,I think there's two that they're looking at. One basically is changing the upper mesh of the screener and also for lubricating the crank system.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2191,5419,215,6,"Okay.  And in addition to changing the screens, is there regular hourly maintenance with regard to those nuts and bolts; in other words, do you have to check them after so many hours of use?",q,MR. FOTI,start_answer

2209,5455,216,17,"And you actually have a discussion in the report about how you think that -- I think that's the manual.  Tell me if I'm wrong -- that manual does a better job of distinguishing the operations for the two screen changes, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2210,5460,216,22,It does because there's a completely different design involved.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2211,5462,216,24,Got it.  Does the Warrior 2100 have a similar jack-up feature?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2212,5464,217,1,"It does, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2217,5474,217,11,"All right.  As a salesman for Powerscreen Connecticut and/or New England, depending on who it is, would it be your expectation that Mr. Wylie would have familiarity with the manual related to the 2100?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

2226,5498,218,10,Normally opens towards the stairs.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2227,5499,218,11,"Okay.  One of the things you said in your report is that any purchaser down the road from the manufacturer cannot alter or modify an aerial lift, right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2228,5503,218,15,"Well, they can't modify a piece of equipment and still maintain your -- your EC certification.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2229,5505,218,17,Right.  But -- but do you agree that one way they could do and maintain their certification is get permission from the manufacturer or get permission from an appropriate testing laboratory?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2230,5509,218,21,"Normally a manufacturer wouldn't give that kind of information unless they had tested and done that work themselves.  And you can get -- you can get kits; for example, we put out kits on occasion to try to meet the -- the needs.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2247,5542,220,4,"Right.  So if it's down in the working position, you can walk right up onto the platform, go down to the box and do the lubrication of the crank, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2248,5546,220,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2249,5547,220,9,All right.  Has your testimony ever -- I realize you only testified at trial once.  But has your testimony -- testimony ever been precluded or have you ever been disqualified as an expert in any case?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2250,5551,220,13,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2251,5552,220,14,"Has your testimony ever been limited, based on any motion practice for any given case, to certain issues as opposed to other issues you were attempting to render opinions on?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2252,5556,220,18,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2253,5557,220,19,"Okay.  I see nothing in your report suggesting that there were any violations of any EC or EU European standards.  You're not going to render any opinions that this machine violates any of those, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2254,5561,220,23,I'm not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2255,5562,220,24,All right.  So I'm correct?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2256,5563,220,25,I'm not going to render any opinions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2257,5564,221,1,"All right.  Turn to Page 127 of your report quickly, please.  What exactly is this -- what is this attachment to your report?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2258,5567,221,4,It's an explanation of the standards related to fall protection for aerial work platforms.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2259,5569,221,6,Is this something that you created or -- I'm just not sure what this document -- this page of the document is.  Is it a continuation of the prior page? What is it?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2260,5573,221,10,I think the source is identified on Page 130.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2261,5574,221,11,Page 130?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2262,5575,221,12,Uh-huh.  Is that right?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2263,5576,221,13,"Okay.  So -- I see.  So, for example, everything that's on Page 126 was from the source perhaps at the bottom there.  Oh, maybe not.  But then starting at Page 127, that all comes from the source at the bottom of Page 130; is that correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2264,5581,221,18,"Yes, that's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2265,5582,221,19,All right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2266,5583,221,20,So it's from OSHA itself.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2267,5584,221,21,"So this is an OSHA publication as it relates to aerial work platforms, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2268,5586,221,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2269,5587,221,24,"And the need for fall protection, right?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2270,5588,221,25,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2271,5589,222,1,"And it shows an aerial ladder.  It shows an articulating boom, an extendable boom, and then it shows you sort of what these types of systems can look like when you raise these aerial lifts below that, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2272,5593,222,5,"Well, that -- that's a Class 2.  The Class 1 is -- it's -- it's identifying different classes of aerial lifts,  I think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2273,5596,222,8,"None of these look anything like the two to three to four, depending on how you want to define it, stairway to the platform on the TEREX -- on the Powerscreen screener, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2274,5600,222,12,"I don't know how to -- I don't think -- I think I alluded to the warning label.  We can go back to that discussion if you'd like to.  But there is a -- there is a concept of a lift that includes all of these different elements.  They have different ways of lifting it vertically.  If you put a hydraulic cylinder under a platform, you do the very same thing as Class 2s.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2275,5607,222,19,"But our -- our -- our device, whatever it is -- it's hydraulics --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2276,5609,222,21,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2277,5610,222,22,"-- I believe, to lift our platform?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2278,5611,222,23,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2279,5612,222,24,"Raises it 20 inches, correct?  I think you told us it's 55 inches.",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2280,5614,223,1,"Twenty, twenty -- probably 20 inches -- like I said, 20 inches on the cylinder so . . .",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2281,5616,223,3,"Right.  So I think what you told us is it's 55 inches when it's down in the working position and it becomes 75 inches when raised, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2282,5619,223,6,I believe that's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2283,5620,223,7,All right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2284,5621,223,8,For lifts.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2285,5622,223,9,"Let me ask you, these -- these items that are depicted in Class 1 vehicle-mounted elevating and rotating aerial devices, are they designed in such a fashion where they can even move while the person is elevated on the aerial device?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2286,5627,223,14,I'm sorry.  I lost the page.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2287,5628,223,15,Sure.  Page 127.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2288,5629,223,16,"There's no movement depicted.  I think in many cases they actually have -- I'm trying to think of the name.  They actually extend these stabilizers, if you will, for this kind of equipment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2289,5633,223,20,"Got it.  And that's Class 2, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2290,5634,223,21,Class 1.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2291,5635,223,22,The Class 2 would get stabilized --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2292,5636,223,23,No.  You've got motion.  You can see -- you can see manually it moves.  It's depicting arrows that move.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2293,5638,223,25,"Oh, okay.  So --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2294,5639,224,1,So --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2295,5640,224,2,-- all right.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2296,5641,224,3,You asked me Class 1.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2297,5642,224,4,All right.  So start with Class 1.  Class 1 is actually on a vehicle where they might be doing some work at an elevated location.  Perhaps they're doing work on a power line or --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2298,5646,224,8,Maybe only 20 inches.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2299,5647,224,9,"-- whatever it is.  Well, they're elevated -- look at the photographs.  Those types of devices -- those types of vehicles with their aerial lifts can raise someone, for example, to like -- say they're going to do a telephone line or something like that.  On a telephone pole, they're going to do some work.  My question to you is, Class 1, can they be -- can -- while the person is elevated in the aerial lift, are there any regulations or anything that says you can't move the vehicle at all while the person is elevated?  Do they have to come all the way down, then you move again and you move them, or can you move with them up there?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2300,5659,224,21,"No, you can move with them up there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2301,5660,224,22,"All right.  Now, with the manually propelled elevating aerial platforms that are down in Class 2, I think what you told us is that those will have arms that will come out to secure it while you're doing some work, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2302,5665,225,2,You can.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2303,5666,225,3,"And those arms can come back in, and you can also move them while the person is elevated, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2304,5668,225,5,"Well, I think, with permission, there's a lot of things you -- the -- the operator can do. Essentially, they put -- they put controls at the base and they also put them up in the aerial device.  But what has to happen is a person in the -- you get -- this whole certification thing is really important because you get the understanding that the person -- it's kind of like driving a ship or an airplane.  There's always a pilot in command, and the person in the bucket is the person who can tell you who can operate the equipment. So that person is -- is the commander of the machine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2305,5679,225,16,"Okay.  But under the right circumstances, that commander in the bucket can tell the person down below, even with a type 2, bring up those arm extensions and move me 8 feet over because I want to access something over here, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2306,5684,225,21,"Or even 6 inches or three, depending on --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2307,5685,225,22,Whatever it might be.,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2308,5686,225,23,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2309,5687,225,24,"But they're mobile, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2310,5688,225,25,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2311,5689,226,1,"You agree that with respect to -- you agree with this:  The instructions as it relates to the screener at issue, there is to be absolutely no raising or lowering of that platform until the machine is locked out, correct?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2312,5694,226,6,That's very unclear.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2313,5695,226,7,Isn't the first step lock it out?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2314,5696,226,8,"Well, the first step is lock it out.  The second step is run the engine and raise it so -- I'm sorry.  It's so confusing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2315,5699,226,11,Well -- but --,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2316,5700,226,12,"My point is, you know, if you want to write those instructions, you need to because people don't really understand how to run that machine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2317,5703,226,15,"Well, does locking it out stop you from raising and lowering --",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer
2318,5705,226,17,"Absolutely.  It locks out all power and you actually have to -- when I lock out a piece of equipment to do an inspection, I don't want anything.  I don't want air pressure.  I don't want -- even though I'm mechanical, I don't want electrical press- -- power.  I don't want anything.  When I want lockout-tagout, you can't do a thing to that machine.  It's down and dead. That's what it means.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2319,5713,226,25,"Okay.  I just want to make sure we have it. Page 136, you referenced a training video for the screener.  That was definitely produced in the Dropbox?",q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

2321,5717,227,4,Yes?,q,MR. ROBINSON,start_answer

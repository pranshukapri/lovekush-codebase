17,202,6,14,"The court reporter is the official transcript.  She takes down what we say, so think of it almost as a, I'll ask a question, then there is a potential of an objection.  Normally, you can answer after the objection, unless you have been instructed not to.  So it's question, potential objection, and then answer. If you give opposing counsel, Mr. Wiencek, an opportunity to state any objection, it will give you an opportunity also to think about your answer. Also, shakes and nods of the head don't work, so you have to keep your answers audible.  If for some reason you don't hear or understand a question, tell me you didn't hear or understand it.  Otherwise, I'll proceed as if you did. There is something called the attorney-client privilege.  I'm not seeking your conversations with counsel today, in terms of your conversations with Mr. Wiencek and things of that nature.  If any topics come up about where attorneys might have been involved in conversation, just proceed with caution.  You may be instructed not to answer questions at a certain point, depending upon what the questions are, so I'm trying to get your independent information.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

20,236,7,22,"Yeah, an attorney involved.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,237,7,23,"Correct.  Okay.  So in those areas, just proceed with a little bit more caution in terms of how you're going to answer a question, just because the intent is not to get a waiver of some attorney-client privilege, but I may ask some questions around that. Anything -- is that all fair to you, what I have explained so far?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
22,247,8,7,"Seems all reasonable, until something specific comes up, I guess.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,249,8,9,"Okay.  All right.  And then, generally, you can take a break whenever you want, unless a question is pending.  We try to do it about every hour or so, but if you need a break before then for any reason, just tell me, and we can go off the record, and we'll take a break.  Sometimes we'll go a little bit longer than an hour.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

36,297,10,5,"Sure.  So from -- in '93 and part of '94, I worked at Lake Hospital.  That's where I was a -- I did my -- our program had a, essentially an administrative internship or residency.  I did mine there at Lake Hospital outside of Cleveland.  And I ended up staying on there for a period of time, in what essentially I would call an assistant administrator role. And then from there, I took a job as a consultant.  That job might have gone to '95, now that I think about.  Took a job as a consultant and worked at a place called New Health Management.  And didn't really like consulting all that much, so I got reconnected with a person that I knew while I was at Lake. He was at Catholic Healthcare Partners at that time, so I came to -- he offered me a job in essentially kind of a new startup that they were working around, on doing around physician integration, employment, variety of different things, which was kind of, all kind of new at that time.  Health systems weren't widely involved with employing doctors.  So I took that job in the summer of '96.  And some of the dates may not be accurate here, but was in that for maybe three years. And health systems kind of got out of the business of employing doctors, for a variety of different reasons, so the need for that role kind of changed.  I ended up kind of changing jobs and going into more informatics, data collection, data analysis at the corporate offices of Catholic Healthcare Partners. And in 2003, from that job, I left the corporate office to take an operations job at Mercy Hospital-Clermont.  Had that job until the summer of '11, which is when I took this job.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

40,345,12,1,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,346,12,2,"So basically you did -- you did a -- you had -- strike that. To go back a second.  When you were in school, did you fo -- did you know that you wanted to go into admin, hospital administration?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
42,352,12,8,"Well, actually, initially, I want, you know, I was premed.  I got accepted to med school, so I was thinking of maybe become a physician.  And then, you know, took another route, kind of evaluated if that was really what I wanted to do.  And then found the -- the Mercy -- the master's program in health administration, and felt that might be a better alignment with my interests.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,361,12,17,"So when you did your graduate programs, did you -- what was -- was it sort of in mind at that point that you wanted to go into administration?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

51,379,13,9,-- do that any longer?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

53,385,13,15,"Okay.  And then leading up to obtaining the presidency job, you had done a number of operations jobs, and administrative jobs, and management jobs, and things of that nature, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

60,415,14,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,416,14,20,"Including with what you see with ProMedica, having an insurance program and capturing market share by causing patients in their insurance program to be directed back to ProMedica institutions?  You have seen things like that, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat

73,450,16,2,"I'm not an expert in it, but certain doctors are, you know, certain doctors are in and not in their network.  For an example, we're -- we're -- Mercy is a -- as a -- even our facilities are participating in their Advantage product, but we don't participate in their commercial product.

82,485,17,11,"Okay.  But what you're seeing in terms of a -- you're seeing -- you're seeing, with regard to -- to what we were talking about with insurance, you're seeing this in a competitive landscape for Mercy here in Toledo, correct?  ProMedica's competition?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
83,491,17,17,"ProMedica -- ProMedica is our competition, yes, I would agree with that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

86,499,17,25,"And -- and so over time, have you seen, and tell me yes or no.  I mean, I may be right, I may not be.

ARCHINACO,start_answer
87,507,18,7,"I -- I only have history in this town from '11 on.  My experience in the last few years is that Mercy's gaining market share, and ProMedica is losing market share. Now, what -- what is related to the insurance company versus, you know, whether their insurance company isn't doing as well, or whether we're just providing better services and patient choice, there is a variety of different factors, I assume.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,517,18,17,"Okay.  We're going to cover a long time period today.  It's going to be fairly -- I have a lot of questions for you today, but I want to -- I'll try to mostly follow chronologically.

786,2462,93,12,"The biggest issue seemed to be with his relationship with the staff, and them feeling intimidated, not respected, you know, short on phone calls, sometimes, you know, being berated. And I'll just give you an example of something where, you know, you asked about working with him.  I remember at one time we -- but, to me, he was always very complimentary of the staff, so I've got this kind of issue with the staff feeling like he makes them feel incompetent, and I've got him saying positive things to me.  So I remember Barb Martin and I sat with him, and I don't remember -- I don't think it was specifically on this matter, but it was -- at the end of it, we mentioned, you know, if -- if you feel -- you're very complimentary of the staff to us, but they don't feel that.  And if, you know, that's the way you feel, you know, in order to make them more confident in their jobs, and you know, these people are hard to find too, they're not going to stay in an environment where they feel intimidated.  You know, why don't you try. Somehow, that totally backfired on us.  I think he went onto the unit and told the nurses if -- maybe I ought to just do all my hearts at V's, which is like how did we go from that, which I thought was a fairly nonintimidating coaching session, to going on the unit and telling the nurses, maybe I just need to take all my cases to V's.

I can't recall specifically what they were.  I remember thinking it was a little bit strange to be meeting with Holland and Hash -- I think I even brought it up at the meeting, you know, Hashmi and Holland don't always see eye to eye on things, but they seemed to have mutual concerns about Phillips.

St. V's has its own quality M & M structure.  If there is concerns, that's the proper place to go and evaluate those things, not discuss it with me, who is really not involved with it.

To the extent it occurred somewhere else, it would go to St. Vincent's.  And a lot of times, if Dr. Holland brought something up to me, I would call either Greg, or someone, and just say, this is what he's telling me. Just make sure we're investigating it, or that, you know, we've already got a review in place, or whatever we needed to do to follow up.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1132,3390,129,4,"That just seemed to be like an ongoing conversation.  You know, kind of like the retirement that may or may not ever happen, but I -- you know, there was a lot of discussion over an extended period of time about, you know, Hashmi's looking to retire.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1330,3974,151,16,"Okay.  Now, why -- you knew that there were conversations -- strike that. We showed you a contract earlier, which I will represent to you we received in discovery, and was the last contract, I believe, that Mercy signed with Dr. Hashmi. It was from May of 2017. And just with that in mind, did that -- does that jog your memory that at least, or did you -- strike that.

1336,4006,152,22,"All right.  Next sentence, It was agreed that Phillips and Holland would be swapped out and a group assembled would be involved in interviewing new CT candidates. Holland and Phillips would not.  It was agreed Phillips would go first, since he had minimal support among either group.  We agreed to reconvene to discuss go-forward with any candidates.

Deb -- Deb Morelli typically dealt with all our medical staff, legal issues with peer review, and any issues related to physician disruptive behavior, so any physician review items.

I said, no, I don't.  I said, he was just in here.  He didn't mention anything about it, not that he and I might not want him to do that.

2367,6807,260,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2375,6825,261,7,"Yeah.  I think he, you know, wanted an opportunity to consult with whoever the appropriate people to be, to consult with was, because it, my recollection, when I talked to him, it had just arrived like that day, or you know, the day before, or whatever.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2376,6831,261,13,"Okay.  Why did you believe that -- strike that. Was it because of your conversation with Doctor -- strike that. Was it because of your conversation with Mr. Arquilla, what came out of that conversation, is that the reason that you told Dr. Holland that this was kind of putting a cloud over something we have worked on here for --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2377,6841,261,23,"Yeah.  And that's one of the -- I don't know if I would say that, you know, when you said, would you change some things, if you knew you were being recorded, I probably would have worded it differently, and just said we're going to have to evaluate this, what this complaint is, and make sure it's all consistent with what our plans were here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2378,6850,262,6,"But as -- as we have seen from emails and whatnot, I mean, you're a person who did sign off on the call agreement with Dr. Holland, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2379,6854,262,10,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2380,6855,262,11,"And you're a person who went through the process of filling out forms to say this, I believe this is in the best interest of our hospital/patients to do this call agreement, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2381,6860,262,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2382,6861,262,17,"And so we see a pattern of you consistently, it seems, advancing the ball, or trying to get something in place with Dr. Holland, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2383,6865,262,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2384,6866,262,22,"And then what it hits is no signature from Mr. Arquilla, shortly after he learns that a complaint of some sort has been filed, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2385,6871,263,1,"I would agree with everything you said up until the point of, I don't really know the timing around Tom's signature, when the complaint was dropped and all that, but I'll agree with you in general.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2386,6876,263,6,"Okay.  So it's not you that is holding off and not signing.  You've already signed.  You didn't say I'm taking my name off of this, right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2387,6880,263,10,"No.  No, there was no reason to do that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2389,6886,263,16,"Yeah, but that was before the -- before the EEOC complaint, which Tom felt warranted some review of what it was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2390,6889,263,19,"Fair enough.  But just to be clear, you never said, and nowhere in this tape, I don't think, you ever say you're going to take your name off of the call agreement. You never threatened Dr. Holland in any way like that, did you?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2391,6895,263,25,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2394,6903,264,7,"Well, whatever the words are that you said will stand for themselves, however those are read. But it's Mr. Arquilla's signature that remained off of this agreement, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2395,6908,264,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2396,6909,264,13,"And so if there were compromises to any patient care, if, not saying whether there were, you have to agree if there were or were not, but if there were any, Mr. Arquilla would bear more responsibility certainly than you, because he is the one who didn't sign the agreement, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
2397,6916,264,20,"I -- I never felt there was safety issues being jeopardized.  I don't think there were issues around patient safety, I don't think anything was in jeopardy relative to the delays of this call agreement.

Because Brunsting left because the same situation.  He saw there was an issue in referrals.  He was young enough that he wanted to have a career, and he ended up in -- in a great, and I think he ended up at UAB doing robotics down there. Burdine came on board, and within a few months, his heart volume went down to nothing.  The last year he practiced full-time, his volume was either 10 or 18 for the entire year.  Burdine. New Speaker:  Mm-hmm. Dr. Holland:  Now, Dr. Phillips is in the same situation, where he's Hashmi's boy.  Phillips is now doing the lungs or the (inaudible) and things that Hashmi doesn't want to do. New Speaker:  Mm-hmm. Dr. Holland:  So that's four surgeons within, what, five or -- five years who have experienced the same sort of behavior.  And no quality of surgeon is going to sit back and watch Hashmi, you know, butcher patients essentially, and that's what he's doing.  And they're not going to sit back and just round on Hashmi's patients indiscriminately. New Speaker:  Uh-huh. Dr. Holland:  I mean, that's not what we do.  We take care of our patients.  We participate in the greater good.  We try to build a team with members who are cooperative and appreciate our efforts and quality, but that's not what happened down there. And there was plenty of opportunity for Hashmi to do that.  We've had many meetings with that.  Burdine participated in those meetings, talked about referrals and quality. And even now, the M & Ms down there, you don't even have to go to the M & Ms.  The last M & M they had was with their little girl who takes the stats.  It was Hashmi and the girl, so .... New Speaker:  Yeah, he invited her. Dr. Holland:  So it's a very corrupt system.  The nurses have been uninvited to the meeting.  Cardiology and cardiology fellows have been uninvited.  And now it's just Hashmi, the statistician and Phillips will show up from time to time. But even, you know, the last meeting they had down there, Phillips got -- came in after Hashmi discussed the three mortalities he had for that month.  It's a fairly corrupt system.

He stayed the section chief of cardiothoracic surgery, he was the chair, or co-chair of the CVTU operations meeting, and he came to a lot of the meetings.

3241,9305,356,17,"Okay.  Now, coming back to the arrest issue for a second.  That was -- that arrest happened literally just as you're about to start marketing Dr. Holland and the St. Anne program, correct?  Just right beforehand?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3242,9311,356,23,Okay.  The arrest happened on what date?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3248,9319,357,5,-- sometime.  Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3249,9320,357,6,And did you change any marketing because of that arrest?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3250,9322,357,8,I don't think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3251,9323,357,9,"Okay.  The -- and so in terms of the arrest, just -- just to be clear -- oh, strike that. Did the woman who -- did the nurse, who moved in next door to Dr. Holland, did you ever learn what her husband did for a living?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3252,9329,357,15,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3253,9330,357,16,"And do you recall whether or not she attempted to apply a second time at Mercy, yes or no?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3254,9333,357,19,I'm not aware of that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3255,9334,357,20,"But that arrest had the potential, had it gone forward, potential of derailing what you were building with St. Anne's cardiothoracic program, if went in the wrong direction, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3256,9339,357,25,"It had the potential, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3257,9341,358,1,Okay.  You were handed Bertke Exhibit A.  I want to go over some other things.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3258,9344,358,4,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3259,9345,358,5,Okay.  Bertke Exhibit A was this little --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

3261,9348,358,8,"-- money chart.  I just wanted to look -- I noted there were some payments made to Dr. Holland in 2017.  It looks like -- it's hard to read, because the font is small.  It looks like less than $3,000; is that right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3262,9353,358,13,Yeah.  It looks like that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3263,9354,358,14,"They could be added up, if we kind of zoom in on it, but --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3264,9356,358,16,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3266,9360,358,20,Fair enough.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3267,9361,358,21,"Okay.  And then Bertke Exhibit B, which had to do with the Ameer Kabour email from June 22nd, 2017?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3268,9364,358,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3269,9365,358,25,"At the top, you talked about getting Dr. Tita involved in a retrospective review, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3270,9369,359,3,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3271,9370,359,4,"Now, you had never, at least from what I have seen, you had never received any type of email like this from Dr. Kabour prior to June of 2017, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3272,9374,359,8,I would say correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3273,9375,359,9,"So then this was at a time period after Dr. Holland had already filed the claim of discrimination, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3274,9378,359,12,So he filed the claim in -- yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3277,9381,359,15,Right.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3278,9382,359,16,"-- the complaint, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3279,9383,359,17,"And you knew that -- you knew from your, you knew personally from your March meeting, that at least from what he told you in that meeting, he was making claims of discrimination and referrals, correct?  At least from that meeting itself?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3280,9389,359,23,"I -- if I remember correctly from the transcription of that event, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3281,9391,359,25,"Now, just to be clear, you're -- are you aware that Dr. Holland has never made any claim of racial or national origin discrimination against any of the doctors at the Toledo Clinic?  You're aware he's never accused them of any of that, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3282,9398,360,6,I'm not aware of it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3283,9399,360,7,Okay.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3284,9400,360,8,"But you're telling me it, so okay.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3285,9402,360,10,"Fair enough.  In terms of the referrals, how the office procedures worked at Dr. Holland's practice with Dr. Hashmi, and whoever else was in the practice at various times, you're not familiar with how the office procedures worked with how the referrals were supposed to occur, were you?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3286,9409,360,17,"No.  That was a separate, kind of separate division.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3287,9411,360,19,"Other than -- and I say this other than conversations with Dr. Holland, where he would complain about referrals, other than what we've already talked about?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3288,9415,360,23,I have no knowledge of the --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3289,9416,360,24,Okay.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3290,9417,360,25,-- process within their office.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3291,9419,361,1,"In terms of the type of cases that Dr. Holland performed at St. Anne's, you're aware that lots of cases were kept, that records were kept of the type of cases that were performed, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3292,9424,361,6,Logs?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3293,9425,361,7,Yes.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3294,9426,361,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3295,9427,361,9,And you're aware that there were high-risk procedures performed at St. Anne's by Dr. Holland; isn't that right?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3296,9430,361,12,"High risk is generic, but as time went on, we did higher-risk cases there, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3297,9432,361,14,But you would defer to whatever those log of cases would show for the years that were there in terms of the types of cases?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3298,9436,361,18,"Yeah.  Again, the logs would probably indicate the type of surgery, meaning was it a three vessel, was it a valve, was it a valve/vessel combo, but I don't think it would -- I don't think it would necessarily say if the patient had other comorbidity, comorbidities, and what that might mean in terms of risk of, you know, readmission, or back to surgery or mortality, so it's -- it's not a complete picture, but there is a log.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3299,9447,362,3,"Dr. Hashmi performed some surgeries at St. Anne's as well, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

3304,9454,362,10,Still does.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3306,9459,362,15,I'm not 100 percent sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3307,9460,362,16,"Almost done. In terms of criticism of doctors, you indicated Dr. Holland criticized doctors generally.  Am I correct that most of his criticism focused on Dr. Hashmi?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3308,9465,362,21,"Yeah, most of it, but you can kind of -- this email from Kabour is kind of the -- he keeps insisting he knows more than the pulmonary and the radiologist, so that was kind of consistent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3309,9471,363,1,He had never --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3310,9472,363,2,"But, to his defense, it's his patient, he's responsible for it, he's ultimately accountable, so ....",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3311,9475,363,5,"But, by that point in time in June, there has already been a discrimination claim that basically says there is discrimination in referrals that is happening here, at least that's what Dr. Holland has asserted, so now Dr. Kabour is writing that in a time period after the discrimination claim has been made, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
3312,9483,363,13,That's the timing of it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3313,9484,363,14,Okay.  But you had not received a written email like that from Dr. Kabour --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

But, you know, and then the call, which is another item.  But I didn't really say that.  I'm just -- I'm just kind of alerting you to some things I wasn't aware of and then saying, well, what's the implication for this? Did I read that part correctly?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

3339,9544,365,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

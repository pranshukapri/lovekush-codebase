352,1114,42,18,"Sure.  That -- that's part of my standard report template where pretty much any report that I do in a litigation matter, I'm going to have a description of -- I'm gonna start the report with a -- an introduction of myself and my experience and credentials that form the basis of my ability to weigh into this and assist the trier in fact to determine damages. I'm then going to have an identification at a very high level of the parties involved, and then my understanding of what the parties are fighting over. So it's intended to be a background that lays out the facts as I understand them or the dispute -- the disputed facts as has been claimed, what the allegations are, because as we just discussed, my directive is to assume that the allegations are true, that liability will be found.  And in that context between these parties in this industry, in this context, I've analyzed damages.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

355,1137,43,15,"And -- and I think you said a moment ago you cite that because you're assuming that the allegations in those are true and they therefore can be cited in your ""The Dispute"" section; is that right?",q,MR. CARLIS,start_answer
356,1141,43,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

358,1145,43,23,"Well, we're talking about two different cases effectively, right, because we're talking about my second report dealt with the counterclaim.  So it's a different dispute in that sense because now it's Whiting in the plaintiff's chair suing Jamex and Mr. Ballengee. So from that perspective, it's a different dispute.  They're clearly related, but it's a different dispute.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

364,1165,44,17,"No, I believe -- I mean, we could go through. Some of those are cited to a -- a pleading by either Whiting or Jamex, and so those are one -- that party's view of the facts. All other case -- other parts of the dispute, I think, are undisputed.  For example -- or I believe to be absolute fact. For example, I'm sure I said in those sections that on such and such date this party filed an amended petition or this party filed its -- its initial petition or something like that, and in -- and in that particular case, I believe that to be fact because I have a -- that filing stamped by the Court with that particular date.  So that's, in my view, a supported fact. But with -- I'm happy to delve deeper if you have issues that you want to explore.

556,1700,65,6,-- in the first place? Did you -- strike that. Let's talk about profits per barrel. Is it your opinion that Jamex would have netted a profit of $1.40 per barrel on each barrel it purchased from Shell at Robinson Lake?,q,MR. CARLIS,start_answer

559,1711,65,17,I believe that's Mr. Fuller's analysis you're thinking of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
560,1713,65,19,Okay.  Do you agree that there's no added damages based on the line fill cost to Jamex in this case?,q,MR. CARLIS,start_answer
561,1716,65,22,"I think we're passing each other here.  I actually calculated -- there are no additional damages. My analysis assumes that Jamex would in- -- would have incurred a cost to hold the line fill until the end of the seven-year term and that lowers the damages, so it lowers the $1.40 per barrel to something less than $1.40 per barrel on net.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

570,1747,67,1,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

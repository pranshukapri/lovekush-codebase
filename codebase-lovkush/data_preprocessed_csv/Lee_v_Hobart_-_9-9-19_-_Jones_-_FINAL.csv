2,203,16,16,Please commence. EXAMINATION,side_chat,DEPOSITION REPORTER,start_question
3,207,16,20,"Good morning, sir.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
4,208,16,21,Good morning.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,209,16,22,Can you state your name for the record.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
6,210,16,23,James William Jones.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,211,16,24,"All right.  I just mentioned it at the start of our tape here, but my name's Bryan Cross. I represent ITW Food Equipment Group in a lawsuit that you've been retained as an expert in.  Okay?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
8,216,17,3,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,217,17,4,"And I'll be probably asking you most, if not all, of the questions today. But I understand you were retained as an expert witness in this case; is that correct?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
10,221,17,8,That is true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,222,17,9,Okay.  And you're offering opinions and testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs in this case?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
12,224,17,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,225,17,12,"Okay.  We have not had an opportunity to meet before, so I want to review a little bit of your history and background just to make sure I have a firm understanding of your qualifications and experience.  Okay?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
14,230,17,17,That would be great.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,231,17,18,All right.  So I have a curriculum vitae that I've seen dated July of 2018. Do you know if there's been any significant updates to your curriculum vitae since 2018?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
16,236,17,23,"Yeah, only a few.  I'm sure I sent you a later in our -- in our deposition materials.  It should be August of 2019.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,240,18,1,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
18,241,18,2,"But the only major changes would be depositions, trial testimony, that sort of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,243,18,4,Okay.  So you've appeared at a couple more depositions and possibly a trial or two since July of last year?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
20,246,18,7,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,247,18,8,All right.  But you're -- okay. And it looks like I'm being handed one that was revised in April of 2019. Does that sound closer to being correct?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
22,251,18,12,"That's probably right, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,252,18,13,"All right.  You haven't had any additional educational experience since that time, have you, sir?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
24,255,18,16,"No, sir, I have not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,256,18,17,All right.  Have you taken on any other professional positions or employment other than J. William Jones & Associates?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
26,259,18,20,"No, sir, I have not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,260,18,21,Okay.  So it looks like you studied engineering and obtained multiple degrees between 1966 and 1973?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
28,263,18,24,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,264,18,25,"Okay.  And after working for a few years as an engineer in various positions, it looks like you became primarily involved with engineering software. Is that a fair assessment?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
30,270,19,5,"Well, not really.  I was a distributor for the ANSYS computer program, which is in my resum√©, but my primary business was consulting work at that time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,274,19,9,Okay.  So as early as 1977 you were acting as a consultant?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
32,276,19,11,"Actually, I started my first consulting business in 1974.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,278,19,13,Okay.  And what was the name of that consulting business?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
34,280,19,15,"That consulting business was Swanson Engineering Analysis Associates, or something like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,283,19,18,Okay.  And it looks like I've got on here that you did Swanson Engineering Associates Corporation from 1974 to 1977.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
36,286,19,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,287,19,22,"All right.  So really my question was: Starting in 1977, it looks like, at least from the curriculum vitae I have, the bulk of your employment and experience was involved with engineering software, modeling and animations and things like that.",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
38,294,20,3,Objection; misstates the testimony.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
39,296,20,5,"Well, no, that's really not true.  I had a company, we sold ANSYS, and we did technical support and I did training.  But the bulk of my business was the consulting business.  I had people doing the marketing and the software sales and that sort of thing. ANSYS is a very complicated and useful program, and I tended to become more of a consultant in the use of the program rather than the selling of it.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,is brackets
40,306,20,15,(Telephonic interruption.),brackets,,start_question
41,308,20,17,Okay.  Was that Silverado Software and Consulting?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
42,310,20,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,311,20,20,"All right.  And ANSYS, is that an engineering software program?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
44,313,20,22,Turn off my phone here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,314,20,23,Is ANSYS that you've referred to a couple of times an engineering software program?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
46,316,20,25,"It is, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,318,21,1,And what types of things does ANSYS allow you to do?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
48,320,21,3,"It's a very general purpose program.  The name ANSYS stands for analysis system, and we would do everything with ANSYS from static analysis, nonlinear dynamics, modal analysis, heat transfer. Let's see.  Magnetic capability, fluid flow capability.  Very general program for mechanical engineers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,327,21,10,"All right.  Would you characterize it as like a modeling or simulation software, then, but from an engineering standpoint?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
50,330,21,13,"Yes, I would say that, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,331,21,14,"All right.  And it allows you, I guess, to depict what either components or systems would do under real world conditions if you put in objective data and you make assumptions that comply with the laws of physics; true?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
52,336,21,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,337,21,20,Would you agree that the reliability of the resulting models and simulations are going to turn on the accuracy of the inputs and the validity of the software assumptions that are used?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
54,341,21,24,"Vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
55,344,22,1,"The validity of the answers turns out to be a very strong function of the talent and the knowledge and the background of the user, actually.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,349,22,6,"Okay.  But if you put in bad data or you rely on poor assumptions, isn't it like every other software program; it's going to be garbage in, garbage out?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
57,353,22,10,Incomplete hypothetical.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
58,354,22,11,"Well, I guess it has to be. If you're not putting in the right information you can't possibly get the right information out.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,358,22,15,And that's where the expertise of the user comes into play in selecting the right data and selecting the right assumptions?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
60,361,22,18,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,362,22,19,"All right.  When you say you did consulting, was that what you were assisting the users of the ANSYS software with, was figuring out what kind of data to use, what sort of assumptions they should be relying upon for their individual projects?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
62,367,22,24,"That was part of it, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,368,22,25,Okay.  Was there any particular industry that most used -- or were you most consulted with the use of ANSYS?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
64,372,23,3,"Actually, we had a very wide variety of users and clients in that business.  We -- I did work for Motorola and Intel.  They were a big client of ours, electronic packaging, thermal and thermal stress analysis for electronic packages that they were developing. I did a lot of work for Rocketdyne on rocket engines that we developed during that time period.  I did considerable work for the nuclear business.  I developed -- I did work for the nuclear shipping containers packaging, nuclear spent fuel. I did a lot of work for the refineries. In my company we were essentially consultants, and by the end of the time I sold the company, I had 45 employees, and we did about a hundred projects a year, consulting projects.  That pretty much sums it up.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,389,23,20,Did you ever do any consulting work for a manufacturer of commercial bakery ovens?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
66,391,23,22,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,392,23,23,"Now, it looks like your -- was Silverado Software company your company, a company you owned?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
68,394,23,25,It was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,396,24,1,All right.  And did you sell that out to MSC Software Corporation?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
70,398,24,3,"I did, 1998.  Yesterday would be my 21st anniversary, I think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,400,24,5,Do you maintain any ownership in MSC Software?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
72,402,24,7,"No, sir.  I sold that stock.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,403,24,8,All right.  And it looks like you indicate you were director of the Expert Solutions Group for about four years. Was that part of the sales group where they kept you on for your expertise and worked with you?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
74,409,24,14,"No, it wasn't sales at all.  MSC wanted to become a consultant.  I had developed a good consulting business with ANSYS, and they wanted to get into the consulting business because they weren't doing that.  They were only selling software.  So the Expert Solutions Group was set up to do consulting work within their organization.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,416,24,21,"Okay.  And I didn't think I said sales, but was that a position you held with MSC to basically help train them on the potential uses for the software you had sold them?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
76,420,24,25,"No.  Actually, my -- my job with Nastran was to actually do consulting work using the Nastran computer program.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,424,25,3,Okay.  Working with their customers?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
78,425,25,4,Or anybody that they could find that needed consulting work.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,427,25,6,"Okay.  At around that same time, it looks like from 2001 you started J. Williams Consulting and Engineering?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
80,430,25,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,431,25,10,And has that been your primary source of employment since the 2002 time frame?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
82,433,25,12,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,434,25,13,"Okay.  What has -- what -- has that entity existed since 2002, J. Williams Consulting?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
84,436,25,15,J. William Jones Consulting and Engineering?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,438,25,17,J. William Jones Consulting.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
86,439,25,18,"Yeah, I started that around '98, I think. I can't remember exactly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,441,25,20,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
88,442,25,21,"The reason I started that is I -- I was approached by a gentleman who wanted to develop jacks for cars, automobile jacks, floor jacks for mechanics all the way to very large jacks, and even for selling to the Big Three in the United States. And I told him at the time there's no way I'm going to work on automotive jacks because they fall on people, cars fall on people, and these lawyers will sue you.  It's unbelievable. And so I said, ""I can't do that work,"" and so he said, ""Well, we'll start another company,"" and I did.  I did that company just to take on commercial products.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,456,26,9,"All right.  So you started that company primarily to provide consulting to people that were manufacturing things because you didn't want to work directly with them, given the risk of litigation?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
90,460,26,13,"Correct, primarily.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,461,26,14,"Okay.  And as a result of consulting with those various companies, did you in fact have the opportunity to provide expert testimony and forensic consulting such as you're doing in this case today?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
92,465,26,18,"Yeah, in limited cases, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,466,26,19,"Well, according to your curriculum vitae, didn't you actually start testifying as an expert consultant back in the 1980s?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
94,469,26,22,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,470,26,23,Okay.  And you've acted as a litigation expert in more than 150 cases to date?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
96,472,26,25,"Probably at least that many, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,474,27,1,Okay.  I know I had asked you about the 2002 time frame. Is acting as a paid litigation expert your primary source of income today?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
98,478,27,5,It is.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,479,27,6,For how long a period of time has that been the case?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
100,481,27,8,"As you can probably see from my resum√©, I left MSC Nastran in 2002, if I recall exactly, and I was asked to come to Washington to serve as a White House Fellow.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,485,27,12,Sure.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
102,486,27,13,And I spent a year as a White House Fellow working on critical infrastructure protection.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,488,27,15,Was that a paid position?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
104,489,27,16,"It was a -- well, I wouldn't consider it to be paid very much.  I had a grant from the ASME that paid $50,000, which was to cover travel, living expenses and my salary.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,493,27,20,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
106,494,27,21,"Most of the people who took those White House fellowships were employed by the National University, and their salary continued.  I just felt it was the right thing to do and I just did it for basically the expenses.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,500,28,1,Okay.  And am I right that your work with the White House and subsequently with the ITI Group was focused on homeland security issues and risk assessments and things like that?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
108,504,28,5,"Yes.  I was asked to put together R & D programs to try to develop ways of preventing or mitigating terrorist attacks, and during the year at the White House, I developed this risk-based methodology called RAMCAP, and after that year was over, I approached the ASME. We had some good people in Risk and we put together a proposal for homeland security, and for the next six years we were funded fairly well by Homeland Security to develop these different sectors for looking at risk and how much the real risks were, how much you could afford to spend to protect various assets.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,517,28,18,"Okay.  Now, in addition to this $50,000 grant to try and cover your travel and living expenses, you did continue working as a forensic consultant and testifying as an expert after 2002 all the way through today, did you not?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
110,522,28,23,"Yeah, but I only took on one or two jobs while I was in Washington.  I wasn't very active in that business.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,526,29,1,"Okay.  When you say ""one or two jobs,"" are you talking about a few cases a year, essentially?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
112,528,29,3,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,529,29,4,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
114,530,29,5,"And I had some ongoing cases when I left, and then I had some clients that relied upon me from time to time, so, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,533,29,8,"Okay.  If we look at your testimony list, certainly there is consistent deposition and trial testimony from 1999 all the way through today.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
116,536,29,11,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,537,29,12,"Okay.  I had asked you about your consulting work earlier. Have you ever acted as a forensic consultant or a litigation expert in a case where somebody was claiming carbon monoxide intoxication, other than this case?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
118,543,29,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,544,29,19,"And similar to the question I asked about your consulting, have you ever acted as a forensic consultant or a litigation expert in a case involving commercial cooking equipment, generally?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
120,548,29,23,I have not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,549,29,24,"Moving beyond commercial bakery ovens, have you ever acted as a consultant or a testifying expert in a case involving any type of combustion appliance?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
122,554,30,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,555,30,4,Okay.  How many of those cases do you think you've been involved with?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
124,557,30,6,"Well, those aren't cases; those were actually consulting projects.  I hope I didn't misspeak.  I thought you meant worked on combustion projects.  I haven't had any other litigation that I can recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,562,30,11,Okay.  So what non-litigation consulting have you done involving combustion appliances?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
126,564,30,13,"I was -- for a number of years, we did work for a company down in San Diego called Solar Turbines, and they make turbine generator sets for supplying power to offshore platforms and other applications.  And they use a turbine, which is a combustion chamber, basically.  It burns natural gas, turns the turbine wheel and generates electricity.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,572,30,21,"Sure.  So, essentially, these are turbine-generated power systems used on like oil rigs and things out in the ocean?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
128,575,30,24,These are standalone power generation platforms.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,578,31,1,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
130,579,31,2,"They build a barge, basically, and there's a big turbine fuel, and then they have a generator and some other different equipment on there.  And they'll float these out to wherever they need power, tie it up against an offshore platform or wherever, and they can generate a tremendous amount of power using that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,586,31,9,"Okay.  And so they have -- if you have natural gas or diesel -- not diesel -- if you have natural gas or another power source, you essentially blow air through the turbine, it spins the blades, and then that blade is connected up to a generator that creates electricity?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
132,592,31,15,"Well, you take in air and then you introduce the gas --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,594,31,17,Sure.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
134,595,31,18,"-- and you burn the gas in the turbine. And then that gas, which is then accelerated through the turbine, turns a turbine wheel, which in turn turns the generator.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,599,31,22,All right.  And what sort of -- what sort of temperature ranges were involved in the combustion process used to power those turbines?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
136,602,31,25,"My company primarily was involved in the internals for the combustion chamber.  It turns out that there's a very -- you're burning gas at a high temperature, sometimes up to the thousands, so 2,000 degrees or higher, and you have to supply enough air coming into the turbine to cool the components so that they don't get above their creep range.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,610,32,7,"Okay.  You say the internals for the combustion. Was your company involved, then, with the ventilation aspects of the turbine to make sure that you were getting enough draft and air in there to keep it cooled down and avoid fatiguing the metals?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
138,616,32,13,"No, our job was primarily involved with designing the actual screens.  They have perforated screens inside the turbines that the air -- incoming air flows through the multitude of holes in it so that the combustion process doesn't overheat the metal inside of the turbine.  It's a very -- it's a very tricky design because you're burning gas --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,623,32,20,Right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
140,624,32,21,"-- and if you've got the metal to temperature of the gas temperature, you would end up -- it would creep and, you know, it wouldn't work.  So you're trying to get as much temperature in the turbine as possible without overheating the metal components.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,631,33,2,"Well, and I get that, but so when you say you guys were focused on the perforated screens, were you handling the combustion analysis and the ventilation analysis, or were you provided specifications and you had to make sure that the perforated screens you were providing met those specifications?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
142,638,33,9,"Our job was to take the inlet conditions, model up these metal components, and then run it through a series of thermal transients or other loading conditions which they would supply, and then to calculate the temperature distribution and the stresses in the components.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,644,33,15,"Okay.  And were the components that you were focused on determining the thermal stress these perforated screens, or all aspects of the turbine?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
144,647,33,18,"All aspects.  We had -- because the numbers that we came out with of the temperatures had to be used in the rest of the analysis, turbine blades and all the other pieces.  So, you know, it's not a -- you can't isolate just one piece.  The whole thing operates as a unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,653,33,24,"Now, in my limited experience with turbines, am I correct that there were no welded components within the turbine itself?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
146,657,34,2,I can't answer that as I sit here today. It's just been too long since I did the work.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,659,34,4,"All right.  As we sit here, do you remember analyzing the effects of the thermal transients and the temperature distribution and stresses across welds as well as across individual components of the turbine?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
148,664,34,9,"Well, in -- to the best of my recollection, in designing those components, they used similar materials, similar materials which would have the same coefficient of thermal expansion in the welding material, or any kind of welding rod or deposited metal would also have the same thermal coefficient of expansion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,671,34,16,You just told me a second ago you didn't remember if there was welding. Do you now remember if there is welding or not welding in those turbine components?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
150,675,34,20,"Well, what I'm referring to is, for example, the turbine blades, how they're attached to the turbine wheel and that sort of thing.  Anytime you have welding inside of a temperature -- of a device that has temperature excursions that large, you always use compatible materials.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,682,35,1,I understand that.  I'm trying to ask what you were analyzing on this turbine project that you told me about and whether or not that involved welding materials or not.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
152,686,35,5,"What I'm trying to explain to you is that once you weld it with the right weld material and you have compatible materials, you can assume essentially that it's homogeneous.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,690,35,9,"I get that, and that's a generic statement; right?  If you have compatible materials and you use the right weld, then you can presume they're going to move homogeneously.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
154,694,35,13,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,695,35,14,"The question is:  For this analysis of the combustion appliance you told me about, were there any welds, regardless of the materials and filler used?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
156,699,35,18,At this -- today I can't recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,700,35,19,"Okay.  Other than the turbine project that we've been discussing, do you remember any other consulting work that you did that involved combustion appliances or combustion products?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
158,704,35,23,"Well, the only other thing I can remember would be the engines that we worked on for Rocketdyne.  Of course, that involves combustion products.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,709,36,2,Okay.  So internal combustion engines or rocket engines?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
160,711,36,4,"Well, these were actually rocket engines.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,712,36,5,Rocket engines?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

I was living in a one-room apartment, and I didn't have a lot to do at night and on the weekends, so I decided I would write a book.  And so I sat down and started writing a book.  It took me three years to write my first book and I rewrote it a number of times, but it was fun and I enjoyed it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Ever since the Titanic, they seem to be more careful about stuff like that, and they don't want to -- if they have a fire in one compartment, they want to isolate that fire. So we looked at ways of using different materials to keep the fire from spreading throughout the ship.

So it had a lot of different aspects, the best I recollect.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

We -- the ASME set up this ITI -- I forget what it stands for, whatever it is, Advanced Technology Institute or something, Innovative Technology Institute -- and made me a senior fellow in that because -- excuse me -- they did not have a mechanism for working with outside consultants. The ASME normally uses volunteers to do all of their work, but we set that up as a business unit of the ASME, and I think that continued for six to eight years.  We were being funded by Homeland Security to continue our work there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

The project you did with the Solar Turbine, we were talking about the analysis you did on the various components and making sure they all worked together, just from a quick Internet search, it looks like predominantly turbine blades are made of stainless steel, titanium and nickel alloys. Do you recall what the turbines on the Solar Turbine project -- was that the name of the company?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
287,1056,49,11,"Solar Turbine, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

289,1060,49,15,"I don't recall, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
290,1061,49,16,"Was it your testimony that all of the various components in that turbine, whether it was the blades, the rod, the combustion box, you know, everything involving that turbine, that they were all made from the same material?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
291,1066,49,21,No.  I didn't -- I said they were made from compatible materials.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
292,1068,49,23,Okay.  And what's your definition of compatible materials?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
293,1070,49,25,"A compatible material is one that has -- that when heated, will, even if there's some amount of differential expansion, it will be within acceptable limits, and if you check the overstress, the fatigue, all the other components of the design, you can make it work. In the case of the turbine wheels, typically, the blades are made out of a different material because they have to be higher strength and they have to be creep resistant, and they don't weld them in. They use what's called a fir tree.  It's a machine, an end on the blade that the profile looks sort of like a fir tree, and then a similar -- a female hole is built into the blade -- I mean into the disc to hold them, and you slide them together and press them.  That way you don't have to weld them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
294,1089,50,18,So that you have a lot of stress created by the high-speed spinning of the turbine blades?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
295,1091,50,20,"The combination of high-speed spinning plus -- that gives you centrical forces, plus you're heating it at a high temperature.  You know, the hotter you can get the gas to go through there, the more efficient the turbine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,1096,50,25,Right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
297,1098,51,1,"And so it's a combination of you want these things to be spinning as fast as possible and as hot as possible, but you don't want them to grow to the point where they touch the outer rim of the -- because that's when you break a blade.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
298,1103,51,6,Yeah.  Nobody wants that.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
299,1104,51,7,All hell breaks loose at that point.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
300,1105,51,8,"So you indicated that there are probably -- more likely than not, there were different types of materials within the Solar Turbine turbine that you worked on, and you were wanting to make sure -- and even though they likely had different thermal coefficients of expansion, that they need to be within reasonable accommodation, or I forget -- what was your --",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
301,1113,51,16,They have to be compatible under the temperature excursion that you expect.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
302,1115,51,18,Right.  But you talked about the thermal expansion coefficients themselves being within a reasonable range of one another or something to that effect. Do you recall what you had told me?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
303,1120,51,23,I don't recall the exact words.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
304,1121,51,24,But you understand the concept I'm talking about?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
305,1124,52,1,"Yeah.  For example, if you use stainless steels or if you use Inconel, Inconel gives you higher temperature properties, doesn't have as much creep at high temperature, but it's so much nickel -- it has more nickel in it than, say, the high nickel carbon stainless steels, but they'll have a similar coefficient expansion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,1131,52,8,What is the magnitude of difference in thermal expansion coefficient that you would view as reasonable between two materials for them to be used together in a high-temperature environment?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
307,1135,52,12,"Well, it depends on the temperature.  The expansion is a product of the alpha, which is the coefficient of thermal expansion times the temperature difference between cold and hot. So if you got a motor that's sitting there at room temperature and you heat it up to, say, 1500 degrees or something, it's going to expand so that if -- for example, if you use a carbon steel, it has a much different coefficient of expansion than stainless steel and so you'll have a differential expansion.  And the bigger the temperature increase, the more strain you will incur at that interface.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,1147,52,24,So you say it's going to depend on the temperature and other factors. What are all the factors you want to consider when determining whether the use of two materials with different thermal expansion coefficients is appropriate for a given application? What are each of the factors?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

314,1163,53,14,No problem.  Try to wait.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
315,1164,53,15,"But, yes, first of all, a lot of it will depend on the geometry that you're dealing with.  But primarily, when you're using two different materials with different coefficients of expansion, the trick is to maintain a balance between the amount of temperature increase you have and the difference in the alpha, or coefficient of thermal expansion. So if you just take two materials and weld them together, a linear piece of material like a plate, and you weld it together along the seam, the stresses are proportionate to E, assuming they have the same modulus, times the difference in alpha, alpha 1 minus alpha 2, times the temperature increased, delta T.  So the stress is E alpha, difference, delta T. And so if you can maintain that thermal stress within limits, then that will tell you how much temperature rise you can afford for given two materials that are being welded together.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
316,1185,54,10,Are there any -- are there any constraints on the use of that -- that equation in terms of looking at the differential of the thermal expansion properties?

322,1209,55,8,The equation I gave --,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

324,1213,55,12,All right.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
325,1214,55,13,You can go.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
326,1215,55,14,"Okay.  All right.  Let's go. The -- to answer your question the best I can, the equation that I give you, the strain is equal to alpha delta T.  That's the strain.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
327,1220,55,19,Right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
328,1221,55,20,"If you exceed the linear elastic properties of the material, you will still get the same amount of strain, but the stress is no longer proportional to the strain. So basically, you could get yielding in the materials, and typically, when you're doing a thermal stress analysis, you have different stress limits that you would use for thermal stress analysis compared to the -- say, just the loading of a part. And according to the ASME code, for example, thermal stresses are categorized as secondary stresses so that you can actually have a range of stress so that even if you yield something on the first part of the cycle, you'll get a -- when it cools down, you'll get a residual stress so that when you heat it up again, you'll go from being in, say, compression to tension so you can get -- the range of stress can be up to twice yield and still be acceptable.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
329,1242,56,15,"Okay.  So in layman's terms -- or not layman's, but at least less engineering terms -- when you're talking about yield, are you talking about some form of plastic deformation of the material?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
330,1247,56,20,"Sure.  If you -- if you take a bar, a tensile specimen and pull on it, by Hooke's law, you'll get a linear relationship of a displacement versus the load.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
331,1251,56,24,And once that plastic deformation or permanent deformation is --,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
332,1254,57,1,"Once you reach the yield point, now you're -- you will no longer get an increase in stress that's proportional to the strain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
333,1257,57,4,Right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
334,1258,57,5,"That's yielding. But with thermal stresses, it's okay sometimes to yield, because when it cools down, you'll get a residual stress that will be beneficial to you, so on the next cycle you'll get a different -- you won't be yielding on the second go-around.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
335,1264,57,11,And it can even change between tension and compression?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
336,1266,57,13,"Yeah.  And of course one of the complicating factors is that, number one, if you look at the allowable -- if you look at the yields, the yield at high temperature is usually lower, considerably lower than the yield at low temperature. Secondly, if you're up to around 1200, 1400 degrees, you're going to get creep, so you think you're going to have a residual stress, but what happens is that residual stress creeps out at the high temperature. So when you start dealing with this thermal stress analysis, it is -- it's not -- it's not a simple -- it's not a simple case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

348,1309,59,4,"The only thing is the time sheets.  I produced those, and I just gave a summary and you requested or something -- I can't remember, but that was asked of me, to have a breakdown.  So I gave you that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

412,1470,65,9,Okay.  So the general purpose was to see one of the ovens in operation and then also to get some measurements of the combustion gases while it was in operation?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

They were designated as more or less the experts in combustion, and I would defer to them for their judgment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

426,1501,66,14,"Okay.  So heat exchanger design and stress analysis you understood as your role in the case. How does that differ, if you know, from Mr. Hendrickson's planned role in this case?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
427,1505,66,18,"Well, it's my understanding that he's a metallurgist, and his primary focus was to look at the metals involved to determine the cause of the metal failure from a metallurgical standpoint.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

430,1517,67,4,Okay.  So you were analyzing the stresses on the metals based in part on the temperature estimates that Mr. Hendrickson provided?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
431,1520,67,7,In part.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
432,1521,67,8,Okay.  Did you have any understanding what Ms. Gill's expertise was on this case?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
433,1523,67,10,"It's my understanding that she is a -- primarily involved in the design process, the hierarchy of design and some human factors, perhaps, that sort of thing.

438,1543,68,4,"Not for stress analysis and fluid flow analysis, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
439,1545,68,6,"Okay.  And so now I think you've added a term for me here. Initially, you talked about stress analysis and the critique of the heat exchanger design probably based on that stress analysis.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
440,1550,68,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
441,1551,68,12,You've now indicated something about fluid. What sort of fluid dynamic analysis have you done?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
442,1555,68,16,I've done some preliminary work to determine the flow rates through various parts of the heat exchanger.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
443,1558,68,19,"Okay.  And is that the calculations done in the last couple of weeks on the differences in pressure of the combustion gases when you're burning or not burning, and then the -- your analysis of the vent hood efficiency?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
444,1563,68,24,It's a little more involved than that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
445,1564,68,25,Okay.  What else is involved?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
446,1566,69,1,"Well, when you're doing a fluid flow analysis, and I'm considering air to be a fluid.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
447,1568,69,3,Sure.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
448,1569,69,4,"In the -- in the traditional economic sense, most people don't think of air being a fluid, but if you'll bear with me, we'll call it a fluid, but we can call it air, if you want to. But when you're looking at fluid flow problems, the pressure and velocities are intimately related, so you really can't do a pressure analysis without doing a fluid flow analysis, that sort of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
449,1578,69,13,"Okay.  And I agree with you there. My question, then, I guess is:  Have you looked at fluid flow problems with respect to anything other than the flue gas mixtures in the heat exchanger as reflected on the calculations that have been provided that I think were done on September 1st or the alleged efficiency or inefficiency of the vent hood ventilation aspects of the oven. Has there been any other work addressing fluid problems besides those two pieces of work product?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

455,1608,70,17,-- the kind of flow we're looking at here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
456,1609,70,18,"All right.  And we're going to go through those and obviously in more detail, but am I correct -- and you may have answered this:  The work you were doing looking at fluid flow, that's all work that's been done primarily in the last few weeks?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
457,1615,70,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
458,1616,70,25,"Okay.  Prior to that time, was all of the work product you had done in this case focused entirely on looking at the stresses imposed on the heat exchanger and your critique of the design of the heat exchanger based on that analysis?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

460,1624,71,7,"Well, I would have to say the work I did was a little more general in that it wasn't limited to that.  And the reason is because the analysis that you're talking about, they involve more of an overall operational thing. The first thing I had to do is try to understand the overall operation of the -- of the heat exchanger, and then -- then I could actually try to get enough information to do these fluid flow and stress analysis.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

468,1657,72,14,"Well, the Ponderosa people, Romig and Guthrie, produced some charts.  They were temperature pressure charts, or at least temperature charts.  I'm not -- and they also showed carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and all the combustion -- well, most of the combustion products that were of interest. So I was on the phone with Joe, and asked him to explain to me, you know, what these represented or what the plots represented, and if he found -- if he had any understanding of why they looked like that; in other words, just to give me a general overall picture of what he learned from doing these tests.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
469,1672,73,3,Okay.  What did Dr. Romig tell you?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
470,1673,73,4,"Well, we went through the charts and looked at the -- at the combustion gas makeup as a function of time after startup, and he explained to me what the different colored lines meant, and he basically explained to me how the analyzer worked, that sort of thing, gave me an understanding of what was going on as he measured the flue gas.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
471,1680,73,11,All right.  And you said that the measurements he did of the flue gas resulted in charts. Was it your understanding that the charts Dr. Romig produced reflected the gases both as a function of temperature and pressure?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

477,1702,74,7,"Okay.  Well, that cuts down on some of my questions.  Not all of them.  Cuts down on the length of our breaks, for sure. You mentioned that you, in addition to the stress analysis you performed and the critique of the heat exchanger design, obviously part of doing that was understanding the overall operation of the heat exchanger. What do you mean by understanding the overall operation of the heat exchanger?  What did you do to obtain that information and what did you learn?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
478,1714,74,19,"Well, I attempted to understand how the burner worked, the controls on the burner, how the ignition of the gas worked. I looked at the -- tried to get an estimate of what would happen inside of the heat exchanger as the combustion gases worked their way through the heat exchanger.  I wanted to know how the secondary system, the heating gas that went into the bake chamber, I wanted to understand, you know, the fan, how it circulated the air across the heat exchanger into the bake chamber.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

483,1733,75,12,"All right.  And was it your -- was it work you did prior to your initial stress analysis and critique of the heat exchanger in terms of learning all of that, or is that work you did more recently in connection with the combustion pressure calculations that you referenced?",q,MR.

486,1744,75,23,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
487,1745,75,24,"So in my initial visit out to Rest Your Case, the only thing I saw was a burned-out heat exchanger with gaps between the tubes, and so I came back to my office and I sat down and had a feel for, you know, what had happened, and I started trying to make calculations to see how high the stresses would be --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

493,1777,77,4,"Correct.  And then I just basically made some assumptions of my own as to maximum excursion temperature, that sort of thing, initially.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
494,1780,77,7,"Okay.  And then is this additional understanding or view of materials to have that understanding something you undertook, say, in the last six, eight months, in order to support a critique of the design as opposed to your analysis of the physics that happened with regard to the actual heat exchanger?",q,MR.

633,2192,93,3,But I don't remember off the top of my head.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
634,2194,93,5,Do you have any information about the date of manufacture or service use for any of the heat exchangers reflected in Dieter 32 through Dieter 34?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
635,2197,93,8,It's probably available in the original documents.  I don't remember it off the top of my head.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
636,2200,93,11,"All right.  Other than I guess the suggestion that there are heat exchangers other than the subject oven that reflect I guess a comparable type of failure mode, is there any other purpose for your reference to the Dieter photographs?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
637,2205,93,16,No.  The reason that I pulled those is because I felt like that -- that this was a generic problem as opposed to a specific problem.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
638,2208,93,19,"And when you say ""a generic problem,"" you mean a problem that's not limited to the individual product at issue but one that might be seen over more than just that one product?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
639,2212,93,23,"No, not product.  It's generic in the sense that it was a flaw in the design of the heat exchanger which showed up in a number of -- of the same -- of the heat exchangers that were in use.  It wasn't a single point failure that sometimes happens when you have a very unique situation but more of a generic problem to the design.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
640,2220,94,5,Okay.  Certainly there are a number of data points that you have even from the graph limited alone that you looked at that suggest heat exchangers of the same design not identified as having failed; isn't that correct?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
641,2225,94,10,"Vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, assumes facts.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_question
642,2228,94,13,"In fact, there's more that have not failed and that have been identified as failed?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

644,2231,94,16,"Well, I can't agree with that -- that statement.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
645,2234,94,19,"Is it your opinion, based on the information you've reviewed, that the DRO inspection program identified more failed heat exchangers than they did heat exchangers that were not cracked at the time of inspection?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
646,2239,94,24,Vague and ambiguous.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
647,2240,94,25,"No, my opinion is that the way that these heat exchangers were identified as being failed was extremely crude and did not necessarily identify heat exchangers that could have had hairline cracks or were beginning to start fatiguing and may be partially failed.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
648,2247,95,6,All right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
649,2248,95,7,"So, you know, the way I remember it in the inspection program, you took the fan, the blower off the heat exchanger and took your trouble light and inserted it as far as it would go into the heat exchanger, and then you went around to the bake chamber and you looked at that heat exchanger to see if you could see light coming out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
650,2255,95,14,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
651,2256,95,15,"Okay.  To get light to come out, you've got to have a pretty good size hole.  There could be --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
652,2259,95,18,How big a hole is it required for light to pass through?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
653,2261,95,20,I don't think he's finished his answer. So could you please finish your answer?,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
654,2264,95,23,"The hole there could have been hairline cracked in all of them, and if they were small cracks, they might not have shown up. There could be partial cracks in all of them and you wouldn't see light coming through there.  But in every case, if you continued to use those heat exchangers, they could have resulted in a complete breach. So if you wanted to do a real inspection, you should have done something like a dye penetrant check, which means that you should put dye penetrant liquid on there and then use some type of a black light to determine if you have a crack. So in my humble opinion, the method used to determine a failed heat exchanger was extremely crude and wouldn't necessarily turn up all the failures.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
655,2282,96,15,All right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
656,2283,96,16,"So therefore, your answer to my question -- to answer your question, do I think that there could be more heat exchangers or all could fail, it's quite possible.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
657,2287,96,20,"All right.  Let me follow up on a couple questions, then.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
658,2289,96,22,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
659,2290,96,23,How big has the hole got to be for light to pass through it?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
660,2292,96,25,"It depends on the crack shape.  If you have a V-shaped crack, light won't pass through it because it doesn't reflect very well.  In many cases, you will have a crack that is open whenever it's hot and closes up when it cools off, and you wouldn't see that crack except by dye penetrant methodology.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
661,2300,97,7,Have you done any testing to demonstrate that ability to have a crack in the heat exchanger that would not be identifiable with the light test that was used?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

Do you have any data to back up the suggestion that there may be cracks present in heat exchangers in 2002 that were not identified by the inspection?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

691,2407,101,10,"Okay.  But my question is:  The crack analysis in the dye penetrant, is that something you looked at with regard to hairline cracks, or whatever term you want to use, in a single material or within the weld joint of two -- of two pieces, two components?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

And I think that Mr. Mills here, he also provided some explanations, which, as an engineer, I found helpful, you know. If you look at the numbers on the instruction, it says it runs for such and such, but Mr. Mills, being a physicist, he says the purge time is sufficiently long to fully flush the brush and products in the uncompromised heat exchanger. I use that kind of information.  It's very useful as an engineer to understand the design. Because it's one thing to just look at the cold, hard facts of what it's doing, but it's another thing to try to understand there's got to be a rhyme and reason for doing something some way, and the more you understand about it, the better off you are in terms of trying to understand and analyze it.  So that's why I pulled this one out.  It gave me some good information.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
782,2700,112,17,So it basically summarized the various factual information that appeared in the burner manual and also provided additional context for some of those operations?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
783,2704,112,21,Exactly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
784,2705,112,22,"That's what it seemed like, but I wanted to make sure I understood.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
785,2707,112,24,"It just helps.  When somebody explains it to you and gives you a little bit more detail, it's always helpful.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
786,2711,113,2,"All right.  I'm going to mark as Exhibit 3 two documents I've stapled together, one of which was the retention letter from July 18, 2017 that was produced to us, and the other is the ledger of charges from this case that you and I talked about earlier.",side_chat,MR.

790,2729,113,20,They are.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
791,2730,113,21,All right.  I'm going to mark as Exhibit 4 the individual invoices that you have brought with you today and that we got sent last night that relate to the information we saw in the general ledger identified as Exhibit 3.,side_chat,MR. CROSS,is brackets

793,2741,114,6,Can you confirm for me that the invoice -- invoices we have marked collectively as Exhibit 4 comprise all of the invoices you have submitted to Mr. Jarchi to date for the work that you have done in this case?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
794,2746,114,11,They are.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
795,2747,114,12,All right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
796,2748,114,13,Do you want me to put this in the pile?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
797,2749,114,14,"Yeah.  Hold on to the Exhibit 4 invoices, if you would. All right.  So if I'm looking at -- actually, I lied.  I misrepresented.  You may still want that ledger. If I look at your general ledger, it looks like through September 3rd, 2019 you have billed a total of $112,200 for work in this case; is that right?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
798,2758,114,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
799,2759,114,24,"All right.  And it also appears that the vast majority, more than $80,000, was billed during just the past four months?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
800,2763,115,2,"I think that's right, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
801,2764,115,3,"All right.  So I want to talk with you a little bit about the work you did both earlier in this case and then the work you've done more recently in the last four months, and we will do that going through Exhibit 4, the individual invoices; okay?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
802,2770,115,9,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
803,2771,115,10,"All right.  So it looks like the retainer letter that you sent out on July 18, 2017 was answered, and within a month, you were actually given a $2,000 retainer on August 17th of 2017; is that right?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
804,2776,115,15,"Apparently.  I don't do the bookkeeping, but that sure looks right.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
805,2778,115,17,Okay.  And then the first invoice that you billed against that retainer was from November -- I'm sorry -- was for work done during October of 2017.  You billed that on November 1st.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
806,2782,115,21,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
807,2783,115,22,"All right.  As I go through your October individual invoice, you indicate that you inspected -- you did an inspection at Rest Your Case. Was that the inspection of the subject heat exchanger?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
808,2790,116,3,It was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
809,2791,116,4,"All right.  Did you inspect any other aspects of the subject oven, other than the heat exchanger, at that initial inspection?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
810,2794,116,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
811,2795,116,8,And what else did you inspect?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
812,2796,116,9,"There were a number of pieces of the heat exchanger in various stages of disassembly.  There was the basic box itself, and then there was the steam unit, if I remember, some portions of the steam unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
813,2801,116,14,"Where there was the balls, the structure that looked like sort of individual racks of balls?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
814,2803,116,16,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
815,2804,116,17,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
816,2805,116,18,"I didn't -- I wasn't as concerned with those.  Photographs -- if you really want to see exactly what I have, I sent you my photographs from that date, and they would reflect everything I saw there at the inspection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
817,2810,116,23,Okay.  So everything of interest to you during the initial inspection are reflected within the photographs you have produced from that inspection?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
818,2815,117,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
819,2816,117,3,Did you take any notes of that initial inspection?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
820,2818,117,5,I didn't.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
821,2819,117,6,"All right.  You indicate in addition to the inspection that took place on October 5th, 2017, you had spent about four hours reading background information. Do you remember what initial information you were provided?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
822,2825,117,12,That was one hour; right?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
823,2826,117,13,"Well, you had one hour on the 1st and an hour and a half on the 3rd and an hour and a half on the 4th.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
824,2829,117,16,"Sure.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  By that time, I had received a number of documents, and I was sort of reading through those documents to see what the case was about. I try to prepare for an inspection because if I had known what happened, you know, the cause, it helps me determine what to look for when I go see this.  And since the documents indicated that it was a heat exchanger problem, then I would concentrate more of my time looking at the heat exchanger problem rather than other parts that might be available.  So that's why I do that research initially.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
825,2843,118,4,"Okay.  And I get all that. But my question, I guess, is:  What is the nature of the background information?  Were you were provided legal pleadings?  Were you provided technical documents?  What information did you spend four hours reviewing prior to inspecting the heat exchanger?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
826,2850,118,11,"My answer is there was a whole bunch of interrogatories and they were very voluminous, and I read down through there and tried to understand from the interrogatories and the responses what was going on with the case.  And I can't remember, but there were a number of those documents.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
827,2856,118,17,Did you receive any design documents or drawings or anything like that prior to signing the protective order that you produced as part of your file?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
828,2860,118,21,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
829,2861,118,22,Okay.  So anything you had reviewed prior to your initial inspection in October of 2017 would have been material that was not designated as confidential?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
830,2866,119,1,That's my understanding.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
831,2867,119,2,"It's vague and ambiguous, but -- yeah.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_question
832,2870,119,5,"All right.  After your inspection, about three weeks later, it looks like you spent two hours on analysis. Is that the stress analysis you did, or what were you analyzing in late October of 2017?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
833,2875,119,10,"That was when I first sat down with the information that I had and tried to determine roughly what the stresses would be at that juncture with the similar metals. And it was just a brief set of -- almost like back-of-the-envelope calculations, to see -- you know, one of the things you do as an engineer is you try to postulate different failure modes and then you do rough calculations to see if those failure modes make sense to you. There's no use to do a detailed analysis that's going to take you a week to do if you can prove up front that's not the problem. So you try to eliminate the things that aren't the problem and discover the things that probably are the problem. And I was doing that initially just to kind of get a feel for the level of stress and the discontinuity and that sort of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
834,2895,120,4,"All right.  So on the 25th, it looks like maybe then what you're telling me is you did a review of the information you gathered and a very broad overview type analysis to see if there was something worth investigating further, and then you have five hours that it looks like you spent five days later when you say specifically calculating thermal stresses.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
835,2903,120,12,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
836,2904,120,13,So was that a more detailed analysis that you performed trying to identify the specific stresses present on the heat exchanger?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
837,2907,120,16,"Yeah, and it includes things -- once you identify what you're going to do, then you need to get material properties, and so you have to start looking for the right source of material properties, and these material properties have to be a function of temperature.  So, you know, that's when you start gathering the information that you're going to need to do the more detailed work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
838,2915,120,24,"And the five hours that you did on October 30th, 2017, was that all closed handwork, or did that include any of the finite element analysis?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
839,2919,121,2,It was all hand calculations.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
840,2920,121,3,"Okay.  So that's gathering the data, running the calculations, checking them, and basically just doing a more detailed assessment of the stresses involved on the heat exchanger?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
841,2924,121,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
842,2925,121,8,And it looks like the next day you spent four hours on something called PPT. Was that a PowerPoint?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
843,2928,121,11,"Yeah.  I wanted to get an understanding of how the flow was going through the heat exchanger. So, many times whenever I'm doing these, it helps me if I will create a model in PowerPoint or Word or whatever document, whatever -- I don't have a drawing program per se; I just tend to use those, and then I create the outline, put in the dimensions and that sort of thing and then try to get a visualization of what's going on inside the heat exchanger, and that's what that was.  And I subsequently used that to help our animators create the animation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
844,2940,121,23,Okay.  I have not seen that PowerPoint. Do you have it with you?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
845,2942,121,25,It's incorporated in my stress analysis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
846,2944,122,1,Okay.  Are you talking about Figure 2 on Page 3 of your Analysis of Heater Tube Failure?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
847,2946,122,3,"That's part of it, yeah.  I think there's other figures in there that I created using that technique.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
848,2949,122,6,"Okay.  Now, I've got on Figure 3 a couple photographs.  One's showing general, and one's more of a blowup showing the actual breaches of the heat exchanger. Was that part of your PowerPoint?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
849,2954,122,11,"Yeah, I would bring in the pictures in the PowerPoint and then do notations, that sort of thing.  So it makes a nice photograph that I can refer to -- or makes a nice figure, not a photograph.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
850,2959,122,16,"How many slides were involved in the PowerPoint you created on October 31st, 2017?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
851,2961,122,18,Just the ones you see.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
852,2962,122,19,Just the two that are included within your heat tube -- analysis of heat tube failure?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
853,2964,122,21,Vague and ambiguous.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
854,2965,122,22,Or if there are just two.  I don't know.  Whatever they are is what it was.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
855,2968,122,25,"Okay.  In terms of the PowerPoint you created in October 30, 2017, is the entirety of the slides you created included within your analysis of heater tube failure that you've produced to us, or were there other sides that have not been produced?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
856,2974,123,5,"As far as I know, you got them all.  Now, remember, it didn't take me four hours to do that slide.  It took me four hours of trial and error to get what I wanted.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
857,2978,123,9,Sure.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
858,2979,123,10,"So it's not exactly -- you know, it's not like I can sit down and have a picture in my head that I'm putting on there.  It's one of those things that you develop over -- you do some analysis, you, you know, work on the picture. Without the pictures, it's hard to explain to somebody what you're doing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
859,2986,123,17,"No, I understand. And so one of the two PowerPoint slides that appear in your analysis of heater tube failure shows diagrams of gases flowing through the serpentine tubes.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
860,2991,123,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
861,2992,123,23,Is that information you provided to what you referred to as the animators?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
862,2994,123,25,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
863,2996,124,1,Who are the animators?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
864,2997,124,2,I don't know who are the animators.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
865,2998,124,3,Did you provide slides directly to somebody or to Mr. Jarchi?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
866,3000,124,5,I gave them to Rob.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
867,3001,124,6,Okay.  Did you ever talk with these unidentified animators at any time?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
868,3003,124,8,"Yeah.  There was one time I was sitting in Rob's office.  He called him up, and I told him what I was looking for.  He apparently had received that picture, and I explained to him what I was trying to show with the picture.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
869,3008,124,13,"Okay.  Did you, in your PowerPoint in October of 2017, attempt to illustrate any portions of the oven, other than the heat exchanger itself?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
870,3011,124,16,"No, I don't think so.  I can't remember it if I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
871,3013,124,18,So you didn't show the convection -- the convection fan flows or the bake chamber of the oven?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
872,3016,124,21,"Actually, it does show the convection fan flows.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
873,3018,124,23,"Well, I know the animation does.  I'm asking about the --",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
874,3020,124,25,The PowerPoint shows it that you just had.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
875,3022,125,1,"Okay.  Let me go ahead and mark this, then, because you're going to have to point that out for me.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
876,3025,125,4,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,is brackets

879,3033,125,12,I mean it's relatively crude.  I'm not saying it's...,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
880,3035,125,14,So we've marked as Exhibit 5 what you've titled Analysis of Heater Tube Failure.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
881,3037,125,16,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
882,3038,125,17,And there's a big blue arrow that talks about arrow -- or that talks about air flowing totally outside of the heat exchanger; is that correct?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
883,3042,125,21,Oven Air - Crossflow through Tubes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
884,3043,125,22,All right.  And we're talking about Figure 2 of Exhibit 5?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
885,3045,125,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
886,3046,125,25,Okay.  And is that the sole depiction you created back in October of 2017 reflecting the convection fan flow?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
887,3050,126,3,"It is.  What I tried to show there, and I think it helped the animator, I used colors to depict the airflow through there, and as the air goes through there you're losing heat to the convection fan.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
888,3055,126,8,Uh-huh.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
889,3056,126,9,"So you see that it started out as red and you got -- I have to apologize.  I'm colorblind, but it looks to me like it's getting lighter in color to indicate that they're taking heat out of the heat exchanger. And the blue I used because it was cooler coming through there to cause the -- to pick up the heat from the heat exchanger.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
890,3064,126,17,"Okay.  Because this is going to be potentially confusing on the video record, can you hold that up so we can see a picture of Figure 2 that you've just been discussing for us?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

893,3070,126,23,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
894,3071,126,24,"And really my question, then, is:  You've got the cross flow of air moving across the heat exchanger tubes and having the effect in terms of drawing some of the heat away that you talked about. Did you do any other PowerPoint slides to show how that warmed-up convection air leaves the heat exchanger and enters the bake chamber of the oven?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
895,3080,127,7,I did not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
896,3081,127,8,Okay.  Did you create any slides that showed or reflected alleged flows within the bake chamber as opposed to what we see here with the heat exchanger?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
897,3085,127,12,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
898,3086,127,13,Okay.  Did you create any slides that showed flow dynamics or ventilation as you open the door of the bake chamber and where that air goes as you open the door of the bake chamber?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
899,3090,127,17,No.  The closest thing I have is this hand-drawn sketches that I did when I did the analysis of the hood area.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
900,3093,127,20,Okay.  And that's the analysis you did on August 30th or 31st?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

And like I said, I will just cut and paste pieces and put it in my work sheet here -- that ends up being this document -- and go to the next deposition and do that. And as I go along, then I try to categorize these things as are these design related to the design, related to the inspection, related to the -- whatever process, and I just try to have broad categories. And I've found it helpful in my business to just -- if it's over like a half a page, I'll just copy that and paste it on my document here because, quite honestly, with -- I probably read 40 depositions or something like that, I'm guessing, estimating, and I --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

996,3379,138,20,"Well, almost everything I reviewed related to the heat exchangers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
997,3381,138,22,Okay.  So that was the focus of your analysis of the oven and the heat exchanger and its operation?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
998,3384,138,25,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
999,3386,139,1,All right.  There is reference in your June 1st invoice.  This is work done in May of 2019. It looks like you're reading a lot more depositions.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1000,3389,139,4,I did.  No doubt about it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1001,3390,139,5,But I wanted to ask you about the final entry on May 31st.  It just says Pressure Switch.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1003,3393,139,8,Do you recall what you did for about an hour involving the pressure switch on May 31st?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1004,3395,139,10,"Yeah, I did.  When I read some of these depos, Lee and Casto and Mills, especially Casto and Mills, they seemed to almost believe that the pressure switch was some kind of a magic wand that if you put a pressure switch on, then you couldn't get carbon monoxide. So I went on the Internet and I did research of various people who make pressure switches, and there's all kinds of good information out there, things on YouTube that you can watch people.  So I tried to learn as much as I could about pressure switches.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1005,3407,139,22,All right.  And do you recall any of the manufacturers of the pressure switches that you saw on the Internet during that hour?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1006,3410,139,25,"I do not, I have to tell you.  But I did -- I think I looked at the ones -- I tried to look at the ones -- Honeywell was one of the ones I looked at, and I can't remember the other manufacturers. But best of my recollection, there were a couple that were used by ITW in their design, and I remember looking, searching for those, and then, you know how the Internet is.  It leads you right down -- it's the greatest time waster ever invented. You can spend an hour looking and you end up three hours later still looking at something. There's a lot of information about pressure switches, people describing how they worked, how they install them, and I tried to watch as much of that as I could.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1007,3427,140,16,What's your understanding of the operation and purpose of pressure switches installed on the subject oven?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
1008,3430,140,19,"Vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1009,3432,140,21,"My understanding of the pressure switch is that the pressure switch measures the pressure inside of the combustion chamber, or when you turn the blower on for the burner, the fan is supposed to start up. You have a small fan motor.  It's an eighth of a horsepower, or something like that, not a very big motor, and it runs a squirrel cage fan, and it blows air into the combustion chamber. It's a big cylinder.  It's like 12 inches in diameter, if I remember, in that neighborhood, and when you blow air into this combustion chamber, you will build up a certain pressure.  The reason is, because there's a back pressure of pushing air through the heat exchanger, it takes quite a bit of pressure differential to blow air through this thing. So as you're blowing air into the combustion chamber, you will increase the pressure in the combustion chamber with respect to the ambient condition, and your pressure switches, if I recall, were set so that if you're between 1 and 1.4, or something like that, inches of water, then -- then the computer that's in the heater, modular combustion blower, that computer recognizes that the fan is on.  That's how it knows that air is coming into the combustion chamber. And the pressure switch then is really just a device so that whenever the pressure differential reaches a certain amount, then it -- it is taught to believe that the fan is running, and so now it knows that air should be being blown into the combustion chamber. And that's all it does.  It just recognizes that there are -- that there is a blower blowing into the combustion chamber.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1010,3470,142,7,"All right.  Is the -- do you know whether the purpose of that is to ensure that you don't ignite the burner with an overly-rich mixture; that you make sure make sure that there's plenty of air blowing into the burner, as you say, before you ignite the burner?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
1011,3476,142,13,"Objection; vague and ambiguous and calls for speculation, depending on who the -- just leave it at that.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1012,3479,142,16,"Well, my understanding of it is basically twofold. Number one, it's blowing air into the combustion chamber, and you don't want to start putting gas in there before you have air flowing through it. And the second function of the pressure switch and the blower is to evacuate all products of combustion or whatever's left in the heat exchanger and start out with clean, fresh air, theoretically, in through the heat exchanger and all the way up through the exhaust duct.  And that's why you run it for 30 -- 30-something seconds before you try to ignite the burner.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1013,3495,143,6,Okay.  That's what they call the purge cycle?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1014,3497,143,8,You could call it a purge cycle.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1015,3498,143,9,"All right.  Now, you referenced something about back pressure. Did you take any measurements of any heat exchanger to try and quantify this alleged back pressure that exists in the heat exchanger?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1023,3518,144,3,I did not actually calculate numerical values for back pressure.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1024,3521,144,6,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1025,3522,144,7,"However, I do know the back pressure is initially 1.0 to 1.4 inches of water, because that's what your pressure switch requires in order to actually make us close the circuit and start the rest of the system to operate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1026,3527,144,12,"And it's your understanding that this small motor, or not very big motor, whatever it is, an eighth of horsepower, was enough to clear that back pressure and permit the combustion to go forward?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1067,3672,150,1,"Okay.  All right.  Now, it looks like a little over a week after that inspection, you had a teleconference that was -- no.  On July 2nd you had a seven-hour conference call and on July 9th you had a six-and-a-half hour conference call. First, the July 2nd call.  So this would have been four days after your exemplar testing. Do you remember who that conference call involved?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1068,3681,150,10,We're looking at the July invoice.  That's right?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1069,3683,150,12,It's the August invoice with July charges.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1070,3684,150,13,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1071,3685,150,14,Yeah.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1072,3686,150,15,Yeah.  We -- we had a call with Rob and some of the experts.  I can't remember who all was on the call.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1073,3689,150,18,Was it the experts that had been at the inspection to discuss the results of the inspection?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1074,3691,150,20,"Yeah, some of them were.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1075,3692,150,21,So was Dr. Romig involved in that conference call?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1076,3694,150,23,"Best of my recollection, he was.  Guthrie.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1077,3695,150,24,Ms. Gill?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1078,3696,150,25,I think she was on the call.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1079,3698,151,1,All right.  Was Mr. Hendrickson on the call?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1080,3700,151,3,I don't believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1081,3701,151,4,Did Mr. Hendrickson attend the exemplar testing?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1082,3703,151,6,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1083,3704,151,7,What was the subject of that lengthy call?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1084,3705,151,8,"Well, Rob wanted to go over a lot of the documents that he was -- that we would be asked to review.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1085,3708,151,11,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1086,3709,151,12,"And it just takes a while.  As you know, there's just a plethora of material in this case, and so we went through some of those documents and how they related to our testing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1087,3713,151,16,"So were you directed by Mr. Jarchi to go look at specific documents that had already been provided to you, or were these new documents that were going to be provided to you?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1088,3717,151,20,"No, these were documents that I had.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1089,3718,151,21,Okay.  So you were just sort of directed to things that might affect your opinions?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1093,3727,152,4,All right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1094,3728,152,5,"He could have been.  I've never met him, and so I -- I've had no interaction with him, so...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1095,3730,152,7,"All right.  Now, a week and a half later -- I'm sorry, just a week later, there's another 6.5 hour charge for a teleconference and prep. Do you remember what that teleconference was about and who was on it?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1096,3736,152,13,"About the same -- it was about the same thing, going over the documents in the case.  And each of us had areas that we were concerned primarily with, so -- but we were trying to get an understanding of the overall big picture.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1097,3741,152,18,"Okay.  So it was a continuation where you were talking with the experts, Mr. Jarchi's advising of different materials each of you should then take a look at consistent with the work you've done on the case?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1098,3746,152,23,Right.  My stress analysis stuff obviously relates to Joe Romig's understanding of the combustion part of the thing and so on and so forth. So we just kicked around mostly technical issues.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1099,3751,153,2,All right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1100,3752,153,3,"We were, in effect, reverse engineering this heat exchanger to try to understand how it worked and why it didn't work and when it failed and why.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1101,3756,153,7,All right.  And then you have the following week a call and work on a Swagelok followed by the next day two hours of research on a Swagelok. What -- what was that call and research focused on?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1102,3762,153,13,"Yeah, let me see.  What dates?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1103,3763,153,14,"Yeah, it's July 15 and July 16 of 2019.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1104,3764,153,15,"Okay.  Oh, yeah.  One of the things that I got to thinking about is the -- how long had the Swagelok concept been around, and so I decided I would do some research into that area, and I went back and read the patent -- first time I had seen that Swagelok was the patent, but I can't remember the guy's name that patented it, but I'll think of it in a minute -- and he shows that Swagelok very clearly in his patent application, which was like early '90s or late '80s.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1105,3774,153,25,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1106,3776,154,1,"And so one of the things I learned about -- and I read that patent pretty thoroughly and I noticed that every claim that he had in the patent was related to the Swagelok concept, and so then after I read that patent and understood what he was trying to do there, I went back to say, ""Well, how long has that technique been around.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1107,3783,154,8,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1108,3784,154,9,"And so I went and actually looked at the Swagelok.  It was confusing at first, because there's another technique called a SwedgeLock instead of a Swagelok, and they're completely different concepts, but they sound like they ought to be the same thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1109,3790,154,15,Right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1110,3791,154,16,"And I wanted to see where the origin of this was.  It turns out that they had been using something similar to this for connecting thin wall tubes together, hoses and radiators. Go back to the Model A Ford, you'll see that they have a little device that raises a little bump in the tube so that when you put the rubber hose on there and clamp it down, it doesn't come off.  So that goes back a hundred years. The Swagelok design is basically taking that the next step and putting that tube through another plate and then rolling it out so that it stays connected.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1111,3805,155,4,Right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1112,3806,155,5,I just wanted to try to understand -- they make such a big deal about the Swagelok and how it's weld was designed and all that stuff.  I wanted to understand its origin.  Probably a bad habit for an engineer.  I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1113,3811,155,10,"Not necessarily. Other than the patent, did you try and go back and look and see whether Swageloks or the Swagelok design was utilized in any other commercial products that were available in the late '80s, early '90s?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1114,3817,155,16,"Yeah, I looked -- I noticed when Mr. Mills, Dr. Mills, whenever he was trying to design a new oven, he utilized the serpentine -- bent serpentine tubes and a Swagelok, and he was actually able to buy that from a friend that made those, and they seemed like they had been in the business for a while making that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1115,3824,155,23,"The supplier of those kind of tubes and locks had been in the business, in your mind, for some time?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1116,3828,156,1,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1117,3829,156,2,Do you know on what applications those had been used?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1118,3831,156,4,They were heat exchangers.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1119,3832,156,5,Okay.  So they were used in heat exchangers?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1120,3834,156,7,"Yes, they were.  I can get it in my notes, but it actually shows in Mills.  He had a report that he did for progress on the new heat exchanger design.  He actually shows that serpentine tube with the Swagelok design which he purchased from a company that makes those.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1121,3840,156,13,Do you know whether any commercial bakery oven manufacturer was offering a product that used a Swagelok as opposed to welded heat exchangers prior to the new offering from Hobart in the late '90s?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1126,3852,156,25,"Yeah, I don't believe the Swagelok design is applicable to boilers.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1127,3856,157,3,Okay.  There are heat exchangers used on some boilers?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1128,3858,157,5,"Well, a boiler by its definition has internal pressure, and if you were to use a Swagelok design, you cannot guarantee leakproof under high pressure.  So I don't think you could use that design for a boiler.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1129,3864,157,11,"Okay.  So it's only appropriate, in your mind, for potential use on a commercial bakery oven because you don't have high pressures involved in the heat exchanger?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1130,3868,157,15,It's not --,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
1131,3869,157,16,Vague and ambiguous.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1132,3870,157,17,I'm sorry.  It's not just a bakery oven.  Any application that would -- and it would generally be an air-to-air or a gas-to-gas heat exchanger --,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1133,3875,157,22,Right.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1134,3876,157,23,"-- because if you're using water or oil or something like that, you would be pressurizing it. And it is not a leakproof positive design.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1135,3880,158,1,So the Swagelok is going to be appropriate for heat exchangers where you're -- you're not going to have high pressure environments such as the commercial bakery oven?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1138,3888,158,9,Misstates the testimony.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1139,3889,158,10,"Yeah.  Anytime you have relatively low pressures and you don't have to have 100 percent leakproof, then I think it would be an application.  But it could be in heaters, other kinds of heaters, heat exchanger equipment. Recuperators, for example, that sort of thing. If you don't mind, I'd like to take a bio break here.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat

1145,3913,159,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1146,3914,159,9,All right.  Then it looks like you talked to Dr. Romig at Ponderosa for an hour and a half on August 23rd?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1147,3917,159,12,That's what it says here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1148,3918,159,13,Do you recall what that conversation was about?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1149,3920,159,15,"Yes.  I was -- I was discussing with him the combustion process, and I had done some calculations, which I think you have a copy of.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1150,3923,159,18,Uh-huh.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1152,3927,159,22,"Okay.  The calculations I have about combustion pressures are dated I think after this August 23rd call. Did you talk with Dr. Romig before doing the calculations, or you had done calculations and you were reviewing with him?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1153,3934,160,3,"I had done some premier calculations, either like back-of-the-envelope calculations to get some basic ideas of where I wanted to go with it. Then I called him up and I said, ""Here's what I'm doing, Joe.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1156,3945,160,14,Do you still have those back-of-the- envelope initial calculations or just the ones from later after that call?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1157,3948,160,17,"Just the ones -- everything that I -- I mean they were so awful, I just threw them in the trash.  But I tried to copy them over into a legible format, but they're the same calculations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1158,3952,160,21,"All right.  And then four days after that, you have a call, and it says an hour and a half. Read Galatsis & call. Do you recall -- so I assume that's reading Dr. Galatsis's deposition?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1163,3965,161,8,I think I called Rob.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1164,3966,161,9,All right.  And did you raise some sort of concern from the deposition you had read of Dr. Galatsis?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1165,3969,161,12,"No.  I just wanted to make sure I understood -- one of the areas that he's working on, or the area that he's primarily working in is the measurement of carbon monoxide and other combustion gases and their effects on the health.  So I wanted to try to understand that.  So I read his deposition to try to understand the difference between the various measurements and how they worked and what they meant.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1245,4182,169,17,"I was down here talking with Rob, sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1246,4183,169,18,Okay.  How long did you talk with the animators?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1247,4185,169,20,Probably 15 or 20 minutes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1248,4186,169,21,Okay.  What was the subject of the conversation?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1249,4188,169,23,"Well, I tried to explain to them what I wanted to show, and I wanted to -- they did have that picture where it showed the air going through the heat exchanger and starting out hot and getting cooler as it comes out and then the exhaust, and then the blue arrow that you referred to that would be the cross flow, that would be from the oven itself, and then I explained to them that I wanted to show a couple of things. We wanted to show the flow through the heat exchanger and then the convection fan and then how the air would go into the baking area of the oven. We talked about showing the leakage out of the door and basically just having some arrows -- some smoke coming out around the door. I also wanted them to put in the part where if you have combustion products coming out near the bottom of the door, there would be a great chance that you would pull those in to the inlet air, to the combustion fan. And those were the things that I wanted to be able to illustrate, and I wanted to show a before and after of the breach of the heat exchanger.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1250,4213,170,22,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1251,4214,170,23,So it took quite a while on a phone call to explain all of that stuff.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1252,4216,170,25,So I understand what you're telling them you want to see in the animation. Did you provide them any objective data of any type whatsoever?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1253,4221,171,4,Objective data.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1254,4222,171,5,"Yeah, like flow rate measurements or calculations or any sort of scientific inputs to use?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1255,4225,171,8,No.  My goal with the animation was to illustrate my opinions but not try to do it quantitatively.  It was more of a qualitative illustration of my opinions of what went on.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1256,4229,171,12,"So in terms of your work with the animators, were -- is there any empirical data whatsoever that you provided, or is it all qualitative and specifically limited to that photograph of how the gases flow through the heat exchanger?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1258,4236,171,19,"Yeah, it's qualitative in the respect that I was just trying to describe the basic idea. It's quantitative in respect to the fact that we have -- I was trying to illustrate the temperature drop as you go through various stages of the heat exchanger.  I --",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

1261,4249,172,6,Go ahead and finish your answer.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1262,4250,172,7,"Okay.  It's qualitative but not quantitative; qualitative in terms of the fact that you do get a temperature decrease as you pass through the various portions of the heat exchanger, and the -- and the -- I tried to illustrate whenever the tubes are breached at the lower end of the heat exchanger how then you would get carbon monoxide flowing into the -- into the bake chamber.  But I did not try to put a number on it.  I wasn't able to calculate the amount of gas.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1263,4260,172,17,"Well, I think you anticipated my question that I started to interrupt your answer with. So these weren't measured or calculated data; these are, ""I want you to show me what I would like to explain.""",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1264,4265,172,22,"That's right.  My goal, as I said, was to be able to demonstrate what I think happened once these holes came in the tubes and we started seeing combustion products being leaked out into the baking chamber.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1265,4271,173,2,"Okay.  Now, have you -- have you taken any measurements or done any calculations whatsoever about the mass flow rate or the other flow characteristics of the convection flow path drawing air from the heat exchanger and into the bake chamber so that, separate and apart from the animations, you have any quantitative understanding of that process?",q,MR.

1268,4286,173,17,Right.  Do you have any objective data that was measured or any calculations you've done similar to what you showed with the vent hood reflecting that flow path and how much and exactly what components of flue gas mixture would be circulating and entering the bake chamber?,q,MR.

1273,4300,174,5,Correct.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1274,4302,174,7,All right.  Have you obtained any objective measurements or performed any calculations designed to trying to quantify what you claim to be gas escaping the closed oven door?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
1275,4306,174,11,"Vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1276,4308,174,13,"No.  What I tried to represent in the animation was -- reflects the testimony of the people who had seen steam coming out of the door.  Ms. Lee.  I believe Mr. Gumbert talked about that in one of his depositions. Let me see if I can get my flow chart here.  Oh, here we go.  Make sure I know who all the players are today. And then of course Nigel Mills talked about having experienced seeing steam coming out of the door at various times.  So the animation just reflects what I understood was happening by these depositions.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1277,4323,175,2,Okay.  You understood what was happening when steam's injected for that approximately 15- to 20-second cycle?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1280,4329,175,8,"Okay.  From your reading of Mr. Mill -- or Dr. Mills, do you have an understanding of the pressure consequences of the steam process and the duration of that process with regard to this oven?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1281,4333,175,12,"I do have a certain amount of understanding of Mills.  He indicated that when you -- when you spray water onto these heated balls that they have in the oven that it generates a fairly large amount of volume of steam, and then that steam will tend to cause overpressure in the baking chamber. Not all that steam can go up the vent. They have a vent for that to keep from overpressuring the bake chamber, and then they lose some steam out the door, and which is probably the reason that they added better seals and some latches at the -- as a change order to the ovens.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1282,4345,175,24,Okay.  And did you have an understanding that the addition of steam is something that happens for less than 30 seconds on any given bake cycle?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1286,4357,176,10,Do you have any belief that there is a greater than roughly one atmosphere of pressure inside the bake chamber at any point other than this short period of time when that large amount of steam is introduced?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1287,4362,176,15,"I think there would be, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1288,4363,176,16,Okay.  Have you done any calculations or measurements to support that belief?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1293,4372,176,25,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1294,4374,177,1,Okay.  Can you point me to the page where you're talking about the increase of pressure within the bake chamber?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1295,4377,177,4,"Sure.  Well, I just kind of have to go through the document here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1296,4379,177,6,Sure.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1297,4380,177,7,"So the -- in -- and one of the things that's made me start thinking about this is in Joe's deposition, Romig's deposition.  One of the questions that was asked to him was, you know, what makes you think that the -- the combustion products are going to be forced into the baking area chamber, and what's going to -- and why wouldn't they just go up the stack, basically. And so I began to think about that, and I realized that -- that there is a basic physics mechanism to cause that, and I wanted to explore that by a set of calculations which I've prepared here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1298,4393,177,20,Okay.  And so the calculations you prepared is addressing the idea that combustion flue gas would escape the heat exchanger and enter the bake chamber; is that correct?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1299,4397,177,24,Correct.  And there would be an overpressure around the area where the tubes have been breached --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1300,4401,178,2,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1301,4402,178,3,-- that would tend to drive these combustion gases into the bake chamber.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1302,4404,178,5,Okay.  So the combustion gases are going to leave the breach of the heat exchanger and some of them will enter the bake chamber.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1306,4414,178,15,"Well, the bake chamber itself, when you have a breached heat exchanger like this, and the combustion -- the heater is running, okay, you will start to pump gas into the baking chamber.  As you do that, you will start replacing the air inside the baking chamber, and you will develop a small overpressure, because the pressure of the gas coming into the baking chamber is higher than the ambient conditions, which essentially are the case in the baking chamber, typically, normally.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,symbols

1313,4440,179,15,"I don't believe it has to overwhelm the door seals.  I don't think the door seals are tight enough to restrict some airflow out of the bake chamber. There's -- it's a big door.  Been my experience that when you try to seal a door that large, especially with temperature gradients, you'll have some leakage.  You won't have a complete seal. And so you can actually start to see combustion products leak out of the door at these leaking areas where they're not sealed properly without having a great deal of increased internal pressure.  A few inches of water will do it.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

But to the best of my knowledge and ability, I have looked at them all and tried to consider their effect on my opinions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1375,4657,187,24,"Okay.  That's fair and understandable. Sir, we talked about back in October of 2017 your inspection of the subject oven, and you've indicated to me that you've produced all your photographs and have not taken any notes at that inspection; correct?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1384,4679,188,20,I didn't perform any other test.  I suggested some additional tests while we were there --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1385,4682,188,23,Okay.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1386,4683,188,24,-- which we would agree on.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1387,4684,188,25,What additional testing did you suggest?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1388,4686,189,1,"Well, let's see.  We first started out, if I recall, testing it as it was presented to us without any modifications, and then we ran a couple of tests that way just to get the combustion products measured at the stack, out the output, and then we -- after a little -- a couple of tests, we -- I asked the question -- I think we all concurred that we should pull off the rubber line that goes to the pressure switches to see if that would shut down the system. We did that.  So we were basically running the blower, and when you pull off the rubber lines that go to the pressure switches, it senses -- it thinks there's no fan rolling, so it does -- it shuts down.  So we just started changing some variables to make sure that it would operate as we expected it to. And then at some point we decided to check and change the damper value, and we did that. We changed the gas pressure coming in, if I recall correctly. So we ran through a whole series of different tests, some of which I may have suggested, but it was a collaborative effort.  And so -- but we all had our opportunities to change as many things and run as many tests as we had time and storage in the computer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1389,4715,190,4,"Okay.  The first thing you said you did on that day was run it, run the oven without modifications. Can you describe for me the configuration of the oven?

1393,4727,190,16,I thought you said without modifications. But how was it presented to you?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1394,4729,190,18,"Well, you know, the -- I believe the air damper was set on 6 and the gas was set at 3.7, and this is from memory.  Hoses were hooked up.  I'm trying to think if there was anything else that was variable. I think that was it.  It looked pretty much like the manual initial setup for installation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1395,4736,190,25,"Okay.  Now, you said the gas is at 3.7.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1406,4760,191,23,"For the burner, yes, sir. Yeah, the initial startup, according to the installation instructions, would be to set it at 5, and the DROG2H was 5.5.  So I could be wrong.  It could have been 5 or 5.5.  I just for some reason remembered 6.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1407,4767,192,4,"All right.  Now, you said this was some sort of shop that refurbishes bakery equipment. Was it set up as if it were in a commercial bakery, or was this -- where was the oven itself?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1408,4772,192,9,"We were in a large steel building.  The building was probably 40 feet high and we were in a very large area, probably say 30 yards by 40 yards floor area, and there was no -- the stack pipe was not connected.  As a matter of fact, I don't think any of the vents were connected to anything. So we were basically running this oven, sitting in a big warehouse without being connected to an outside exhaust.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1409,4781,192,18,"Okay.  So you're in this big steel building with 40-foot-high ceilings, and if I understand what you're saying right, the flue itself was not connected to any external ventilation?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1410,4785,192,22,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1411,4786,192,23,And you're not aware of there being any ventilation for any of the output vents on the top of that oven?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1412,4790,193,1,"I don't believe there were any, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1413,4791,193,2,"Okay.  During the testing you were conducting, did any of you have carbon monoxide monitors or respirators you were using while you were performing that testing?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1414,4795,193,6,"No.  No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1415,4796,193,7,Were any ambient measurements made of carbon monoxide in the area while you gentlemen and Ms. Gill were performing that testing?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1417,4801,193,12,"So I understand that there's not a flue stack vent on the oven. Did you have the draft inducer or the stack fan that we talked about earlier set up somehow, or was it also not in play on the exemplar oven?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1418,4807,193,18,"It wasn't connected, best of my knowledge.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1419,4808,193,19,So you talked about changing the air damper value on the burner and also changing the gas pressure input. Were there any other variables that you changed during the course of the exemplar testing?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1420,4813,193,24,Not that I know of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1421,4814,193,25,"Other than observing the absence of any ventilation in connection with this oven, did you make any effort to assess or analyze whether or not the as-presented condition of the oven was as designed or not?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1422,4820,194,5,"I didn't make any -- I didn't do any experimentation to determine anything like that, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1423,4822,194,7,"Okay.  Now, you said there was no ventilation pipes. Was there -- was there a hood or a ventilation hood available on this oven at all?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1424,4826,194,11,"No, there was no ventilation hood.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1425,4827,194,12,"Okay.  Now, the damper change you talked about, that's just a -- that's a control that's present and available on the burner itself; right?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1426,4830,194,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1427,4831,194,16,Okay.  And you set that air damper where you want on the burner?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1428,4833,194,18,Yeah.  There's a picture of that on Page 15 of the installation instructions.  That would be ITW505.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1429,4836,194,21,Okay.  So how did you go about changing the gas pressure input as a variable?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1430,4838,194,23,"The technician that was given to us to run that oven, he had a wrench and he opened up, changed the gas pressure.  He had a device that he hooked up to it to measure the gas pressure coming out of the regulator.  So he reset that for us.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1431,4844,195,3,"Okay.  So he would just change the gas pressure and then had something that was measuring the pressure leaving the regulator or entering the regulator, which -- I guess it would be leaving the regulator if you're changing it.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1432,4849,195,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1433,4850,195,9,Did anybody record or keep track of the gas pressure measurements that were used as different variables?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1434,4853,195,12,"Joe, I think, and Mr. Guthrie.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1435,4854,195,13,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1436,4855,195,14,They took copious notes about the operation and the testing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1444,4875,196,8,All right.  And is there anything from within -- I'm sorry. Was there any of the exemplar testing data obtained that appears within the calculations that you have marked -- or that we have marked as Exhibit 7 or Exhibit 8?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1445,4881,196,14,"Let's see.  No, I don't think so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1446,4882,196,15,Okay.  Are you relying upon any of the test data obtained during the exemplar testing in support of any of your opinions?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
1447,4885,196,18,Vague and ambiguous.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1448,4886,196,19,Yes.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1449,4888,196,21,Okay.  What opinions -- for what opinions are you relying on exemplar test data and what specific test data?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1450,4891,196,24,"Okay.  The results of our testing indicated that there -- that when you change the air damper settings on the combustion, on the combustion combustor unit, that it changes the carbon monoxide reading significantly. For example, you have to kind of fine tune the inlet air damper so that you get a reasonably clean burn.  If you close off that damper, you tend to develop -- generate a lot more carbon monoxide. So that one of the things that I learned from the test was that these variables, setting these variables when you set up the oven for the first time, it can be very tricky to get a clean burning oven, and if you change any of the other variables, like the back pressure, for example, then the change -- then you will have a significant effect on the combustion products that are generated.  That's what I learned.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1451,4910,197,17,Okay.  So you say that changing the air damper settings can affect the carbon monoxide production substantially and it's difficult to sort of fine tune the inlet air damper. Were there baseline measurements taken of carbon monoxide production with the oven as it was presented?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
1452,4917,197,24,Vague and ambiguous.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1453,4918,197,25,"Yeah, I think I said that initially.  Our initial tests were only of as presented.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1454,4923,198,4,"Right.  And were there measurements taken, CO measurements taken in the flue gas or the bake chamber or anywhere else in that condition before you started changing things?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1458,4934,198,15,"All right.  So are you relying upon any quantitative assessment of the data that was taken during the exemplar testing, or is it the qualitative point that you've identified for me that changing the air damper setting can affect the CO production substantially?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
1459,4940,198,21,"Vague and ambiguous, argumentative.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1460,4942,198,23,"No.  What I'm relying on is that by changing the air damper settings and turning down from, say, 6 to around 2, something like that, you can see the carbon monoxide going up from maybe in the hundreds to maybe 5,000.  So I mean it's a profound change in the combustion product just by changing the air damper.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1461,4951,199,6,Okay.  And are those COAF measurements?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1462,4952,199,7,They are.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1463,4953,199,8,And where are those measurements taken?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1464,4954,199,9,"Actually, they're both COAF and CO.  And the measurements were taken about -- if I recall, about six inches into the exhaust stack on that oven.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1465,4958,199,13,"Okay.  So those were taken from the -- not the flue, but I guess into the top of the outlet at the top of the oven?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1466,4961,199,16,Yeah.  I believe the pipe stuck out maybe a foot or something like that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1467,4963,199,18,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1468,4964,199,19,And Guthrie put the probe about as far down into the outlet as he could.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1525,5109,205,8,"With respect to testimony that I read about a couple of our experts, there may be some questions that come up about -- or that I would have an opinion about, but the details of the effects on the human body is not, and how you measure it, and the difference between the different types of measurements.  I don't expect to be -- I would defer to others on that area -- in that area.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1526,5117,205,16,"Okay.  So what I've got, just so I know what the bounds of what you intend to talk about at trial are, what measurements do you foresee potentially discussing?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1527,5121,205,20,"The only measurements that I would probably get into is if someone asks me, ""Well, a short time exposure to 200 parts per million carbon monoxide, is that bad or good,"" and I would say, ""When it exceeds the certain limits, standards, that sort of thing.  That's my understanding.""  But it would be peripherally that I would have an opinion about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1625,5484,219,19,Or months or weeks or whatever?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1626,5485,219,20,The question is:  Could I estimate the date when the first cracks happened or came in to that -- those welds.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1627,5488,219,23,"That's the question, and I understood your answer to be you'd have to do additional work that you haven't done as we sit here today.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1628,5492,220,1,"Well, I believe that, you know, I can say that initial cracking probably occurred fairly soon after it started into use.  I would estimate no more than, say, a year before you started getting hairline cracks in there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1629,5497,220,6,"Okay.  Are you getting escape of flue products from the cracks in the heat exchanger welds immediately upon creation of those cracks, or do they have to evolve into I guess a geometric size and shape of some form before gas starts coming out of the pipes?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1630,5503,220,12,"What happens in -- first of all, this is normally what is referred to as low cycle fatigue, okay?  The failure of that mode is what we call low cycle fatigue. My calculations indicate that every cycle of this heat exchanger produced stresses that were greater than the ultimate stress.  That doesn't necessarily mean you get a crack on the first cycle, but it means that if you don't -- you don't go very many cycles until you start to fatigue the material and start to get an incipient crack. Once that crack initiates, it may not go all the way through the weld.  Typically, it does not.  So you're going to have more cycles happening until the crack goes all the way through the weld, and now you have a breach in the heat exchanger. Initially, that will be a small crack and you won't get much of an emission through there. But a small crack grows, especially it's going to start to grow faster because you have combustion products going into that crack and now you're attacking the crack on all surfaces. So initially, you're only attacking the inside of the tube, but after you grow a crack in it, now you're attacking the whole crack all the way through. So the question that -- what I would have to determine is -- I believe I could calculate the number of cycles to initiate or at least approximate that.  I could calculate the number of cracks to grow it all the way through. The thing that makes it more difficult is to determine how fast the gap grows, and then that depends on how much oxidation you're getting in the tube and whether there's a flame present at that point.  So it gets a little hairy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1631,5540,221,23,Sure.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1632,5541,221,24,"I was trying to make those calculations, but -- they're doable, but I guess to go back after this longwinded answer, I believe you will get crack initiation and crack propagation fairly soon, within like a year of operating it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1633,5547,222,4,"And I appreciate that.  You had told me that based on the calculations you did do you would assume within a year you're going to get crack initiation and propagation. My question, though, was:  Have you done the work to determine when you would actually start getting escape of flue gases from whatever crack is present at the weld?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1652,5610,224,15,"Yeah, I don't recall. Again, we have experts that specialize in making those measurements and were there.  I wouldn't venture an opinion in that area.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1653,5615,224,20,"Okay.  Is it your opinion that the condition of the heat exchanger got any better or any less cracked at the point after crack initiation began and propagated, or was it as bad as it was going to get in 2010 when they took it out of service?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1654,5622,225,1,"Again, I don't know that, and the reason is, this problem of cracking and carbon monoxide production is very interrelated.  As you've seen from our test, changing the amount of air in the burner airflow will change the amount of carbon monoxide that's generated so that as this crack grows, you change the air fuels mixture, and so you may be developing very high carbon monoxide at some point as the tube continues to fail and the gaps get bigger and bigger. So that's what I mean by it's interrelated. the carbon monoxide production depends on how much -- on the air-fuel mixture.  The more -- the more you change that, you can have very high variations in carbon monoxide production.  So that's why I can't answer that question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1655,5639,225,18,"Really, my question was:  Does the crack get any better or does it just continually get worse over time so that when it's taken out of service in September of 2010 it's as bad as it's ever been?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1656,5643,225,22,I would say the crack's not going to get well.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1666,5670,226,23,"Not really.  No, I -- well, first of all, the people here at ITW were -- they had like 70, 80 percent of the market, so they were the leaders in the market.  They were the predominant producers of ovens. Secondly, they seemed to me like they just copied their oven from another oven that was out there, so if they copied their oven from another oven that was out there, it wouldn't be much of a comparison; it would be comparing apples and apples and not apples and oranges. So therefore, I'm not sure that even if I knew the failure rate for a competitor's oven, I'm not sure it would be meaningful, because maybe everybody is using the same design.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1694,5766,230,15,Okay.  What is each aspect of the heat exchanger that you find is defective?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
1695,5768,230,17,"Calls for a narrative as reflected in Exhibit 6, vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1696,5771,230,20,"Okay.  Having designed many heat exchangers over the years, I looked at this design and I can see a number of things that are defective about it as far as the design goes. Number one, the -- and of course the most important is the use of dissimilar metals, welding them together when you're going to have a high heat excursion. Number two, using boxes on the ends of the tube.  When you run the gas flow into a wall, flat wall, you are -- you're losing a tremendous amount of energy.  You're dissipating the kinetic energy of the airflow through the heat exchanger.  It hits the wall and becomes a stagnation condition.  It has to reaccelerate through the next layer of tubes going the other way.  It hits that wall.  You lose pressure back and forth, back and forth. So your pressure drop to that heat exchanger is going to be much higher than it could be if you used some kind of a return bend.  Almost all heat exchangers have return bends rather than flat walls. The next point that was a terrible part of the design is that these tubes are inline.  If you're going to get decent heat transfer, you need to have staggered raise of tubes.  Staggered raise of tubes greatly enhance the air-to-air heat transfer between the heat exchanger and the two cross loads. You have the air flowing across these tubes coming from the -- from the oven convection, and then when you have inline tubes like this.  The tubes on the farthest side away from the air direction are going to be very ineffective in transferring their heat to the convection air. And then finally, the most important thing, probably, is that this heat exchanger is a safety component. In other industries, such as the nuclear industry, we often have a primary side and a secondary side.  Here the primary side is the gas going through that's heated.  The secondary side is the convection air flowing across there. The key to this heat exchanger is that you don't want to mix those two together.  You do not want to have combustion products going into the bake chamber so that the heat exchanger is a safety-related piece of equipment, and as such, should be treated as such.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1697,5823,232,20,Okay.  So let me first ask you.  You had a throw-off comment there that you've designed many heat exchangers. Can you identify for me each heat exchanger you've designed over your career?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1698,5828,232,25,"Sure.  I started off my career in the nuclear business.  I've designed heat exchangers for the Navy nuclear program for submarines and aircraft carriers. Next, after I finished my Ph.D., I went to work for Westinghouse as a consultant on the Clinch River breeder reactor.  Then I designed heat exchangers for sodium -- sodium heat exchangers. After that, I went and spent a lot of time in the commercial nuclear business designing heat exchangers. Then I progressed to the refining business and worked in the refining business designing literally thousands of heat exchangers.  Let's make it hundreds.  I don't want to sound too old.  But I had contracts with ARCO, other companies, refineries where I rated and re-rated all the heat exchangers in their -- in their refineries. What else.  Those are the major ones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1699,5848,233,19,"All right.  So the Navy program and Westinghouse, you were working with heat exchangers involved with nuclear reactors?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1700,5851,233,22,They were.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1701,5852,233,23,"All right.  And then in terms of commercial heat exchangers, you were looking at heat exchangers in refineries, primarily with ARCO?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1702,5856,234,1,"No, probably ten different refineries.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1703,5857,234,2,Okay.  And how are heat exchangers used in refineries?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1704,5859,234,4,"Heat exchangers are used in refineries to transfer heat from a hot fluid or to a cold fluid, and they call -- in some cases, they call them regenerators, because when you have -- when you produce diesel gasoline, it's often produced at high temperatures, 1800 degrees, and rather than lose that heat, you will go through a heat exchanger and cool the product, the diesel or the gas, down to a much lower temperature.  And you're using that heat to heat up something else that you would have in a reaction.  So refineries are very good about not throwing away heat.  Heat costs money.  And so basically, that's what heat exchangers are used for. In this case, it's very similar.  You're heating the heat exchanger with natural gas and you're using that natural gas heated air to transfer the heat to the bakery air.  So it's just a matter of using the heat -- heating value of the natural gas for baking bread.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1705,5878,234,23,So I want to go through the various defects you identified.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1706,5880,234,25,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1707,5882,235,1,"The first one was that the use of dissimilar metals in an environment of high heat excursion. In your mind, that's what led to the failure of the welds and the breach of the heat exchanger in this case; correct?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1708,5888,235,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1709,5889,235,8,"So that alleged defect is directly related to the failure mode of the heat exchanger, in your opinion?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1710,5892,235,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1711,5893,235,12,"Now, the second one you talked about was the use of boxes on the end of the tubes rather than a return bin type design, and the problem there was you have stagnation where the flow has to stop completely and then reverse itself, and that leads to a pressure drop at the end of -- or at the termination of each tube, essentially?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1712,5900,235,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1713,5901,235,20,"All right.  So ultimately, what you're dealing with, then, is the flue gas is moving through the heat exchanger under lower velocity or pressure because it has to stop at the end of each box?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1714,5906,235,25,And you're not -- you're not -- you have pressure drop through the heat exchanger so that you don't have as good a flow out the stack.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1715,5910,236,3,"Okay.  And the problem with that is because the pressure is lower and it's not moving as quickly, you're dissipating heat and you're losing heat, so it makes the heat exchanger less efficient?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1716,5914,236,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1717,5915,236,8,"All right.  Is there anything about the box ends as opposed to a return bin that in your mind facilitated the failure of the heat exchanger, or is it just an efficiency defect?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1718,5919,236,12,"No.  The fact that you're welding a tube into a flat plate which forms the box is the worst configuration. The flat plate is very rigid in that plane, whereas, the tube wants to expand due to thermal expansion, and so therefore, you get the maximum amount of stiffness preventing radial expansion as opposed to if you have a cylinder into a 180-degree bend, it wouldn't give you that.  Even if they were dissimilar metals, the two cylinders are much more compatible than a flat plate and a cylinder.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1719,5931,236,24,"Okay.  So the first thing we talked about was the use of dissimilar metals that are going to expand differently in comparison to temperature. This is a different aspect that looks at the geometry of the pipe coming into the box, and the stresses imposed by that geometry you're saying with a different shape of the return bin instead of a box, you would reduce the stresses imposed by that connection?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1720,5941,237,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1721,5942,237,9,"Okay.  Then the third item you talked about was the use of inline tubes as opposed to some sort of staggered matrix or configuration. Again, is that alleged defect, in your opinion, something that contributed to the failure mode of the subject heat exchanger or something that again just reduces efficiency?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1722,5949,237,16,"It -- I don't think it contributes to the failure mode.  I can't think of any way it would, but it will definitely reduce the efficiency of the heat exchanger.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1723,5953,237,20,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1724,5954,237,21,And probably make it larger than it needs to be.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1725,5956,237,23,"And then the last item you talked about was you view the heat exchanger as a safety component that -- and I guess, then, your opinion is going to be that you should make sure that that doesn't fail, or what is your opinion with respect to why it's a defect, given that it's a safety component?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1726,5964,238,5,"Well, it's a safety-related component. That means that you can't afford to have to breach that containment. You see it all the time in the nuclear business.  You have water with radiation in it compared to fresh water on the other side. You see it in refineries where you're cooling two different fluids, and you -- and they don't mix well.  You don't want to mix the two components.  Sometimes you can get an explosion if you do.  So all of those things.  It's safety related in that if you get a breach in one, it could cause an explosion or something bad could happen.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1727,5977,238,18,Okay.  Do you view automotive brakes as a safety component of a vehicle?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1729,5980,238,21,Are brakes a safety component?  Is that what you're saying?,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

1734,5990,239,5,No.  That's a different philosophy and a different design project altogether.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1735,5994,239,9,Okay.  And how is it different?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1736,5995,239,10,"Brakes are a wear component.  Just like an eraser on a pencil, tires on your car, there are many things, and they wear by abrasion, okay, abrasion.  Abrasion causes you to lose material on something. The heat exchanger doesn't have any abrasion.  There's nothing grinding material off causing material to be lost.  They should last forever.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1737,6004,239,19,"Okay.  Is it your opinion, then, that a heat exchanger that is a wear item or something that can fail within the service life of the product, that it is a defective product?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1738,6008,239,23,"Well, if it lasts for 99 years, it would be a very minor defect.  But it has to do with the life expectation and the consequences of failure, because the risk and the consequence of failure is one of the things that you have to take into account when you're doing design, and you cannot have a safety-related component that fails 27 percent of the time, okay?  It's unacceptable.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1739,6017,240,6,"Well, if it's something that is subject to stresses and is a wear item, as you've identified, won't eventually all of them fail if you -- under continued use?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1743,6028,240,17,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1744,6029,240,18,"So my question is:  If I'm looking at life expectations, you're expecting that product to fail at some point in time under continued use.",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1746,6034,240,23,"I think I said that those are examples of abrasions, abrasion failures.  I didn't -- each one of them is caused by abrasion.

So we've been talking about the heat exchanger and your analysis of how and why it failed, as well as the fact that once it fails, it's going to start releasing flue gases into the convection flow that will enter the bake chamber. And we've talked about your qualitative opinion that if you open the door of a bake chamber, the flue gas mixture that's present in the bake chamber is going to come out and you will be exposed to it because of the ineffectiveness of the vent hood.",q,MR.

1791,6182,246,15,"Okay.  Dwell time.  It turns out that when I calculated the average velocity of the air underneath the hood being drawn up by the fan, I get a velocity. And so if I -- I get one that turns out to about one mile per hour, very slow, and so if it has to go -- I get 1.6 foot per second.  So if it has to go from the floor to the top and we've got 7, 8 feet, it would take about four seconds to get from the bottom of the oven to the top.  That's assuming that it's all being pulled into the vent.  That gives me a dwell time of so long that I can calculate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1792,6196,247,3,"Okay.  And other than this idea that it's going to take four seconds for the mixture that's coming out, in your opinion, at the bottom of the oven and making its way up into the vent hood, have you made any calculations with regard to dwell time, other than this ballpark four seconds?",q,MR.

And under one of the things that they actually ask you to do here is in the initial startup to check the draft at the location of the pipe three inches below the barometric damper and adjust to minus .04 to minus .08 inches of water column. So what that tells me is that there's a very small vacuum that's in the stack that's generated by this draft inducer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1869,6464,257,11,"Draft inducer, yeah.  And the thing that struck me when I read that was that the amount of vacuum it produces is .04 to .08 inches of water. And so just to put that in perspective, that little 8 horsepower motor that you have at the blower, it develops somewhere between 1 and 1.4 inches of water, and so even if it's only 1 inch of water and this is .08, you know, we're talking about a factor of 10 or something on the difference. You're pulling air up with this draft inducer; you're pushing air up with the blower. Another way I thought about it is that if you want to know how much vacuum .04 inches of water is, think about putting a straw into a McDonald's and sucking on it until the water rises 04 inches, which is the thickness of a credit card.  That didn't strike me as enough vacuum to do very much.

1881,6516,259,11,"I considered that, yeah.  I thought about that long and hard, and one of the things that I concluded was that it takes a lot more -- you have to push a lot harder from the bottom of the heat exchanger.  You have to create enough pressure to cause the gas to go through the heat exchanger because it's ineffective as a blow area.  And so you get a big pressure drop through the heat exchanger. So if this little small vacuum up at the stack is trying to pull something from the bottom of the heat exchanger, the inlet area where the burner is, it's got a hell of a job.

1919,6638,264,3,It is my understanding that that's true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1920,6639,264,4,"Okay.  And I know you said there wasn't any ventilation present when you were looking at the oven in June of this year, but typically, would that ventilation that's exiting the top of the oven into which the overpressure vent is attached, would that typically be then ducted out to the roof to exhaust outside the environment of the oven?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1921,6646,264,11,That's correct.  That's my understanding.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1922,6647,264,12,Okay.  What's the purpose of the overpressure vent?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1923,6649,264,14,"Overpressure vent primarily is there because during the baking cycle, occasionally you want to call for steam in the bake chamber.  And when that happens, you have a water supply that sprays water on these steel spherical balls that are part of the -- part of the mechanism of the oven, and when you spray water on those balls, which are hotter than the boiling point of water, they flash into steam, and when you flash water into steam, you get a volume increase of about 998 to 1.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1924,6659,264,24,"Okay.  And so this is one mechanism of allowing that excessive pressure we talked about when steam's injected into the bake chamber to escape the bake chamber, other than --",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1925,6664,265,3,"Otherwise, you might overpressure the bake chamber and you could cause leaking out the door. In extreme cases, if you had a good enough seal, you could blow the door right off of it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1926,6668,265,7,Okay.  What would be the effect of the overpressure vent in the bake chamber during the remainder of the bake cycle when there is no steam being introduced into that environment?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1927,6672,265,11,"The only function that I would think it would -- or I could see that it would have would be that if for any reason the baking chamber pressure tended to exceed atmospheric pressure, then the excess pressure could go up the vent, and it would keep the bake chamber essentially at atmospheric pressure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1928,6679,265,18,"Okay.  And would you anticipate, absent the introduction of steam, any other mechanism allowing the atmosphere in the bake chamber to exceed -- the pressure in the bake chamber to exceed atmospheric pressure, given the presence of the overpressure vent?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

1931,6696,266,9,"All right.

1957,6781,269,16,"Well, based on my experience, the air exchange rate in these types of places is fairly low, fairly long.  It takes a long time to completely change the air in there.  I'm assuming that the air is essentially static whenever I made my calculations.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1958,6788,269,23,"Okay.  So you haven't done the analysis, but for purposes of the opinions you gave and the calculations you were contemplating, you were assuming essentially static air within the bakery?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1960,6797,270,6,"All right.  When you say ""relatively long,"" can you give me some idea of the sort of assumption that would be required for your, I guess, disregard of the HVAC characteristics of the bakery and the calculations that you would be contemplating?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1961,6803,270,12,"Well, I know the average airflow in any room due to HVAC is extremely low, if you take the average over the whole room. And I'm assuming that the people, whenever you open the door, the first five to ten seconds you're going to get a tremendous amount of high concentration so that the two what I call dwell times, the time that you would be exposed compared to the time it would take to replace the air with fresh air are long enough -- the difference is long enough so that you can assume essentially a static bakery atmosphere.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1962,6815,270,24,"Okay.  So the calculations you're talking about are just sort of on the magnitude of four seconds or whatever that we talked about of the gas getting up to the vent hood area, in comparison to how long it's going to take the entire area to exchange air; is that --",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1963,6822,271,5,"No.  I think you -- I didn't say four seconds of exposure time.  I said if you took the average velocity, it would take about four seconds, but that doesn't mean that you're going to actually evacuate that air out of the hood.  There still be would be a tremendous amount of the concentration of what was in the chamber around the oven, and so that might last for considerably longer than four seconds.  But I used four seconds as the average time it would take to get the velocity to bring the air up from the floor to the hood.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1964,6833,271,16,"So have you analyzed or -- I know you haven't measured, but have you analyzed how long you would anticipate flue gases escaping from the bake chamber to remain in the area of a hypothetical person standing in front of a door -- you know, you said four seconds, so it's going to be longer than that, but do you have any idea how long that it would be?",q,MR.

1972,6853,272,10,"-- CO, then that is what you're comparing to the amount of time it would take to completely change out of the bakery, and as long as that relationship is big enough, then you can assume stagnant conditions?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

1995,6939,275,18,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
1996,6940,275,19,"So that, you know, if we play that before the jury, they will be able to see how breaching these tubes will introduce combustion products into the bake chamber.

It's just going to be an overall depiction of what might occur as a result of the failed tubes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1997,6949,276,2,"All right.  And similarly, if we see it becoming more dense or turning more green, that doesn't mean in reality you're actually getting a greater volume or a higher pressure of the gases in the bake chamber; it's just ""I'm showing you the general process by which combustion products can enter the bake chamber""?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
1998,6956,276,9,"Vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, misstates the testimony.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1999,6958,276,11,"Well, just to clarify, I do believe that when you start the burner and you're having combustion gases introduced into the bake chamber, the bake chamber, if it's been opened recently and left open for some length of time, it might be more atmospheric air with a little carbon monoxide or combustion product, but over time, as you're continuing to burn, you will introduce more and more carbon monoxide, and the concentration of carbon monoxide in the bake chamber will tend to increase. And one of the kind of interesting things is, since this stuff is probably going to be hotter than what's in the bake chamber, it's going to force -- it's going to go up and it will force the cooler air inside the bake chamber out the vent here.  So it's possible to replace most of the air in the bake chamber with the carbon monoxide -- with the combustion products. So it has a -- there's a mechanism by which you can increase the concentration over time as long as the burner is working.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2000,6982,277,9,Okay.  Have you seen any testing data to support the idea that absolute concentration over time is going to increase as you allow the burner to continue burning with a failed heat exchanger?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2001,6986,277,13,"I haven't seen any test data to that effect, but I believe my analysis of how it would work is true.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2002,6989,277,16,"Okay.  And what you're telling me also, I guess, is this idea that you got a flue effect with the carbon -- with the combustion gases.  The mixture in the bake chamber that comprises combustion gases are going to migrate to the roof area and you're going to have cooler air displaced and pushed to the bottom?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2003,6996,277,23,"Yeah, relatively speaking.  The combustion -- when you're coming right off the combustion chamber, that's when you're going to have your hottest air, your hottest air products, combustion products, and we know that the design, according to Mills, goes up to 1600 degrees Fahrenheit.  They're designing for numbers up to 1600 degrees in his testimony. But let's just say they're 1400 degrees. We'll give it the benefit of the doubt.  I also believe that you're going to have an overpressure there forcing that hot air into the bake chamber, because I believe the pressure in the heat exchanger will be higher than the pressure in the bake chamber.  Because as you pointed out, the bake chamber is vented to the atmosphere, so it's going to maintain about atmospheric pressure; whereas, we know the combustor is going to increase the pressure.  So you're going to be blowing hot combustion products into the bake chamber. Logically, they rise to the top of the bake chamber, and as they fill the bake chamber, you're going to be pushing the colder air that might be more nearly atmospheric conditions out the vent, because it vents from the bottom.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2004,7022,278,23,"Because of the buoyancy effect, what effect, if any, will the action of the convection airflow have on the hypothetical stratification of air mixture within the bake chamber. Since you're constantly circulating that with the convection fan, how are you going to get the stratification you've just described?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2005,7030,279,5,"Well, that will have an effect.  There's no doubt about it.  But even in spite of the fact that you're pushing air around, you still can get a stratification due to the weight.  It's a weight thing. And I don't -- from what I can tell looking at these things and being inside of it, you're not going to have a uniform convection current everywhere.  And especially in the areas where it's stagnant, you'll get this stratification due to the temperature of gas.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2006,7041,279,16,"And would it be appropriate to refer to a buoyancy effect, I guess, of the combustion gases having this tendency to rise up to the top part of the bake chamber and force the cool air down low?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2007,7045,279,20,Definitely.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2008,7046,279,21,"Okay.  And would you expect, then, those combustion gases at the top of the bake chamber to, I guess, exert a positive pressure with the cooler gases down low likely having a negative pressure in relation to one another?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
2009,7052,280,1,Vague and ambiguous.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
2010,7053,280,2,I would think that the pressure differential is extremely small.  I don't think you can probably measure it.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2011,7057,280,6,"Okay.  As you open the bakery door oven, would the buoyancy effect of the combustion gases that are already up at the top of the bake chamber cause them to want to go up and out once you open the door and, likewise, cooler air would be flooding into the bottom of the bake chamber as you open that door?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2012,7064,280,13,"I think when you open the door, it actually creates its own draft.  If I -- if I go into a small room and I slam the door and the windows are closed, you'll find that that door doesn't want to slam, because you're trying to -- the door has a large area.  It's like a piston and it will actually affect the airflow in the room. For example, if I go to a closet, open it real fast, I can feel air being moved by the effect of the door.  So when someone opens the door to look inside this oven, the opening of the door itself will actually create a flow of air, and that's hard to quantify that, but it will tend to pull the gases out into the area where the person is standing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2039,7180,284,25,"Okay, good.  5.  All right.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2040,7182,285,1,"All right.  So we've got 13 pages of notes that include various figures and then 5B and 5C, there are some test data related to the analysis reflected in Exhibit 5; correct?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2041,7186,285,5,There we go.  5C and 5B.  Okay.  I'm on top of it here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2042,7188,285,7,"So would a fair summary of the opinion reflected in this work product be that the heat exchanger failed because metals with different coefficients of thermal expansion were welded together, and that resulted in stress and an ultimate failure of the weld joints?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2043,7194,285,13,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2044,7195,285,14,"All right.  And in your mind, the use of those different materials in this particular application presented a design flow or defect?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2045,7198,285,17,"Yes, it did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2046,7199,285,18,"Okay.  You say -- as we -- I'm going to walk through these, but on Page 1, you talk about the combustion gas being forced through the heat exchanger by a fan. And that's the burner motor that we've been talking about?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2047,7205,285,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2048,7206,285,25,"All right.  But they're also being pulled through the tubes with a draft inducer, although you don't believe it's at a very particularly strong suction?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

2056,7224,286,17,"Now, we're walking through this and I think you clarified some of this today, but I want to just make sure, since it's in your report, that I've asked you about it. You say that combustion is not likely to be complete and that's going to result in the generation of carbon monoxide, but am I correct that you've not done any work in this case to quantify the actual levels of carbon monoxide that will be produced by the subject burner under any specific conditions?",q,MR.

2071,7283,288,24,"Let me answer.  The bottom line is I believe that if these combustion products are introduced into the area where people work, they will be inhaled.

2073,7295,289,10,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2074,7296,289,11,"Moving to Page 2, you've got a single page of handwritten notes that comprises Page 2 of Exhibit 5.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2075,7299,289,14,I would refer to that as a drawing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2076,7300,289,15,"Yes, so it's a sketch of the heat exchanger.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2077,7302,289,17,"May not be the best drawing in the world, but I would call it a drawing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2078,7304,289,19,"Well, I will say your calligraphy is far better than mine, so I wouldn't complain about it. I do want to ask you, though, it says up at the top that this sketch was done October 26, 2017, and reflects Sheet 2 of 7. Do you know where the other six pages of notes are from October 26, 2017?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2079,7312,290,1,"Well, they're incorporated in this report, because when I did the calculations, I did them on like scratch paper, but I redid them and typed them so that they would be legible.  So really, everything that you see here would be something I copied from the original calculations which I took that particular drawing from.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2080,7319,290,8,"All right.  So in terms of substance, anything that was captured on those six other pages of handwritten notes you believe is reflected somewhere within the text or calculations that we see in Exhibit 5?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2081,7324,290,13,"Definitely.  I just basically sat down and -- maybe I'm just not smart enough, but I cannot type a report when I'm doing calculations.  I have to do the calculations and go back and type it up, because they're just too many ways -- I guess I'm just not good enough to do it on the fly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2082,7330,290,19,Were the other six pages of handwritten notes discarded at some point?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2083,7332,290,21,"Definitely.  If I don't, I get confused. And so after I type something up and make a report, I found that it's best to throw the other ones away, because sometimes there's two or three pages where I'll scratch things out and say that didn't work out and try this and try that until I get something that works.  So, yes, those are not -- not fit to be presented to anybody.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2084,7341,291,4,All right.  So there were likely changes or corrections or other revisions to the initial calculations that were done in handwriting that led to --,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2085,7345,291,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2086,7346,291,9,-- what we finally see as the final calculations and information presented in Exhibit 5?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2087,7348,291,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2088,7349,291,12,"Do you know whether you had considered any different analytical approaches, or were they simply corrections to the same, same approach?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2089,7352,291,15,"No.  As far as I know, there's only -- I would only know how to do this one way.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2090,7354,291,17,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2091,7355,291,18,And this is the way I did it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2092,7356,291,19,"And what we see in Exhibit 5 is the culmination and the end product after you've gone through and made sure that you've dotted the I's and crossed the T's, so to speak. All right.  The next page is Figure 2, and that's the PowerPoint that you created of the gases flowing through the heat exchanger.  I think we've talked about that enough.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2093,7365,292,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2094,7366,292,3,"So let's move to Page 4.  And you talk about the design flaw again, and you indicate: ""The tube is welded to the flat plate that forms the surface of the box structure using a fillet weld."" And I just want to ask you:  Do you know whether that's a fillet weld or a groove weld?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2095,7374,292,11,"You could call it a -- you could call it each, either, I think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2096,7376,292,13,What's the difference between the two?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2097,7377,292,14,"Well, a fillet weld is when you have two things -- normally two things joining at a right angle, and then you put a weld in there.  I recognize that these don't exactly join at a right angle, but it's a triangular weld. A groove weld is typically more of a square weld.  So I tended to call it a fillet weld. But I'm not hard.  If you want to call it a groove weld, that's fine with me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2098,7386,292,23,It is what it is and we know the welds that we're talking about.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2099,7388,292,25,Exactly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2100,7390,293,1,All right.  And you indicate that the weld failed at some point during the service life of the oven and allowed combustion gases to escape.  And here you say into the atmosphere inside the bakery rather than being exhausted out the flue duct. Do you see that language?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2101,7396,293,7,Which page are you on?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2102,7397,293,8,"I'm still on Page 4.  And you say: ""This joint failed in service, allowing gases from the combustion chamber to escape into the atmosphere inside the bakery instead of going out through the exhaust duct.""",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2103,7404,293,15,Yeah.  That's probably not a very well -- or a good way of stating it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2104,7406,293,17,"Well, would it be more accurate to say that it escaped from the heat exchanger into the convection flow that would allow it into the bake chamber of the oven?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2105,7410,293,21,"Yeah, and then eventually out into the bakery.  Yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2106,7412,293,23,Okay.  And then it's going to escape --,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2107,7413,293,24,"Ultimately, it does go into the bakery. So --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2108,7416,294,1,So it's going to go into the bakery when you open the door?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2109,7418,294,3,"Correct, that's basically the idea.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2110,7419,294,4,"Do you believe it's going to escape into the bakery through the seals of the door, given that we think that there's probably equal pressure to atmosphere inside the bake chamber?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

2124,7464,295,23,"I have not made that calculation.  It would depend on the relative back pressure.  Gas will always go to the easiest area, the least resistance, like everybody else. And so, basically, if it's less pressure, it drops and goes through the failed heat exchanger than it is to go up the stack, then more of it will go in the bake chamber. And quite honestly, initially, when you start having hairline cracks, I would say most of it goes up the stack, but whenever you start seeing a whole tube eaten away like this, I think more of it goes into the bake chamber.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2125,7479,296,12,"All right.  In terms of the analysis -- well, I'll come back. If you turn to the next page, Page 5, you talk about the designer understanding that materials had different thermal expansion properties. Are you following along with me?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2126,7485,296,18,Give me a hint where you are there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2127,7486,296,19,"Yeah.  You're down about halfway on the second paragraph on Page 5.  It says, ""It would appear that the designer was cognizant of the fact that there's a significant difference in the thermal expansion properties of the materials. Can you see that language?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2128,7492,296,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2129,7494,297,1,And the basis for your assumption that the designer was aware of the thermal expansion properties was essentially use of an expansion joint on the fire tube?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2130,7498,297,5,Let me just read the whole thing here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2131,7499,297,6,Yeah.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2132,7500,297,7,"""Presumably, the purpose of the expansion joint is to allow the carbon steel tubes to expand lengthwise independently of the stainless steel fire tube."" Yeah, and that's -- from that picture, you can see that here we have a stainless steel fire tube and we have carbon steel tubes, and they both connected top and bottom. If you didn't have an expansion joint in the fire tube, you would be forcing them to have the same relative deflection, okay, relative same deflection, and that would put a bending load on the box, so that they put an expansion joint there to allow the carbon steel tubes to expand more than the stainless steel, and that allows the -- prevents an axial stress from developing due to the difference in expansion. That's -- that was just -- I looked at that and said, ""Why did they put an expansion joint in there,"" and that's because you're tying carbon steel and stainless steel of the same length, so they figured that out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2133,7524,298,5,Have you seen any documents or testimony to confirm that assumption that that's what purpose the expansion joint was intended to serve?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2134,7527,298,8,I didn't.  I just looked and said that makes sense to me as an engineer.  I would do that same thing if I was trying to design this.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2135,7530,298,11,"Is there any other purpose the expansion joint might serve, other than the one you've assumed and explained?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2136,7533,298,14,"The only other reason I could think it would be there would be the combustion tube gets hotter than the other tubes, so that would compensate for that also.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2137,7537,298,18,Okay.  It might isolate the heat transfer from the fire tube getting into the front box and the other tubes?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2138,7540,298,21,"It wouldn't isolate the heat transfer. The expansion joint won't do anything for heat transfer.  It will -- it will allow that tube, the big -- how big is that diameter, 12 1/2 inch diameter tube.  It will allow that to expand and contract with respect to the tube in the stainless steel box and the carbon steel box.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2139,7548,299,3,"Do you know what the construction of the expansion joint is, what materials are used?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2140,7550,299,5,I don't know.  I didn't measure that when I was at the site.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2141,7552,299,7,Do you know why it might be wrapped in a fibrous ceramic material that would be suitable for insulation?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2142,7555,299,10,"Well, I would assume because it gets hot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2143,7556,299,11,"All right.  And then you go on to say that despite the apparent cognition of the different thermal expansion, it does not look like the designer appreciated or understood that the weld joints would experience high stress due to the use of different materials. Was that your conclusion?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2144,7563,299,18,I'm sorry.  Where are you reading that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2145,7564,299,19,"Yeah.  We went through that.  Right after you talk about the designer being cognizant of the fact that there are different coefficients of thermal expansion between stainless steel and carbon steel, you say that: ""The designer did not understand that the weld joint between the carbon steel tubes and the stainless steel box would result in high discontinuity stresses when the temperature of the heat exchanger was increased."" Was that your opinion?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2146,7579,300,8,"That was my opinion, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2147,7580,300,9,"Okay.  And that's -- and the weld joint between the aluminized carbon steel tubes and the stainless steel box, that is in fact where the subject heat exchanger failed; true?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2148,7584,300,13,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2149,7585,300,14,And that's something you believe that the designer reasonably should have known but did not?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2150,7587,300,16,Yes.  I think that was an error in the design process.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2151,7589,300,18,Okay.  You go on to describe a fatigue process with stress on the weld caused by cyclical heating and cooling leads to an eventual crack and then the crack is exacerbated by the flue gases that are escaping through it until you get a complete breach over time. Did I understand that language correctly?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2152,7596,300,25,"That's my understanding.  That's what I think happened, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2153,7599,301,2,"Okay.  And you've talked about that a little bit a couple times today.  You used the term ""low cycle fatigue"" and you referenced that I think one other time earlier today and you said the low cycle fatigue is being caused by the cyclical stresses imposed on the weld. How are you using the term ""low circle fatigue""?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2154,7607,301,10,"If you look at a fatigue curve for any of these materials, what you find is that it's usually a logarithmic curve and you have a vertical axis which is alternating stress.  You have a horizontal axis which is logarithm of the number of cycles. And if you have low cycle fatigue, you will find that you'll start to develop a crack within a few hundred cycles, usually, and that high cycle fatigue can take you all the way out to a million cycles without cracking. So the curve is -- again, it's a logarithmic curve that starts of high stress because you can take a -- for a few cycles, you can take a high stress cycle, but if you want it to last a hundred thousand cycles, you got to reduce that alternating stress cycle.  If you want it to last forever, you've got to have a very low alternating stress, and that's the nature of fatigue curves. And so anything that fails in the very early stages after a few hundred cycles, say, that would be a low cycle fatigue.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2155,7629,302,6,"All right.  But you haven't attempted to quantify and put a specific number of cycles on the failure for this particular design; rather, it's the idea that the stress is imposed by each cycle and above the ultimate yield strengths, so you would not expect it to last into the high cycle range?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2156,7635,302,12,"It won't last long, because each time you heat it up and cool it down, you are inducing a large strain. And it turns out that fatigue is actually more driven by strain than it is stress, and when you're doing fatigue tests to determine how long a metal will last, you typically use a strain test rather than a stress test, except for very high cycle like in an aircraft design.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2157,7644,302,21,"Okay.  And then we get back into this idea of the back pressure and the gas escaping once you have a breach of the heat exchanger, but, again, this ignores any effect or any potential effect by the draft inducer, based on your analysis that the draft inducer would not have an appreciable effect?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2158,7651,303,2,That's my opinion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2159,7652,303,3,Okay.  And did you do any testing whatsoever to substantiate your hypothesis that a back pressure would exist in the heat exchanger while the burner was firing?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

2164,7663,303,14,So is that a theoretical analysis but you haven't tested that?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2165,7665,303,16,"I have not tested it, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2166,7666,303,17,"All right.  The last thing obviously I want to ask you about is this suggestion that there is your opinion that there's a flame that existed at the gap when the carbon monoxide in the burner gas has reached a combustible air-fuel ratio and that would explain explosions in the oven. First, are you talking about there being alleged explosions in the subject oven?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2167,7674,303,25,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2168,7676,304,1,You're talking about other ovens or puffs or pops or whatever Dr. Mills was referring to?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2169,7678,304,3,"Well, there's actually been, I'll say, half a dozen explosions where they actually did severe damage to the door and blow out glass and stuff like that.  So there have been some pretty severe explosions which I saw in some of the documents that I read.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2170,7684,304,9,And have you seen -- and the explosions are in fact what the pressure switches were identified -- or were created to try and address; right?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2171,7688,304,13,"That was one of their reasons. Apparently, they were thinking that they were running gas into the ovens without the fan blowing and creating a large amount of accumulated gas which was actually going into the bake chamber itself, and when it got ignited, it was causing explosions, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2172,7695,304,20,All right.  And have you analyzed any of the individual incidents you've identified to determine whether that was not in fact what was happening in those vents?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

2174,7702,305,1,"I did not have the opportunity to analyze those cases because I don't have all the detail.

2175,7711,305,10,"Okay.  What would the source of the flame at the gap in the heat exchanger be?  I mean are you talking about the flame getting out of the combustion chamber and getting to the breach of the heat exchanger, or what's the flame at that gap?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2176,7716,305,15,"Well, again, I don't have any experimental data to back it up, but I looked at the damage that was done by the -- in the Albertsons heat exchanger, and it looked like to me that end of those tubes had been exposed to actual flames, just based on my experience.  They were oxidized in a way, they were curled in a way, and they appeared actually to have lost a considerable amount of the metal.  Completely lost.  It was somewhere in an oxidized way. So that was to me consistent with a flame impingement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2177,7728,306,1,"Okay.  Now, you said you haven't done any testing of that theory. Have you done any calculus -- or calculations or theoretical analysis to determine how the flame would get from the burner to that spot or how any other mechanism that a flame would be propagated to that location?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2178,7735,306,8,"The only thing that I would consider is that there was enough excess fuel so that the flame and the burner was actually filling not only just the combustion chamber, but it could have been a flame all the way down to where this breach in the tubes was. But again, that was just a -- my own thinking based on the amount of damage that was done to the tubes.  It looked like to me they were exposed to flames.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2179,7745,306,18,Okay.  So you haven't done testing or theoretical analysis to see whether it would be possible for the flame to get to that point; it's rather based on your assessment of the ends of the failed tubes?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

2200,7795,308,16,Second page is strength.  This is the ultimate strength.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2201,7797,308,18,Okay.  And the source of this graph of the strength of the metals was engineeringtoolbox.com?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2202,7799,308,20,"Correct, on the Internet.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2203,7800,308,21,"Okay.  And essentially, the outcome of that calculation and that reference is that the thermal stress in the carbon tube is going to be more than three times the ultimate stress limit at a thousand degrees; is that right?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2204,7806,309,1,"That's what I calculated, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2205,7807,309,2,"Okay.  Why wouldn't the carbon steel tube, each and every carbon steel tube that's attached to stainless steel, then crack and deform after a single cycle?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2206,7811,309,6,"Because they're ductile.  Carbon steel, especially at that temperature, is very ductile. It's just like you can take a paper clip and I can bend it double, and if I calculated the stress, that would be well above ultimate.  But it doesn't break. As a matter of fact, you would have to sit there and work it for a long time before you would actually break it. And that's the same mechanism here.  The ductility of the material at that temperature allows it to strain, but it doesn't overstress it.  It won't break.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2207,7823,309,18,Okay.  Is that the same explanation you would give for why you wouldn't get a failure at every single cycle with the hoop stress being in excess of the ultimate strength?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2208,7827,309,22,"Sure.  We look at a car after it's in an accident.  It's bent.  The stresses are way above yield if you calculate it using linear elastic methods, but they don't usually break because they're not brittle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2209,7833,310,2,Okay.  And that's why you don't end up with a longitudinal split down the carbon steel pipe every single time you cycle it?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2210,7836,310,5,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2211,7837,310,6,"You also on Page 10 calculate something called the stress intensity, and it looks like you basically combine the calculated bending and hoop stress values.  And you talk about that concept being intended to reflect the maximum difference in principal stress components. Do you see that language?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2212,7844,310,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2213,7845,310,14,Is it your opinion and testimony that calculating the bending stress and the hoop stress is the same as calculating the principal stresses?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

2216,7851,310,20,I just objected; vague and ambiguous.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
2217,7853,310,22,"Oh.  It turns that in this case it is, because there aren't any shear stresses. The magnitude of shear stress is very small. So the two components, you have a bending stress, which is in the axial direction, and you have a hoop stress, which is in the circumferential direction, and the absence of sheer stress, which I ignored.  Those are the principal stresses.  And since one of them is in tension and one is in bending, the stress intensity is the summation of those two stresses, the absolute value of the summation.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2218,7866,311,9,"Okay.  I think this goes back to the question I had, though. So the stress intensity on the inner radius you have shown as 114,694, and that would be with the carbon steel, and you note that that's four and a half times the ultimate strength of 20 -- almost 26,000, or the 25,900 we talked about?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2219,7873,311,16,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2220,7874,311,17,"So the four and a half times stress intensity -- I'm sorry.  With the stress intensity being four and a half times the ultimate stress for carbon steel is premised on this idea that the 25,900 ultimate strength for carbon steel applies both in tension and compression?",q,MR.

2228,7900,312,17,"So you get all these calculations talking about stress and the magnitude of stress over ultimate strength and all that, but what I'm hearing you say is once you yield it, really, strain is a lot more important than the stress numbers, just like the --",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

2252,7972,315,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2253,7973,315,12,Did you consider any additional constraints on the movement and stresses that might be imposed by this more complex structure as opposed to the interaction between a single tube and plate interaction?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

2255,7980,315,19,I don't believe there would be any.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2256,7983,315,22,"Okay.  Earlier when we were discussing your work with Solar Turbine, you talked about you can't isolate one piece; the whole thing operates as a unit. Why would the heat exchanger with the multiple tubes in not have some effect on each other in terms of their thermodynamic -- their stresses and expansions?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
2257,7992,316,5,"Misstates testimony, compound, argumentative, vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
2258,7995,316,8,"Well, the answer is very simply that if you go back to Page 2, my sketch of the stainless steel box, these -- these tubes are all welded into a flat plate.  That would be the top of the carbon steel box -- I'm sorry -- the top of the stainless steel box that you see I've got marked 24 inches wide. When that stainless steel box is heated, it will expand uniformly in all directions, okay? And it will -- and when a flat plate expands, it is very stiff.  Let's see if I can demonstrate. The bottom line is that a cylinder like this is much weaker in the radial direction than a plate is in the in-plane direction.  So therefore, whatever the plate does it will force the cylinder to do. So if the hole will expand or contract, since it's in a flat plate, that flat plate is much stiffer than a cylinder with a load in it. So therefore, you can isolate these tubes. There will be very little interaction between the tubes.  And so I only analyzed the one tube.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2259,8019,317,6,"Now, the radial displacement that you're talking about is the flat plate being stiffer, and you think that would isolate the effect of one tube from another. Am I right, though, that the plate is not just going to expand elastically without being affected by the stiffness of at least the individual tube that you're analyzing?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2260,8027,317,14,"That's true, and this analysis takes that into consideration.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2261,8029,317,16,Okay.  So how is the stiffness of the tube taken into consideration when the inputs that you were talking about were just the -- the differences in the thermal expansion coefficients?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2262,8033,317,20,"Just by heating up the whole thing.  You build a model and if you just increase the temperature of every -- of all the pieces, then when one has a differential motion compared to the other, that causes the stress.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2263,8038,317,25,"I understand it's going to cause the stress, but wouldn't the resistance of the tube to expanding at the same rate as the steel plate affect the rate at which the steel plate is expanding? It's going to resist that pull?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2264,8044,318,5,"Sure, and that's reflected in the analysis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2265,8046,318,7,Okay.  Where is that reflected in the analysis?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2266,8048,318,9,"Because we start off with the steel -- with the tube, a model of the tube, a model of the plate, and all we do is increase the temperature of these pieces.  I think I used a thousand degrees or something, Delta T, and whenever that plate wants to expand, the hole gets bigger, and the tube, the stainless -- or the carbon steel tube doesn't want to get bigger as fast, so the stainless steel pulls it out, okay?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2267,8057,318,18,Okay.  So the inherent strength or resistance of the carbon steel tube to being pulled is factored into your finite element analysis and calculations?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2268,8061,318,22,"Yeah, and that's essentially what I did by hand.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2269,8063,318,24,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2270,8064,318,25,"I started off on Page 6, for example, and I just made the assumption that the plate's much stronger than -- if I expand the plate, it will pull the tube out with it, and I calculate the differential motion and that gives me the stress in the tube.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2271,8071,319,6,Okay.  And that's the use of the Roark solution?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2272,8073,319,8,"Exactly.  And I think I came out with 80,000, 79,259, and whenever I ran it through the stress, I got 80,000.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2279,8087,319,22,"When I did the hand calculations, I didn't take into account the relatively -- relative flexibility of the plate.  I assumed that the plate was much stronger than the tube.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2280,8092,320,1,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2281,8093,320,2,"And I calculated the deflection of the plate, the hole of the plate, and I applied that deflection to the tube.  So I did not take into account the fact that the tube will pull the plate back a little bit.  And my assumption was, based on doing this for a long, long time, that the stiffness of the plate is much greater than the stiffness of the tube.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2282,8101,320,10,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

2312,8190,323,21,"And I think the last thing you indicated, though, one of your findings is that because of this plastic deformation that was not accounted for in your calculations or in your FEA, really, strain becomes the more important driving factor rather than the stresses that you've analyzed at some length?",q,MR.

2315,8201,324,6,Same objection; vague and ambiguous.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
2316,8203,324,8,It's the strain range that causes low cycle fatigue.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2317,8206,324,11,"All right.  Let's move on, then, and talk about the combustion pressure calculations that we've marked as Exhibit 7. First off, can you tell me generally what you're trying to show through these calculations?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2318,8211,324,16,"The -- one of the things that occurred to me was that if we're just comparing the pressure that's developed by the burner fan and looking at pressure drop through the heat exchanger, we're not really looking at the right conditions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2319,8216,324,21,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2320,8217,324,22,"When you are -- when you first start up the fan, there's no flame, and so you get a fairly small pressure drop through the heat exchanger because you have low flow.  You don't have a lot of volume of air going through the heat exchanger. When you have low flow, your pressure drops pretty small, and you don't see the resistance.  The pressure drop is related to low velocity. In other words, the more air you try to push through a given hole, the more pressure it takes to do it, as you can -- I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure that out. So I wanted to get a feeling for how much the pressure would increase whenever we kicked on the burner, okay?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2321,8234,325,13,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2322,8235,325,14,"And so when you first start up the blower, you just have ambient air going into the blower. Now, at some point, after you've left it on for 34 seconds or whatever, theoretically, you have cleaned out all of the combustion products through the heat exchanger and all the way up the duct, maybe, and now you kick on the flame.  You try to light this.  You turn on the gas.  You get your igniter, and all of a sudden you get a flame. You're putting 318,000 BTUs in this thing. That's a lot of energy, okay?  That energy has to go someplace; right?  And where it goes is in expanding the gas.  The amount of gas volume compared to the amount of air volume is pretty low so that you can -- for a first order of assumption, you can just assume that the air you have coming in is going to be converted to hot gas, so that now we get an expansion of that hot gas.  The gas will expand, and it expands a lot between ambient, which may be 70 degrees feeder air, and all of a sudden, that gas is heated up to 1200 degrees or something like that. And I looked up the methane plane temperature.  It's 3452.  Of course, we won't get that hot a gas because we're mixing air with it and it's not going to be complete combustion. So there's a lot of reasons we don't see 3452, but we will see a fairly high temperature. And we know that we have exhaust gases coming out up to 500 degrees, and that's after you've taken the heat out of that gas with your heat exchanger.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2323,8266,326,19,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2324,8267,326,20,"So I'm saying let's just assume that the gas heats up, and I -- for a first cut, I said, ""Let's assume it goes up to the max of 1600,"" which I believe Mills says is kind of an upper limit on his use of stainless steel.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2325,8272,326,25,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2326,8274,327,1,"So if that's what he's saying is the maximum, I'll start out with that in number. So the next thing I do there is say, ""Okay, what happens to the gas whenever heated up for an ambient to 1600.""  Well, it expands, and it expands a lot, okay?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2327,8280,327,7,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2328,8281,327,8,"And, you know, you've experienced that if you, you know, have a balloon or whatever.  Whenever it gets hot or cold, it changes its size.  This is really expanding the gas. On the other hand, whenever this gas expands and I'm trying to push it through there, it's got to have a higher velocity.  Because I've got X number of cubic feet of gas going through the same area, it's got to go through there faster. Well, the faster it goes through there, the higher the pressure. So when I put it under pressure, it actually gets smaller again, so I got two things competing.  The heating expands the gas, but if I increase the pressure, it compresses the gas.  So it's not a simple problem to figure out. So what I did was to go through there, and I used these basic equations of fluid flow.  One is mass continuity, M dot.  That's the mass flow rate. Row V1a1 is equal to Row 2 V2a2 on Page 1, and I know what the initial density of the gas is, .074 pounds per cubic feet, and that gives me a starting point. Now, and then I -- I look up the density of air, and that's on the last page, air density in pounds per cubic feet, at different temperatures. And so I applied it for different temperatures and different pressures.  So you can see from this, if you look carefully, you'll see that the density varies with the pressure in terms of atmosphere; in other words, if I double the pressure, the density goes -- goes up by a factor of 2.  If I triple the pressure, and that's one of the basic laws of physics, Boyle's Law or Charles Law or somebody's law.  So if it's a law, it's got to be right. So now I have the situation where I have -- I've got an idea of how much more volume I've got to push through there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2329,8321,328,22,Okay.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2330,8322,328,23,"That tells me I can calculate the new velocities.  And then I also know that the higher the velocity, I'm going to get a pressure increase because I've got to push harder to get the gas to go through. So now higher pressure compresses the gas, and I'll have a tradeoff, and so I want to use these equations to determine what that tradeoff is, and that's what I've done here.  I used those equations and I used something called Bernoulli's law. Bernoulli's law says that the rho v squared over 2g -- that's velocity squared -- plus the pressure, plus the head, is equal to a constant. So what it tells me is I can trade off static pressure for kinetic energy, and so then I used that equation, combined that with my other pressure ratio equations, and I find out that after I go through this that the pressure will be the ratio -- will increase by the ratio of the two velocities, the velocity before I pressurize -- before I burn it, and then the pressure with the velocity after the combustor turns off. And the whole point of doing this is to find out whenever I hit the -- turn on the gas and I start blowing hot air through this thing, am I going have a higher pressure at this failed area than I would before, and it turns out it's a linear relationship with the velocity. So, yes, the answer is I will have a much higher pressure at those failed tubes when I'm burning it than I will whenever I don't have combustion going on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2331,8356,330,5,Okay.  And how does that factor in to your opinions about the -- I guess the effects of the breach in the heat exchanger?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2332,8359,330,8,"Okay.  One of the questions that's come up is here we have a situation where we hit -- we hit the burner so the gas comes on, and now we're running hot gas through there. The pressure at those breached areas will be much higher than it would be if I was just running ambient air through there. So now I'm going to force air into the bake chamber, and that pressure is significantly higher, so I will increase the pressure in the bake chamber because I'm forcing a lot of the combustion products into the bake chamber and they're going in at a much higher pressure. So now I'll see an increase in pressure in the bake chamber, okay, and I will also double up more combustion products into the bake chamber, okay?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2333,8376,330,25,All right.  So you -- go ahead.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2334,8378,331,1,"And now, all of a sudden, the oven says I don't need any more heat for a while.  It turns off. After some number of seconds, the electricity to the -- to the burner is turned off, the fan stops. But now we still are pulling air through the duct, okay?  We've got our duct fan up there pulling air. But -- but when that happens, you have much lower pressure at the breached area, okay?  So you may be getting air in there, but it's not going to be pumping as much fresh air into the bake chamber as you were pumping in whenever you were burning, when you had the burner on.  And that's what I'm trying to figure out. So it turns out that due to my calculations and in my opinions here, when you hit the burner sort of like an afterburner on a jet engine, all of a sudden you get a lot more pressure, the combustion products are going to be forced into the bake chamber.  You will actually see an increase inside the bake chamber of pressure, okay, because it can't escape out of the vent now fast enough.  And so we -- and so we will see leakage and whatever.  And now when we turn off, the pressure drops.  That's my conclusion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2335,8402,331,25,"Okay.  Let's go through some of this.  I thought we had gone through some of this before, but let's go through it again. So the gist is that when you turn on the burner, you heat up the gases, and so you're going to increase the pressure of the combustion gases as they're going through the heat exchanger --",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2336,8410,332,7,"No, first of all, you increase the velocity.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2337,8412,332,9,"Right, the velocity.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2338,8413,332,10,"And when you start trying to force more mass through the same area, you're going to have more pressure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2339,8416,332,13,So you're going to make it more likely for the combustion gases to leave the heat exchanger through the breach because they're coming through at a higher pressure?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

All of a sudden, when it hits the wall, it has to stop, okay? And I can use Bernoulli's equation, as I did down here on Page 2, to calculate what the pressure would be when I have no velocity, and that is the stagnation pressure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2430,8739,344,24,Okay.  So that's the pressure at the point where the velocity of the gas drops to zero?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2431,8742,345,1,"Correct, before it turns around and goes the other way.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2432,8744,345,3,"And by looking at the gas at the stagnation pressure, you simply -- you're able to calculate the comparative pressure relationship because you eliminate the velocity pressure?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2433,8748,345,7,"I know that at the point where these tubes are failed, you're essentially at zero velocity, because the air has to stop going to the left and go back to the right.  So it has no velocity, or very little velocity.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2434,8753,345,12,"Okay.  And by eliminating the velocity pressure, you can make a direct comparison of the pressure between the two gases?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2435,8756,345,15,Exactly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2436,8757,345,16,"Okay.  This idea of the higher pressure heated gases flooding the bake chamber with a volume that's going to overwhelm the overpressure vent, is that impacted at all on the size of the breaches in the heat exchanger, the gaps that are present?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2437,8762,345,21,"Of course.  The bigger the gaps get, the more pressure.  The more gas you'll be pumping into the bake chamber, the more overloaded you'll get and you'll start to see a pressure increase.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2438,8766,345,25,All right.  Have you accounted for the gaps anywhere in the hypothetical that you gave me that the difference in pressure would result in the bake chamber actually becoming overpressurized?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2439,8771,346,4,I'm sorry.  I don't understand the question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2440,8773,346,6,Yeah.  I guess it goes back to what I asked you earlier:  Have you done any kind of volumetric analysis to see how much combustion gas would be pushed into the combustion chamber under any set of conditions?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2441,8778,346,11,Not at this time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2446,8791,346,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2447,8792,346,25,All right.  And is it your opinion that the vent hood is going to be effective at capturing any percentage of the gas mixture escaping the chamber when the door is opened?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer

2469,8842,348,23,All right.  So your assumptions or your calculations were made under the assumption that there was an 800 CFM fan attached to the vent hood; is that right?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2470,8847,349,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2484,8878,350,7,Yeah.,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2485,8879,350,8,"I don't have a number for that, but it doesn't matter on my calculations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2486,8881,350,10,Have you done any testing of a connected vent hood to an 800 CFM fan to see if there is a localized cone of suction?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2487,8884,350,13,"Yes -- no, I haven't done any testing, but one thing I can tell you is that the hood as designed, in my opinion, is pretty much worthless.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2488,8887,350,16,"I know you're telling me that, but I'm trying to find out what the basis for that opinion is.",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2489,8890,350,19,"Well, there's a couple of bases. First of all, you have a very low amount of air that you're moving through the vent and in the best conditions. Secondly, I've designed -- I've designed hoods before, and I don't think this hood design is -- from an engineering standpoint, it appears to be very poor. It looks like to me from all I can figure in the ones that I've seen that it's open underneath the hood. The way you design a hood is that you have a fan causing a draft.  Then you put a flat plate inside the hood that only has about an inch gap all the way around.  And by doing that, you increase the velocity around the edges of the hood to what we call the capture velocity.  So all the fumes that would come up under the hood would be sucked into the hood because they couldn't get out without passing through the capture velocity. If you have a hood that just has a big opening up there with no plate in it to increase the airflow at the periphery, you don't capture very much of the fumes, they'll go around there, because the average flow velocity is 1.6 feet per second, which is about one mile per hour.  I walk three miles an hour, at least, so that's about a third of the walking speed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2490,8919,351,22,"So the 1.6 feet per second or 1.09 mile per hour, that's basically what you're drawing with the suction from the fan itself; right?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2491,8922,351,25,"Over the whole area of the vent, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2492,8924,352,1,"Okay.  Have you taken into account at all the escape velocity of the gas, that high pressure gas that's at the top of the oven as you open the door?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2493,8928,352,5,"I don't know what you mean by the ""escape velocity.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2494,8930,352,7,"Well, when you open the door, am I correct that the hot gases at the top of the bake chamber are going to want to move outward and upward?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2495,8933,352,10,"Yeah, all of the gas is in the bake chamber, not along the top ones, but they'll all want to move outward and upward. When you open the door, you will cause a partial vacuum, and that will pull the gases out into the bake area around the oven.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2496,8939,352,16,"Okay.  Have you calculated how fast the gases are going to be exiting the oven because of either the suction you're creating or the vacuum you're creating when you pull the door open, or just their natural tendency to go out and up?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2497,8944,352,21,"I have not calculated that, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2498,8945,352,22,Okay.  Wouldn't that be additive to the suction of the fan in terms of what goes into the exhaust and what doesn't?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2499,8948,352,25,Not necessarily.  It could bypass the fan altogether.  The fan suction is so low that you're not going to get much help out of the air velocity.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2500,8952,353,3,"Okay.  If you have an 800 cubic foot per minute fan, what's that mean in terms of the amount of air that's being removed by that fan?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2501,8955,353,6,"800 cubic feet every minute. So what I did was to calculate how much for that given area, 1 foot deep, what would be -- how long would it take to evacuate that, and that gives you that for every foot, it would take that long to pull up that much air.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2502,8961,353,12,What's the volume of the bake chamber?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2503,8962,353,13,I forget.  It's pretty big.  It's about 5 by 4 by 6.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2504,8964,353,15,About 150 cubic feet?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2505,8965,353,16,"Yeah, I would say 150 cubic, a reasonable number might be.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2506,8967,353,18,All right.  What's your basis for assuming a linear gradient for the escape of the gas from the -- the gas mixture from the bake chamber once the door is opened?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2507,8971,353,22,"Well, I know the velocity at the top because I calculated it.  I know the velocity at the bottom is zero, because you can't get any flow in that direction, and so I just assumed linear.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2508,8976,354,1,What's the basis for assuming it's linear as opposed to some other relationship?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2509,8978,354,3,"Just based on experience, it's a reasonable assumption.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2531,9051,356,24,"Generally speaking, if you're designing a hood like I used to do for the steel businesses in Pittsburgh and stuff, you want to create a high airflow around the periphery and generate capture velocity so that as the fumes work their way out, it will suck them up under the hood.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2546,9098,358,19,"All right.  Now, the stagnation pressure assumption that you talked about, it's basically the gas coming in, it has to stop when it gets to the back wall of the box, and then so it's essentially -- the velocity of the gas is still at zero when it gets to the opening where the breach between the tube and the box is; is that accurate?",q,MR.

It will turn, but you see, the flow area of the box is a lot bigger than the flow area of the tube. So that velocity as it turns will be very low, and so you'll still have a higher pressure. That's what's driving it into the tube going the other way and accelerating down the other side. The other side will hit another wall and be sucked into the tube up there and back and forth. That's what I'm assuming.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

So he tended to be in the -- very knowledgeable about what was going on in that group.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2573,9200,362,17,"Gumbert was the manager of the -- of the support group.  And actually, he seemed to have a very large role in the company, to me.  He had a number of people working for him, and he was responsible for making sure that the service department was providing support for all of their 2500 ovens out in the field.  He seemed like a very nice -- a good guy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2574,9208,362,25,"You understood he was in the service end, though; he was wasn't a designer?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2575,9211,363,2,"Oh, correct.  He was in the service business.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2576,9213,363,4,All right.  You cited a couple of times to some issues with a manufacturing supplier called FarWest?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2577,9216,363,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2578,9217,363,8,Do you know whether FarWest had anything to do with the heat exchanger that was in the subject oven?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2579,9220,363,11,"My understanding, that they didn't make these ovens.  They came on board afterwards.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2581,9223,363,14,These ovens were made in their Canadian plant.  The heat exchangers were.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2582,9225,363,16,"Okay.  Now, you talked about the design hierarchy in a number of different places and sort of this idea of eliminating hazards or guarding against them or warning. Are you familiar with that reference?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2583,9230,363,21,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2584,9231,363,22,All right.  Is it your belief that that methodology is applicable to every identifiable hazard for a given product?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2585,9234,363,25,It's applicable to every identifiable hazard.  Is it applied to every identifiable hazard? That's a different question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2586,9238,364,3,"Is there any product that you cannot identify a hazard, an existing hazard?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2587,9240,364,5,"Well, there are probably hazards out there that you haven't thought of, but if you do a risk assessment of a product, you should be able to identify most all of the probable hazards that it would see in its lifetime.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2588,9245,364,10,"All right.  And the point of a risk assessment is not only to consider the hazard, but the likelihood of it occurring and the consequence of it occurring; right?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2589,9249,364,14,That's basically what a risk assessment does.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2590,9251,364,16,All right.  Because a hazard can be anything that can hurt you?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2591,9253,364,18,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2592,9254,364,19,All right.  Is there a hazard to allowing automobiles to travel faster than 5 miles per hour?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2593,9256,364,21,There's a hazard to allowing them if they go over 5 miles an hour.  There's also a hazard for them 5 miles an hour or less.  It all depends on how you look at it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2594,9260,364,25,Is it possible to put a governor on the vehicles or enforce cars to require smaller engines so the vehicle is not capable of going more than 5 miles an hour?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2595,9265,365,4,It's possible.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2596,9266,365,5,"Okay.  You wouldn't mandate that that's required under the design hierarchy to address that hazard, though, would you?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

2598,9273,365,12,"I agree there's some fundamental misunderstanding of when that's applied, but...",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2599,9275,365,14,"No, there's also a risk benefit analysis that has to be applied to these things.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2600,9277,365,16,Okay.  Would you agree with the concept that the design hierarchy should be followed to eliminate any hazard that it creates an unreasonable risk of harm from a product?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2601,9281,365,20,"Well, I think the design hierarchy should be followed for all products.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2602,9283,365,22,I agree it's for all products.  I'm talking about the type of risk or harm or hazard posed by the product. You apply the design hazard -- you apply the design hierarchy to get the product to where it's reasonably safe?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat
2603,9290,366,3,"Objection.  It's argumentative and misstates.  It's vague, too.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
2604,9292,366,5,"Your question -- in your question you use the term ""reasonably safe."" That's -- that's where you have a subjective decision to make.  And you also mentioned the term ""consequence."" In the case of risk and this design hierarchy, consequence is probably the most important. Even if it's a low risk, a low probability of it occurring, if it's a high enough consequence, you have to consider it in your design, and certainly a death due to carbon monoxide poisoning is possible.  Certainly should be considered in the design hierarchy, in my opinion.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2605,9306,366,19,Do you know whether any of the plaintiffs died due to exposure to carbon monoxide?,q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2606,9308,366,21,It's my understanding they haven't died yet.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2607,9310,366,23,"Do you know whether -- well, you've already indicated you're not going to be talking about the expected health risk posed by various levels of carbon monoxide intoxication; correct?",q,MR. CROSS,start_answer
2608,9315,367,2,That's outside of my expertise.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2609,9316,367,3,All right.  You did indicate that there's an understanding that a -- a balancing needs to be applied on design decisions as well as general acknowledgment of the design hierarchy; correct?,q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

2613,9325,367,12,"Well, there's always a balance.  You -- as you said, I wouldn't want to reduce the speed of cars to 5 miles an hour to prevent any injuries or deaths.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2614,9330,367,17,"You've got to make sure that the consumers can afford what you're offering, that it's providing utility, and you've got to look at things like durability and serviceability and a whole host of costs when coming up with design decisions; isn't that true?",q,MR. CROSS,start_chat

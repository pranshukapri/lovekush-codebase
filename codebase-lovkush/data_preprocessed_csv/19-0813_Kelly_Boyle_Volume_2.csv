941,1981,228,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
942,1982,228,17,What does that mean?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
943,1983,228,18,It's a body of work that Juan Gomez leads that is literally just what it says.  What -- how much does it cost to service the business.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
944,1986,228,21,"And maybe if you can just put a little more color on that.  When you say cost to service the business, what business is this referring to?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
945,1989,228,24,"So supply chain is a service to our retail business.  If you don't understand how much your services are costing the business, it's very difficult to understand your impact, where do you get savings, where is there opportunity.  And as I stated before, our systems historically haven't been very accurate.  And so this is a large body of work to go after being more accurate on costs.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
946,1998,229,7,Got it.  So this is the cost of the supply chain to provide the supply chain services to Walmart overall; is that accurate?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
947,2001,229,10,Yes.  And I would -- I -- your definition of supply chain?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
948,2003,229,12,"It's a great question.  I'm -- I was using your word, so what would you -- is there a better, more accurate description than supply chain to refer to the costs to serve that are at issue in this email?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
949,2007,229,16,"So without getting too complex, often, when a silo within a business function operates not holistically, it can make poor business decisions.  Cost to serve really encompassed a fully landed cost across multiple functions of moving product across the entire network.  So in our world, some of those things might not be referred to specifically as supply chain but it would be moving the product.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
950,2015,229,24,Fair enough.  And did this relate to fresh or did it relate to a larger part of the business than just fresh?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
951,2019,230,2,"So cost to serve is for everything.  I believe this, as I read it, talks about maybe starting with Fresh because it's small.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
952,2022,230,5,"Okay.  And the second -- actually, the third paragraph of this email talks about the $450 million opportunity to tackle.  Is that Fresh related?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_chat

974,2054,231,11,"So I really -- I'm a staff function that has the ability to influence.  My only direct accountability is that operational piece.  And then I develop capabilities that are actually executed amongst all the other functions, so that's a difficult question to answer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
975,2060,231,17,"I think I understand it.  When you say the operational piece, does the operational piece relate directly to Fresh produce or no?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer

1041,2172,235,25,"So as it states in here, I need to provide a business case, I think it says, to the SteerCo, which would then explain to them how much money we're spending, what the value would be, based on the activities that we are proposing to do on the deliverables.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1042,2179,236,6,Got it.  So your understanding is this was just about the business case for continuing the work with Zest as opposed to the business case or a ROM model for implementing Zest?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
1043,2183,236,10,Which is why I called it short-term pricing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1499,3052,269,21,"Yes.  So this is not even, probably, about five months into Greg Smith's tenure.  We were on a trip on the West Coast.  I had just been given perishable consolidation, which is a project that is run out Corinne.  I did not start it.  I did not establish it. I did not deploy it.  But it was a mess, and they gave it to me because it needed end-to-end management. I took it on probably a couple of months before this.  Greg was new.  He wasn't aware of it.  We went to the DC.  It became a very contentious point. There were two VPs in the room that had initiated it and led it.  They did not speak up nor did they own what had happened previous to me getting it.  It was perceived in that meeting that the whole project had been a mess because of my management.  There were three -- they weren't VPs.  They were SVPs.  They do not work with Walmart anymore. That was the situation.  It was not appropriate for me to address it there given the level of people that were there and leaving me hanging.  Kath was very aware.  She understood it.  That's what this is referring to.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1501,3077,270,20,"Not in this situation.  Because of where the project was, it didn't have data.  It didn't have a business case.  And he kept asking those questions, which are very important for a well-run project.  And I had to say no.  And the two gentlemen who had started the project and didn't have that information were not forthright, given that six months in, that was their EVP and direct supervisor, and so I was left out to hung -- hang.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1502,3087,271,4,And the EVP there was Greg Smith?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer

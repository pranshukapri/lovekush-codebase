I will be happy to let you take a break. I would also ask that you keep all of your responses verbal because the court reporter cannot take down nods of our head or shrugs of our shoulders.

22,287,9,24,"Guess what, if you spelled it wrong, none of us will ever know.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
23,290,10,1,"Well, I had to think because we got bought out by another CPA firm.  I was only with them for a very short time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

29,304,10,15,Since January of 1999.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
30,305,10,16,"And tell me, while you were at those two CPA firms, what were you doing there?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
31,307,10,18,"Essentially the same thing that I'm doing now for Nationwide, in-house for Nationwide, I was doing as an independent contractor for various insurance companies including Nationwide.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,312,10,23,"And before January of 1999, what were you doing?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
33,314,10,25,Same thing.  I was doing forensic accounting for a firm out of Los Angeles.  It was called RGL Gallagher.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,318,11,3,And how long were you there?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
35,319,11,4,"Well, I was with them since 1997.  They started out as Campos and Stratus. I was with them since 1990, May of '90.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
36,322,11,7,Was that also in the capacity of a forensic accountant?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
37,324,11,9,It was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
38,325,11,10,"Before 1990, were you employed?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
39,326,11,11,I was in school.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

45,334,11,19,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
46,335,11,20,Okay.  And have you ever sat for a CPA exam?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
47,337,11,22,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
48,338,11,23,And did you pass it?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
49,339,11,24,"I passed -- when I took the exam, it was a five part exam and I passed certain parts at different times.  I did not pass them all at one time to complete the exam.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
50,344,12,3,"All right.  So as we sit here today, you are not considered a CPA?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
51,346,12,5,I am not a CPA.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,347,12,6,And have you taken any other courses after you left the University of Arizona related to accounting or forensics?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
53,350,12,9,"Yes.  Well, I'm a Certified Fraud Examiner.  I've been a CFE for a number of years since 2005, I believe.  I take regularly ongoing continuing education courses related to fraud and fraud examination.  Those typically center around the accounting aspects of fraud and fraud examination.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
54,357,12,16,"And your CFE, what did you have to do to obtain that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
55,359,12,18,Take an exam.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,360,12,19,"Is that a written exam, an oral exam, or a combination?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
57,362,12,21,It's a written exam.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
58,363,12,22,"And who is the, like, sponsoring agency or the group that --",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
59,365,12,24,"The association is Certified Fraud Examiners, I believe, out of Austin, Texas.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,369,13,2,Did you have to just take that exam or were there preparatory courses that you had to pass in order to take the exam?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
61,372,13,5,"Well, there was a preparatory exam course that you had to take, but you also needed to fulfill the experience requirements. Based on the years of service and the type of accounting practice that I was in, it qualified me for the experience requirement to sit for the exam.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
62,379,13,12,All right.  And have you ever testified as an expert in court at any time?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
63,381,13,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
64,382,13,15,And can you tell us how many times.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
65,384,13,17,"This is just through deposition testimony.  I haven't testified in court.  So I think it was, maybe, four or five.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
66,387,13,20,And do you remember the names of any of the cases?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
67,389,13,22,I don't as I sit here today.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,390,13,23,Did you maintain copies of the -- do you have copies of the transcripts from any of those depositions?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
69,394,14,1,"No, I do not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
70,395,14,2,Do you remember what courts they were in?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
71,397,14,4,"I think one of them was Arizona State Court, and I think there might have been a Federal Court case as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
72,400,14,7,What were the general topics that you were testifying about in those cases?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
73,402,14,9,"It was with regard to economic damages such as loss of income -- I'm trying to think.  I think one of them might have been an employee dishonesty case.  But, in general, most of them have been regarding the loss of income business interruption aspects.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,408,14,15,"Okay.  On a day-to-day basis or monthly basis when you're at Nationwide, can you tell us, like, how many forensic examinations are you conducting just on a routine basis?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
75,413,14,20,"Sure.  Our goal is to do about 26 claims a month, which is about 300 a year. Typically allowing for vacations and stuff.  We pretty much try to stick toward that goal.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,417,14,24,"And is that something you actually track, like, how many you have done?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
77,420,15,1,"Oh, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,421,15,2,"And as we sit here today, do you remember the claim from the Clemens Cleaning Village?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
79,424,15,5,I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,425,15,6,"Okay.  Before you came here today, other than speaking to your attorney, did you do anything to prepare yourself for the deposition?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
81,429,15,10,"Basically looked through my report, my prior report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,431,15,12,Okay.  And were there drafts of your report that you also reviewed?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
83,433,15,14,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,434,15,15,"Okay.  So let's turn now -- I'm going to start asking you some questions specifically about Clemens.  When you have an assignment like this, is it something that you typically go out into the field or do you work from your office or from home to do that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
85,440,15,21,No.  Almost all of the work that we do is performed from our home.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,442,15,23,"And in the Clemens Cleaning Village case, is that true that you --",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
87,444,15,25,That is true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,446,16,1,-- basically sat in your home office and performed this work?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
89,448,16,3,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,449,16,4,"Okay.  Did you ever interview, like, over-the-phone or in-person, anyone who was a representative of Clemens Cleaning Village?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
91,453,16,8,"I had an initial conversation with Randy, Mr. Randy Clemens.  Then, I believe, I also had a conversation with his associate, Ms. Janet Curtis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,457,16,12,"Okay.  And did you ever have any contact with their accounting firm, the outside accounting firm, that represents Clemens Cleaning Village?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
93,461,16,16,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,462,16,17,Do you remember anything about the conversation you had with Randy Clemens?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
95,464,16,19,"That specific conversation, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,465,16,20,Okay.  Do you have any general thoughts about what it was about?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
97,467,16,22,"Well, generally, in my initial conversation with a policyholder I will discuss what our role in the process is, what kind of information we'll probably need to take a look at, the process of evaluating the business income loss, the extra expense loss.  That's a typical conversation that I would have with any policyholder.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,476,17,5,All right.  Do you recall your conversation with Janet specifically?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
99,478,17,7,"My initial conversation was with Randy.  It wasn't with Janet.  I did speak with Janet later on with regard to the flow of the documentation, when we would be receiving documentation.  If I had any questions, they would typically go through Janet.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,484,17,13,All right.  What were you asked to do in this case?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
101,486,17,15,"I was asked to work with our policyholder, evaluate the business income loss, summarize, review the extra expense invoices that they were submitting, put them into a format that I could provide to the claim associate for his coverage review and coverage determination, and then the report on a monthly basis going along through the policy period.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,494,17,23,"All right.  And if we were to -- I take it that everything you did on this would have been done on the computer, not on paper necessarily?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
103,499,18,2,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,500,18,3,"And if we were to sit down at your computer, what kind of file or files would be available to you if you looked at them for this claim?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
105,504,18,7,I just want to clarify.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
106,505,18,8,Sure.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
107,506,18,9,"When you say files, do you mean, like, PDF or word documents or what --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,508,18,11,"I'm more talking, like, organization.  If you sat down at your computer today and you wanted to look at the file for Clemens Cleaning Village --",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
109,512,18,15,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,513,18,16,What would it look like in terms of the layout or how you could find pieces of the file?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
111,516,18,19,"It would be in a sub-folder with categorization of my work papers and then any PDF of my documents, of my reports, that were submitted to the claim associate.  Then possibly a folder with the extra expense invoice, possibly a folder with other documents such as payroll or tax returns.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,524,19,1,"So in terms of the extra expense, if the client or the insured was submitting invoices, let's just say for a replacement shirt, would you have reviewed and then saved that invoice in your file?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
113,529,19,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,530,19,7,"And could you, if you had to, go back and trace every invoice that's listed in your report to some PDF or document that's in your file?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
115,534,19,11,"Yes.  It would take some time, but, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,536,19,13,But your belief is that it is all there?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
117,538,19,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,539,19,16,I'm going to mark as Exhibit-1 to your deposition a copy of your report.,q,MR. BLUM,symbols

120,542,19,19,"(Whereupon, Exhibit-1 was marked for identification.)",brackets,,symbols
121,544,19,21,- - -,symbols,,start_question
122,546,19,23,"I'm just going to ask you to take a moment and go through that.  My first question is, is that a true and correct copy of your final report from the Clemens Cleaning Village claim?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
123,552,20,3,Yes.  This does appear to be a final report.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,554,20,5,"In the upper left-hand corner on the first page there is a date of 10/24/18.  Is that the date on which you personally would have finalized that or is that just, like, when this report got printed?  You tell me what that number represents.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
125,560,20,11,"It's typically the same thing. So when I generate the report, it was generated on 10/24.  It's stamped with that date, and that's usually the date that I would send it off to the claim associate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,565,20,16,"Is it accurate that before you got to this final report on 10/24, would there have been interim reports that you would have provided to the claims adjuster?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
127,569,20,20,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
128,570,20,21,And is it also accurate that all of the information that you submitted to the claims adjuster in those interim reports is really summarized and finalized in this report of 10/24/18?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
129,576,21,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
130,577,21,2,"Okay.  All right.  I want to focus on the first page, if we could.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
131,579,21,4,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
132,580,21,5,"Can you tell me briefly -- there is page numbers at the bottom, which are production numbers from the litigation.  They are not your page numbers.  So looking at page 1731, could you just please tell us what this page represents.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
133,586,21,11,"This page is just a summary of the evaluated business income loss through our policy period ending June 15, 2017, and a summary of the extra expenses that we had reviewed.  It just summarizes the analysis contained in the schedules leading up to the summary schedule.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
134,593,21,18,"Okay.  Just so we're on the same page, and you have to understand I'm not an accountant so I want to make sure I'm using the right words.  Can you just tell me, what is your definition as you're working on this of what business income loss is?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
135,599,21,24,"Well, the business income loss is the net profit or loss that you would have had but for the loss of that, plus your continuing operating expenses including payroll.  That analysis is contained on the supporting schedules, as well as a format which, I believe, is a little bit simpler for policyholders to understand and us to explain. It's an evaluation of the loss revenues less those expenses that would discontinue or be saved during the loss period. Those numbers should equal -- whether you do that first bottom up approach or the top down approach, which I would call the loss sales less save expenses, and that analysis is contained in the supporting Schedules.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,616,22,15,"Okay.  And then the extra expense, just again so we're on the same page, tell me from your professional definition of what extra expense means in the context of this report.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
137,621,22,20,"Well, those extra expenses would be those expenses incurred by the policyholder that are over and above normal to continue the business operations.  We basically summarize those invoices and review them as they were provided to us from the policyholder to the claims associate for their review of coverage as well.  There could be duplications with what they are handling in terms of the property damage or contents.  We typically summarize those expenses and provide it to the claims associate for their determination as to coverage.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,635,23,8,"And, again, just sticking with the summary on page one, under the preliminary business income loss through June 15th of 2017, I believe the way your schedule here shows is that there is no loss; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
139,640,23,13,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,641,23,14,"All right.  Then there are two, I call them footnotes, on this page.  It's notes A and B.  Can you tell us, what was the significance of note A on the first page of your report?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
141,646,23,19,"I think the significance of footnote A was from an earlier report and the footnote probably should not have continued on. But, essentially, the purpose of footnote A in an earlier report that I was illustrating to the claims associate that the policyholder had not submitted a formal business interruption claim, and that the indication that we were receiving from the policyholder was the same as our preliminary analysis through July 2016.  So obviously that first footnote shouldn't have continued on into this report probably.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,659,24,6,How about footnote B?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
143,660,24,7,"Footnote B, I was illustrating to the claims associate that we had taken into account the policy provision of the 24 hour waiting period.  That's the first part of the note.  Then as we were evaluating the loss of income for Clemens Cleaning Village, the format of the loss sales less they saved expenses became a negative number. I had a conversation with our claims associate in that time period asking him if we would be -- if it was his opinion that we should deduct that negative business income amount from the extra expenses that were submitted.  He had indicated to me that, no, we would not be taking that negative business income value against the extra expenses.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
144,676,24,23,Did he indicate to you why that was?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
145,678,24,25,"He felt that the coverages were stand alone, that the business interruption was suffered from the extra expenses.  If there was no business income or business interruption loss, that the extra expenses would stand on their own.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
146,685,25,6,"Okay.  And I take it if we go through page-by-page, everything in the rest of this report is the backup for the two conclusions or the two summaries you have on page one; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
147,690,25,11,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
148,691,25,12,"Can you look at the next page for us, page 1732.  Can you tell me, what does page 1732 represent?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
149,694,25,15,"Yes.  This is the evaluation of the business income loss in that format that I described earlier, which is in that net income plus continuing operating expense format.  So this is in what's typically the policy language format of the business interruption.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
150,700,25,21,"And the conclusion that I see on here -- make sure I understand this -- is that the extreme right-hand column is the loss net income, right?  And your number here is $188,318, which shows as a negative number meaning there was actually $188,000 above what their operating income would have otherwise been?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
151,709,26,4,Yes.  Or that there was no business interruption loss.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
152,711,26,6,"Okay.  During the timeframe when your company is reimbursing the insured for extra expenses, does that impact your analysis of this loss of business income?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
153,715,26,10,The timing of when payments are made doesn't impact our analysis of business interruption.  I hope I understood your question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
154,719,26,14,"I think you did.  Because when you say the timing of payments, it's the timing of payments from the insurance company to the insured does not impact this analysis?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
155,723,26,18,"That's correct.  And from our department, from the Forensic Accounting Team, we don't have anything to do with payments that are made.  We issue the reports and then payments are made from the claims adjuster at the claims management level.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
156,729,26,24,"And I take it if you look at the Schedule on page 1732, are there areas that you can identify where the insured actually saved money as a result of the loss and that's how they ended up with a negative loss net income?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
157,735,27,4,"I don't know if I would phrase it as, they saved money, per se.  I would just say that in the evaluation of the business interruption loss, the extra expenses that they incurred mitigated their revenue losses.  Then when we took into account the revenue evaluation.  There were certain expenses that when deducted lead us to a negative number. Such as, a larger one on here would be depreciation, for instance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
158,745,27,14,"Okay.  In fact, the depreciation here is $223,745; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
159,747,27,16,"There are actually two lines of depreciation.  There is a $223,745 and then there is a $28,470.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
160,750,27,19,And both of those are depreciation numbers that contributed to the negative section of the loss net income?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
161,753,27,22,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
162,754,27,23,"And can you tell us when you did this comparison, obviously you were saying there wasn't a loss, what were you comparing it to?  So what was the base numbers that you used to compare that there was not a loss income?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
163,760,28,3,"Well, we were primarily interested -- well, let me take a step back. Once the determination by the claims associate was made that the negative BI would not be applied to the extra expenses, from that standpoint on, on a monthly basis we were reviewing monthly sales from Clemens and their monthly payroll reports and just monitoring on a sales basis whether there would be any reduction or loss of revenues that could contribute to a positive business income loss.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
164,771,28,14,Okay.  And I take it that there was not a loss that occurred?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
165,773,28,16,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
166,774,28,17,"Okay.  So I take it from the date of your report that was done on 10/24/2018, that in fact when this report was completed, the period of covered loss from June 15th of 2016 to June 15th of 2017, had completed that cycle and was totally available to you when you did your final numbers?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
167,781,28,24,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
168,782,28,25,"All right.  Can you tell us then, putting that page aside, what Schedule 1A, which is on page 1733, represents?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
169,786,29,3,"Schedule 1A represents the other format that I had described to you earlier. Schedule 1 is the evaluation of the business income loss and the net profit plus continuing format.  Schedule 1A is the business income loss bi-period or month, which is in the loss revenue less save expense format.  The totals should be equal to the two, between the two Schedules.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
170,795,29,12,"Right.  And, in fact, when you look at your Schedule 1 and Schedule 1A, your total for the loss net income is the same?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
171,798,29,15,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
172,799,29,16,"Okay.  If you could turn to the next page, which is listed as Schedule 2, which appears on 1734.  Can you please tell us what this Schedule represents.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
173,803,29,20,"Yes.  An integral into the business interruption or business income evaluation is the calculation loss of revenues. So that's what we see on Schedule 2. Basically, we analyze the monthly revenues for the two years prior to the loss.  We took a trending of those sales figures.  It looks like we took an August through May trend of about a one percent growth and applied that to our prior year sales to get our projected sales during the loss period.  We then compared those projected sales to actual sales.  The difference is noted in the column on Schedule 2.  When you sum that column, that number would then flow forward to Schedule 1A and Schedule 1 in the business interruption evaluation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
174,820,30,11,"Okay.  I just want to make sure I understand that.  So in the loss revenue column, which is on the right-hand side --",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
175,823,30,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
176,824,30,15,The number that appears where it says increase/decrease --,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
177,826,30,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
178,827,30,18,That is an increase or decrease in the sales over the prior period?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
179,829,30,20,Over the projection.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
180,830,30,21,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
181,831,30,22,"So the prior period would be the prior month sales multiplied by the one percent growth factor to arrive at the projected.  Then the difference that you see in the increase or the decrease column would be the comparison of the actual -- to the projected.  Where there is a negative number, it would mean that the actual sales proceeded our projection.  When there is a non-negative number, it would be those sales that are decreased or we're considering as loss revenues.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
182,843,31,8,"Okay.  Can you tell me, what was the source of the historical information that you relied upon for this analysis?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
183,846,31,11,I believe we were receiving monthly sales reports from Janet Curtis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
184,848,31,13,I understand that.  But I mean more prior to the loss period.  What historical information did you have from prior to the loss period?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
185,852,31,17,Monthly sales reports going back a couple of years.  Then we also had a couple of years of tax returns.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
186,855,31,20,"Okay.  And I apologize if I misunderstood you there.  When you say sales reports, were they, like, Quicken QuickBook reports that had come from the client or the insured?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
187,860,31,25,"They might not have been Quicken, but they were monthly sales reports.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
188,863,32,2,"All right.  Great.  If we could turn to page 1735, which is listed as Schedule 3.  Can you please tell us what that is.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
189,866,32,5,"Schedule 3 is a summary of the Clemens Cleaning Village tax return for the 12 months ending September 30, 2015.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
190,869,32,8,Uh-uh.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
191,870,32,9,Which would be their 2014 tax return.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
192,872,32,11,And why were you preparing that summary?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
193,874,32,13,"I was preparing this summary to evaluate in terms of the ongoing business interruption loss.  Those expenses that would be fixed in nature and those expenses that would be variable in nature.  Typically, variable expenses would discontinue during a period of interruption.  Fixed expenses would likely continue depending upon the length of the interruption period.  So that's what this analysis was intended to do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
194,884,32,23,"Okay.  Then Schedule 4, which falls on pages 1736 and 1737.  Could you please explain to us what that is.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
195,888,33,1,"Yes.  1736 and 1737 pages are an analysis of the payroll.  What we did is, we looked at the payroll for the 84 days prior to loss and developed what their average payroll may look like or did look like.  That was a daily average of $5,228.  Then we compared that to the post loss payroll or the payroll actually incurred in the post loss period. What we were doing here is trying to identify any saved payroll as a result of the loss. Initially when we got into this, we were looking at whether there would be a continuance of operations or not.  So we were evaluating payroll on an ongoing basis to determine if there was any savings in that area.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
196,903,33,16,"And I take it -- can you tell us, was there or wasn't there any savings in the payroll through the claim period?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
197,906,33,19,"It does not appear that there was any savings.  In fact, our analysis tends to show that payroll went up slightly after the loss.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
198,910,33,23,"Okay.  All right.  If you could turn to page 1738 for us, please.  I believe it continues after that to Schedule 4A.  Could you please tell us what that is.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
199,915,34,2,Yeah.  Schedule 4A is just a summary of the weekly payroll records that were provided by Clemens.  The totals on Schedule 4A flow through to Schedule 4 and is part of the payroll analysis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
200,920,34,7,"Okay.  If you look at Schedule 5, which starts on 1741.  Could you please tell us what that is.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
201,923,34,10,"Schedule 5, pages 1741 through 1758, is a summary of those extra expense invoices and charges that were presented to us by Clemens.  They were summarized by me and forwarded on to the claims associate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
202,928,34,15,"Okay.  And just so we're clear, let's just take the very first entry on Schedule 5, which is, it says, Macintosh linen and uniform and then there is an invoice number and date, right?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
203,933,34,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
204,934,34,21,"Then it says, fire towel processing.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
205,936,34,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
206,937,34,24,And an as claimed number.  What does that represent?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
207,940,35,1,The as claimed number would have been the amount that was on the invoice and on the quickbooks ledger that was provided by the policyholder.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
208,944,35,5,"All right.  Then the difference, what does that represent?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
209,946,35,7,"The difference would be, based on my review, those items which I think on my first pass would not be appropriate to an expense charge.  In this case, we have a difference where this vendor Macintosh had charged sales tax.  Because Clemens was the end user or the distributor, sales tax shouldn't have been included in those invoices and we backed those out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
210,955,35,16,"And then so the as reviewed number, is that a number which you basically are approving to say this is in line for payment?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
211,959,35,20,"The as reviewed column is the column that on a preliminary basis I would put in as reviewed.  Then what I do is submit this to the claims associate.  If he has any issues or changes to be made or based on his coverage, then I would pull that out of as reviewed and make a note.  So basically what ends up in the as reviewed column is after my review and the claims associate's review.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
212,969,36,4,"Okay.  And so if we went through this entire Schedule 5, each of these invoices came to you personally and you reviewed it; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
213,973,36,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
214,974,36,9,"Okay.  And if we went to your computer file today, theoretically, we should be able to find each of these invoices in that file?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
215,978,36,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
216,979,36,14,And then is it also accurate that you received some kind of proof of payment by the insured for these invoices?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
217,982,36,17,I did not receive proof of payment.  Payment is a little bit different than the accrual or incurred portion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
218,985,36,20,Sure.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
219,986,36,21,"So I did not receive proof of payment, but I received proof that it had been entered into their accounting system and was part of their incurred expenses.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
220,990,36,25,All right.  So you had at least proof in their books that they showed they had this invoice and had listed it as a legitimate expense?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
221,995,37,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
222,996,37,5,That would be true then if we went through every one of these individual invoices listed in Schedule 5?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
223,999,37,8,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
224,1000,37,9,Okay.  So why are you qualifying your answer there?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
225,1002,37,11,"Well, I don't recall whether on a monthly basis Janet was giving me the quickbooks report every month.  So I'm not sure.  My only qualification is, I don't know if I received all of those quickbook reports.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
226,1007,37,16,"All right.  If we could, let's go to page 1757.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
227,1009,37,18,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
228,1010,37,19,"Actually, I have a question.  It goes on for a couple of pages, but there is an item of fuel for leased trucks.  Can you tell me why that would have qualified as an extra expense if they had -- it would have had to have had ongoing trucking operations no matter what.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
229,1018,38,1,"My understanding and explanation from the policyholder was that these were -- well, they had the leased trucks and then they had to expend fuels for those leased trucks to handle the product or the linens that were sent out of house.  It required them to go to more locations and have more trucks to bring those back in to house for distribution.  That's my understanding.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,1027,38,10,Okay.  Did you do any other analysis to verify any of that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
231,1029,38,12,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
232,1030,38,13,"Okay.  If we look on page 1757, there is an insurance expense.  Can you tell me why those insurance expenses were considered an extra expense?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
233,1034,38,17,"Well, in this case, the description insurance expense that you see there with the number before it is the policyholder's or Clemens' description.  I think she was just classifying those as expenses she didn't know what else to do with. So she just put them into an expense category called insurance expenses.  And to remain consistent with what they were doing in their accounting system, I just kept the same nomenclature.  It appears that these expenses are for a temporary build out so that the policyholder can continue operations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
234,1048,39,5,And that would be then -- the next category down actually says cost for temporary location.  They would be part of that; is that correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
235,1052,39,9,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
236,1053,39,10,"At the very bottom of the cost for temporary location there is a purchase for an industrial dryer.  That's, like, $52,000. Do you see that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
237,1057,39,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,1058,39,15,Why would that cover as an extra expense versus being a replacement under the building or under the personal property claim?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
239,1061,39,18,"That's a question for our claims associate.  I think at this point in time when this expense came through, the claim associate was Steve.  He was comfortable with it being part of the extra expense.  These are examples of expenses that I would really rely on our claims adjuster to approve and put forward.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,1068,39,25,"Okay.  And then the temporary rent, can you tell me what your understanding of the temporary rent was.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
241,1072,40,3,"The temporary rent was the rent for the temporary location that they were operating out of, which would take in these subcontracted out for cleaning linens and so on.  So the policyholder had to rent a temporary location that I think was on their same property that they used to continue their operations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,1080,40,11,"All right.  And then underneath it says, less saved rent?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
243,1082,40,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,1083,40,14,"Or less save rent loss location, right?  So that is it, I take it, the amount that they saved by not paying at the original location?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
245,1087,40,18,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,1088,40,19,"Okay.  And in the end, was there extra rent or saved rent?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
247,1090,40,21,"In the end, I think the difference was $2,400 between the two, between the temporary rent and the saved rent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
248,1093,40,24,"All right.  Great.  If we look on page 1758, there is a total number that's listed there.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
249,1097,41,2,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,1098,41,3,"Okay.  There is an as claimed number and the as reviewed number is $13,196.71 less.  From your review, had you personally agreed that the 1.9 million that's listed in the as reviewed column is what should have been paid to the insured?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
251,1104,41,9,"The $1,976,815.39 is the amount that I provided to the claims associate after my pass through for it, and that's the amount that they had approved as covered.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,1108,41,13,"Okay.  And at any time, did the claims person working on this file provide you with any input or any information which indicated that any of the things that you had included should not have been in here?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
253,1113,41,18,Yeah.  There was one back on page 1757.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,1115,41,20,Uh-uh.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
255,1116,41,21,"The extra accounting fees. There is a $10,500 charge that the claim associate, after discussion with him, he didn't feel that was an extra expense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
256,1120,41,25,Okay.  Was there anything other than that accounting issue that you recall was questioned by the claims adjuster?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
257,1124,42,3,"I think there was questions as to the temporary build out and some of the other questions, but ultimately in the end they were approved.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
258,1128,42,7,"Okay.  After you completed your report in October of 2017, did you have any other involvement in this matter?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
259,1131,42,10,Only other involvement is preparing an expert report for possible trial.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,1133,42,12,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_chat

265,1143,42,22,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
266,1144,42,23,And then when you've testified -- have you testified as an expert on behalf of Nationwide?,q,MR. SLATTERY,start_answer

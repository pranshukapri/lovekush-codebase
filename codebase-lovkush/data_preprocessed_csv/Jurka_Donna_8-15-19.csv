My name is Jackie Kaplan, and I introduced myself to you off the record this morning, but so the record is clear, I'm going to be asking you probably most of if not all of the questions today.

4,165,5,15,Yes.  That's agreed.,side_chat,MR. DONOHUE,start_question

An objection by one Defendant is good for all Defendants, and although I don't think that this is an issue, I will put it on the record, appearance today does not waive any jurisdictional claims or defenses including those related to service of process.

8,180,6,6,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,181,6,7,"Okay.  I'll set out a few rules and we'll try to go from there.  So the first and most important thing is that we have a court reporter here today which you may have noticed, and so you and I are going to do our very best or I'll ask you to do your very best not to speak over one another so try to let me finish my question before you answer and I'll try to let you finish your answer before I ask my next question. Next is that all your answers do need to be verbal today because we can't take down a head nod or a head shake or anything like that.  So I'll ask that you say yes and no or anything else that you have to say. If you answer a question that I ask, I'm going to assume you understood my question. However, if you don't understand my question or you want me to rephrase it, just let me know and I'm happy to do so. If you need a break you can let us know and we're happy to take a break.  You just need to answer the one question if it's pending at the time, and then we'll take a break. Understand all of that?",q,MS. KAPLAN,start_answer
10,206,7,8,"Yes, I do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,207,7,9,"Thank you.  Okay.  And then one other rule I like to mention is that this is what we call a discovery deposition, and what we mean by that is we're trying to discover whatever information you are aware of and recall, and we want to make a record of that.  We don't want you to guess as to anything.  So if the answer to a question is either I don't know or I don't remember, those are perfectly acceptable answers.  We just don't want you to assume or guess or anything like that.  All right?",q,MS. KAPLAN,start_answer

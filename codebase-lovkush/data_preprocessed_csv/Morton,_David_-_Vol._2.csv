4,202,11,17,"We're here to finish up today for your deposition, and I think when we left on Tuesday, I kind of gave you a road map of what's going to happen today.  I'm going to finish up my time with Groton Refrigeration and your father's business and your work there, and then some other folks here in the room may have some questions for you.  Some folks on the phone may have some questions for you.  But kind of, again, the same rules as Tuesday.  If there's anything that I ask that you don't understand or doesn't seem clear, just let me know, and I'll rephrase it for you.  Fair enough?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
5,215,12,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

15,234,12,24,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
16,236,13,1,"But we'll move on, at least right now, to Groton Refrigeration.  And we spoke briefly about it on Tuesday.  That was the business that your father started sometime, as I understand it, in the 1940s?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
17,240,13,5,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
18,241,13,6,"Okay.  And at one point, he was kind of employed by Fort Devens as a refrigeration engineer, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
19,244,13,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
20,245,13,10,"And then he also started his own business, Groton Refrigeration, where he would do some commercial and residential work kind of on the side, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
21,249,13,14,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
22,250,13,15,All right.  And he retired in 1965-ish?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
23,251,13,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
24,252,13,17,Okay.  And he retired from the Fort Devens stuff?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
25,254,13,19,Fort Devens.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
26,255,13,20,Right.  But continued Groton Refrigeration?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
27,257,13,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
28,258,13,23,And he did that up until the time of his passing in 1971?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
29,261,14,1,Yes.  Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
30,262,14,2,"And then the business kind of folded in '72, but from that '71 to '72 time frame, that's kind of when you were --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
31,265,14,5,Winding down.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,266,14,6,"Right.  Wrapping up the business, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
33,267,14,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,268,14,8,"Okay.  So you indicated, I think, on Tuesday that you began helping your father out maybe on evenings and weekends around the age of 10?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
35,271,14,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
36,272,14,12,All right.  So that would have been about 1950?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
37,274,14,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
38,275,14,15,Okay.  Did you help your father while he was performing work here at Fort Devens?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
39,277,14,17,Not for Fort Devens.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
40,278,14,18,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
41,279,14,19,"He would -- in other words, he was like a subcontractor that would bid off on certain projects that the government wanted done.  I did not work for Fort Devens or the government in any manner.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
42,283,14,23,"Okay.  But if your father would bid on a job for Fort Devens, he might get it, and you might be helping your father --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
43,287,15,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
44,288,15,3,"-- perform work, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
45,289,15,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
46,290,15,5,"Okay.  And the work that your father was doing for Fort Devens -- I'm kind of like breaking it into two areas.  One would be the Fort Devens work, and then a separate might be the stuff he might do on the side, right?  Is that kind of how his business ran?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
47,296,15,11,"We only took care of really two -- the NCO Club and the Officers Club.  Those -- which were sort of separate.  They had separate managers.  In other words, the government didn't really run those.  So, yes, I worked at those two areas.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
48,301,15,16,The NCO Club and the Officers Club?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
49,302,15,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
50,303,15,18,"Was there any other areas or any other projects that your father did for Fort Devens that you were involved in, aside from working at the NCO Club or the Officers Club?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
51,307,15,22,I was basically performing that work for Groton Refrigeration.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,309,15,24,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
53,311,16,1,Groton Refrigeration had the subcontract.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
54,312,16,2,Gotcha.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
55,313,16,3,If that makes sense.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,314,16,4,It does.  So your father as Groton Refrigeration --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
57,316,16,6,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
58,317,16,7,-- would get the bids or the projects for the Fort Devens?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
59,319,16,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,320,16,10,"And then as I understand it, those particular projects were essentially -- were they limited to the NCO Club and the Officers Club?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
61,323,16,13,No.  No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
62,324,16,14,They would be --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
63,325,16,15,"These were owned by Fort Devens, whether -- some of the mess halls.  There was more than one mess hall, so he --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
64,328,16,18,Go ahead.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
65,329,16,19,-- he would bid off on certain work that had to be done.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
66,331,16,21,"All right.  Well, let's try it this way. With respect to Fort Devens, what particular jobs or what particular sites do you recall assisting your father as part of his work in conjunction with Fort Devens?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
67,337,17,2,Could you rephrase that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,338,17,3,Sure.  Yeah.  I'm trying to envision here that what happens is your father -- bids go off in Fort Devens for refrigeration work?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
69,341,17,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
70,342,17,7,"Your father, as Groton Refrigeration, puts in for particular jobs, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
71,344,17,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
72,345,17,10,"All right.  And some of them he may be awarded, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
73,347,17,12,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,348,17,13,"All right.  And some of those, I want to know which ones he was awarded that you went and assisted him.  Does that make sense?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
75,351,17,16,Yeah.  Just on Fort Devens?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,352,17,17,Just on Fort Devens.  Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
77,353,17,18,It was -- the plant is not there anymore.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,354,17,19,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
79,355,17,20,But it was a cold storage plant that received the beef from railroad cars.  So we would do some work at those.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,358,17,23,Okay.  So -- go ahead.  Were there others?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
81,359,17,24,That was the main one that I remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,361,18,1,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
83,362,18,2,That was one of the big ones.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,363,18,3,"Okay.  With respect to the -- you and your father's work at the cold storage plant at Fort Devens, do you recall what particular type of work you were doing at the storage plant?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
85,367,18,7,"As the railcars came in, there was a bunch of hooks that rode on a track.  So they were going to dissemble that facility.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,370,18,10,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
87,371,18,11,"So my main was to disassemble these tracks, and they were done in sections and bolted, and, you know, you undo the bolt, take the track out. So there was a lot of mechanical.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,375,18,15,"So they were in the process of, what? Dissembling the storage plant?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
89,377,18,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,378,18,18,Okay.  And how old do you think you were when you went to help your father disassemble this storage plant?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
91,381,18,21,"I'm going to say 15, 16 years old.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,382,18,22,Okay.  And how long were you working with your father to help disassemble this storage plant? How long did that project take?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
93,386,19,1,That was almost a month's project.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,387,19,2,"So if you were 15 or 16, that might have been, like, 1955, '56 time frame?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
95,389,19,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,390,19,5,"And was this in the summer, like, between school years, or when did this project take place?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
97,392,19,7,"A lot of it was weekends, whether it was a summer or winter -- I think either fall, spring, or summer and fall.  I mean, I don't remember any major snowstorms or anything like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,396,19,11,"Okay.  And then as I understand, your role here was essentially to kind of disassemble these tracks.  Were they made out of metal?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
99,399,19,14,"They were made out of metal, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,400,19,15,"And the hooks -- I assume you hook on a side of meat, and it comes off the train?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
101,402,19,17,"Yeah, exactly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,403,19,18,"So this was essentially just kind of, like, scraping the metal tracks and the hooks and all that?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
103,406,19,21,"That job, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,407,19,22,"Okay.  Aside from that, do you have any memory of any other particular work that you did with your father specifically here at Fort Devens?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
105,411,20,1,Yes.  Because Fort Devens was starting to close things down and downsize.  Put it that way.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
106,413,20,3,Uh-huh.  Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
107,414,20,4,"So they were closing some mess halls, which we would de-assemble.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,416,20,6,And what was your role in assisting with the disassembly of these mess halls?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
109,418,20,8,"Basically, a lot of it was pumping the units down and cutting of pipes so that the refrigeration unit could be removed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,421,20,11,When you say pumping units --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
111,422,20,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,423,20,13,"-- down, what kind of units are you talking about?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
113,425,20,15,Refrigeration units.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,426,20,16,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
115,427,20,17,"They had a canister, which was called a receiver, and it had a series of valves on it.  You'd close the valve down, run the compressor, and it would store the gas in the receiver so you didn't discharge the gas into the air.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,432,20,22,Okay.  And how long of a process would that take to close the valves -- close the valves on the receiver and then once you run the compressor to basically store the gas in there?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
117,437,21,2,"Yeah.  Then, as I say, you cut everything free.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,439,21,4,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
119,440,21,5,"Obviously, the compressor, electric motor was involved.  That was all -- you could remove that as one unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,443,21,8,"When you say ""it,"" you mean the compressor?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
121,445,21,10,"The whole unit you could remove.  It was a compressor, receiver, condenser, motor.  Those were all bolted onto a frame.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,448,21,13,"Okay.  So, again, this is more disassembly, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
123,450,21,15,Disassembling.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,451,21,16,Okay.  So the first step would be kind of to pump the units down?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
125,453,21,18,"That was -- yeah, that was the big thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,454,21,19,"All right.  And then once the gas is stored, you can then start to, as you say, cut the pipes?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
127,457,21,22,"Yeah.  Cut the pipes, and, obviously, disconnect the electrical end of it to free the unit up so the unit could be moved out as a unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
128,461,22,1,"Okay.  And as a unit, how big of a product are we talking?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
129,463,22,3,I'm going to say two by three.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
130,464,22,4,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
131,465,22,5,That's not exact.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
132,466,22,6,"Sure.  Okay.  And the unit, you said, would include things like the motor, the condenser?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
133,468,22,8,"The whole, yes, shebang, you might say.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
134,469,22,9,"Okay.  And then the unit, the whole shebang, as you say, that's just removed as one complete entity, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
135,472,22,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,473,22,13,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
137,474,22,14,It could easily --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,475,22,15,It could easily be taken out once you got everything separated?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
139,477,22,17,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,478,22,18,"The pipes that you had to cut, what kind of pipes were those?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
141,480,22,20,Those were copper pipes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,481,22,21,And what kind of tools did you use to remove the copper pipes?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
143,483,22,23,A tubing cutter in most cases.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
144,484,22,24,"Were there -- when you say ""most cases,"" so would there be occasions when you wouldn't use that type of cutter?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
145,488,23,3,"Most of the time it was a tubing cutter. Other than that, occasionally -- because you could -- there was not room, you'd have to use a hacksaw.  We didn't have the luxury of a reciprocating saw back then.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
146,493,23,8,"Were any of these pipes -- these pipes that you were cutting, were any of them insulated in any way?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
147,496,23,11,"No, not -- very, very seldom.  Most of them, because of the size, they were anywhere from quarter-inch up to five-eighth to three-quarter-inch tubing, and we didn't have to -- those did not have to be insulated.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
148,501,23,16,Were there tubing or piping in the areas where you were working that were insulated?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
149,503,23,18,Not that I remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
150,504,23,19,"Okay.  And while you were doing this work, I assume that there were other trades present helping to disassemble these mess halls?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
151,507,23,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
152,508,23,23,What other types of trades were present while you were helping to remove these units that were also working in the mess halls?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
153,512,24,2,"Well, they were de-assembling and which -- whether carpenters, you want to say, but to rip apart cabinets.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
154,515,24,5,Uh-huh.  Were there any sort of walls or interior structures being removed?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
155,517,24,7,Usually my end of the work got done before that part of the process was started.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
156,519,24,9,"Okay.  And these mess halls, are they just one-story mess halls?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
157,521,24,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
158,522,24,12,Okay.  Were there any sort of furnaces or boilers or anything in these mess halls?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
159,524,24,14,I don't remember any boilers.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
160,525,24,15,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
161,526,24,16,I'm not sure how they heated them.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
162,527,24,17,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
163,528,24,18,"Obviously, there had to be some type of boiler, but I had nothing to do with that end of it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
164,530,24,20,"Okay.  With respect to the mess hall itself, how big of a building is this?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
165,532,24,22,"I'm going to say at least 30 by 60.  I mean, it was a fair-sized building.  I'm going to say probably close to 5,000 square feet, and these are -- obviously, I didn't measure the buildings.  It's just an approximation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
166,538,25,3,"Sure.  Do you know approximately how old you were when you were doing this?  I know you were about 15 or 16 when the storage plants was disassembled.  What about the mess hall?  Do you know, was that before or after the storage plant?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
167,543,25,8,"As I say, I really don't remember whether I was 16 years old or whether I had a license at that point in time.  I can't say.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
168,546,25,11,Okay.  But around the same time that they were taking --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
169,548,25,13,Around the same time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
170,549,25,14,"Okay.  Would you know the manufacturer of any of these units, the compressor units, that you were disassembling to remove?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
171,552,25,17,"Well, as I say, these were a separate electric motor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
172,554,25,19,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
173,555,25,20,And the big ones that I remember working with was either GE or Westinghouse.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
174,557,25,22,"And when you say ""that,"" is that as it pertains to the motor portion?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
175,559,25,24,The motor portion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
176,561,26,1,"Okay.  Now, would you have any information in terms of when these motors were originally installed in the mess hall?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
177,564,26,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
178,565,26,5,And would you have any information in terms of whether or not there had been any prior repairs or maintenance on these particular motors before you went to remove them?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
179,569,26,9,"Only because -- yes.  Meaning, you had to have some type of maintenance, usually within a year. I mean, I'm not sure -- because these were taking care of their daily work on -- post engineers in the refrigeration end of it.  This was their job to keep these units running.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
180,575,26,15,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
181,576,26,16,"So I personally did not do the repairs, but there had to be repairs.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
182,578,26,18,Right.  Okay.  So you know that they were done?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
183,580,26,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
184,581,26,21,But that's not something that you were personally involved with?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
185,583,26,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
186,584,26,24,"Okay.  You talk about, you know, the condenser being part of this unit as well, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
187,587,27,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
188,588,27,3,Do you know who the manufacturer of the condensers were?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
189,590,27,5,Not the condensers.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
190,591,27,6,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
191,592,27,7,"They did not have a nameplate on them.  I mean, all they were is a steel canister depending on the size of the unit.  To what size that steel canister was, it was probably, I'm going to say, a quarter-of-an-inch steel that was, obviously, bent or a canister, and then with a welded seam, and both ends were welded, and then they had an inlet and an outlet.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
192,600,27,15,"Okay.  What other particular -- I know there's the electric motor that's part of this unit. There's a condenser that's part of this unit.  The receiver, is that also part of what you would call this unit?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
193,605,27,20,That's part -- that was actually bolted to the frame.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
194,607,27,22,"Okay.  And this receiver, do you know the manufacturer of the receiver that you were removing?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
195,609,27,24,"No, I would not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
196,611,28,1,"Okay.  Are there any other component -- major component parts of what we've been calling this unit aside from the electric motor, the condenser, the receivers that you're kind of getting ready to disassemble and remove?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
197,616,28,6,The compressor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
198,617,28,7,The compressor.  All right.  There you go.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
199,618,28,8,You got to have that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
200,619,28,9,Okay.  So the compressor is a major part of this unit.  Yes?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
201,621,28,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
202,622,28,12,"Okay.  And so your -- what kind of interaction do you have with the condenser portion of this unit to get it ready for removal, if anything?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_chat
203,625,28,15,Condenser or compressor?,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
204,626,28,16,I'm sorry.  Compressor. We've got to change the names here.  Compressor.,side_chat,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
205,628,28,18,"Well, no, because that was usually removed as a unit --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
206,630,28,20,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
207,631,28,21,-- along with the motor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
208,632,28,22,So there wasn't anything you needed to do to the compressor as part of that removal process?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
209,634,28,24,"As I say, it was removed as basically a unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
210,637,29,2,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
211,638,29,3,Not -- there were a few times the compressor and the motor were too heavy to remove. Then we removed the motor separately and the compressor separately.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
212,642,29,7,"And in an instance like that, how do you do that?  Do you have to separate the motor from the compressor?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
213,645,29,10,"You have -- no, because they were separate units.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
214,647,29,12,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
215,648,29,13,"Obviously, they were all bolted to this frame.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
216,650,29,15,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
217,651,29,16,"So the compressor had four bolts on it, which you would have to, obviously, remove to free that up.  But then it also had the valves that went into this compressor.  There was an intake and a -- there was a low side and a high side.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
218,656,29,21,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
219,657,29,22,"So you had to remove those valves, and there was gaskets that were involved and --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
220,659,29,24,"Okay.  And when you were removing the low side and the high side valves from the compressor, is that something you had to do every time or when -- you said on occasion?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
221,664,30,4,Just when you had to separate the motor from the frame.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
222,666,30,6,"Gotcha.  So if you didn't have to separate it from the frame, you wouldn't have to remove valves?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
223,669,30,9,Right.  The valves usually stayed there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
224,670,30,10,"Okay.  And when you were doing this work on breaking down the mess halls, how often did you have to actually remove valves versus it could all go out as one unit?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
225,674,30,14,That was not a daily process.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
226,675,30,15,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
227,676,30,16,"Obviously, once in a while.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
228,677,30,17,And how many mess halls were you involved disassembling?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
229,679,30,19,I'm going to say probably a half a dozen.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,680,30,20,"Okay.  And then in terms of these units that we're talking about, how many units per mess hall were there?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
231,683,30,23,Half a dozen.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
232,684,30,24,All right.  So half a dozen.  So six times six would be roughly 36 total?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
233,687,31,2,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
234,688,31,3,"Okay.  And then of the 36 roughly total we're talking about of these units, how many of those would you say you actually had to kind of remove valves in order to remove the entire unit?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
235,692,31,7,Probably 50-50.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
236,693,31,8,Okay.  So about half of them would have required you --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
237,695,31,10,Because of the size.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,696,31,11,"Okay.  The compressors that you were removing as part of the unit, do you recall who manufactured those?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
239,699,31,14,Circumference.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,700,31,15,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
241,701,31,16,Copeland.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,702,31,17,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
243,703,31,18,Frigidaire.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,704,31,19,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
245,705,31,20,Let's see.  There was no air-conditioning in those units.  So there would not be air-conditioning.  I think did those were American Standard and Carrier.  Carrier.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,709,31,24,Carrier was one of the compressors?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
247,711,32,1,"Yeah, but these -- these were units on air-conditioning, which that was not involved in the --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
248,714,32,4,The mess hall teardown?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
249,715,32,5,-- the mess halls.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,716,32,6,"Okay.  So in terms of the compressors that were involved in the mess hall teardown, it would be Circumference, Copeland, and Frigidaire?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
251,719,32,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,720,32,10,Okay.  In terms of the valves of the half of them that you had to remove --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
253,722,32,12,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,723,32,13,-- do you know the manufacturers of the valves?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
255,725,32,15,Those valves did not have a name on there that I remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
256,727,32,17,"Okay.  And some of this work of removing the valves, you said that there were gaskets involved?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
257,730,32,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
258,731,32,21,"Okay.  Would you know the manufacturer -- well, strike that. In removing these valves, did you have to remove the gaskets?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
259,736,33,1,"Because it was a teardown situation, no, because all this stuff was basically going to be scrapped.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,739,33,4,"Right.  Okay.  So basically, the only reason you're removing a valve is to make the system -- be able to remove the system?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
261,742,33,7,"In this part of it, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
262,743,33,8,Yeah.  Okay.  Any other work?  We talked about your disassembly in the cold storage?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
263,745,33,10,Yup.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
264,746,33,11,"We talked about you working on roughly a half dozen mess halls, tearing -- helping to tear them down.  What other work do you recall helping your father at Groton Refrigeration at Fort Devens?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
265,750,33,15,Just the NCO Club and Officers Club.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
266,751,33,16,"Okay.  And so at the NCO Club, what kind of work did you assist your father with?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
267,753,33,18,"That was more on full maintenance, repairs.  Anything that broke down where we got called on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
268,756,33,21,All right.  And is this the same type of thing for the Officers Club?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
269,758,33,23,"Basically, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
270,759,33,24,"Okay.  At the NCO Club, did you do any sort of, like, new construction for them, or was this, again, all kind of maintenance, repair of existing units?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
271,764,34,4,This was 90 percent just maintenance and repairs.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
272,766,34,6,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
273,767,34,7,Keeping things operating.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
274,768,34,8,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
275,769,34,9,Making sure we kept the vehicle.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
276,770,34,10,"Right.  What might the other 10 percent, then, encompass?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
277,772,34,12,"Occasionally, we would have to put in a complete new unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
278,774,34,14,"Okay.  In case something couldn't be repaired, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
279,776,34,16,"Well, they would replace some of these old coolers, and when they did, they would, obviously, put in something new.  Usually bigger and better.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
280,779,34,19,"Okay.  And the 90 percent maintenance, repairs and 10 percent maybe, you know, replacement of equipment, is that the same for the NCO Club as it is the Officers Club?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
281,783,34,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
282,784,34,24,Okay.  And when would you say you first went to work with your father at the NCO Club?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
283,787,35,2,"Oh, that was way back.  That was in the early '50s.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
284,789,35,4,And what type of equipment at the NCO Club do you recall helping your father maintain or repair?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
285,791,35,6,"Basically, the same as what was in the mess halls.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
286,793,35,8,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
287,794,35,9,They were the very same.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
288,795,35,10,"So we would have, what?  Kind of, like, these -- we talked about these units, these compressor units?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
289,798,35,13,"Yes.  This was -- most of these here back then in the early '50s, they would come as separate units.  The late '50s, '60s, '70s, they started coming with a sealed compressor.  Meaning, the motor, the compressor would all be one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
290,803,35,18,"And, again, forgive my ignorance, but these compressor units, what are they utilized for in the NCO Club?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
291,806,35,21,Keeping things cold.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
292,807,35,22,Okay.  And does that run anywhere from keeping the beer cold to keeping the club itself cooled?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
293,811,36,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
294,812,36,2,All right.  So it will help for the refrigeration units where we're sticking the Budweisers?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
295,815,36,5,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,816,36,6,As well as the little AC unit that helps keeps the officers cool while they drink the Budweisers?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
297,819,36,9,"That's where American Standard would have come in and -- because they were bigger on the outside units refrigeration -- I mean, air-conditioning units.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
298,823,36,13,"Okay.  And as part of your work with your father of maintenance and repairs, would you also work on, for example, the refrigerators that kept the beer cold?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
299,827,36,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
300,828,36,18,"And would you also, with your father, work on the AC units that kept the club cool?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
301,830,36,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
302,831,36,21,"Okay.  And did your father, through his company, ever do any, you know, heating work, for example, on boilers and furnaces, or was it more on the AC side?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
303,836,37,1,AC side.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
304,837,37,2,"Okay.  Now, we talked about at the mess hall the work that you did in terms of tearing out these compressor-type units.  Let's stick with those units first.  What type of maintenance or repair work would have been done on those at the NCO Club?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
305,842,37,7,"Basically, the same.  I mean, preventing maintenance, you -- we had a portable air blower because dust was -- it was like a radiator when I say ""condenser.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,846,37,11,Okay.  Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
307,847,37,12,That's the -- so you had to keep it clean so the air would go through it to condense the gas. So those would have to be cleaned on a -- we did it on a monthly basis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,851,37,16,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
309,852,37,17,"Because they did get dirty, and that was a dirty process.  And while you were at it, you also blew out the motors in and around the compressor to keep things as clean as possible because when you had to work on it, I mean, you didn't walk out of there like a grease monkey.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
310,858,37,23,"Right.  Okay.  All right.  So one of the things you had to do for maintenance of these compressors is, again, just kind of keep them clean. Clean out the units, clean out motors.  When you say you blew them out, what would you utilize to do that?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
311,864,38,4,We used a portable electric air blower that we used on a regular basis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
312,866,38,6,And do you know who manufactured that?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
313,867,38,7,No.  I would be guessing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
314,868,38,8,"Okay.  What other types of routine maintenance -- and when you and I on day two are talking about the presses and the equipment of your printing, we talked about maintaining things versus repairing things?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
315,873,38,13,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
316,874,38,14,Were there -- what other sort of maintenance might you do --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
317,876,38,16,That was the big monthly maintenance is cleaning.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
318,878,38,18,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
319,879,38,19,"As long as everything -- well, when you did that, you also inspected the belts because that was another big thing.  Because you had a separate motor, a separate compressor.  You had to have it driven by something.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
320,884,38,24,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
321,886,39,1,And it was belts.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
322,887,39,2,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
323,888,39,3,"There was usually either one, two, or three.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,890,39,5,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
325,891,39,6,"So you would inspect the belts for cracks. They would only last so long before the rubber started breaking down, and you would have to replace those.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,895,39,10,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
327,896,39,11,"So that was a maintenance, but some of them you found in the general inspection of the unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,898,39,13,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
329,899,39,14,"Then you had dryers.  You had sight glasses, expansion valves that would have to be once in a while replaced because every once in a while these units, because of the way the compressors were designed, the front seal would leak a little bit.  So you would have to add gas every once in a while.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,905,39,20,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
331,906,39,21,"And you always -- you tried to purge your gauges and stuff so no air or moisture would get in, but on occasion, yes, moisture got in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,909,39,24,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
333,911,40,1,"Then two things could take place.  Your dryer could freeze up and stop the gas flow.  That was pretty easy because you would just have to go by touch.  If the dryer was cold, you knew the thing was plugged up, or the expansion valve could freeze, and then you're getting no cooling on the evaporator.  So those two things had to be changed once in a while.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,918,40,8,"Okay.  And so for maintenance, it looks like you kind of clean out it and you do a visual inspection to make sure everything is operating --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
335,921,40,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,922,40,12,"-- as intended?  Both kind of by visual and, like you said, you could -- if you needed to touch the dryer, if you knew it was cold, you knew there might be a little bit more going on there, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
337,927,40,17,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,928,40,18,"Okay.  And then, obviously, if something was going on, whether it be a dryer or something along those lines, then you might make the necessary repairs; is that fair to say?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
339,932,40,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,933,40,23,"Okay.  The compressor itself, that unit, do you know who manufactured the one in the NCO Club?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
341,936,41,1,"No, I do not.  Because the compressors, depending on how many BTUs that you needed --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,938,41,3,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
343,939,41,4,-- we would just replace a defective compressor with -- we had spares.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
344,941,41,6,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
345,942,41,7,And just because it was a Circumference compressor doesn't mean that we had to put that type of pump back on.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
346,945,41,10,Gotcha.  It was more the BTUs that were -- that you kind of matched up?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
347,947,41,12,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
348,948,41,13,Gotcha.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
349,949,41,14,"Just to match it up just like an electric motor.  I mean, you matched up the horsepower.  You matched up the shaft size because you're pulling it, you know.  It had to go on a replacement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
350,953,41,18,Gotcha.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
351,954,41,19,"So these units, whatever unit was there, does not mean that was the unit that was on it when it died or whatever.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
352,957,41,22,Because it could be various combinations of things?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
353,959,41,24,"Because we had spares, whether electric motor or compressors.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
354,962,42,2,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
355,963,42,3,Then we'd take that compressor back and rebuild it and repair it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
356,965,42,5,"Gotcha.  And then that could be, then, again, put back into service?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
357,967,42,7,"That could be put back into service, but as I say -- excuse me -- that's why I can't say it was a Copeland, you know, whatever.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
358,970,42,10,"Okay.  Gotcha.  And at the NCO Club, was there just one compressor unit that kind of handled the refrigeration?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
359,973,42,13,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
360,974,42,14,How many generally were there for the NCO Club?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
361,976,42,16,"There again, usually at least a half a dozen.  I say a half a dozen because you had more than one vehicle, and, you know, I don't remember exactly how many coolers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
362,980,42,20,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
363,981,42,21,I can only general -- I'm saying a half a dozen.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
364,983,42,23,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
365,984,42,24,It could be -- it could be five.  It could be eight.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
366,987,43,2,And does each compressor then operate just one of these beer coolers?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
367,989,43,4,Most of them was one.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
368,990,43,5,Gotcha.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
369,991,43,6,And they had --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
370,992,43,7,And then now they also had air-conditioning for the club itself?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
371,994,43,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
372,995,43,10,And would the air-conditioning units have separate compressors as well?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
373,997,43,12,"Those were sealed units.  When I say ""sealed unit,"" the compressor and the motor was all in one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
374,1000,43,15,And that's for the AC units?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
375,1001,43,16,For the AC.  And then you had a large condenser fan motor on the AC units.  So those two components really made up your AC unit except for the electrical end of it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
376,1005,43,20,And what was significant about the electrical end of the AC unit?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
377,1007,43,22,"Well, you had to have a -- they were a different type.  There was pressure switches.  There were temperature switches.  Something would have to tell that unit when to start and when to stop.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
378,1012,44,2,Gotcha.  Yup.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
379,1013,44,3,"And there were a different process.  You know, some used temperature from inside.  Some used pressure.  There were pressure switches, and there was temperature switches.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
380,1017,44,7,"Okay.  With respect to, like, for example, the beer coolers themselves, did you guys ever have to do maintenance or repairs on those particular pieces of equipment?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
381,1021,44,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
382,1022,44,12,Okay.  And do you know the manufacturer of any of these beer coolers that you --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
383,1024,44,14,Not the beer coolers themselves.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
384,1025,44,15,Yup.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
385,1026,44,16,"Just a simple fact, once it was moved in place, we didn't -- basically didn't disturb it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
386,1028,44,18,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
387,1029,44,19,"No.  I cannot say what the manufacturer was.  I mean -- no, there was so many different ones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
388,1031,44,21,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
389,1032,44,22,"You know, I'm sorry.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
390,1033,44,23,"It's okay.  And with respect to work that you or your father may have performed on these coolers, these beer coolers, what did that entail? What was the maintenance that you guys might do?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
391,1038,45,3,"Actually, what we've gone through was almost the same thing.  I don't care if it was a beer cooler or whether it was a salad unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
392,1041,45,6,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
393,1042,45,7,It was the same maintenance.  The same procedures.  The only difference is one unit was maybe a little smaller.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
394,1045,45,10,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
395,1046,45,11,And the other unit had to be bigger because of the size of the chest.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
396,1048,45,13,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
397,1049,45,14,That was the only difference.  If -- they operated in the same manner.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
398,1051,45,16,"Gotcha.  So if things like, you know, having to blow things out?  Visual inspections?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
399,1053,45,18,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
400,1054,45,19,"Okay.  The compressor work that you did, again, you said it was -- they helped to keep the coolers cool as well as help to run the AC units; is that correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
401,1058,45,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
402,1059,45,24,"So the AC units at the -- at the NCO Club, approximately, if you know, how many AC units were there for the club or was this, like, central air?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
403,1063,46,3,Usually it was central.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
404,1064,46,4,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
405,1065,46,5,"It was so long ago, I do not remember how many units.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
406,1067,46,7,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
407,1068,46,8,They tried to do it as a central unit.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
408,1069,46,9,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
409,1070,46,10,But some had smaller rooms.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
410,1071,46,11,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
411,1072,46,12,And those would be done separately.  So you could have had two.  You could have had three.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
412,1074,46,14,"Gotcha.  And just kind of sticking with the NCO Club, did you help your father perform any sort of maintenance on these -- any of these units, the AC units?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
413,1078,46,18,"Oh, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
414,1079,46,19,Okay.  And what type of maintenance is performed on these AC units?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
415,1081,46,21,"Because of the type of compressors that was on the AC unit, it wasn't like the older refrigeration units where the compressors were separate, and so these were all a sealed unit.  So you didn't get as much leakage of gas, I'm going to say, because there's no seal involved like there was on the older compressors. So other than an external leak, did you have to add any gas to the AC units.  The biggest part on the AC units, cleaning the condenser, blowing it out, and on those it had a large electric fan to circulate the air through the condenser.  Some of them had to be oiled.  Some of them had to be greased, and that was on a monthly basis.  And some had to get replaced because usually -- because those were out in the weather, in the element.  Yeah.  They would break down a little more, and so you had to maintain them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
416,1099,47,14,"Okay.  So kind of, again, we talked about earlier maintenance is -- in this case, it's more just kind of blowing out the condenser?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
417,1102,47,17,That was the big thing on the air-conditioners.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
418,1104,47,19,And that's just to kind of keep that dust and debris that gathers to ensure efficiency?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
419,1106,47,21,Get it out of there so the air can penetrate.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
420,1108,47,23,"Right.  Okay.  And then the other thing you said, they would have these large electrical fans that on a monthly basis you just kind of need to grease or to lubricate --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
421,1113,48,3,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
422,1114,48,4,"-- again, for efficiency?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
423,1115,48,5,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
424,1116,48,6,Okay.  And this was something that you helped your father do?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
425,1118,48,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
426,1119,48,9,"Okay.  The manufacturer of the AC units, do you remember who that was?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
427,1121,48,11,"Well, that was either American Standard --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
428,1122,48,12,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
429,1123,48,13,And now I'm drawing a blank.  There's one more.  There's two of them.  I think I did mention those earlier.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
430,1126,48,16,"Okay.  And these units, aside from doing this maintenance that you described, did you have to perform any repairs to any of these units?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
431,1129,48,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
432,1130,48,20,Okay.  What --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
433,1131,48,21,The coil --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
434,1132,48,22,"I'm sorry.  I was going to say what kind, but you were about to say.  The coil?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
435,1134,48,24,"The coil is inside, which air passed through, and that's where you got your cooling.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
436,1137,49,2,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
437,1138,49,3,So those had to be -- I didn't mention those on -- those would have to be cleaned out as well.  The filters would have to be cleaned out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
438,1141,49,6,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
439,1142,49,7,And those were all the same process of using the blower --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
440,1144,49,9,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
441,1145,49,10,-- and blowing and cleaning those out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
442,1146,49,11,"To blow out the coils and the filters of the AC units, did you have to disassemble the unit in any way?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
443,1149,49,14,You had to open up -- usually they had a small door that you removed so you could get at the filters and you could get at the evaporators to clean them.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
444,1153,49,18,"And so once you opened this small door, you were able to get the portable compressed air --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
445,1155,49,20,"No, you don't -- you slid the filters out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
446,1156,49,21,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
447,1157,49,22,"Then, as I say, you cleaned the filters. You could do that, you know, one or two times.  Then you would have to replace it with new filters.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
448,1161,50,1,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
449,1162,50,2,And then you would also have a circulating fan because somewhere you've got to create the airflow.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
450,1165,50,5,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
451,1166,50,6,"And that would have an electric motor, and that would have to be -- most of it was lubricating, whether it was grease or whether it was oil.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
452,1169,50,9,"Okay.  Any other types of -- and what I hear what you're saying when you talk about cleaning out the coils and occasionally cleaning out filters and then after a while they're going to have to almost be replaced, I kind of see that as maintenance because you guys are going to go in there, and you're going to blow out the coils and blow out the filters?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
453,1176,50,16,Right.  Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
454,1177,50,17,"What I'm curious about is, do you have any memory of helping your father perform any specific repairs wherein a unit broke and it was more than just blowing something out or greasing something up that you actually had to perform a repair on something?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
455,1183,50,23,Yeah.  They also had expansion valves.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
456,1184,50,24,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
457,1186,51,1,"So on occasion, whether it was moisture that that valve would be defective and had to be replaced.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
458,1189,51,4,Okay.  And do you know who made these expansion valves?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
459,1191,51,6,Not the expansion valves.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
460,1192,51,7,"Okay.  And to remove an expansion valve, what does that entail?  How do you go about doing that?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
461,1195,51,10,"Basically, you've got to pump the unit down --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
462,1197,51,12,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
463,1198,51,13,"-- out of the system.  Then some were flare nuts.  You would have a liquid side and a gas side.  You would have to remove the flare nuts.  Now, on some of the air-conditioners, they had an expansion valve that bolted in because they went to different tubing, different sections of that coil.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
464,1204,51,19,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
465,1205,51,20,"I mean, maybe one you'd be the quarter -- the lower part, and then the next -- so it would be like an octopus that had more than one line coming off it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
466,1209,51,24,"Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  Yup.",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
467,1211,52,1,"So you could remove the main part of it by -- usually it was two bolts, and then you would have the gasket that you replace, and then you'd bolt the whole thing back in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
468,1215,52,5,"The gasket that you were removing, do you know who manufactured that?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
469,1217,52,7,"They were basically -- it was Gasket Pack or Pack Gasket.  They were, like, a preformed gasket.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
470,1219,52,9,"Okay.  Those would be the ones that you would utilize to replace the gasket that you had removed.  I guess my question is, when you go to do this work for the first time on an expansion valve, do you know the manufacturer of that gasket that you are removing?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
471,1225,52,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
472,1226,52,16,Okay.  And how would you know the manufacturer of the gasket you are removing?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
473,1228,52,18,"Because we bought the gaskets, and they were, like, in a kit, different sizes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
474,1230,52,20,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
475,1231,52,21,And you didn't have to cut them.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
476,1232,52,22,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
477,1233,52,23,"They were all premolded, I guess, and so you would have different sizes all in this kit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
478,1236,53,1,Yup.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
479,1237,53,2,That's how I would know what the gaskets were.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
480,1239,53,4,I see.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
481,1240,53,5,"Just because, as I say, they came out of this kit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
482,1242,53,7,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
483,1243,53,8,Nothing to do with the valve.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
484,1244,53,9,"Okay.  But those are the ones that you are putting on, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
485,1246,53,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
486,1247,53,12,"I guess my question is just a slightly -- just a little bit different.  You're going to remove that expansion valve for the first time, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
487,1250,53,15,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
488,1251,53,16,"Let's say that.  And as part of that process, I think you told me there is a valve -- I'm sorry -- there's a gasket involved in that?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
489,1254,53,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
490,1255,53,20,"My question is -- and then you have to remove that gasket before you can then take one of the precut ones you have and put it on, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
491,1258,53,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
492,1259,53,24,"Okay.  The one you're taking off that first time, do you know who made that one?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
493,1262,54,2,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
494,1263,54,3,"Okay.  And do you know what the gaskets that you were utilizing, what they were made of?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
495,1265,54,5,I'm not sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
496,1266,54,6,"Okay.  The one that you removed, how did you go about removing that gasket?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
497,1268,54,8,"Usually that gasket was either with -- I used to have a chisel that was in pretty good shape. So you'd chisel it out.  You know, you don't want to damage the steel end of it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
498,1272,54,12,Right.  Right.  Was there ever occasion when you were removing old gaskets that they would just come right out?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
499,1275,54,15,"Yeah.  Usually on compressors, you had a suction side, which was usually cold.  Then you had the high side, which was usually very hot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
500,1278,54,18,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
501,1279,54,19,The cold side wasn't bad.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
502,1280,54,20,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
503,1281,54,21,"But the high side, because of the heat, had baked them on, so you had to work at them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
504,1283,54,23,"Gotcha.  But, again, as you indicated, to do that work, though, if you're using your chisel, you're going to do it carefully so as not to damage where the two --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
505,1288,55,3,That was the big part.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
506,1289,55,4,"Yeah.  Okay.  And the -- the gaskets that you replaced them with, I'm sorry, did you call them Gasket Pack?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
507,1292,55,7,"Yeah.  It -- I'm not sure which -- whether it was vice versa on the names, and I just -- pack -- I'm sure on ""pack.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
508,1295,55,10,Okay.  And is that P-A-C-K?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
509,1296,55,11,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
510,1297,55,12,Okay.  Where would you get those?  Where did you get the replacement gaskets?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
511,1299,55,14,From Standard Supply in Worcester.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
512,1300,55,15,"And the removal process of removing these gaskets, did that create dust in any way?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
513,1302,55,17,"Obviously, when you disturb a gasket and you have to pry it off, I'm going to say yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
514,1304,55,19,"Okay.  And when you were doing this work, did you wear any sort of breathing protection or anything like that?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
515,1307,55,22,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
516,1308,55,23,"Okay.  Any other types of repairs?  We talked about a lot of the maintenance that you would have done on these AC units, and they sound like a lot of the maintenance is kind of similar --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
517,1313,56,3,The same.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
518,1314,56,4,The same type of thing?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
519,1315,56,5,The same thing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
520,1316,56,6,Any other types of repairs that you recall performing with your father on these units?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
521,1318,56,8,"Well, basically, if the unit failed, you would have to replace the unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
522,1320,56,10,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
523,1321,56,11,"If the circulating fans, you know, whether it was on the condenser or whether it was on the evaporator, you would have to replace.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
524,1324,56,14,"And if a fan failed, what's that process entail?  Is that kind of an unscrewing --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
525,1326,56,16,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
526,1327,56,17,-- the fan?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
527,1328,56,18,"Yeah.  Some bolts, taking a cage off, and then they had, obviously, a frame to hold the fan in place.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
528,1331,56,21,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
529,1332,56,22,"And, obviously, you've got the electric end of it where you would have to disconnect your wire.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
530,1336,57,1,Yup.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
531,1337,57,2,"Most of those were totally replaced, and a new one were put in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
532,1339,57,4,"Okay.  If you had to remove, you know, particular units of the, I guess, either the compressors -- you know, the AC units to get it back and working -- and I'm assuming every repair is going to be different because it's going to depend on what the problem is.  If you had to remove particular component parts of the compressor, how was that done?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
533,1346,57,11,"Well, on the refrigeration compressors, really you had two.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
534,1348,57,13,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
535,1349,57,14,"I call it either the high side or the low side.  You've got a suction side, and you've got the high side.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
536,1352,57,17,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
537,1353,57,18,"You would have two gaskets in there.  The low side, usually that gasket came off pretty easily, but on the high side, you had to scrape it and clean it and whatnot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
538,1357,57,22,"And removing and replacing these gaskets, that was only done if the unit needed some sort of repair, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
539,1361,58,1,"Right, if -- yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
540,1362,58,2,"It's not part of the regular maintenance, in other words?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
541,1364,58,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
542,1365,58,5,"Okay.  And when you were working with your father at the NCO Club, is it fair to say that most of your work and your father's work was on the maintenance side versus the repair side?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
543,1369,58,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
544,1370,58,10,"Okay.  And if you had to break it down percentage-wise for the time that Groton Refrigeration when they were at the NCO Club, what percentage of their time would be maintenance versus having to conduct these actual types of repairs?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
545,1375,58,15,I'm going to say 75-25.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
546,1376,58,16,"Seventy-five percent maintenance.  The other 25 percent of the time there might be some type of repair, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
547,1379,58,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
548,1380,58,20,"And then of that 25 percent of the time that there might be some sort of repair, it could be all sorts of different types of repairs?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
549,1383,58,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
550,1384,58,24,And not every repair that you might have to perform at the NCO Club on the compressors or the units or whatever would involve gasket work; is that fair to say?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
551,1389,59,4,That's fair to say.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
552,1390,59,5,"Okay.  So of that 25 percent, then, what percentage of that repair work might actually involve the removal and replacement of a gasket?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
553,1393,59,8,That would be the lower end because the compressors were pretty -- it wasn't like an expansion valve.  It was not like a dryer.  It was on occasion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
554,1397,59,12,"Uh-huh.  Okay.  So it was -- it would be, let's say, the exception rather than the rule that you might be working removing and replacing a gasket?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
555,1400,59,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
556,1401,59,16,Okay.  And some of the work you also mentioned that you and your father did involved the Officers Club.  Is the work that you described at the NCO Club essentially the same as the Officers Club?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
557,1405,59,20,The same thing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
558,1406,59,21,And do the same percentages that we just described in terms of maintenance versus repair kind of apply to the Officers Club?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
559,1409,59,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
560,1411,60,1,"Okay.  And then within that repair percentage the amount of time you might be removing or replacing gaskets, again, was about the same at the Officers as it was at the NCO?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
561,1415,60,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
562,1416,60,6,Okay.  We've talked about the work that you did disassembling the cold storage in the mess halls.  We talked about the general maintenance that you helped your father with at the NCO and the Officers Club.  Any other work at Fort Devens that you recall assisting your father?,q,MR.

700,1702,71,17,Circumference.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
701,1703,71,18,"Oh, Circumference.  Thank you.  And so with respect to replacement gaskets, do you know who manufactured the replacement gaskets?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

704,1711,72,1,You would replace it to match the pump.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
705,1712,72,2,Gotcha.  Okay.  And then part of that replacement plate includes the gaskets?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
706,1714,72,4,"The gaskets.  So they came -- as I say, depending -- I'm not sure if it was a Copeland or depending on which pump was being worked on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
707,1717,72,7,"Okay.  Were -- did you ever do valve plate work on, for example, on AC units?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

709,1720,72,10,"We talked about that, right.  Okay.",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
710,1721,72,11,"So, no.  If something happened there, you would have to replace the compressor.  You could not replace these components to a sealed unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
711,1724,72,14,"Okay.  So you just take out one -- you take out the sealed unit, and you put in a new sealed unit?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
712,1727,72,17,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
713,1728,72,18,"Gotcha.  So if you were doing that kind of work, taking out a sealed unit and putting in a sealed unit, it didn't involve any gasket work?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
714,1731,72,21,Not usually.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
715,1732,72,22,"Okay.  Which begs the question, occasionally it might?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
716,1734,72,24,"I'm trying to think on some of the air-conditioners, but -- no, there was not a lot of gasket work on a sealed unit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
717,1738,73,3,"Gotcha.  Okay.  Other than those two types of repairs that you talked about, the front seal and the valve plate compressor work, any other types of repairs that might be performed -- basically, it's not in the field.  You're taking the unit back to the shop?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
718,1744,73,9,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

722,1749,73,14,"If it would get any worse than that, we just replaced it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
723,1751,73,16,"Fair enough.  So if you could replace the front seal or replace the valve plate, you might do that.  Anything above that, it just wasn't worth saving, per se?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
724,1755,73,20,"Per se, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
725,1756,73,21,"Okay.  When your father was employed by Fort Devens, that was a full-time job for him, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

880,2070,86,10,"Well, first of all, we had to determine the size of unit it was going to take to cool that area.  We did have an engineer that would come out, look at this particular application, and tell us what we were going to need.  Then it was my job to install.  There again, your compressor sat by itself. You had to run the tubing into the walk-in cooler. You had to hang an evaporator.  That's a cooling unit to cool the walk-in cooler.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

921,2172,90,12,Gotcha.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
922,2173,90,13,"Then after you did your initial blowing out of these units, the motors, then you checked the belts, and the big thing was you had to check the gas to make sure the unit was up to capacity on the amount of gas that it would hold.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
923,2178,90,18,"The building that this diner was in, was this an old building, or was the --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

So you would have to pump the unit down, change the dryers, or the other big component was the expansion valve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
935,2211,92,1,So the primary repairs would have been to replace the dryers or the expansion valves?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

940,2222,92,12,That would be a repair.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
941,2223,92,13,Okay.  What if it was something more than just replacing the brushes?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
942,2225,92,15,"Then usually removing the motor, replacing the motor, and getting the motor rebuilt.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
943,2227,92,17,"And rebuilding the motors, where would that take place?  Back at the family --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

952,2244,93,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
953,2245,93,10,Do you recall the manufacturers of any of the motors that you may have repaired or replaced?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
954,2247,93,12,"Well, I worked on many that were either GE or Westinghouse.  Those were the two big ones.  I know there were a few.  I do not remember those names.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
955,2251,93,16,Do you remember the manufacturer of any of the dryers that you would have had to replace?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
956,2253,93,18,Not the dryers.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
957,2254,93,19,Okay.  You talked about expansion valves in terms of repairs?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
958,2256,93,21,"Now, they could have been made by any one of the pump and valve companies, but I really can't pick one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
959,2259,93,24,Okay.  Any other repairs or maintenance that you recall personally performing for your father at the Park Street Diner?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
960,2263,94,3,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
961,2264,94,4,Okay.  Were there other diners that your father did this type of work for?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
962,2266,94,6,That was the main big account that we had.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
963,2267,94,7,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
964,2268,94,8,"There were a few other small ones, but -- I failed to mention ice cream companies that --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
965,2270,94,10,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
966,2271,94,11,-- we did work for.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
967,2272,94,12,"And when you say ""big account,"" is it fair to say that the Park Street Diner was your father's primary account across all of these, whether they be meat markets, bars, or ice cream?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
968,2276,94,16,That was a single biggest account just because it was new.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
969,2278,94,18,Yup.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
970,2279,94,19,And we did all the installation per se --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
971,2280,94,20,Gotcha.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
972,2281,94,21,"-- on the refrigeration.  Other accounts, I can name them, some of them, all of them, whatever, but a lot of those were already installed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
973,2284,94,24,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
974,2286,95,1,So now it was just a matter of repairing and maintaining.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
975,2288,95,3,"Okay.  And I guess I'd like to talk to you a little bit about some other accounts that you did have where you did do this type of maintenance or repair work.  So what other establishments, what other companies, did your father perform this maintenance or repair work at?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

982,2307,95,22,"Obviously, the -- we -- Hotel Lincoln was Main Street, Ayer, which is no longer.  It was the Wigwam, which was a beer establishment, which is no longer there.  The Shell Club in Shirley.  That's closed.

983,2316,96,6,Uh-huh.  Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
984,2317,96,7,Those are -- and many more.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

986,2323,96,13,"Yes.  And as I say, there were more --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
987,2324,96,14,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
988,2325,96,15,"-- but I just can't without, you know, doing some research.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

990,2329,96,19,What's that now?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
991,2330,96,20,If -- you said I could think of some more if I could do some research.  What would you do? What kind of research would you do?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer

994,2336,97,1,"Yeah, and that's tough.  Yeah, we had many more.  I had some in Pepperell.  I had some in Littleton.  So, yes, there were pizza shops.  There were other pizza shops in Ayer that we did work for, so, yeah, as I say.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
995,2341,97,6,"Were you working -- did you help your father at each and every one of these establishments, or is it one of those, I just know we had these as accounts; I can't tell you which ones I did work at versus which ones I didn't work at?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
996,2346,97,11,I worked at all of them at one time or another.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
997,2348,97,13,"And the type of work that was performed at, for example, The Triangle, the bar in Groton, do you have a specific memory of the type of work and the type of equipment that was worked on at The Triangle in Groton?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
998,2353,97,18,"As a simple fact, I worked on so many, and whether it's a beer cooler or a meat cooler, the functions are the same, and pretty much the products that I have named I couldn't name while there were so many of these Crane pumps, or, you know, what type because a lot of them you just interchanged.  You looked at the size.  You looked at the horsepower. You looked at whether it was a pump.  How much, you know, water that -- PSIs that involved.  So you matched it up.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
999,2364,98,4,"So I guess is it fair to say that you can't put a particular brand name product at a particular location?  For example, product X was at The Triangle and compressor Y was at Johnson's, and pump Z was at Ayer Meat Market; is that fair to say?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1000,2369,98,9,"Exactly, because the functions were all the same.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1001,2371,98,11,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1002,2372,98,12,"You know, you wanted to cool an area, and depending on how big the area is to how big of a unit you had.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1004,2378,98,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1005,2379,98,19,"And earlier you had mentioned that routine maintenance, the blowing out of the particular units, for example --",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1006,2382,98,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1007,2383,98,23,-- that routine maintenance was the primary work that you performed; is that fair to say?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1008,2386,99,1,That's correct to say.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1009,2387,99,2,"Okay.  And I thought we talked something about, like, 75 percent of the work might be maintenance versus 25 percent was repair?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1010,2390,99,5,Repair.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1011,2391,99,6,"And is that the same for what your father's business was, 75 percent maintenance, 25 percent repair?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1012,2394,99,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1013,2395,99,10,"Okay.  And the products that you worked with or the equipment that you worked with that you talked about thus far in terms of the NCO Club and The Officers Club, the diner, is that essentially the same type of equipment and units that were in these other places?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1014,2401,99,16,"Yes, it is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1015,2402,99,17,"Okay.  But, again, unable to tell me exactly what piece of equipment or manufacturer of what piece of equipment is at what place?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1016,2405,99,20,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1017,2406,99,21,"Okay.  When you -- what portion of your work for your father involved actually taking particular product, particular pieces of equipment back to the shop and doing some work on them? Remember we talked about that stuff in Fort Devens. On the side work, did your father do that kind of same stuff?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1018,2414,100,4,"That same stuff, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1019,2415,100,5,"But if it was a -- if it involved a motor, that was sent out?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1020,2417,100,7,The motor was replaced.  Then the motor that I took off --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1021,2419,100,9,Uh-huh.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1022,2420,100,10,"-- was replaced.  As I said, to replace that motor, whether it happened to be a GE, really didn't make any difference to me.  As long as the shaft size was the same, the horsepower was the same, my voltage was the same.  Whether it was a single-phase motor, a three-phase motor, that didn't matter as long as I had matched it up to what was there and replaced it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1023,2428,100,18,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1024,2429,100,19,So I didn't always replace it with the same brand of motor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1025,2431,100,21,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1026,2432,100,22,Because that didn't make any difference to me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1027,2434,100,24,"Right.  And I think you said the same thing about, for example, pumps.  As long as it -- as long as the function of the pump was the same, it didn't matter?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1028,2439,101,4,"As long as the function was the same.  If they didn't happen to carry the type of pump I needed, but they had a pump that was going to do the same job, I took the pump that was going to do the same job.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1029,2444,101,9,"Okay.  Now, you began working full-time in 1961 in the printing industry, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1030,2446,101,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1031,2447,101,12,All right.  So around the age of 21?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1032,2448,101,13,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1033,2449,101,14,"All right.  And once you started working for the printing company around the age of 21, and when you -- you got married in '61, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1034,2452,101,17,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1036,2456,101,21,It decreased.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1037,2457,101,22,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1038,2458,101,23,I spent more time on the maintenance end of it on weekends.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1039,2461,102,1,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1040,2462,102,2,Because now I'm starting to have a family and --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1041,2464,102,4,You have your own responsibilities?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1042,2465,102,5,-- I've got other obligations.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1043,2466,102,6,"Exactly.  Exactly.  So from 19 -- is it fair to say, then, from 1950, around the age of 10, to around 1961, was when you were more involved with your father's business?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1044,2470,102,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1045,2471,102,11,And mostly on weekends?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1046,2472,102,12,"Mostly, and nights was a big emergency problems.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1047,2474,102,14,"Okay.  All right.  So if there was an emergency, that's when your father might get a call?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1048,2476,102,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1049,2477,102,17,"Okay.  But the regular maintenance that you might be involved in would be more on the weekends, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1050,2480,102,20,More on the weekends.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1051,2481,102,21,Okay.  And I meant to ask.  Was your father a licensed AC guy?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1052,2483,102,23,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1053,2484,102,24,"Okay.  When he went and did his work, did he have to get any sort of special permits or anything to do his work?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1054,2488,103,3,Not back then.  That --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1055,2489,103,4,Go ahead.  Back then --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1056,2490,103,5,Back then you didn't need it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1057,2491,103,6,"Okay.  And then beginning in 1961 up until essentially 1971 when your father passed, your involvement with his company became less because, again, you had your own family, correct?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1058,2495,103,10,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1059,2496,103,11,"And so if you were working, it would have been more on the weekends doing some maintenance?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1060,2498,103,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1061,2499,103,14,"And then when your father passed in '71, your involvement with the company was essentially just to kind of wrap it up, right?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1062,2502,103,17,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1063,2503,103,18,"All right.  And since 1972, there's been no involvement with any sort of refrigeration work?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1064,2505,103,20,"Fair to say there were a few times trying to help someone out, but full-time involvement, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1065,2507,103,22,"You mentioned that your father on the side, as part of his side job, might also do some residential work?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1066,2511,104,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1067,2512,104,2,Were you ever -- did you ever assist your father at all in any of the residential work?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1068,2514,104,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1070,2517,104,7,"Well, all I know is there were two in Groton that I remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1071,2519,104,9,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1072,2520,104,10,"Both of them happened to be down on Route 40, and I can't say that I can remember the name of either one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1073,2523,104,13,Okay.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1074,2524,104,14,I'm sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1075,2525,104,15,That's all right.  Do you remember what type of work you helped your father perform at these two residences in Groton?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1076,2528,104,18,Usually it was refrigerator door gaskets and temperature switches.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1077,2530,104,20,"A refrigeration door gasket, is that just kind of a gasket?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1078,2532,104,22,"That was a seal that goes around your door, and for some reason back then people hung onto things longer than they do today.  So they got ratty after a while --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1079,2537,105,2,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1080,2538,105,3,"-- and leak and whatnot.  So you would replace it.  It was -- I didn't do that many.  So they were a pain in the neck, and that's why we basically never did home stuff.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1081,2542,105,7,"Okay.  But the door gasket, that's just a rubber gasket?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1082,2544,105,9,That's a rubber gasket.  It's held on some manner with some type of screws and plate.  Something to hold it in place.  Even back then they were not magnetic like they are today.  So you had a door latch that held the door tight.  So it was just a matter of replacing the gasket.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1083,2550,105,15,"The temperature switches, what did that entail?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1084,2552,105,17,"That basically -- it's a temperature switch.  In other words, it's set to come on, like, at 38.  When the evaporator gets to a certain temperature, whether 34 or something like that, it would shut the unit off.  So it was basically a start and stop switch, and it worked off of temperature.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1085,2558,105,23,"Okay.  And if that was faulty, what did you have to do to replace, to swap those out?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1086,2561,106,1,"You had a temperature control line.  It was like a flexible line, but it was made out of some -- like, aluminum.  It was soft.  It could get bent and whatnot.  And so you usually -- it's around the front of the door where you can see it when you open the door, and it's got, like, 1 to 10 on it or something like that --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1087,2568,106,8,Yeah.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1088,2569,106,9,"-- depending on what number you set it to. So then it's got the tubing that runs to the evaporator, and it works off of the temperature.  In other words, that's the sensor that comes to the switch.  Usually what happens is the points burn out, and once that happens, your switch is no good and doesn't function properly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1089,2576,106,16,So then you just -- it's just a matter of removing the old switch --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1090,2578,106,18,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1091,2579,106,19,-- and replacing that?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1092,2580,106,20,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1093,2581,106,21,Okay.  Was that -- was there any other type of work you recall doing with your father or for your father as part of his side work in any sort of residence -- residential setting other than the door gaskets or removing and replacing a temperature switch?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1094,2588,107,3,The only other one that I can think of right offhand was for Donald Priest.  We knew him. We did work for him in the cold storage.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1095,2591,107,6,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1096,2592,107,7,And he had an old refrigerator that we had to tie in a service valve and charge it every once in a while.  It had a slow leak somewhere.  We never did find it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1097,2596,107,11,Okay.  So this was just a matter of replacing whatever was leaking?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1098,2598,107,13,Yes.  Replace every once in a while. About once a year we'd have to charge it with a little more freon.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1099,2601,107,16,Okay.  Any other residential work that you recall?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1100,2603,107,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1101,2604,107,19,Okay.  Okay.  Having talked about -- are there any other types of work that you recall assisting your father at Groton Refrigeration that we've not touched upon?,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1102,2608,107,23,"Well, there are some places that I didn't name without -- yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1103,2611,108,1,Right.  I mean --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1104,2612,108,2,"There were many more, but nothing that would have meant doing any more serious work type of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1105,2615,108,5,Right.,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1106,2616,108,6,It was just maintenance.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1107,2617,108,7,"Okay.  And, yeah, you talked about The Triangle, and we kind of went through the Shell Club and Carlin's?",q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1108,2620,108,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1109,2621,108,11,And I understand that there are other businesses --,q,MR. HOOVER,start_answer
1110,2623,108,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1580,3642,149,7,"Evaporator, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1581,3643,149,8,"Okay.  So could you describe for me in laymen's terms, please, how -- how cooling is accomplished with, let's say, a liquid -- a liquid-cooled system, if you know?  You have a refrigerant, correct?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer

1583,3649,149,14,Yes.  So let's start with the refrigerant. What happens?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1584,3651,149,16,"Basically, that's what you've got a compressor for.  It compresses the gas.  Now it goes through your evaporator.  As it goes through the evaporator, it changes it over to a gas.  Then when it comes up to the evaporator, in the refrigerator it goes through an expansion valve, and that's like you open up your -- the older freezers, the evaporator was that whole section that got all ice on the inside in time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1585,3661,150,1,So --,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer

1587,3665,150,5,"Yeah.  Okay.  So we've got a couple of steps here, so it's a little confusing.",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1588,3667,150,7,"Yeah.  It goes from liquid to gas, and it keeps coming back again.  Meaning, depending on where it was going, whether it comes back as a gas stage, and then it's compressed to a liquid stage through the condenser.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1589,3672,150,12,"It's a cycle, is it not?  It's a cycle? It just keeps --",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1590,3674,150,14,It is a cycle.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1591,3675,150,15,"Okay.  All right.  So if we start with a liquid refrigerant, would it be fair to state that if we start with a refrigerant that's liquid, it vaporizes at some point in the system and becomes gaseous, correct?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1592,3680,150,20,That's right.  You go from one to the other.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1593,3682,150,22,"Okay.  And then in the system, the gas eventually gets condensed back into liquid?  Is that -- in laymen terms, is this -- am I understanding the system correctly, sir, based on your understanding?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1594,3687,151,2,That's what a condenser is for.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1595,3688,151,3,"Now, you talked about a compressor earlier.  What is the compressor doing?  Is that changing the gas to a liquid?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1596,3691,151,6,No.  It's building up pressure to send it to the condenser so now it can condense back to liquid.  It goes through the compressor as a gas.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1597,3694,151,9,"Okay.  Now, when you helped your dad out with respect to worksites outside of Fort Devens, you told us about the diner.  That was an installation.

1621,3759,153,24,"Now, could you describe for me, sir -- let's take the compressor first.  Could you describe how was -- how would the compressor be affixed to the frame?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1622,3764,154,4,"Basically, with four bolts and affixed to a quart -- I'm saying a quarter-inch steel frame. Obviously, everyone didn't make their frame out of the same thickness of metal, but I'm using that as a rule of thumb.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1623,3769,154,9,So the bolts would seat the compressor on the frame?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1624,3771,154,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1625,3772,154,12,And these bolts -- it was a bolt with a nut?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1626,3774,154,14,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1627,3775,154,15,"Okay.  And how -- what tool or tools would you or your dad use to, let's say, remove a compressor?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1628,3778,154,18,"Basically, half-inch, nine-sixteenths, whether an open end, a box, depending on how much room you had and -- because usually we were only removing four bolts.  So we really didn't get into a ratchet with a socket.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1629,3783,154,23,Okay.  And what about the condenser?  How would that be affixed to the frame?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1630,3786,155,1,"Basically, it was bolted to the frame and very seldom removed from that frame.  Meaning, that was a part that -- not unless there was some vibration and some wear that wore through the line you would be involved in replacing that, but usually that was very rare.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1631,3792,155,7,Okay.  How about the receiver?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1632,3793,155,8,"The receiver was nothing more than a cylinder.  As I say, it was welded and then welded on the two ends.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1633,3796,155,11,So would it be unusual to remove the receiver from the frame --,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1634,3798,155,13,"Yes, definitely.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1635,3799,155,14,-- Mr. Morton?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1636,3800,155,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1637,3801,155,16,"And could you tell me -- I'll get to the -- I'll get to the -- I guess the last piece would be a motor, but can you tell me the sizes approximately? I take it it's going to vary depending upon the output of the system?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1638,3806,155,21,"Right.  The amount of gas that's in the system, they would engineer the receiver to be able to hold all the gas in that system.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1639,3809,155,24,"So the receiver was a cylinder or a tank, if you will?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1640,3812,156,2,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1641,3813,156,3,"And it's holding gas.  It's not holding liquid, if you know?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1642,3815,156,5,"It's -- when you pumped it down and pumped it into the receiver, it was usually gas.  It was not in a liquid form.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1643,3818,156,8,Okay.  So what -- so could you give me your best estimate of the range of sizes -- dimensions of receivers that you encountered with your dad in the --,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1644,3822,156,12,"Well, as I say, that depended on the size of the compressor and the unit.  You know, if it was a half horsepower, you may have had a gallon-, gallon-and-a-half tank.  If it was a five horsepower, you would probably have a 15- to 20-gallon tank at least.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1645,3828,156,18,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1646,3829,156,19,So that would be a much longer tank that usually went on the bottom.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1647,3831,156,21,"But this tank, it's not welded onto the -- is it welded onto the frame?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1648,3833,156,23,"Usually they had, like, a U-bolt or something like that to hold -- hold it in place.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1649,3836,157,1,Okay.  And how about the motor?  Is -- was the motor also affixed by these -- this bolting system?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1650,3839,157,4,By bolting systems.  The motor itself had slots so you could tighten the motor up to tighten up your belts.  So it could move one way or the other at least an inch.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1651,3843,157,8,"And when you say ""to tighten up your belts,"" you're talking about the -- the belts that the motor -- that are being driven?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1652,3846,157,11,The motor turned the belts.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1653,3847,157,12,Right.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1654,3848,157,13,And the belts turned the compressor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1655,3849,157,14,"Okay.  And is the motor -- I know I asked this, but I'm not sure you got to it in your answer, but you told us that the -- you know, there is -- there's play that was designed into the system to permit the motor to be moved, and I think you said approximately an inch, so that the belts stayed tight.  But how was the motor -- how were the motors affixed or seated in the frames?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1656,3857,157,22,"Basically, they were seated in the frame as nuts and bolts.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1657,3859,157,24,"So these nuts and bolt -- with respect to these pieces of equipment, I take it there were legs -- were there legs on the pieces of equipment that through which the bolt -- the nut and bolt system -- in other words, how did it -- it's sitting -- I'm trying to visualize this.",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1658,3866,158,6,It did not sit flat.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1659,3867,158,7,I see.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1660,3868,158,8,"Most of them, whether it was pressed and cut metal.  The frame was cut, so the frame sat up, and, yeah, there were four legs.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1661,3871,158,11,With feet?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1662,3872,158,12,Yeah.  In some manner.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1663,3873,158,13,"So the frames -- I'm just trying to move this along.  The frames -- would it be fair to state that the frames were engineered and designed in such a way as to accept affixing of the various pieces of equipment on the frame so that the pieces of equipment on the frame vibrated as least -- as little as possible, correct?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1664,3880,158,20,You've got that correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1665,3881,158,21,"Okay.  Now, you told us that your dad had, for lack of a better description, had a shop, if you will, in the garage at your home?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1666,3884,158,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1667,3886,159,1,"And I think you told us that you -- from time to time your father took back to the garage compressors -- no.  Strike that.  Condensers.  Let me ask a better question.  Sorry.  Strike the question. I think you told us this morning that from time to time your father would take back to the home, to the garage, condensers that needed attention?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_chat

1669,3896,159,11,So what am I supposed to do here?,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
1670,3898,159,13,"Just for future reference, Mr. Morton, I may need to object to the attorneys' questions throughout the day.  But unless I instruct you not to answer, I want you to assume that you have to answer all of the questions.  He's asking you about a topic that we already discussed earlier today, but I'm going to allow you to clarify or to continue to answer his question for now.  Okay?",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
1671,3906,159,21,Okay.  I'm certainly going to need you to repeat it.  I'm sorry.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat

1676,3918,160,8,Did your dad from time to time take condensers from worksites back to the garage at your home for work?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1677,3921,160,11,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1678,3922,160,12,Okay.  Then let me ask you another question.  Did your dad from time to time take compressors from worksites back to the garage for attention?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1679,3926,160,16,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
1680,3927,160,17,Objection.  Asked and answered.  He clearly -- he made that abundantly clear earlier this morning.,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
1681,3930,160,20,"Sir, it's a foundational question.",side_chat,MR. MOCCIA,start_chat
1682,3932,160,22,"It's also asked and answered.  He talked at length about compressors that his dad used to bring back.  Now you're asking him if his dad brought back compressors.  It's asked and answered.  If you want to ask a follow-up question, I think that would be more appropriate.  If we were to ask a foundational question for all your questions, we'd be here for days.  That's my only point, sir.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
1683,3941,161,6,Are you finished?  Yes?,side_chat,MR. MOCCIA,start_chat

1687,3948,161,13,"Objection.  Asked and answered.  You just asked him that question, and he said that no condensers were brought back to the shop.  If you want, we can get a read back to confirm that.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_question
1688,3954,161,19,What equipment did your father take back to the shop for --,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_chat
1689,3956,161,21,Objection.  Asked and answered.  We went over this this morning.,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_question
1690,3959,161,24,You can still answer.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_chat
1691,3961,162,1,"And he talked about the compressors and the valve plates that his dad used to bring back to the shop.  This is becoming harassment at this point.  These same questions were asked earlier this morning.  These same exact questions. Am I missing something here, guys?",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
1692,3967,162,7,"We've established that compressors were back brought, right?",side_chat,MR. HOOVER,start_chat
1693,3969,162,9,We did.  We absolutely did.,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
1694,3970,162,10,Okay.  Now there may be some follow-ups there.,side_chat,MR. HOOVER,start_chat
1695,3972,162,12,Okay.  And that's fine.  I'm not objecting to any follow-up questions regarding the compressors.,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
1696,3975,162,15,Fair enough.,side_chat,MR. HOOVER,start_chat

1698,3977,162,17,"Not yet, sir.  Just let him ask the question.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
1699,3979,162,19,All right.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1700,3981,162,21,"In order to take a compressor from a worksite back to the garage at your dad's home, describe for me physically what had to be done to remove the compressor from the unit.",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1701,3986,163,1,"Basically, you would -- as long as the compressor still worked halfway, you'd pump the unit down, meaning the gas out of the system into the receiver.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1702,3990,163,5,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1703,3991,163,6,Then you'd -- then you could remove the compressor without losing all the gas into the atmosphere.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1704,3994,163,9,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1705,3995,163,10,"Then you would remove the compressor by removing the valves.  There were two valves.  There was an intake and a high side and a low side. Meaning, one was a cold return, and the other was hot gas that came out of that side.  The cold side, you usually could remove that gasket fairly easy.  On the high side, it was a very hot application, so that gasket you had to work at.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1706,4003,163,18,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1707,4004,163,19,"When I say ""work at,"" meaning, usually using a chisel to separate it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1708,4006,163,21,And how would you physically remove the piece of equipment from the frame?  Is this the bolt system?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1709,4009,163,24,Then -- now your compressor is separated.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1710,4011,164,1,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1711,4012,164,2,Your lines are no longer going to --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1712,4013,164,3,I'm with you.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1713,4014,164,4,Now you take your four bolts off the bottom and remove the compressor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1714,4016,164,6,"Okay.  I got it.  So with respect to the other components of a system, those being the receiver, the condenser, the motor, and let's leave the switch aside for a minute.  The condenser -- the condenser, the motor, and the receiver, were there ever occasions when you -- when your dad had to remove one of those components from the system and take it back to the garage at your house?  Yes or no?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1715,4024,164,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1716,4025,164,15,Okay.  Which components?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1717,4026,164,16,The electric motor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1718,4027,164,17,Okay.  Any others?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1719,4028,164,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1720,4029,164,19,"Okay.  And with respect to the electric motors, how many times did that happen, if you can recall?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1721,4032,164,22,Many.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1722,4033,164,23,Okay.  And could you describe for me how you would disassemble and remove the electric motor from the system?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1723,4037,165,2,"To explain it very simple, obviously, the electric motor failed, and you had to replace it. Meaning, you had four bolts.  You had a fan blade if it was an air-cooled unit, and you'd have at least two belts.  Maybe one or two belts.  Maybe three. Then you would have to remove the pulley and fan assembly from the motor, and then you could physically pick the motor up and bring it back to the shop.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1724,4046,165,11,"Okay.  And when you -- before physically picking the motor up and bringing it back to the shop, I take it you had to unbolt it?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1725,4049,165,14,You had to unbolt it.  You had to have a replacement motor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1726,4051,165,16,"Okay.  And when you got these motors back to the garage, is that where you were taking them? Or perhaps you were taking them to another location depending on what was wrong with the motor?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1727,4055,165,20,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1728,4056,165,21,All right.  So if they were going back to your garage at your house -- strike that. Did any go back to your garage at the house?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1729,4059,165,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1730,4061,166,1,Okay.  And on what occasions would they go back to your garage at the house?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_chat
1731,4063,166,3,You mean for what reasons?,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_question
1732,4065,166,5,For what reason -- strike the question. For what reason would they go back to your garage at the house?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1733,4068,166,8,"Very seldom did they go back to the garage or the shed, whatever you want to -- more of a shed would be the proper terminology.  It was not a garage as would you think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1734,4072,166,12,Okay.  I'll call it a shed from now on.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1735,4073,166,13,"Okay.  Very seldom did they go back there because usually when we had to replace them, the motor had failed, and we just took them to Leominster to the person that rebuilt the motors for us.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1736,4077,166,17,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1737,4078,166,18,He would then take care of that end of it and repair the motor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1738,4080,166,20,"Okay.  So would it be fair to state, sir, that your dad and you never rebuilt a motor?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1739,4082,166,22,That's fair to say.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1740,4083,166,23,And if the motors were being brought back to the shed -- and I know you said it was very seldom -- were they being brought back to the shed to be held to bring back to Leominster?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1741,4088,167,3,"That is about the only reason we'd bring it back to the shed, to tell you the truth.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1742,4090,167,5,Got it.  Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1743,4091,167,6,"Because if it was only one motor involved and we had some spares, we would wait until we had more than one motor to take back -- take to Leominster at a time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1744,4095,167,10,"Okay.  Now, the shop in Leominster, I think you were asked, but you don't recall the name of the shop in Leominster?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_chat
1745,4098,167,13,Objection.  Asked and answered.,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_answer
1746,4100,167,15,"No, I don't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1747,4101,167,16,Do you know the name of the person who worked at the shop?  The owner of the shop or any of the workers at the shop?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer

1751,4108,167,23,Where was it located in Leominster?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1752,4109,167,24,All I know it was off of Route 13 in Leominster.  I know that's one of the side streets. I do not know the name of the street.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1753,4113,168,3,"Okay.  Now, earlier this morning, you also told us that from time to time -- strike that. Also this morning, you told us that you worked on brushes.  You had occasion to work on brushes and motors.  Do you remember that testimony?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1754,4118,168,8,Yes.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1755,4119,168,9,"So describe for me what's a brush in a motor, please?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1756,4121,168,11,"It is -- either your electrical motors had two starting.  One was what they call a brush motor -- all right -- where the brushes actually started that motor.  Then you had a capacitor motor. The brushes rode up against an armature, and they would wear out, and you would have to replace these brushes.  These brushes were a carbon material.  All I know is it was a black carbon material.  And you would replace the brushes, and you would clean the armature because with the old brushes that arced over a period of time, the armature got very dirty.  So you take emery paper and clean that armature, blow the motor out, and then you put in new brushes.  So basically, you were usually off and running.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1757,4136,169,1,Okay.  And where did you do this brush replacement work?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1758,4138,169,3,Usually you did it --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1759,4139,169,4,On-site?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1760,4140,169,5,-- on-site.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1761,4141,169,6,"And do you recall whether the brushes came in a brush assembly?  Did they snap in, sir?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1762,4143,169,8,You could replace both.  Usually we just replaced the brushes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1763,4145,169,10,"Okay.  So let me ask you with respect to the brushes, if I could, sir.  Were they -- were they part of what I might call a brush assembly?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1764,4148,169,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1765,4149,169,14,Okay.  And would it be fair to state that it was a -- do you know what a tension control system is?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1766,4152,169,17,Yeah.  Basically -- yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1767,4153,169,18,What's a tension control system?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1768,4154,169,19,"Basically, it controls pressure.  These pressures had to be up against the armature.  All right.  Once you -- the motor was called to start -- all right -- and gets up to a certain speed, this brush assembly would click out.  So now the motor is running strictly on the armature.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1769,4161,170,1,"Yes.  And when I use the term a ""tension system"" -- not attention -- ""tension system"" -- the tension system was designed to provide a mechanism through which the brushes could maintain contact with the armature, correct?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1770,4166,170,6,To my knowledge.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1771,4167,170,7,"But that wasn't an area that -- that you were trained in in any way, were you?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1772,4169,170,9,I was trained in how to change the brushes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1773,4171,170,11,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1774,4172,170,12,Not to change the brush assembly --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1808,4231,172,21,Okay.  And how about shaft size?  What range of shaft sizes?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1809,4233,172,23,I'm going to say anywhere from a half inch up to at least -- on the larger ones were an inch to an inch and a quarter.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1810,4237,173,2,And were there voltage ratings of these motors?  Do you know?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer

1816,4250,173,15,"You testified this morning that you remember encountering both General Electric and Westinghouse motors in the field.

1819,4265,174,5,"No, because there were many, and where we replaced motors, but not necessarily with the same brand of motor that was on there.  The only thing we replaced had the same shaft size.  It had the same whole configuration, meaning where the slots were in the motor.  And, obviously, the horsepower.  The voltage.  So if it was the same -- whatever kind of motor was there we took off and replaced it with a replacement motor, but the replacement motor could have been either one.  We used many, as I say, in both GE and Westinghouse.  We used many of them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1820,4276,174,16,And did you also replace with other brands?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer

1825,4284,174,24,"Just over a period of time, if a compressor failed and we could not fix the compressor and the motor was fine, then that would become a replacement motor.  So in other words, if we could salvage anything from the unit -- so that's how we -- and we purchased some.  You could -- he would -- meaning, the person that repaired our motors, he had motors that he would sell us.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1829,4300,175,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1834,4309,175,24,"Now, those smaller fan circulating motors, how many horsepower were those?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1835,4312,176,2,"Those went right down to a third horsepower.  One-sixteenth, you know.  All they had to do was turn a fan blade.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1844,4330,176,20,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
1845,4331,176,21,"Obviously, you got into some of the bigger ones on some of the air-conditioning units.  They're a little bigger.  They went up -- oh, horsepower -- you know, I really -- I'd have to look at the nameplate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

The last thing I want to talk to you about is you mentioned valves, and we've talked about the Crane Co. valves that you installed and removed in your home earlier today.  I now want to talk to you -- you said that the circulating pumps that you encountered in the field typically came with an expansion valve which you believe was from the same manufacturer.  Is that a correct summary of your testimony?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2489,5675,230,15,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2490,5676,230,16,"Okay.  I know you said you only worked with or around a few Crane Co. pumps.  Would it be fair to say, then, that you also only worked with or around a few Crane Co. expansion valves out in the field while assisting your dad?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2491,5681,230,21,"We worked with many different ones.  So I would say it was more than a few, but I could not say how many.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2492,5684,230,24,"Okay.  When you say ""many different ones,"" what --",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2493,5687,231,2,"Because every valve I put on, I didn't pay attention to the manufacturer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2494,5689,231,4,"Fair enough.  Okay.  Let me ask you.  With regard to the Crane Co. pumps that you worked with, are you able to give me a good faith estimate without guessing of how many pumps that you encountered were Crane Co. pumps versus the other brand of pumps that you encountered?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2495,5695,231,10,"No, I cannot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2496,5696,231,11,Okay.  Are you able to -- the same question for valves.  Are you able to tell me the percentage of Crane Co. valves you encountered in the field while assisting your dad as opposed to other brands of valves which you worked with and around?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2497,5701,231,16,"No, I cannot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2498,5702,231,17,Okay.  Am I correct that you were never in charge of ordering products for your father's company?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2499,5705,231,20,You're correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2500,5706,231,21,Okay.  And would he have been the person in charge?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2501,5708,231,23,I was not in charge.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2502,5709,231,24,Right.  I understand you weren't.  Am I correct that your father was the one who was in charge of ordering products and supplies --,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2503,5713,232,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2504,5714,232,4,-- for the company?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2505,5715,232,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2506,5716,232,6,Okay.  Did he have accounts with any particular supply houses?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2507,5718,232,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2508,5719,232,9,Could you tell me which one or ones you believe he had accounts with?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2509,5721,232,11,Standard Supply in Worcester.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2510,5722,232,12,Okay.  Did your father ever purchase expansion valves for use in his business independently of his purchase of an accompanying pump or if -- do you understand my question?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2511,5726,232,16,"Not really.  I think what your question is, is did he purchase these things from different supply companies, and the answer is no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2512,5729,232,19,"No.  The answer is no.  Okay.  Well, and I appreciate that, and my question was bad, so I'm going to try it again. You testified that the expansion -- I'm sorry -- that the pumps came with a -- typically came with an expansion valve, right?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2513,5736,233,1,The pumps had nothing to do with the expansion valve.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2514,5738,233,3,Okay.  I'm a little confused then.  I -- maybe I misunderstood your testimony.  I thought that the -- you indicated that the pumps were typically the same manufacturer as the expansion -- as the associated expansion valve?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2515,5743,233,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2516,5744,233,9,Is that correct?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2517,5745,233,10,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2518,5746,233,11,Okay.  Okay.  But they weren't -- they didn't come in the same package?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2519,5748,233,13,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2520,5749,233,14,"Okay.  So they -- gotcha.  All right.  So if you were -- if your dad was purchasing a brand X pump, he would typically then go ahead and purchase a brand X expansion valve; is that correct?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2521,5753,233,18,"He didn't have to purchase the same type. Put it that way, if that makes sense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2522,5755,233,20,"It does.  Let me try and clarify that a little bit for my own sake.  So you didn't have to use, for example, a Crane Co. expansion valve with a Crane Co. pump?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2523,5759,233,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2524,5761,234,1,That's correct.  Okay.  Was there any rationale or formula or some reasoning why you -- when you would use a Crane Co. expansion valve with a Crane Co. pump?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2525,5765,234,5,No.  The two were different functions. Put it that way.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2526,5767,234,7,Okay.,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2527,5768,234,8,So you could use -- you did not have to use the same.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2528,5770,234,10,"Okay.  So if they did happen to be the same, it was just luck of the draw; it wasn't by design?  Is that fair to say?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2529,5773,234,13,That's correct to say.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2530,5774,234,14,Gotcha.  Thank you.  All right.  So let's talk about those valves.  Did your dad purchase Crane Co. expansion valves for use in his business?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2531,5777,234,17,"All I can say is he did purchase them, and they -- all I can tell you is where they came from.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2532,5779,234,19,"Okay.  All right.  So he did purchase them, and you already told me where he purchased, correct?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2533,5782,234,22,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2534,5783,234,23,We talked about that.  Okay.  Can you tell me the physical dimensions of those expansion valves?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2535,5786,235,1,"No, I really can't.  I can tell you one took in a half-inch to five-eighths flare nut, and the other connection was anywhere from a quarter- to three-quarter-inch flare nut.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2536,5790,235,5,"Okay.  So were these valves -- they were connected in the system by -- well, strike that. How were they connected to the systems?  Were they soldered?  Were they brazed?  Were they threaded?  Were they flanged?  Were they some combination?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2537,5796,235,11,They were flanged.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2538,5797,235,12,Okay.  And --,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2539,5798,235,13,Well --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2540,5799,235,14,Did you -- sorry.  Go ahead.,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2541,5800,235,15,"They were connected by flare nuts.  So, yes, a flange.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2542,5802,235,17,Okay.  Gotcha.  Did you ever install or assist your father in installing a new Crane Co. expansion valve?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2543,5805,235,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2544,5806,235,21,"Okay.  Much like the pumps, is it fair to say that you don't recall a specific location where you installed a new Crane Co. expansion valve, but rather you have a general memory of installing them over the course of the time you assisted your father?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2545,5812,236,2,All I can say is installed many of them over a period of time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2546,5814,236,4,Okay.  But you can't give me any specific locations; is that correct?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2547,5816,236,6,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2548,5817,236,7,Okay.  What type of material flowed through the Crane Co. expansion valves?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2549,5819,236,9,"Basically, brass and copper.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2550,5820,236,10,Okay.  So they were made of brass and copper.  Can you tell me what type of material flowed through the valves?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2551,5823,236,13,Freon gas.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2552,5824,236,14,Freon gas.  Okay.  And what was the temperature of that freon gas?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2553,5826,236,16,"Without referring to a manual, I -- I can't give you the actual temperatures.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2554,5828,236,18,"Understood.  Are you able to give, without guessing, a good faith estimate of the temperature of that freon gas?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2555,5831,236,21,No.  I'm not even going to try.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2556,5832,236,22,"Fair enough.  All right.  When a new -- when you purchased a new Crane Co. expansion valve, what kind of packaging did it come in?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2557,5836,237,1,They came in a fairly light cardboard box.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2558,5837,237,2,"Okay.  Do you remember what, if anything, was written on the box itself?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2559,5839,237,4,"No, I don't remember that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2560,5840,237,5,"Okay.  Do you recall what, if anything, was -- identified the valve as a Crane Co. valve?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2561,5842,237,7,"No, I don't for the simple fact I paid attention to the size of the inlet and the outlet of the valve.  Not so much the name or anything else.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2562,5845,237,10,Okay.  Let me ask you this.  You talked about the process of installing valves in your home -- Crane Co. valves.  Would it be the same process for installing one of these Crane Co. expansion valves out in the field when you were assisting your father?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2563,5851,237,16,"Out in the field, you would use these.  In the home, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2564,5853,237,18,"Correct.  And that's a good clarification. The -- but the installation process itself, I understand that you would not use these valves in a home, but the process of installing a new valve, was it the same process that you went through to install a Crane Co. expansion valve in the field as you used to install, you know, one of the gate valves in your home?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2565,5862,238,2,"No, because basically you didn't use an expansion valve in the house.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2566,5864,238,4,Okay.  So I guess in that case can you describe for me how you would install a new Crane Co. expansion valve out in the field?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2567,5867,238,7,I just described that.  You -- you pumped down a system --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2568,5869,238,9,"Well, okay --",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2569,5870,238,10,"-- and you had two flare nuts, and that's what held the valve in there, and, obviously, you'd loosen them up and take the valve out, and then replace it with a new one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2570,5874,238,14,"Okay.  The -- where did you obtain the new -- well, strike that. Where did you obtain the new gasket material that you would use when you were installing a new Crane expansion valve?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2571,5879,238,19,There was no packing material on the expansion valve.  That was put --,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
2572,5881,238,21,"Mr. Morton, listen to his questions carefully.  Okay?  I know it's getting late in the day, but just listen as carefully as you can. He's asking about gaskets, not packing.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_question
2573,5887,239,2,"Okay.  Let me -- let me -- let me do a few things here. First, I just want to clarify that there was no packing in the expansion valves; is that correct?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2574,5891,239,6,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2575,5892,239,7,"Okay.  With regard to the flange gaskets that you used when installing a new Crane Co. expansion valve, where did you get those new flange gaskets from?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2576,5896,239,11,Are you talking about the circulating Crane pump?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2577,5898,239,13,"No, sir.",q,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2578,5899,239,14,"Jose, do you want to talk for a second?",side_chat,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2579,5901,239,16,Yeah.  Why don't we take a -- why don't we take a quick little break.,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
2580,5903,239,18,Okay.  That's fine.,side_chat,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2581,5904,239,19,"The time is approximately 4:37, and we are off the record.",side_chat,THE VIDEOGRAPHER,is brackets

2584,5912,240,2,"And, Mike, Mr. Morton just wants to clarify something that he may have been mixed up with, which was part of the reason why we -- he was a little confused right now just before the break.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
2585,5917,240,7,"I think I know what it might be, but, yeah.",side_chat,MR. SIMONS,start_question
2586,5920,240,10,"Sir, go ahead, please.",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2587,5921,240,11,"Well, basically, for some reason I think when you're saying ""expansion valve,"" I might have made the mistake.  Maybe Crane did not make the expansion valve because I'm listening to your questions, and I don't think you're talking about the same type of expansion valve that I am.  I've got the stem valves.  I've got the gate valves, and circulating pump.  Stuff like that. So, anyway, if you want to keep going on the expansion valves, we can hopefully straighten it out, and maybe I've made a mistake, and maybe they were not Crane expansion valves.  So I'm just not sure now.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2588,5934,240,24,"Okay.  Let's try this, then.  I believe you had previously testified that Crane Co. manufactured an expansion valve which you encountered in the field while assisting your father.  Am I correct that your present memory is that that may have been an error, and, in fact, you do not believe Crane Co. manufactured expansion valves?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2589,5942,241,7,"The way your questions are coming, it raises questions in my mind whether, in fact, I've made a mistake when I said that.  If that makes sense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2590,5946,241,11,"It does.  I don't want to not do my job and basically, you know, not follow up thoroughly with you. As you sit here today right now, do you believe that you encountered expansion valves which were manufactured by Crane Co.?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2591,5952,241,17,"That was my belief, but I may have made a mistake, and maybe they were not.  Maybe -- maybe you don't make expansion valves, because the expansion valves, they do not take a packing or anything like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2592,5957,241,22,"Okay.  Let me ask you generally.  Do expansion valves, you said they were connected by a flare nut?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2593,5961,242,1,A flare nut is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2594,5962,242,2,"A flare nut.  Correct.  Am I correct, then, that that does not -- that those expansion valves, then, do not use flanged gaskets?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2595,5965,242,5,Could you repeat that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2596,5966,242,6,"Sure.  If the connection is to a flare nut, am I -- is it also correct that there is no flanged gasket used --",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2597,5969,242,9,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2598,5970,242,10,-- to connect the expansion valve?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2599,5971,242,11,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2600,5972,242,12,Okay.  All right.  Then let's move on from those for now. You just mentioned a couple other different types of Crane Co. valves that you said -- gate valve and globe valves; that is correct?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2601,5977,242,17,"The stem valve and the gate valve, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2602,5978,242,18,"Okay.  Stem valve and gate valves.  Okay. Let's talk about those, and I'll try to see if we can do it wrapped up together to save some time. Do you recall encountering those types of Crane Co. valves out in the field while assisting your father?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2603,5984,242,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2604,5986,243,1,Okay.  Can you tell me what those valves were made out of?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2605,5988,243,3,"They were copper.  Copper and brass, and, yes, you did have stem packing that you could repair the leak on the valve with.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2606,5991,243,6,"Okay.  You've gone way beyond my question, but let's -- we'll get into all that later.  It might be a little while later, but we'll get to it. What were the size range in terms of inlet and outlet of these valves?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2607,5996,243,11,"Well, there again, there were many different sizes going from a half-inch on up to two-inch and even -- they made bigger ones, but those --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2608,6000,243,15,"What size did you, in particular, encounter out in the field while assisting your dad?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2609,6002,243,17,Anywhere from a half an inch to an inch and a half.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2610,6004,243,19,Thank you.  Okay.  Did you install new Crane Co. stem and gate valves?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2611,6006,243,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2612,6007,243,22,Okay.  Where did your dad obtain those valves from?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2613,6009,243,24,Standard Supply in Worcester.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2614,6011,244,1,Okay.  What was the packaging like that those valves came in?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2615,6013,244,3,"Other than a cardboard box, that was basically it, and other than the --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2616,6015,244,5,Do you recall --,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2617,6016,244,6,-- size and the information -- the technical information about the valve was on the box.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2618,6018,244,8,"Okay.  So the technical information, that's what you recall as being written on the -- printed on the box was technical information about the valves themselves?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2619,6022,244,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2620,6023,244,13,What kind of technical information?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2621,6024,244,14,The size of the valve.  The stem size of the valve.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2622,6026,244,16,Okay.  Anything else?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2623,6027,244,17,"That was the main thing, and the flow of the valve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2624,6029,244,19,Okay.  Did the packaging include any other written material apart from what was printed on the package itself?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2625,6032,244,22,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2626,6033,244,23,Okay.  You said these ranged in size from approximately a half inch to an inch and a half.  Can you tell me how were these connected into the system? Were they brazed?  Were they soldered?  Something else?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2627,6039,245,4,"Most of them were soldered, and then the others had a flange with a gasket.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2628,6041,245,6,Okay.  Can you tell me what percentage were soldered versus flanged of the ones you installed?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2629,6044,245,9,Usually on up to one-inch was soldered. Then you got into the larger ones.  They were flanged with a flange -- soldered flange.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2630,6047,245,12,Okay.  Can you -- are you able to -- you said most of them were soldered.  Are you able to give me a good faith estimate without guessing of the percentage of the new Crane Co. valves which you installed which were soldered versus a percentage which were flanged?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2631,6053,245,18,"No, I cannot give you a percentage.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2632,6054,245,19,Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Okay.  Are you able to tell me what percentage of the stem and gate valves that you worked with out in the field were manufactured by Crane Co. versus other manufacturers' brands of those same types of valves?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2633,6059,245,24,It just so happened Standard Supply carried a lot of the Crane Co. valves.  So that's the reason we used their valves.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2634,6063,246,3,"Okay.  Are you able -- again, I'll go back to my question, and if it wasn't clear, I apologize. Are you able to give me a good faith estimate without guessing of what percentage of the valves that you installed were Crane Co. versus other brands?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2635,6068,246,8,"Without guessing, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2636,6069,246,9,"Fair enough.  Okay.  The gaskets which you would use to install on the new Crane Co. valves which were flanged, where did you obtain those gaskets?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2637,6073,246,13,That would have been Standard Supplies.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2638,6074,246,14,Okay.  Were those gaskets precut to size?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2639,6075,246,15,"They were precut gaskets, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2640,6076,246,16,"So as before, am I correct you would not have to cut, drill, sand, or otherwise manipulate those gaskets to install the new valves; is that correct?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2641,6080,246,20,"When you remove the old valve, you had to scrape the flanges.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2642,6082,246,22,"Okay.  Sir, that wasn't my question.",q,MR. SIMONS,start_chat

2647,6093,247,8,"Sir, let me ask you again.  When you installed those new gaskets on the new valves that were precut gaskets, am I correct that you did not have to cut, scrape, sand, or otherwise manipulate those new gaskets?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2648,6098,247,13,"Just on the valve, no, you didn't have to manipulate it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2649,6100,247,15,Okay.  You testified earlier that the gaskets -- the precut flanged gaskets which you used had been reddish in color.  Was that the same type of gasket that you would use when installing a new Crane Co. valve?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2650,6105,247,20,I'm not sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2651,6106,247,21,"Okay.  Do you recall what color the new flanged gaskets which were precut, what color they were?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2652,6109,247,24,They were either black or a very dull reddish color.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2653,6112,248,2,Okay.  Are you able to -- do you know the composition of either the black gaskets or the reddish-colored gaskets?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2654,6115,248,5,The reddish-colored gaskets were some type of a rubberlike material.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2655,6117,248,7,Okay.,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2656,6118,248,8,"The black gaskets, no, I have no idea what the composition was of the black gasket, except they were --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2657,6121,248,11,"How -- sorry, sir.  Go ahead.",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2658,6122,248,12,Except they were a very hard material.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2659,6123,248,13,Okay.  How thick were the black and the red gaskets?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2660,6125,248,15,The red gaskets could have been as much as an eighth of an inch thick.  The black gaskets were thinner.  Sixteenth of an inch.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2661,6128,248,18,Okay.  Did those gaskets -- you said they were obtained from the supply house.  Were they obtained independently of the valves themselves?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2662,6131,248,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2663,6132,248,22,Okay.  How long would it take to install one of these precut gaskets onto the flange?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2664,6134,248,24,"Well, on the flange that's soldered to the pipe, you would have to clean that gasket. Obviously, you wouldn't have to clean the old pump because you weren't putting the old pump back on.  So you had to clean two areas.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2665,6140,249,5,"Okay.  Was there ever a situation where you were installing a new Crane Co. valve for the first time in the system?  In other words, where you didn't have to remove a preexisting valve or where the one you were installing was the very first one to be installed in the system?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2666,6146,249,11,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2667,6147,249,12,Did that situation ever occur?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2668,6148,249,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2669,6149,249,14,"Okay.  So am I correct, then, that there wouldn't -- you wouldn't have to do any scraping if you were installing the valves -- the first valve into that system?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2670,6153,249,18,"A new valve, a new flange, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2671,6154,249,19,Okay.  How often did you have to do -- encounter that situation with a Crane Co. valve while assisting your father?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2672,6157,249,22,Probably 20 times.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2673,6158,249,23,"Okay.  And in that situation, how long would it take to install the new precut gasket onto the new flange?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2674,6162,250,2,Fifteen minutes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2675,6163,250,3,Okay.  Was that just a matter of putting it on and turning it a little bit so it was in the right place and then bolting it together?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2676,6166,250,6,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2677,6167,250,7,Okay.  All right.  Any other work involved in installing -- just the installing portion -- of a new Crane Co. stem or gate valve which we haven't discussed yet?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2678,6171,250,11,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2679,6172,250,12,Okay.  Let's move on.  Did you ever do any maintenance or repair work on a Crane Co. stem or gate valve which was already in line?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2680,6175,250,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2681,6176,250,16,Okay.  Am I correct that in such a situation you would not know the prior maintenance history for that particular valve?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2682,6179,250,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2683,6180,250,20,"And am I correct that, as you would not know the prior maintenance history for that valve, you would not know whether any of the flanged gaskets were the original gaskets that were installed when that valve first went into place?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2684,6186,251,1,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2685,6187,251,2,"And I am correct that you wouldn't know if there was -- if the valve contained packing, whether that packing was original to the valve or had been replaced prior to the time you had to do your work on it?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2686,6192,251,7,I have no idea.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2687,6193,251,8,Okay.  What type of maintenance or repair work would you have to do on these valves that were sealed while assisting your father?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2688,6196,251,11,"If they were leaking, you would loosen up the flange nut on the stem, and we would have broke gasket material, and you would wrap that several times and then tighten up the stem nut to tighten that up against the shaft of the valve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2689,6201,251,16,Okay.  Did you ever have to remove the old packing?  The preexisting packing --,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2690,6203,251,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2691,6204,251,19,-- from those valves?  Okay.  How would you go about that?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2692,6206,251,21,With a sharp object that you could dig into it without gouging the shaft or the body of the valve.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2693,6209,251,24,Okay.  How long would that take on average?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2694,6212,252,2,Twenty minutes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2695,6213,252,3,Okay.  Would you need to remove all of the packing at that time or just some of it?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2696,6215,252,5,You tried to remove it all.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2697,6216,252,6,"Let me ask you.  If a valve were leaking, as you described, would the first step that you would take be to tighten the packing nut to see if that stopped the leak?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2698,6220,252,10,"Yes, that would be the first step.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2699,6221,252,11,"Okay.  And how often did doing that, tightening the packing nut, correct the leakage problem?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2700,6224,252,14,"If the valve was leaking, that's the first step you would do is trying to tighten up the flange, and sometimes that's all it took, and you didn't have to remove the packing or anything.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2701,6228,252,18,"Sure.  And I guess my question to follow up is, are you able to tell me a good faith estimate without guessing how often doing that, tightening that nut, would resolve the leaking problem?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2702,6232,252,22,"No, I cannot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2703,6233,252,23,"Okay.  For example, can you say that did it, you know, 75 percent of the time or 50 percent or something like that?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2704,6237,253,2,"Objection.  Asked and answered.  We don't want you to guess, Mr. Morton.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_answer
2705,6239,253,4,I think your question --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2706,6240,253,5,"My question was -- let me rephrase it. Are you able to give me a good faith estimate, without guessing, of the percentage of times when tightening the packing nut would resolve the leaking problem?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2707,6245,253,10,The same objection.,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_answer
2708,6246,253,11,"The percentage of time?  Once or twice, if that answers your question.  In other words, it would work one or two times, and then you would have to replace the packing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2709,6250,253,15,"Okay.  That does answer my question.  So if I understand you correctly, the first time and maybe a second time that you would encounter leaking on a particular valve, tightening the nut would correct the leak, but after the second time, you would typically have to change the packing?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2710,6256,253,21,Objection.  Form.,side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_question
2711,6258,253,23,Is that a fair way to say it?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2712,6259,253,24,That's a fair way to say it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2713,6261,254,1,Okay.  Thank you.,q,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2714,6262,254,2,"Hey, Mike, this is Jose.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
2715,6263,254,3,Yeah.  Yes.,side_chat,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2716,6264,254,4,"We're -- just let's see if maybe talk off the record just timing-wise.  I just wanted to see how much longer you had to see if maybe there was a good juncture just to suspend and continue another day, but if you feel like you're going to be done, you know, within a reasonable time, maybe we can just power along.  I just wanted to see what your thoughts were on that.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat
2717,6272,254,12,"Yeah.  Sure.  I mean, I would -- I'm thinking there's another 10, 15 minutes, and then I know Mark has got his medical stuff and other follow-up.  That's kind of where I'm at right now. That's my best estimate, without guessing.",side_chat,MR. SIMONS,start_chat
2718,6277,254,17,"All right.  If you only have, like, maybe 15 minutes tops, why don't we just -- just finish up your questions, and then we'll reevaluate where we're at at that point.",side_chat,MR. BECERRA,start_chat

2725,6297,255,12,"Thank you, sir.  All right.  Mr. Morton, we're back after we did that quick tape change.  We were talking about your work doing maintenance or repair work on valves. I wanted to -- the next question I wanted to ask you was, when you would obtain the replacement packing material, where did you obtain that from, or where did your father obtain it from?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2726,6305,255,20,It came in a -- a spool.  I have no idea where he obtained it.  I'm sure it was probably Standard Supply in Fitchburg.  That's where we bought just about all of the stuff that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2727,6309,255,24,Okay.  Were there any markings or indications about who manufactured that packing material?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2728,6313,256,3,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2729,6314,256,4,Could you tell me the color of that packing material?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2730,6316,256,6,A black color.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2731,6317,256,7,Okay.  What was the texture of it?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2732,6318,256,8,A rope texture with -- it looks like some type of tar substance.  I guess that was to make a good seal when you put it back.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2733,6321,256,11,Okay.  Could you tell me the thickness in terms of what the dimension --,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2734,6323,256,13,Yeah.  I'm going to say an eighth of an inch to a quarter of an inch would be my guess on the thickness.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2735,6326,256,16,Okay.  How would you get it off the roll?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2736,6327,256,17,"It was on a spool, and it was just winding it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2737,6329,256,19,"Okay.  Just unwinding it, and then would you have to make a cut to get it separated from the rest of the material which was still on the spool?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2738,6332,256,22,"No, you did not have to cut it.  I mean, as far as separating it.  It would roll right out. So if you needed six inches, that's what you cut off.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2739,6336,257,1,"Gotcha.  All right.  And that helps a bit. So when you would, for example, measure out six inches, cut the six-inch piece off of the spool, what would you use to cut it off the spool with?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2740,6340,257,5,A razor knife.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2741,6341,257,6,Okay.  And how long did that take?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2742,6342,257,7,Five minutes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2743,6343,257,8,"Did cutting that create any -- strike that. What, if any, conditions did cutting that material off the spool make?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2744,6347,257,12,"Any time you disturb a surface, you -- yeah.  There's a certain amount of fiber that gets into the air.  How much, I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2745,6350,257,15,"Okay.  After you had cut off the appropriate size piece of the replacement packing material, what would you do next?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2746,6353,257,18,"You'd wrap that around the shaft, and if you felt it was a little too long, you'd cut off a little more, and then you would tighten up the flange nut around it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2747,6357,257,22,Okay.  Did you have to make any more cuts to that gasket material or packing material?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2748,6359,257,24,"Yeah, because you guess at the length, and then, as I say, when you start wrapping the valve, whether you've got to go around one time or two times, that depended on the stem size of the valve to how many times you went around.  If you had sufficient room, you'd go around twice.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2749,6366,258,6,Okay.,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2750,6367,258,7,"Then you would tighten up the flange and see if you were successful, and if it didn't leak, then you were good.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2751,6370,258,10,"Okay.  And just so I'm clear, when you would do that, if you had overestimated, let's say, how much the replacement packing material, you had to essentially cut off a little bit of the excess?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2752,6374,258,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2753,6375,258,15,"Is that -- okay.  And to physically, how long did it time-wise take to make that cut? Actually, I'm not talking about, like, the measurement.  To physically make the cut, how long did that take?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2754,6380,258,20,You're talking minutes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2755,6381,258,21,Okay.  And were you using the same razor?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2756,6382,258,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2757,6383,258,23,Okay.  Was that razor generally sharp?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2758,6384,258,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2759,6386,259,1,"Okay.  All right.  Are you -- strike that. Other than changing the packing on the Crane Co. stem and gate valves, is there any other type of maintenance on those valves which you would perform?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2760,6390,259,5,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2761,6391,259,6,Okay.  I think we're getting close.  Did you ever have to remove a Crane Co. stem or gate valve that was already in service when you got there?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2762,6394,259,9,"If the valve was functioning perfectly, why would you remove it?  I guess you can't do a question with a question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2763,6397,259,12,"I agree, but my question is, did you ever get to a -- did you ever encounter a situation where you did need to remove a Crane Co. stem or gate valve which was in service?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2764,6401,259,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2765,6402,259,17,Okay.  Are you able to estimate for me without guessing how much of the time you had to remove a Crane Co. stem or gate valve versus the other brands of valves that you encountered?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2766,6406,259,21,The same procedure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2767,6407,259,22,"Okay.  I understand it's the same procedure, and I appreciate that.  Are you able to give me a good faith estimate without guessing of the percentage of time you removed Crane Co. stem and gate valves as opposed to other manufacturers' brands of stem and gate valves?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2768,6414,260,4,"No, because the procedure is the same.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2769,6415,260,5,"Okay.  The procedure, as I -- at least as you previously explained it would be, and please correct me if I'm wrong, unbolt the valve, remove the flange gasket, and then you're done; is that correct?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2770,6419,260,9,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2771,6420,260,10,Okay.  And would you remove the flange gaskets which were there in the same manner as you previously testified?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2772,6423,260,13,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2773,6424,260,14,"Okay.  And I just want to be clear.  With respect to the Crane Co. valves specifically, when you would remove -- any time you would remove a flange gasket, is it the same that you would have to be careful not to actually damage the flange itself?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2774,6429,260,19,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2775,6430,260,20,"Okay.  And I think you said that the same with regard when you remove packing, you had to be careful not to damage the packing stem itself, correct?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2776,6434,260,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2777,6436,261,1,What would be -- what problems could you generate if you did damage the flange or the packing stem itself?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2778,6439,261,4,"Basically, you would have to replace, not only the valve, but the flange, and that would --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2779,6441,261,6,Is that because you -- sorry.  Go ahead.,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2780,6442,261,7,And that's because you damaged both of them.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2781,6444,261,9,Right.  And would the result of damaging be that they could no longer form the tight seal that was necessary?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2782,6447,261,12,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2783,6448,261,13,"Okay.  All right.  All right.  With regard to any Crane Co. stem or gate valves which you had to remove from a -- from a system, is it -- am I correct that you would not know the maintenance history of any of those valves?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2784,6453,261,18,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2785,6454,261,19,"And am I correct that given that you did not know the maintenance history of any of those valves that you had to remove, you would not know whether any of the components, the packing, flange gaskets, et cetera, were original to the valve or not?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2786,6461,262,1,"Fair to say, correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2787,6462,262,2,"Okay.  Is there other work, apart from the installation, the repair work, and the removal work, that you recall doing with any Crane Co. gate or valve -- gate or stem valve out in the field?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2788,6466,262,6,"I think to answer that, as long -- not unless you -- you had leakage, whether -- the gate valve, sometimes they get corroded, so they were not making a seal, and whether it was water or what it was would leak by, and you had a defective product that you had to replace.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2789,6472,262,12,Okay.  So that would be a situation where you would need to remove the valve; is that correct?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2790,6474,262,14,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2791,6475,262,15,"Okay.  And the process for removal would be the one we talked about already, right?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2792,6477,262,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2793,6478,262,18,"Okay.  Is there any -- apart from -- if you saw -- strike that. If you encountered such a corroded, you know, gate or stem valve out in the field, would you do -- was there anything you would need to do to try to repair it, or you just know, no, that's just got to come out?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2794,6486,263,1,You basically knew it had to come out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2795,6487,263,2,Okay.  All right.  Are there any other products or equipment you associate with Crane Co. which you believe you worked with or around which we haven't discussed yet?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2796,6491,263,6,I do not quite understand the question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2797,6492,263,7,"Okay.  Let me retry that.  We talked about Crane Co. valves and pumps, correct?",q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer
2798,6494,263,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2799,6495,263,10,Okay.  Are there any other products which you worked with or around which you believe were manufactured by Crane Co. which we haven't discussed?,q,MR. SIMONS,start_answer

2814,6522,264,12,Hi.  I'm hoping I'll be even less than that.  My name is Chris Wasil.  I'm just going to ask you just a few questions about Goulds pumps.  I believe you said on a previous date that you remember helping your father remove a Goulds well pump from your home when you were about 13 years old.  Do you recall that?,q,MR. WASIL,start_answer
2815,6529,264,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2816,6530,264,20,"Okay.  And since this was a well pump, was it submerged in water when you went to remove it?",q,MR. WASIL,start_answer
2817,6532,264,22,No.  It was a shallow well pump.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2818,6533,264,23,Okay.  Was any part of the pump wet?,q,MR. WASIL,start_answer
2819,6534,264,24,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2820,6536,265,1,Okay.  And can you tell me how you know this was a Goulds pump?,q,MR. WASIL,start_answer

2822,6542,265,7,"Okay.  And about how long did this process take, to the best of your memory?",q,MR. WASIL,start_answer
2823,6544,265,9,"Basically what you're asking, how long to take the old one out and how long to put a new one in?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2824,6547,265,12,"Sure.  Yeah.  The total project removal and replacement, about how long was that process?",q,MR. WASIL,start_answer

2826,6551,265,16,"And the new pump you put in, was that also a Goulds pump?",q,MR. WASIL,start_answer

2830,6558,265,23,Okay.  Okay.  And I think you also testified that you installed a water pump during the construction of your current home.  Do you recall that?,q,MR. WASIL,start_answer

2833,6566,266,6,"Basically, one pump.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2834,6567,266,7,"Okay.  Did you just install this pump, or did you ever perform maintenance and repairs on the pump?",q,MR. WASIL,start_answer

2836,6572,266,12,"And can you just very briefly describe to me what it is -- when you say you rebuilt it, what that involved?",q,MR. WASIL,start_answer
2837,6575,266,15,"Yeah.  It involves taking the motor off the pump, and then you have a rebuilding kit that involves a propeller which you replace.  Some of the other components that you replace, there's a jacket that the impeller fits into and rides up against and wears, so you replace that.  So it basically -- any parts that came in that rebuilding kit, you would replace.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2838,6583,266,23,Okay.  Do you recall how many times you did this for the pump?,q,MR. WASIL,start_answer
2839,6586,267,1,Once.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2841,6590,267,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2842,6591,267,6,Do you recall just approximately when you did that rebuild?,q,MR. WASIL,start_answer

2845,6597,267,12,Fitchburg Plumbing on Main Street in Fitchburg.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2846,6599,267,14,"And was this rebuild kit something branded by Goulds, or was this something generic that applied to all pumps?",q,MR. WASIL,start_answer
2847,6602,267,17,Goulds.  It was a Gould rebuilding kit.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
2848,6603,267,18,"Okay.  Sir, that is all the questions I have for you.  Thank you very much.",side_chat,MR. WASIL,start_chat

2854,6619,268,9,Okay.,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
2855,6620,268,10,"And as I said, we didn't always replace a certain motor with the same type of motor.  It could have been, you know -- so, no, to answer your question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2856,6624,268,14,"Okay.  And the replacement -- strike that. The brushes that you told me about earlier that you replaced, do you happen to know the brand name or trade name of those brushes?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
2857,6628,268,18,"No, I do not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2858,6629,268,19,"Okay.  Did they come in any packaging, if you recall?",q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer

2860,6636,269,1,No.  No.  I understand that.  And I think you told -- you told me that you replaced brushes occasionally.  Can you give me your best estimate over the course of your working with your dad how many times you would have replaced brushes in a motor regardless of the brand name of the motor?,q,MR. MOCCIA,start_answer
2861,6642,269,7,"Right.  No, I cannot tell you, or I can't even give you an estimate except many times.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

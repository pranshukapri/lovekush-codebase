10,284,11,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,285,11,23,"And probably for most of the deposition I will actually refer to De Laval or De Laval Steam Turbine Company.  Is that appropriate and will you understand that I'm referring to IMO Industries, Inc., the company that you are the corporate representative for?",q,,start_answer
12,293,12,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

16,303,12,16,"Yes, I believe that's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,304,12,17,"Just so it's clear for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, when you are talking today, you are talking as the corporation, you are talking as IMO Industries, Inc. and De Laval Steam Turbine Company, fair?",q,,start_answer

19,313,13,1,"It's your understanding that you are in fact the corporate representative, true?",q,,start_answer
20,316,13,4,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,317,13,5,"I'm going to talk to you about three basic topics for purposes of this deposition.  The first topic is going to De Laval's historical knowledge about the dangers of asbestos.  The second topic is going to be De Laval's conduct or how they responded relating to asbestos and the third topic is going to be related to De Laval pumps and turbines that had asbestos components or utilized asbestos insulation, okay?",q,,start_answer
22,328,13,16,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,329,13,17,"I want to start out before I get there with some preliminary matters. First of all, is it accurate, sir, that De Laval Steam Turbine Company was a seller and manufacturer of products that had asbestos components for more than 50 years?",q,,start_chat

28,346,14,9,"They continued to sell these products with asbestos components without interruption until the 1980s, true?",q,,start_answer
29,349,14,12,"It depends on the component, but some yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
30,351,14,14,"If we start in the thirties and end in the eighties, it's accurate that for over 50 years De Laval Steam Turbine Company manufactured and sold equipment that had asbestos components, true?",q,,start_answer
31,356,14,19,"Some, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,357,14,20,"In fact, De Laval also sold asbestos products themselves, true?",q,,start_answer
33,359,14,22,"In some cases where spare parts were included as part of customer's orders, that may be true.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,363,15,1,"For example, I guess we need a little bit of background.  When you were talking about the asbestos components that were utilized in some De Laval pumps and turbines, you are referring to in some occasions asbestos gaskets and asbestos packing material, true?",q,,start_answer
35,370,15,8,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
36,371,15,9,"In addition to actually selling the pump or the turbine with that piece of asbestos component inside it, De Laval on occasion also sold spare parts which would have been just the asbestos gasket or the asbestos packing as requested by a customer?",q,,start_chat

38,378,15,16,True?,q,,start_answer

44,394,16,7,"On occasion, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

56,421,17,9,Until 1972 that's true on relatively infrequent occasions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,423,17,11,"If we take it from the 1930s until the 1970s, De Laval would have been a seller of asbestos thermal insulation products for a period of about 40 years, true?",q,,start_chat
58,428,17,16,"Same objection, mainly to the term seller, but you can answer the question.",side_chat,MR. COLAO,start_answer
59,431,17,19,"Yes, when a customer ordered asbestos or any insulation and the material that was being used at that time happened to contain asbestos, then De Laval would provide it as part of a contractual obligation to a customer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,438,18,1,"It would generally be asbestos thermal insulation products that would be used as insulation for a De Laval turbine, true?",q,,start_chat
61,442,18,5,"Subject to the prior objection, go ahead.",side_chat,MR. COLAO,start_answer
62,444,18,7,"Again, generally is a very broad term.  It often was, but there are other materials that were used on occasion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,447,18,10,"Fair enough.  I think I understand what the nature of your qualification was and my point simply was when De Laval did on occasion sell asbestos thermal insulation products between the time period of the 1930s until the 1970s, it was insulation that was going to be used on De Laval turbines, true?",q,,start_answer
64,455,18,18,"Yes, normally, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,456,18,19,I want to shift gears now and talk to you about the first item that I mentioned at the very beginning which was De Laval's knowledge about the dangers of asbestos.  Now we've discussed as we just pointed out that De Laval sold and manufactured equipment that had asbestos components and also sold asbestos replacement components for a period of about 50 years. Would you agree that when De Laval knew about the dangers of asbestos is an important inquiry?,q,,start_chat
66,469,19,7,Objection to form. I don't know why he would have that basis of knowledge.,side_chat,MR. COLAO,start_answer
67,472,19,10,That's your call.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,473,19,11,"Fair enough.  As the corporate representative of a company that sold products with asbestos components for more than 50 years, do you think that it's important to find out when your company may have first learned that asbestos was dangerous to human beings?",q,,start_chat

74,495,20,8,That's generally true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

77,505,20,18,"Would you repeat the question, please?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,507,20,20,"Sure.

91,534,21,22,"Over the time period that you have been with this company more than 30 years starting in the sixties going up until at least the nineties, is it your testimony that De Laval and IMO have been truthful and accurate about potential hazards associated with their products?",q,,start_answer
92,542,22,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

94,546,22,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

103,574,23,12,The OSHA regulations were recognized by De Laval and its customers to some extent.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

He's only testifying based upon what he's being shown and read from this Exhibit.",side_chat,MR. COLAO,start_chat

1592,5210,208,23,I didn't say that.  What I said was that we didn't know if it actually was on a specific pump or a specific ship or at a specific time on that ship. My experience tells me that in many instances insulation once it's removed for maintenance is not replaced and/or where in situations where a customer may fully intend to insulate it when he purchases the equipment he does not because as I said before it's not an absolute essential to the operation of the machine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

1888,6017,241,5,"No, I'm sure there are many. These turbines were not standard items that were produced for stock and then somebody sold them off a shelf.

1895,6039,242,2,"I do want to get to that, but my question is more general than that.  Is there a range of temperatures that the De Laval turbines that drove fuel oil service pumps would work?",q,MR. GREENSTONE,start_answer
1896,6044,242,7,"If they all used steam from the same pressure level, then those would be consistent.  If different -- if on different ships the steam came from a different point in the production or use of that steam.  For example, if it came directly from the boiler, it would be higher in pressure and therefore temperature than if it came from the cross over between the low and high pressure turbine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1897,6054,242,17,Fair enough.,q,MR. GREENSTONE,start_answer

2345,7554,302,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2346,7555,302,18,"It's like similar to the way at a library, you just open up a card file and look through it for the customer's name?",q,MR. GREENSTONE,start_answer

2357,7578,303,16,"Certainly a large construction contractor such as Daniel is the type of customer that De Laval often sold to, true?",q,MR. GREENSTONE,start_chat
2358,7581,303,19,Objection to form. Mischaracterizes what he already said.,side_chat,MR. COLAO,start_question

2365,7600,304,13,Same objection.,side_chat,MR. COLAO,start_answer
2366,7601,304,14,No.  You are broadening this to all turbines and only the relatively small turbines have packing anywhere inside them. You get to a larger machine and it's very -- it just doesn't happen.  You don't have the typical type of packing that you are referring to.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

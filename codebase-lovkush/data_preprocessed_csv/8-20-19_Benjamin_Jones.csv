But we tow for insurance companies and do other things.  At a minimum I go out four or five times a week.  But if it's on a night or a day like that was, that was the first wreck of the day, but normally that would have been a very long day for me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,290,13,5,Is that because there was a snowstorm?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
116,291,13,6,"Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  Like I said, it depends.  It's probably the only business you like it when it rains or you like it when it snows.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,294,13,9,"A lot of work, right?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
118,295,13,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,296,13,11,So probably the most you go out is about 14 times?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
120,298,13,13,Yes.  And it depends.  It's such a -- it all depends how people want to drive.  Some days for no reason at all you're very busy and days where it's snowing out and you'd think you'd be very busy you get one or two calls.  It all depends how everyone is driving.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,304,13,19,Can you say on average how many hours a week you work?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
122,306,13,21,"Again, it depends on where the tow is to. It depends on it could be a local tow.  Could be -- there are times when I have to go all the way to Pennsylvania, Maine, if people are breaking down that live in that state sometimes the insurance companies pay me to tow them all the way home.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,313,14,2,Is that often that you have to do a long distance tow?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
124,315,14,4,No.  It's a couple of times a year.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,316,14,5,And so is it fair to say at Pratt & Whitney you're working about 36 hours a week?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
126,318,14,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,319,14,8,"And then as the tow truck, what do you work?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
128,321,14,10,I would say probably -- if it's -- we average it out to where I'm doing six to eight calls a week.  I try to do probably 10 to 12 hours.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,324,14,13,10 to 12 hours a week?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
130,325,14,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

133,328,14,17,Did you miss any time from work on either of these jobs?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
134,330,14,19,"Well, again, when it happened I had the luxury of not having to go to Pratt for a couple of days, so I took a couple of days off from the accident because they put me on muscle relaxers and I didn't feel right driving the truck.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,335,14,24,Other than a couple of days taking off?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
136,336,14,25,"No, I can't afford to take time off. I have a lot of things going on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

141,346,15,9,So there was no claim made?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
142,347,15,10,The only claim that was made I believe was the original emergency room visit.  After that everything else was through my regular insurance.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,350,15,13,"Okay.  All right.  Just to finish up here, at Pratt & Whitney is that a physical job that you have?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
144,353,15,16,I haven't had to physically work since 2000 when I went salary because it's a union shop.  I can't physically do anything other than direct people on what to do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

146,358,15,21,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

148,361,15,24,"Yes, a desk job.  A lot of running the entire facility.  There's a lot of, you know, a lot of walking.  There's a lot of overhead work which is why, you know, I've got to have this thing eventually fixed.  Most jet engines, they're not at level, they're just too big or they're up in the test facility so I'm constantly looking up.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,369,16,6,Are you reaching or --,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
150,370,16,7,"No, no.  But everything that we're doing is overhead work.  And that's why this pain bothers me. By the end of the day all the stuff I'm doing, it's just a burning sensation that just won't go away.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,374,16,11,"And as a tow truck operator, can you tell me about the physical aspect of that?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
152,376,16,13,"It's basically like on -- a thing like this it's mechanical work and it's a lot of -- especially accidents.  Accidents is what I like doing because you have to figure out how to get the car back up the bank or back off its roof.  Sometimes it's challenging, but for the most part it's not accidents.  A lot of it is just breakdowns and stuff, so it's easy work.  But it's -- it does have its physical times when, again, the car is down the bank.  You have to manipulate everything, figure out how to get it up and all this other stuff.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,387,16,24,And get it on the wrecker?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
154,388,16,25,"Yeah.  And as far as strenuous, you try to make the wrecker do the work for you.  A lot of winching, cables, pulleys.  You don't kill yourself when you have the equipment to do it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,393,17,4,Do you always drive the same vehicle?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
156,394,17,5,"No, no.  There's three different vehicles. There's this one, which was my main vehicle because it's the newest vehicle and he doesn't really trust a lot of other people driving it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,398,17,9,"And this vehicle, just so we're clear, what kind of vehicle is it?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
158,400,17,11,That's a 2006 Nissan UD.  It's a cab forward.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

160,403,17,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,404,17,15,And how often would you say that you drive that particular one?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
162,406,17,17,"That's the main one.  I drive that all the time unless someone else is on call and they call me for backup I will drive the other wreckers.  Sometimes it's a multiple vehicle accident.  Sometimes it's an accident way down the bank where you need to use the boom truck.  Since I know what I'm doing, they'll call me out with the boom truck to recover it back up to the street to get it on the flatbed for the guy that's working that day.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,416,18,1,You said there were two other vehicles?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
164,417,18,2,"Yeah, there's two other wreckers.  One of them is a four-wheel-drive forward and the other one is a 99 International Flatbed like this one, but it's not a -- the UD is the primary one we use because it's got an excellent turning radius if you get into dealership parking lots it's much easier to maneuver around.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,424,18,9,Even though it's such a big vehicle?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
166,425,18,10,Even though it's such a big vehicle because it's a cab forward that's the one you want to be in.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,427,18,12,"All right.  So let's, at this point, turn to the accident.",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

194,466,19,25,"Because of this.  Between the wrecker and the car went across all the lanes, so they closed the road.  It was -- there was an officer in front of the UD which you can't see.  There's like a Suburban type of vehicle there, all-wheel-drive.  And then behind the wrecker scene -- I don't know if any of these pictures show it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
195,474,20,7,"Just for the record, we previously marked four photos that were provided by you; is that right?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
196,476,20,9,"Right.  So this was the -- prior to this happening -- I'm sorry -- this vehicle was in front of me.  When the accident happened, he went around to block traffic there.  But prior to the turn, you can see the lights where they stopped the traffic.  There were two other officers behind me about a hundred yards apart to slow traffic down and make sure people are moving to the right-hand lane.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
197,484,20,17,"So just so I'm clear, when this accident occurred you were already at the accident scene?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
198,486,20,19,"Yes.  So without the car being there, this is where the truck was positioned, maybe a little further back because it got pushed forward, and this trooper was in front of me helping the people with the car.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
199,491,20,24,"So let's start with, what were you responding to before this accident happened?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
200,494,21,1,This would have been the scene right there. I was on the side.  After I evaluated --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
201,496,21,3,This is Exhibit 1.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
202,497,21,4,Yes.  After I evaluated where the car was versus the -- there's like rope rails right here -- determined that I had to pull it up through the side. So that's when I was reaching -- I was inside the cab reaching behind the front seats.  We have to keep what is called loop straps in the cab because if they get wet they freeze up and you can't use them at all.  So I was reaching behind the cab to get the loop straps to put to the side of the tires and do a side pull to pull the car up.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
203,507,21,14,So there was a car off the road?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
204,508,21,15,Yes.  That's it right there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,509,21,16,What kind of car?  It's hard to see.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
206,510,21,17,I would have to look that up.  I do this so often.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
207,512,21,19,It was a car as opposed to an SUV?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
208,513,21,20,"Yes, it was a car.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,514,21,21,And the van was to the left side of the road?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
210,516,21,23,"Yes, this is the left-hand lane.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,517,21,24,"And I see, is this area where the yellow line is, is that the shoulder of the road?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
212,520,22,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
213,521,22,2,So you had responded to remove that?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
214,522,22,3,"And I couldn't pull right up on the car because, again, the trooper was there making sure that the people in the car were okay.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
215,525,22,6,Okay.  And how long had you been at the accident scene before the accident happened?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
216,527,22,8,Probably five minutes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
217,528,22,9,And in those five minutes you had actually gotten out of your vehicle?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
218,530,22,11,Uh-hum.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
219,531,22,12,"And when the accident occurred with my client's vehicle, you said you were reaching in?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
220,533,22,14,Yes.  I was reaching in the cab over the seats because behind the seats is where we keep all the equipment that can't get wet.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,536,22,17,So you're reaching in on the passenger side?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
222,538,22,19,Yes.  I'm reaching over into the passenger side behind the seats here.  There's three things of what we call straps.  There's all different kinds depending what you're going to do and that's where the loop straps were.  I was reaching over this seat here behind the other one.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,544,22,25,Were your feet on the ground?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
224,546,23,1,My feet would have been on the first step. So the door was open and my feet were on the step and I'm receiving over to grab the loop straps.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,549,23,4,"And just as detailed as you can, were both feet -- you know, the position of your body, like both feet on the step?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
226,552,23,7,Yes.  More than likely both feet were on the step there as I'm reaching behind the front seat.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
227,554,23,9,Okay.  Did you anticipate the accident before it happened?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
228,556,23,11,"No, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,557,23,12,Why don't you describe to me what happened.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
230,558,23,13,"Okay.  So I'm reaching behind the front seat to grab the loop straps.  All of a sudden, I got lunged into -- again, because it's a cab forward so the windshield is straight and then there's the dash. I got lunged forward into the windshield and then I ended up down between the seats and the dash.  And as soon as that happened I thought the worst. I thought somehow the truck rolled forward because the brake system is there and I'm like, ""Oh my God.""  I was freaking out.  ""What just happened?""  Because, again, the last thing I saw was the officer and the two people in front of me so I thought the truck rolled forward.  I thought the worse, ""Oh my God.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,572,24,1,You thought your truck had moved?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
232,573,24,2,"Yes.  When that happened, again, my adrenaline is flowing.  I'm ""Holy cow.""  I jumped out, ran to the front of the truck, and I'm going ""What?"" And then I realized the officer is still in front of me far enough away.  I'm, ""What's going on?""  And the officer screams, ""I think someone ran into the back of your vehicle,"" and I came around and saw it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,580,24,9,So you didn't even realize what had happened?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
234,582,24,11,"I didn't even realize what had happened because, again, I was so concentrated on -- I thought I ran into the people in the truck in front of me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,585,24,14,And you jumped in front of the truck?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
236,586,24,15,"Yes.  I jumped out and ran in front of the truck.  And again, when I saw the officer there everybody is looking at me, ""What just happened?""  And I'm looking at them, ""What the heck just happened?"" Because now, again, once I saw there were -- everything was where it was supposed to be I'm like, ""Okay, what is going on?""  And the cop is, ""I think someone ran into behind you.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,594,24,23,And the cop was there and the people from the original accident?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
238,596,24,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
239,598,25,1,Were they all standing outside?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
240,599,25,2,"They were all -- I believe to the -- when I saw them they were all on the side of the car still, out of the vehicle though, when it was snowing.  And again, it's a good thing he was still there getting information on what happened in the accident because otherwise I'm usually telling them to get into the cab of the truck for their safety because they don't want to be off the side of the road.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
241,607,25,10,So nobody else was in the truck?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
242,608,25,11,Nobody else.  It was me leaning across the front seat getting the loop straps.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
243,610,25,13,Did they see the car running into the truck?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
244,612,25,15,"No, because they were off to the side here, but the officer must have put two and two together and said, ""Somebody must have slammed into the back of your truck,"" and then we both walked around.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
245,616,25,19,"And your truck, when this happened, your truck was in the position as is shown in Exhibit 1 here?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
246,619,25,22,Yes.  I think it got pushed forward.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
247,620,25,23,"So we're looking at Exhibit 3, just for the record?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
248,622,25,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,624,26,1,I see.  So the tire marks are in the snow?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
250,625,26,2,"That's where his car hit, but it got pushed forward, too, because it was snowing at the time, so that was from him when we removed the car from underneath it because eventually, like I said, they closed the whole highway down and that's the first time I ever spoke to the individual.  I said, ""Hey, does your car still start?""  And he said yes and I said, ""All right.  Let's see if it will back out from underneath to get traffic flowing again,"" and he did that and parked behind the wrecker.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,635,26,12,"These photographs, did you take them?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
252,636,26,13,Yes.  The officer asked me to take them.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,637,26,14,"Okay.  And Exhibit 1 here and Exhibit 2, was this -- the vehicles weren't moved after the accident?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
254,640,26,17,"No, no.  That's prior to moving them, but once he moved out I took pictures of the controls and how he hit the rear of this to push the mudflap right up on top of the ....",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
255,644,26,21,And so Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4 is after the car was moved?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
256,646,26,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
257,647,26,24,All right.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
258,648,26,25,"And I took this one just to show my boss because I wasn't sure I would be able to do anything at that point because the controls, I wasn't sure if they would work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
259,653,27,4,What did this control?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
260,654,27,5,This controls the bed of the truck and the winch.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
261,656,27,7,"And just for the record, Exhibit 4, we're looking at the controls here?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
262,658,27,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,659,27,10,And so the two that are bent --,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
264,660,27,11,They're not supposed to be bent.  This whole thing got pushed up and we had to redo the whole control mechanism surface there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
265,663,27,14,Was it able to work after the accident?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
266,664,27,15,I worked it from the other side.  These were -- we disconnected these and -- there's controls on both sides.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,667,27,18,They're the same controls?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
268,668,27,19,Yes.  They look exactly the same but they're not messed up.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,670,27,21,Okay.  I see.  And Exhibit 3 is just a further away picture?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
270,672,27,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
271,673,27,24,And you said from Exhibit 3 you believe that the truck -- your vehicle actually moved from the impact?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
272,677,28,2,"Yes, because he hit the controls and then hit the rear end.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,679,28,4,The tire?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
274,680,28,5,"So, and that's, when he did that, that's what threw me forward because we didn't know it at the time but later, like four months later, we had to replace all the brake parts on that side because when the emergency brake was on, this has air brakes, so when the emergency brake was set this side controls, and like I said we didn't know it at the time but they all broke off.  When I was using my emergency brake, it was only that side that was catching but we wouldn't have known that unless -- we finally figured it out because we were on a hill one time and all of a sudden it was rolling forward and that's when we figured out it had to be from when he hit the....",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,693,28,18,"Just to be clear, at the time you were stopped, before the accident, you had the emergency brake on?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
276,696,28,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,697,28,22,"And then from the impact of the accident, there was a problem with the emergency brake?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
278,699,28,24,"And again, we didn't know it at the time. None of that went through the insurance company or anything, we just fixed it.  We were like that's from the accident because the other side was fine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
279,704,29,3,And obviously the control panel that you were telling me about had to be replaced and that was damaged in the accident?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
280,707,29,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,708,29,7,Was there any other part of the truck damaged in the accident?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
282,710,29,9,"No.  Again, he's kind of lucky.  The car went underneath the bed.  So when he pulled out it settled back down, but it's up a little bit here because his hood is underneath it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,714,29,13,Was there damage to the underneath part of the truck?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
284,716,29,15,"No, because, again, the only thing in the way are the controls.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,718,29,17,That's good because the truck stopped the car from going underneath?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
286,720,29,19,"Yes.  Again, there's so much more scenarios that could have been worse.  I could have been at the controls.  The bed could have been down.  He would have went over the top of me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,724,29,23,"And the people in the car, you can go on and on?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
288,726,29,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
289,728,30,1,All right.  Do you know the names of the people?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
290,730,30,3,"No, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,731,30,4,"What about the officer, is he the one that filled out the police report?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
292,733,30,6,"I don't know the officers' names.  There were three or four of them.  Like I said, there was him and then there were two more officers behind us but I don't know if there were multiple officers in the car, so I don't know who made the report out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,738,30,11,"Okay.  And as far as you know no one saw the car slide in, it was after?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
294,740,30,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
295,741,30,14,Okay.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
296,742,30,15,"Because, again, traffic was flowing, but we were flowing in one lane on the other side.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
297,744,30,17,And the officers had blocked which lane?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
298,745,30,18,They blocked the left lane behind me probably a good four hundred yards behind us.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
299,747,30,20,All right.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
300,748,30,21,"And again, there was one there and one even further back with his lights on to get people to slow down first.  And then the other one was moving people over to get by this scene because, again, the right lane was open.  There was no reason to close the highway down.  And they typically don't.  They never, unless it's blocking more than one lane they won't close the highway.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
301,757,31,4,"Okay.  So I know you were telling me what happened to your body when this happened.  You hit the windshield, you said?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
302,760,31,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
303,761,31,8,What part of your body hit the windshield?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
304,762,31,9,The back of my head.  I was reaching over the seat and it threw me this way and the windshield is right there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
305,765,31,12,Did it crack the windshield?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
306,766,31,13,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,767,31,14,"And can you tell me, again, what other parts of your body hit what inside the vehicle?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
308,769,31,16,"Again, I got tossed around so it was --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
309,770,31,17,I know it's a very difficult question.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
310,771,31,18,"I can tell you I ended up on the floor in between the seats and the dash and that is a very tight area.  So I was this way, so I had to, you know -- and again, I was so jacked up from adrenaline thinking I might have ran over somebody in front of me, but....",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
311,777,31,24,In the front seat is it like a bench seat or two?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
312,780,32,1,"There's two.  The seat that I drive in, the driver's seat, is an air ride seat because it's a big truck so when I ride in the seat when you're going over bumps it cushions the impact.  And then there's the middle has an arm rest which flips up to another seat and then there's a passenger seat which is the same as mine but it's not an air ride seat.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
313,787,32,8,And so you were reaching over the passenger seat at the time?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
314,789,32,10,Yes.  I was reaching up.  That middle section is a raincoat coat that's on a hangar.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
315,791,32,12,Is there a back seat to the cab?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
316,792,32,13,"No.  It's just -- behind the cab, it's an extra cab, but that is for tool storage.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
317,794,32,15,And that's where you were reaching?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
318,795,32,16,That's what I was reaching behind to get the straps.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
319,797,32,18,"Okay.  And your head hit the actual windshield, right?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
320,799,32,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
321,800,32,21,And you ended up your whole body on the floor?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
322,802,32,23,My whole body between the seats and the dashboard.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
323,804,32,25,Was your head where the driver's seat was?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
324,806,33,1,"It was in the middle, I assume, only because I was reaching over.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
325,808,33,3,Did you have any visible injury?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
326,809,33,4,My shoulder was a little bit black and blue.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
327,811,33,6,That's your left shoulder?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
328,812,33,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
329,813,33,8,And where was the bruising to your shoulder?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
330,815,33,10,It was up here.  (Indicating),a,THE WITNESS,start_question
331,816,33,11,The top?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
332,817,33,12,"Yes, the top.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
333,818,33,13,Any photos of that?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
334,819,33,14,"No.  It wasn't -- again, it didn't really go black and blue for a day or so.  That wasn't their main concern at the emergency room.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
335,822,33,17,I understand.  I was just asking the details. Okay.  So your head hit the windshield and your body ended up on the floor?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
336,826,33,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
337,827,33,22,Any other part of your body hitting anything else that you can recall?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
338,829,33,24,Not that I can recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
339,830,33,25,Afterward you were able to get out immediately?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
340,833,34,2,"Oh, yes.  I ran to the front.  I didn't even look in the back.  If I looked in the back I would have noticed what happened, but I ran toward the front of the vehicle because I wanted to make sure everybody was all right.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
341,838,34,7,Okay.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
342,839,34,8,"Because, again, I thought it was something I did.  I didn't assume somebody slammed into the back of the truck.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
343,842,34,11,Did you hear the impact or anything?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
344,843,34,12,"No.  Well, all the impact I heard was like inside the cab.  Yes, I heard it but I thought it was me hitting someone in front of me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
345,846,34,15,"Oh, okay.  And did you feel the impact?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
346,847,34,16,"Again, my adrenaline -- so, again, if it was just a normal thing where I didn't think I might have done, you know, something in front of me, I probably would have said yes, I felt it then.  But I was so fired up on what the heck, trying to figure out what happened.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
347,853,34,22,All right.  So right after you went over to the officer?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
348,855,34,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
349,856,34,25,And to the occupants of the other vehicle?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
350,858,35,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
351,859,35,2,Can you describe the occupants of the other vehicle?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
352,861,35,4,Yeah.  It was a middle-age couple.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
353,862,35,5,Did you go over to the red car?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
354,863,35,6,This one?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
355,864,35,7,Yes.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
356,865,35,8,"After.  When the officer said that, ""Hey, I think someone slammed in behind you,"" and so I'm back there and so the officer went over and he started to talk to the guy, but I was looking at the car and what happened and I was like, ""Oh, God.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
357,870,35,13,"Okay.  Now, I know your adrenaline and everything, but immediately after the accident were you feeling any pain or aware of any injuries?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
358,873,35,16,"Again, they asked me, the officers asked me if I wanted, you know, I said, I know, ""I'm banged up, but no one else is on duty.""  My boss was in the other truck at the other end of the highway.  I said, ""I'm good,"" because they said, ""We'll call an ambulance."" They kept asking me, ""I will call an ambulance."" I said, ""I'm good.  If I leave the truck there nothing will get done.  The highway will stay closed.  I will go afterwards.  Don't worry.

He said yeah and I said, ""Does your car start?""  He said yes, so I said, ""If the car starts we're going to get this one out of the way so they can reopen the highway.""  And the officer that was there said it was perfect, so that's what we did. We had him start it up, put it in reverse, and slowly back out.  Then he drove around and put the car behind the truck.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

He pulled the truck forward, got the car up, and then he loaded it up on the bed and then he loaded this car on his truck and I drove back to the shop.  There's a turn-around up the street a little ways, so maybe I went a mile up the street, did the turn-around to get into the westbound lane for the emergency vehicles and got back.  And once I got back I said, ""All right. I'm going to head up to the emergency room to have them look at this.""  He said, ""That's fine,"" that he would take care of all the rest and unloaded the vehicles and did all of that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

414,1008,40,21,"Yes.  I told the doctor when I went in, the first thing they did is they took my blood pressure and immediately put me in a neck brace.  When I got into the -- what do you call it, the room there that they put you in, I had the neck brace on and it actually hurt more.  That's when I told the doctor, ""You've got this neck brace on me now.  It's absolutely killing me.""  He said, ""It's procedure.  We have to do it that way.""

418,1023,41,10,"Yeah.  They did whatever they do when you go in there.  At this point I'm like, ""Get this off me.""  I said, ""You're absolutely killing me having this on my neck.  It hurts like crazy.""  He said, ""We can't until we figure out what's going on.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

424,1035,41,22,"Physically he was looking with his hands and stuff.  And again, it just was excruciating pain. Again, I don't understand why they -- I understand they've got procedures, but having that neck brace on really, really made things worse.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

434,1052,42,13,I took them for two days.  They made my stomach so upset I stopped taking them.  That's why I saw my normal doctor to see if there was anything else because my stomach was a disaster with what they gave me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
435,1057,42,18,Did they give you any other pain medication?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

I was taking the ibuprofen and I said, ""The pain is still there.  But the funny thing is it's not there after I wake up, I'm fine.  About in an hour or two I can start feeling it.  At the end of the day it's like someone has a hot poker in my back.""  And that's the way it's been since then.  And again, at the time I didn't know why, but eventually we found out why.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

484,1154,46,11,"Yes.  Some days are better depending on any activity.  If I don't do anything it's a better day. If I go out and do miniscule things, even if it's getting in this thing and driving it, just the constant shifting, it just starts to burn after a while.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
485,1160,46,17,"And driving the truck, it's a stick shift?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
486,1161,46,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

490,1166,46,23,"He did basically the same thing they did in the emergency room.  He checked my back and checked everything and he looked at -- I think he looked at what he had, the film that he had there, and said, ""I can see why they released you because you really can't see on there what they did, if there's any major damage, but my assumption is this.""  That's when he said he thought I would benefit from physical therapy anyways.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
491,1176,47,7,So did you go to physical therapy?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
492,1177,47,8,"Yes, I did.  Ten weeks of physical therapy with Ryan.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

496,1182,47,13,"At first I wanted to strangle him because it seemed like -- it really aggravated it.  And then he explained, ""Let's to through it,"" and we went through it and ended up finding a couple of exercises that helped.  You can definitely tell it was helping, certain things we were doing.  And he said, ""Okay, let's keep that up.""  But again, at the end of the day I would just still have this burning sensation.  The exercises I could do and it would help for like an hour.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
497,1192,47,23,Then it would go back to the same?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
498,1193,47,24,Yes.  It always returned to that same burning at night.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
499,1196,48,1,"And this would happen while you were sleeping, too?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
500,1198,48,3,"Well, trying to sleep.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
501,1199,48,4,Did it interfere with sleep?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
502,1200,48,5,"Yes.  That's the whole problem with it burning like that, it's hard to find a position.  It's let's try this and then if I get to sleep I will wake up fine.  But the problem is being on call you find a position, you get to sleep, and then two hours later the phone is going off, ""Hey, there is a breakdown"" or ""a wreck,"" and you get up, come back, and start the whole process all over again.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
503,1208,48,13,Do you have to take anything to help you sleep?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
504,1210,48,15,I take melatonin.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

509,1215,48,20,Any other type of medication?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
510,1216,48,21,"No.  Again, I'm very -- I won't take any type of sleeping medication if it's prescribed because when I worked at the Global Operation Center for Pratt, we worked a rotating shift, and I was the only guy out of 16 that had -- they took Lunesta, whatever it was, and the stories they would tell you about the dreams they had I didn't want any part of that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

512,1226,49,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
513,1227,49,6,"So I'm clear, when you work at the -- when you're on call, it's 24/7?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
514,1229,49,8,"24/7.  They prefer it that way because I know what I'm doing and I don't mind being on call because, like I said, it's cyclical.  So I'm off or I'm at home or I get called out for a couple hours, so I like it like that.  The schedule works for me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
515,1234,49,13,All right.  So how often were you going to physical therapy for those ten weeks?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
516,1236,49,15,Three times a week.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
517,1237,49,16,And then is there a reason you stopped the physical therapy?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
518,1239,49,18,"Yes.  We got to the ten weeks, I guess that's what insurance covers.  I guess they can put in for an extension and I just said that at this point it doesn't seem like -- I'm at a certain point where we know what's happening and we know -- but at the end of the day it was the same result.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
519,1245,49,24,So you weren't making much progress there?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
520,1246,49,25,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

522,1250,50,3,I can't remember if I went back to see Dr. Spada or not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
523,1252,50,5,Did you go to another doctor?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
524,1253,50,6,"I did because, again, once I found out that this was burning and stuff, and I am not a doctor fan so I really don't know any experts, so I asked my attorney if there is someone I should go see and they had a couple of recommendations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
525,1258,50,11,Your attorney recommended that you see Dr. Jambor?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
526,1260,50,13,We went to see Jambor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
527,1261,50,14,And when did you do that?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
528,1262,50,15,"Again, it's very tough to find a doctor that is not going to work through workmen's comp.  As soon as she heard you're not going through workmen's comp, they don't want anything to do with you.  That's why I had to go and say, ""Listen, I can't find anyone that will work,"" and so there was a recommendation to go see him and he was very nice.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
529,1269,50,22,And what did he do for you?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
530,1270,50,23,"He was the one that examined me and really went into depth on what could be done about it.  He said, ""Listen, unfortunately, the CT scan"" -- he was absolutely right.  He said, ""Unfortunately, the CT scan that they did won't see if there's any damage, so you need to go in for your MRI.""  He said, ""You have to have that done so we can eliminate that there is nothing wrong."" And eventually we did the MRI and that is, low and behold, what opened up the whole thing saying, ""Here is why you're having the pain.""  And I don't understand it.  I don't understand why they don't do that at the hospital right off the bat because I wasted ten weeks of physical therapy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
531,1285,51,12,Had you ever had an MRI before?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
532,1286,51,13,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

534,1288,51,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
535,1289,51,16,And did they have a plan or recommendation for you after that?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
536,1291,51,18,"After, when I saw them, they said, ""Okay, the worst word we can tell you is extrusion and that's what you have in one of your... the medical term, that's the worst scenario you can have is an extrusion"" and he said, ""That's what is most likely causing your pain.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
537,1297,51,24,And did they tell what you you should do for that?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
538,1300,52,1,"They said an extrusion, unfortunately, is called an operable condition and that's the only way to fix it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
539,1303,52,4,Do surgery?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
540,1304,52,5,"They can mask it.  They asked if I wanted to do cortisone shots and I said if it gets to that point where I can't, then I would seek that out as an option, but I just don't need needles into my neck, you know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
541,1309,52,10,Did you try it at all?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
542,1310,52,11,"I will try it if I have to.  And again, they all said that that would just mask it.  It is not fixing an extrusion, it will fix the pain but not the problem.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
543,1314,52,15,"About surgery, did you discuss surgery with Dr. Jambor?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
544,1316,52,17,"Yes, but Jambor, he's not a surgeon so he recommended -- he had two or three recommendations and, unfortunately, I ran into the same problem again. As soon as you say that there is no workmen's comp, you're not going through workmen's comp they say, ""Sorry, Mr. Jones, we don't deal with accidents.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
545,1322,52,23,"Did you ultimately go to another doctor, Mastrianni?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
546,1324,52,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
547,1326,53,1,Now does he perform surgery?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
548,1327,53,2,"He informed me after the fact, he said, ""I'm going to do a consultant.  I can recommend certain surgeons, but ultimately surgery is your choice.""  And again, I don't know doctors.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
549,1331,53,6,But did you go to him for an opinion or did you go to him for treatment?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
550,1333,53,8,"No, I went to him to find out what my options would be, you know, and then what this condition is.  And he -- actually, he's very knowledgeable.  He had a lot of surgery history.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
551,1337,53,12,But he can't perform it?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
552,1338,53,13,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
553,1339,53,14,And so he recommended other surgeons?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
554,1340,53,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
555,1341,53,16,Did you go to any of those?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
556,1342,53,17,"No.  Again, at this point, because I'm the operations manager at Pratt & Whitney, I was the only. I just hired a deputy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
557,1345,53,20,Okay.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
558,1346,53,21,"Once she is up and trained, which unfortunately doesn't happen overnight, but once she's up and trained I do plan on getting the surgery because I can't go on like this.  But I also can't -- in my position I can't say I need to be out for 8 to 12 weeks.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
559,1353,54,2,There's no one to replace you?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
560,1354,54,3,"No.  I'm the operations manager.  There is no one to replace me, nor would I want someone to -- force someone to say, ""Hey, sorry, I'm going out for surgery and you need to work Friday, Saturday and Sunday for the next eight weeks.""  That's not something I would do to somebody.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
561,1360,54,9,It's difficult because of the schedule?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
562,1361,54,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
563,1362,54,11,"You recently hired a deputy, you said?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
564,1363,54,12,Yes.  It will be probably take six months to a year to get her up to speed.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
565,1365,54,14,When did you hire her?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
566,1366,54,15,Two months ago.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

568,1368,54,17,Rosario Puntio.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
569,1369,54,18,And so you are planning to have surgery?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
570,1370,54,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
571,1371,54,20,Have you consulted with any surgeons?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
572,1372,54,21,"No, not yet.  Again, I would like to make sure that -- I don't know if you know what it entails, what has to be done.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
573,1375,54,24,What did they tell you?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
574,1376,54,25,"Again, you'd think it's the back so they'd come in from here, but they have to cut next to your esophagus, move everything over and try to fuse the disc back in place.  It just gives me the heebies thinking about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
575,1382,55,5,But it's something that you feel you need to do?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
576,1384,55,7,"It's something that I know I need to do because everyone, the doctors and everyone, it's operable, the only way to fix it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
577,1387,55,10,Did they tell you about the risks involved?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
578,1388,55,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
579,1389,55,12,So as of right now you don't have any scheduled appointments?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
580,1391,55,14,"No, no.  I want to make sure that I can leave work comfortable.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
581,1393,55,16,Okay.  And you believe that will be when?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
582,1394,55,17,"I would believe sometime, again, depends on the schedule and depends on -- there's a lot of changing things that happen at Pratt.  Obviously we're combining with another company now so I would say spring.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
583,1399,55,22,All right.  Are there any other medical treatment or doctors that you went to?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
584,1401,55,24,"No, not that I can think of.  No.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
585,1402,55,25,"And the last doctor that you went to, is that Dr. Mastrianni?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
586,1405,56,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
587,1406,56,3,And before -- did your attorney recommend him or somebody else?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
588,1408,56,5,"Well, again, because I was finding everyone I called didn't want to deal with me I reached out for a recommendation.  And I'm actually glad.  He did thousands of those surgeries.  He actually got me to relax a little bit about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
589,1413,56,10,"All right.  Beforehand, when was the last time you had medical treatment?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
590,1415,56,12,"I'm not a doctor person, so I don't usually go.  But the last time would have been my annual checkup with Dr. Spada.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
591,1418,56,15,And then the last --,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
592,1419,56,16,I'm sorry.  There was a couple of emergency room examinations where I got something in my eye.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
593,1421,56,18,But related to this accident?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
594,1422,56,19,"No, nothing.  Nothing.  No.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
595,1423,56,20,"So related to the accident, did you see Dr. Jambor just two times.",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
596,1425,56,22,"I believe I saw him twice and then his assistant once and I can't remember his assistant's name, because he was out that day, but they assured me when I got to his office that he was very knowledgeable and he actually was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
597,1431,57,2,"From the records I have, it looks like the last time you went was August 23, 2018 about a year ago; is that right?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
598,1434,57,5,I guess.  I don't keep a log when I go.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
599,1435,57,6,"I have the records, but I'm asking you.",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
600,1436,57,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
601,1437,57,8,"So from when you saw him a year ago, other than seeing Dr. Mastrianni one time, have you had any other medical treatment in the last year?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
602,1440,57,11,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
603,1441,57,12,"So your current condition, has it changed at all?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
604,1443,57,14,"No.  It just stays steady.  And again, based on all the doctors that I have seen, including, you know, they've all said that, unfortunately, it becomes a harder operation the longer you keep it with the disc slipped or extruded.  The longer you wait, the harder, the more -- the recovery time is going to be longer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
605,1450,57,21,And what did they tell you the recovery time was?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
606,1452,57,23,Eight to twelve weeks.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
607,1453,57,24,And you have to be out of work during that time?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

609,1457,58,2,From both jobs?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
610,1458,58,3,"Yes.  Again, they said everyone's recovery is different, so that's why they say eight to twelve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
611,1460,58,5,"I understand.  Now, I know you told me it's difficult to look up, that's part of your job?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
612,1462,58,7,Uh-hum.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
613,1463,58,8,Are there any other activities or things you do on a regular basis?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

619,1473,58,18,Did you do that year round?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
620,1474,58,19,Not during the winter months.  But I would say springtime through probably November.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
621,1476,58,21,Have you been able to go jogging since?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
622,1477,58,22,No.  I know if I jog like ten minutes this will be burning.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
623,1479,58,24,Have you tried?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
624,1480,58,25,"Oh, no.  No.  I just know.  Because, again, I -- it's a quarter mile back and forth from my office through the two buildings that I cover and everything, and just walking that route at work it just starts burning.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
625,1486,59,5,And that's required of your job?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
626,1487,59,6,"Oh, yeah.  I have to cover the entire two facilities so....",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
627,1489,59,8,"It's about a quarter of a mile, you said?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
628,1490,59,9,It's about a quarter of mile from my office through the Building 220 and the Building 410 which I also cover so.....,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

630,1495,59,14,When I had a pedometer on me it was nine miles a day.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
631,1497,59,16,"And so you're still able to do that, but it's difficult?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
632,1499,59,18,"Yes.  I actually -- when you say ""still able to do it,"" by the end of the day I'm getting in my car and if I have to go to the other building I drive, I don't walk it.  It stinks because I'm constantly starting and stopping.  I don't have a company car so....",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
633,1505,59,24,So the nine miles is what you used to do?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
634,1506,59,25,"The nine miles is, on a busy day, that's what I used to do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
635,1509,60,2,And what would you say it is now on average?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
636,1511,60,4,"On average, I'd say it's at least five.  If it's busy and there's a problem in 410 and I'm constantly going back and forth it's nine miles a day.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
637,1514,60,7,And did you go to the gym on a regular basis before the accident?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
638,1516,60,9,Probably once or twice a week at work. There's a work gym.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

647,1535,61,2,"Other than jogging or the gym, anything else?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
648,1537,61,4,"Not that I can think of other than work. I'm a workaholic, unfortunately.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
649,1539,61,6,"How many hours, combined, the two jobs, would you say you work a week?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

26,151,6,1,"I retired from the VA in 2017.  I certainly continued to do litigation consultation work, but I don't know if that satisfies your definition of employment. I'm retired from the VA.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,155,6,5,How often do you perform litigation consultant work?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
28,157,6,7,"I review probably on average about two cases a week.  But if you're asking me about depositions and trial testimony, it's certainly less than that.  I think I'm estimating this is about the fifth deposition this year.  And on average I would think it ranges between five and ten the last few years at least. And then in trial I probably testify on average maybe once every year, maybe a little less than that recently.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,166,6,16,What percentage of those cases are asbestos related cases?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
30,168,6,18,"Well, this year I would -- certainly the vast majority are asbestos related.  I'm working on one rather large tobacco litigation case, so that would be the only one right now that is not asbestos related.  I think it would probably be about 75 to 95 on an average basis over the last several years are asbestos related.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,174,6,24,When were you initially contacted regarding the Drummond case?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
32,177,7,1,"Well, I have no independent recollection of a specific date, but based on my report I would estimate that it would have certainly been within a few weeks of September 2018.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,181,7,5,And what were you asked to do following your retention on this case?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
34,183,7,7,"Well, I'm again referring to my report, but usually as stated in my report I'm asked to be -- review records and deposition testimony as in this case and then to be willing to render either a report or testify in deposition usually about state of the art issues. Although, as a pulmonologist, frequently as in this case I was asked to review medical records and would expect to weigh in on medical issues as well.  So state of the art, medical issues. And then as noted in my report address the probability if you will of warnings changing the direction of Mr. Drummond's case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,195,7,19,So in addition -- it is my understanding you reviewed Mr. Drummond's deposition testimony in this case?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
36,198,7,22,"Yes.  I brought with me today what I reviewed, which I think is 11 volumes of deposition testimony.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,200,7,24,Okay.  Is there anything else that you brought with you to the deposition today?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
38,203,8,1,"Yes.  I brought my CV or a copy of my CV and my report, which I authored in September of 2018.  In addition the medical records I brought, which I reviewed and cited I think in my report from 2016 and '17.  And then recently was provided with a death certificate as well.  So I brought all those things with me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,209,8,7,Did you prepare any notes in preparation for your deposition today?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
40,211,8,9,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,212,8,10,"So in addition to the deposition volumes, the medical record and Mr. Drummond's death certificate, were you given any other factual information about the substance of the Drummond case from counsel or anyone else that formed the basis of any of your opinions?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
42,217,8,15,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,218,8,16,"And, Dr. Howard, are you being compensated for your work on the Drummond case?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
44,220,8,18,I expect to be.  I've not rendered a bill.  But I would certainly expect to be for the work that I've done in this case as well as today's session.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,223,8,21,What is your hourly rate?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
46,224,8,22,$450.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,225,8,23,Do you have an approximation of how many hours you've worked on the Drummond case?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
48,227,8,25,"Yes.  Prior to and including my creation of the report in September of '18, I had spent seven hours on the case.  And since then I've spent an hour rereviewing the materials I mentioned to you and then a 15 minute conference with Mr. Speziali.  So I think it's eight hours and a quarter.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,234,9,6,Were you asked to give any medical causation opinions in this case?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
50,236,9,8,I haven't actually been asked anything specific other than what I mentioned.  But I would expect that one of the two parties would ask me if I thought this was an asbestos related mesothelioma and I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,240,9,12,Do you have any additional medical causation opinions in addition to the opinion you just expressed that this is an asbestos related mesothelioma?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
52,243,9,15,"Well, I have nothing prepared to cite and again I haven't been asked any questions.  But, typically, I would expect that there would be questions about -- and I actually referred to this within my report certainly that this case like many I believe in this era at least is typically related to remote asbestos exposure in the workplace. And both historically and currently I think there's a wealth of information supporting a fiber differential in that causation and I would expect to reflect on the Navy's use and knowledge about asbestos throughout the historical period of time of probably the 1940s through at least OSHA in 1972. So I would expect again I don't have any specific script to tell you what my exact opinions are there, but I would welcome any questions concerning that. I would -- I cited as best I could the variables that I and most physicians and medical scientist look to to try to establish causation in terms of the nature of the exposure, specifically the frequency, the intensity, the duration, the product itself in terms of the friability or respirability of the asbestos contained within that product.  And I certainly look to all those in trying to establish a specific causation. As I noted in this case from the deposition testimony, specifically regarding Westinghouse and GE, I thought there were very few of those specifics that were able to be cited.  So I mention that in the report. Certainly, if there's other information regarding that, I would factor all that in.  So I don't know if that answers your question globally at least.  I would expect to have a lot of opinions regarding that general area based on primarily the deposition testimony or more importantly the historical medical literature and how it developed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,281,11,1,"Okay.  So looking at your report that's dated September 14th, 2018, how did this report come to be prepared?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
54,284,11,4,So I need to clarify.  The report that I believe I rendered in this case was authored on September 11th.  Is that -- are we looking at the same report?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,288,11,8,"That's correct.  It was served on September 14th, so that was the date I was representing. But you're correct, the report is dated September 11th.",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
56,291,11,11,"Oh, I see.  Okay.  So if I understand your question, I put together this information and tried to summarize not only case specific details, which are relatively few as you probably noted, it's probably two or three paragraphs based on the deposition testimony and then at the end I insert information that I gleaned from review of the medical records. And then I have already prepared a summary report of my state of the art opinions, which of course do not change with a given case.  So I insert all of those and then submit it.  Is that what you're asking me? I'm not sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,303,11,23,Yes.,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
58,304,11,24,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,305,11,25,Do you have any updates to this report since you initially created it in September of 2018?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
60,308,12,2,"I think, and I'm sorry, Leah, I don't know the exact date, but it seems to me that I updated my generic report for both Westinghouse and GE, which of course are not focused on Mr. Drummond's specific case, but some of that information would come from those updated reports. Which if I'm correct, I think was at the end of '18 and beginning of '19 I think.  I'd have to check.  I didn't bring those reports with me. So there may have been some updates, but I don't think any of it would conflict with the substance of this report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,319,12,13,Okay.  I would like to mark your report as Exhibit 1 to the deposition so we know what we're referring to.,q,MS. MCMORRIS,is brackets

63,325,12,19,So am I understanding you correctly that none of your opinions as to GE or Westinghouse has changed since this report was drafted?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
64,328,12,22,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,329,12,23,Do you estimate giving any state of the art opinions that are not included in this report?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
66,331,12,25,"I certainly don't anticipate it.  I try in these summary reports to address most, if not all, of the issues that I would expect to be asked about. Having said that, I know I've been in situations where either plaintiff or defense counsel have asked me specific questions that I might know about historically for example that I didn't include.  So if that came up, I would hope to be able to answer the question.  But I've tried the best I could to summarize all that I would expect to be asked about in this report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
67,342,13,10,"Leah, this is Dave Speziali.  I can send you, if you gave me an e-mail address, I call them generic reports.  There were updates to those.  If you'd like, I can get them to you now or later at some point or through Cathy.",side_chat,MR. SPEZIALI,start_chat

75,360,14,2,"So from reading the materials that you were provided in this case, is it your understanding that Mr. Drummond was suffering from pleural mesothelioma?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
76,363,14,5,"Yes.  I think he had a variety of medical conditions, but pertinent most to our discussion today is that he developed a malignant pleural mesothelioma, which I believe was likely related to past occupational exposure to asbestos.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,368,14,10,"And you just touched on, as mentioned in your report, a number of variables that need to be considered when determining the degree to which a given exposure contributes to an asbestos related disease.  Is that correct?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
78,373,14,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,374,14,16,"And some of these factors that you mentioned include the proximity of exposure, duration of exposure, frequency, fiber type and there are several others listed in the report that you frequently mention.  Correct?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
80,378,14,20,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,379,14,21,"So after reading Mr. Drummond's deposition and reviewing his medical records, do you have any opinions regarding the variables during his work at the Fore River Shipyard in general?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
82,383,14,25,"Well, I believe certainly in his early years of employment from '56 through probably '71 I read about working in a shipyard arena, which certainly I think would provide opportunities for exposure. My earlier comments about GE and Westinghouse just had to do with a lack of very specific recollection of those variables including whether asbestos was involved and things like that. But I think from his description and my knowledge of the shipyard setting, especially in the early years, I think without giving you exact references, I took from it there were certainly opportunities for exposure in the shipyard that would have led and did lead in my opinion to the conclusion that I expressed earlier that it was likely related to asbestos.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,399,15,15,Were there any specific exposures that you were able to identify that contributed to his mesothelioma?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
84,401,15,17,"As I pointed out in the report and I'll answer up front no is the answer in that many of those details are lacking. But, again, knowing the extensive use and the period of time that he was there and the description that he gave, I think generally it's fair to conclude that the general exposure through that arena would have been enough to attribute the causation conclusion too that I mentioned.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,411,16,1,Okay.  Do you have any opinions regarding any particular product or manufacturer's responsibility for Mr. Drummond's development of mesothelioma?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
86,414,16,4,"Well, certainly not specific manufacturers. But, again, as I rendered in the report, most pleural mesothelioma currently have to do with remote exposure, which often involves thermal insulation. I mentioned other types of exposure in the report, but the vast majority have to do with thermal insulation products. So, generally, again knowing the extensive use of those in the shipyard setting, especially in the 50s, I would say that that as a product is the most likely. But as far as a specific exposure I don't think that you can accurately conclude that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,426,16,16,"In addition to thermal insulation, are there any other products in this case that you believe may have contributed to Mr. Drummond's mesothelioma?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
88,429,16,19,"Well, my focus again was on GE and Westinghouse.  I can't -- and especially I didn't review a year after I rendered the report those other types of exposures.  I mentioned certainly brake and I think drywall in my report, but I can't recall any specific product or type of product. Thermal insulation overwhelmingly is the most likely.  I know he mentioned gaskets and other things in the shipyard, but, as I recall, overwhelmingly it was thermal insulation that I thought was the culprit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,440,17,4,Did your review of Mr. Drummond's deposition suggest to you one way or the other that he was exposed to asbestos while working around General Electric equipment?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
90,444,17,8,"No.  Again, I thought he did not recall specific exposure.  He made it very clear he didn't work -- he never worked directly on turbines.  The turbine manufacturers that he was able to recall I didn't see was specific to General Electric or Westinghouse. The specific recollection on Westinghouse regarding forced draft blowers, I think even when questioned he couldn't specifically say it was asbestos. And in my experience many of those are not insulated. So I thought there were many variables there that would not allow me to specifically conclude that exposure to Westinghouse or GE products were the culprit, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,457,17,21,"Did either Westinghouse or General Electric provide you any documents regarding the insulation, thermal insulation products that were used on the Sherman-class destroyers built at the Fore River Shipyard?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
92,463,18,1,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,464,18,2,Were you provided with any information about the asbestos content of the insulation used on this turbine on the Sherman-class destroyers?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
94,467,18,5,"No, certainly not.  I'm aware generally of various manufacturers and generally of the content, but not specifically in this case, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,470,18,8,"So same question for the forced draft blowers, were you provided with any information about the asbestos content of insulation used on the forced draft blowers on the Sherman-class destroyers?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
96,474,18,12,"No, just the uncertainty mentioned in the deposition.  So other than that, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,476,18,14,Okay.  What is your general understanding of the insulation used on those types of equipment on Navy vessels during the 1950s?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
98,479,18,17,"Well, I'm certain that's out of my field of expertise, but I've seen descriptions from a variety of sources that primarily focuses on the piping that could be attached to the turbine.  Oftentimes there is a blanket referenced on the top of the turbine.  But we're getting beyond my field of expertise. I would refer to his description of the process and then certainly my knowledge of extensive use on piping within the vessel typically in shipyards historically.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,490,19,2,"If you were provided any information showing that the insulation on General Electric or Westinghouse equipment on the Sherman-class destroyers was asbestos containing, would that in any way change your opinion regarding Mr. Drummond's exposure?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
100,495,19,7,"Well, if I understand your question, it would involve that specific exposure that he experienced.  So I did mention in my report that, for example, if you were to provide evidence that his exposure on that vessel and that turbine involved asbestos containing thermal insulation and there was evidence of all those other variables in terms of more than just walking by, he was actually there when exposure was ongoing, I think from his description I'm confident that at most it would have been bystander exposure. But, historically, certainly if that was present and it was asbestos containing thermal insulation, then I would certainly be able to conclude that that might have added to the causative exposures that he experienced.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,510,19,22,In your report you detail a number of general state of the art opinions.  And I don't want to go through all those because I think they're laid out pretty well in your report. But do you have any additional opinions about the general state of the art that are not included in your report?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
102,518,20,4,"So I understood your previous question to be similar.  And, again, I don't think so, but certainly if you ask me something that was outside of this -- of what was covered here and I knew about it, I would certainly try to answer that. But I don't anticipate -- I think I've tried to cover from my knowledge and my experience what questions are most pertinent to both sides.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,526,20,12,Do you have any opinions specific to the Navy knowledge regarding the hazards of asbestos in the 1950s?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
104,528,20,14,"Well, I don't consider myself a Navy expert. I'm not a Navy veteran, I've never worked for the Navy in a shipyard.  So in that regard, no. But I've tried to include in my report based predominately on published medical literature I believe the sophistication of the Navy in the development of this so called state of the art knowledge base. From the very beginning I cited the Fleischer Drinker report for example and then Captain Brown's publication both in the 40s that detail I think processes that the Navy had in place to try to address asbestos. And so I would -- I think I referenced what I'm thinking of in response to your question in the report and I would expect to reflect on those publications, Fleischer Drinker, the Brown publication, the Marr publication all referenced I think in my report. You know, certainly the Navy was involved with Walsh-Healy requirements, the minimum standards I referenced.  So off the top I'm thinking that those are all in response to what I would expect to render concerning your question about Navy knowledge.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,550,21,10,Do you have any information specific to Bethlehem Steel's knowledge regarding the hazards of asbestos in the 1950s?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
106,553,21,13,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,554,21,14,"When Mr. Drummond began working at the Fore River Shipyard in 1956, what was the general state of the art at that time?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
108,557,21,17,"Well, as I initiated in my report, the knowledge base I believe regarding the potential hazards of asbestos began prior to that in the 1930s, late 20s if you look at case reports. So certainly by the 50s there was a base of medical literature that utilized peer review published epidemiologic studies showing in predominately textile factory arenas that with prolonged and intense and direct exposure some of those individuals would develop scarring within the lung, which was referred to as asbestosis. Certainly, I think your question was in the 50s by.  By the 40s we now have both Captain Brown's publication and maybe more importantly the Fleischer Drinker study published in '46 that indicated a number of processes were in place. And the significance of the Fleischer Drinker study I believe was that it represented the first epidemiologic study outside of the textile factory arena that concluded in part that this field of marine insulation at that time with those processes in place was not a dangerous occupation. Certainly, the state of the art at that time also involved the role of the ACGIH and the utilization of some of those studies from the 30s to initiate a dust control level that was established and promulgated across the country to try to void and prevent any adverse outcome, which as noted at that time was asbestosis. So that gets us I think to the 50s, which is I think where you asked me.  So by 1956 certainly it was acknowledged that in certain circumstances asbestos could result in scarring of the lung and there were efforts to minimize dust production at least to that level that was promulgated as a level that below which adverse outcomes would not occur.  All of that was in place by the 1950s.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,593,23,1,"These efforts to minimize dust production levels, what were some of those efforts that were in place in the 1950s?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
110,596,23,4,"Well, when you read the publications, both the Brown publication that I mentioned in 1941, as well as the Fleischer Drinker study in 1946, they especially specific to this case they talk about processes that the Navy had in various locations and with various levels of compliance that involved ventilation, dust suppression techniques and even the use of respirator type devices. In some they mentioned wet methods, which would be occasionally utilized.  I think those are predominately the engineering categories that are cited at that time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,606,23,14,Do you have any knowledge whether or not any of those dust minimization efforts that you just described were being used at the Fore River Shipyard?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
112,609,23,17,"I certainly don't have any personal knowledge. I would reflect -- and I haven't done this in preparation for this so I can't cite it directly, but as I mentioned in my report the Fore River Shipyard was one of those surveyed by the Fleischer Drinker study. So to specifically answer I would have to look at the language there, but I don't know off the top I'm sorry.  And I'm not suggesting that those measures were preventative to the subsequent development of a mesothelioma, the knowledge of that of course comes in the future well beyond 1956 in my opinion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,621,24,3,"In your reading of Mr. Drummond's deposition testimony, did you see any indication that any of those dust suppression techniques were being used at Fore River during Mr. Drummond's time there?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
114,625,24,7,"No.  But I don't recall anybody specifically asking him about ventilation and things like that.  But to answer your question, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,628,24,10,"Do you have any information regarding General Electric or Westinghouse's contemporaneous knowledge of awareness, knowledge or awareness, excuse me, of what Bethlehem Steel knew about the hazards of asbestos during Mr. Drummond's time there?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
116,633,24,15,"Specifically regarding Bethlehem Steel, absolutely not.  I do have some knowledge and certainly expectations regarding the published medical literature and what I would expect and in some cases know that the corporation would know about that information certainly being part of organizations which promulgate those conclusions from the published literature I think is evident in this case. And maybe this is getting too far afield, but certainly my knowledge about Alice Hamilton and her role with GE historically would I think partially address that.  But I have no knowledge about what the corporate knowledge about Bethlehem Steel's knowledge would be, it would be more aimed at the published medical literature.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,648,25,4,"In your report you express an opinion that, trying to find the correct paragraph here:  ""The absence of caution labels associated with General Electric or Westinghouse cannot be deemed a proximate cause of Mr. Drummond's exposure to asbestos."" Do you see that reference?  I think it's on the third page.",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
118,655,25,11,"I don't -- let me see if I can find it.  I recall the reference, let's see if I can find it.  I may not need to find it.  Go ahead and ask.  I recall the reference.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,659,25,15,The question is what is the basis for your opinion?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
120,661,25,17,"Well, so specifically regarding whether warning labels on a GE or a Westinghouse product in this case would have probably changed anybody's behavior. In most cases I don't have a specific quote from the plaintiff.  In this case Mr. Drummond was specifically asked whether or not that information would have changed him and I think I included that in my report.  He clearly stated that it would not. In most cases my conclusion, and in this one as well, is in part based on a number of variables including their described work. So the fact that he didn't work directly on those products, along with the fact that the products in question here are predominately thermal insulation as noted throughout a period of time that he worked in that arena did have warnings on them.  As well as certainly the sophistication and the knowledge of the Navy, which I referenced earlier. It wouldn't have been that that kind of information would have educated the Navy or likely based on his own response have any impact on what Mr. Drummond's activity was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,684,26,14,"Is that your opinion the same opinion regarding what you just testified for the Navy, is it also your opinion that these warning labels would not have impacted the shipyard in any manner?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
122,688,26,18,"Correct, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,689,26,19,So is it your opinion that neither GE or Westinghouse made an affirmative decision not to warn because they were aware of the shipyard or the Navy's investigation regarding the hazards of asbestos?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
124,693,26,23,"Well, I can't really speak specifically to what was underneath that decision, but certainly they were aware and in many instances it would be based again on published medical literature, as well as experience, that number one as I think was pointed out in a deposition the forced draft blowers and in this case the turbines would typically be delivered without asbestos. The asbestos that the Navy decided to subsequently apply would have in many cases had warnings already on it. So in part that knowledge of the processes that are in place and probably that many products that were available and in use at that time, which were I don't believe mandated to use, did have warning labels already on them. So I think speculating a little bit that all of those factors would certainly play into that decision, as well as the fact that your product does not contain asbestos.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,713,27,17,And you mentioned some of the controls that were in place affecting shipyards during this time period.  And I believe you cited to the minimum requirements for safety of industrial health for shipyards in the Walsh-Healey Act. Are there any other that apply specifically to the Fore River Shipyard during that time period?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
126,720,27,24,"Well, certainly the ACGIH.  And I guess not a requirement, but my understanding is that the vast majority of states embraced the recommended threshold limit value.  So what the legal requirement of specific shipyard was regarding that I can't really address, but I think that also would at least speak to the processes in place. Other than that, I think the two things that you mentioned certainly are pertinent to that.  Along with certainly the published literature that I spoke to earlier.  That's somewhat of a unique variable in this case.  So I think that's all I'm thinking of in answering that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,734,28,12,"And specific to the Walsh-Healey Act, was that applicable to product manufacturers such as General Electric and Westinghouse as well as shipyards?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
128,737,28,15,"We're getting outside of my field here.  My understanding is a federal employee was Walsh-Healy Act involved federal contracts beyond a certain economic level and then it required a variety of actions be taken, which included adherence to the five million particle per cubic foot level in the 50s I recall. But as far as specific requirements and legal requirements of a corporation versus a shipyard, I don't know.  My understanding as a physician was that it applied to all federal contracts over a certain dollar amount.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,749,29,1,"And so the federal contract, is it your understanding that was just between the Navy and a shipyard and not necessarily including product manufacturers?  I'm just trying to understand your opinion.",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
130,754,29,6,"Okay.  Again, I'm not an expert on the contractual situation.  My understanding was if you signed a federal contract, whoever you are, General Electric, Westinghouse or a shipyard that involved more than I thought it was $10,000, but I'm not sure of that, then you would be obligated to follow this -- these rules of engagement.  That's the extent of my knowledge. I just know from reading it that it embraced the five million particle which becomes very pertinent to what I testify about speaking again to the widespread adoption both in federal and in state jurisdictions to that level as being a credible effort to do the best that we could with the knowledge that we had at a specific time to prevent adverse outcomes.  That's the extent of my knowledge of that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,769,29,21,In what way do the requirements imposed upon the Fore River Shipyard through the Walsh-Healey Act or the minimum standards contribute to your opinion that the Fore River Shipyard was highly sophisticated regarding asbestos safety?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
132,775,30,1,"Well, my understanding of your previous question that led to that label of highly sophisticated had to do with the Navy. The shipyard in terms of the Walsh-Healey Act in my opinion it speaks to the question that frequently comes up about the legitimacy of the five million particle per cubic foot level. Clearly people were not embracing that in an effort to cause harm to people.  And when that position is taken, I think citing federal endorsement of it through the Walsh-Healey Act and then state endorsement of it tends to minimize the legitimacy of that argument. So beyond that, the legal sophistication of the shipyard I'm not personally aware of.  I was speaking primarily of where the Navy's involvement from the very beginning of this period of time, specifically the 40s, in investigating and knowing about the potential hazards of asbestos.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,793,30,19,"In the third page of your report there is a statement stating:  ""The Fore River Shipyard was highly sophisticated regarding asbestos safety starting with the requirements imposed upon it by the government regulations including the minimum standards and the Walsh-Healey Act.""  That's what I was referencing.  Do you see that in your report?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
134,801,31,1,Yes.  What I think I'm addressing is thinking that the Fore River Shipyard is affiliated with the Navy and the Navy is certainly knowledgeable and obligated and endorsing those ideas and the base of the knowledge for it. So maybe I shouldn't separate the Fore River Shipyard as an entity from the Navy.  I'm just thinking the Navy is there and predominately he's working on naval vessels.  So I'm assuming there's going to be some cross pollination of that knowledge base.  I'm just not specifically knowledgeable about the non Navy functioning of the Fore River Shipyard.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,813,31,13,Do you have an understanding of whether or not the Fore River Shipyard was a Navy shipyard versus a contract shipyard?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
136,816,31,16,"No, I don't know the makeup there.  I just thought from the description in this case that it was heavily involved with the Navy, especially during the period of time that Mr. Drummond was there.  So I don't know the legal makeup or the specific corporate entity makeup of the shipyard.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,822,31,22,Would it change your opinion at all if the Fore River Shipyard was a privately owned shipyard as opposed to a Navy shipyard?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
138,825,31,25,"I don't think so.  In those cases that I've been involved with, if it was a totally non Navy operation, then typically the shipyard has been involved with organizations like the National Safety Council and Industrial Hygiene Foundation, things like that where information is passed.  And as mentioned earlier, the ACGIH with state adoption of various dust control limits. Usually, if the Navy is not involved, I've done the work to try to figure out what the corporate entity was guided by in a given state.  I'm just assuming in this case there was heavy Navy involvement.  He made that clear from his testimony as well.  So that's kind of where my thought process is regarding the sophistication.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,839,32,13,And would that sophistication for a private shipyard such as the Fore River Shipyard be the same as what a corporation such as General Electric or Westinghouse would have had available to them?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
140,843,32,17,"Well, most of what I refer to and the publications that I've referred to here, including all the ACGIH information and state regulations and federal regulations, are all publicly available. So if your workplace is addressed, it's pertinent to know and I would expect an operation to be aware of what was in those sources of information from peer reviewed published literature, to state regulations, to federal law that addressed your operation.  I would certainly expect them to know about that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,854,33,2,So changing gears here a little bit.  You did review medical records of Mr. Drummond from this 2016 to 2018 time period; is that correct?  Let me see if I can find it here.,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
142,858,33,6,"Leah, I'm sorry, I was still thinking about your last question and I looked through my report.  In citations four and five I think I addressed some of what you asked me about, including of course the previously noted reference that the Fore River Shipyard was one of the original yards surveyed in that Fleischer Drinker report. So I guess specific to this case I would look at citation four and five to address some of those sophistication questions.  I'm sorry, I got distracted by that and I forgot or missed your most recent question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,869,33,17,That's okay.  I was going to change gears on you here and talk about Mr. Drummond's medical records that you reviewed. Is it correct that the records that you reviewed were from 2016 to 2017?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
144,874,33,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,875,33,23,Okay.  And what did your review of his medical record suggest to you regarding his diagnosis of mesothelioma?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
146,879,34,1,"Well, I believe it confirmed it.  I usually am asked to review the records to weigh in on the legitimacy of the diagnosis and in this case I think it was totally and completely legitimate to do what they did and I'm certainly supportive of the diagnosis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,884,34,6,"I'm just going to review my notes briefly here, but I think I'm just about finished.  When you're reviewing a case like this and the medical records that you were provided, is there -- do you have a method to differentiate between an exposure that you believe is causative and contributes to disease or one that does not?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
148,891,34,13,"I usually don't get that from the medical records.  But there are some variables that I look to and in this case there was evidence of pleural plaques formation, which also attests to the deposition claim of occupational exposure to asbestos. So specific to this case that was an indicator in my opinion supportive of Mr. Drummond's testimony and what I knew about the workplace that supported that this was an asbestos related mesothelioma. But most of the time and in most situations regarding your question, it's gleaned more from the deposition testimony of the workplace and the exposure than it is the medical record.  I, you know, with mesothelioma many are non occupational -- non occupationally related, but you can't determine that in most cases from the medical records.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,908,35,4,"Did you see anything in your review of Mr. Drummond's medical records that you disagreed with treatment wise, diagnosis wise or anything just in general that you disagreed with?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
150,912,35,8,"Not in his medical records if that's the focus of your question.  The only thing I can think of, and I don't think it was a conclusion, but one of the entries listed a history of asbestosis and that certainly was not supported throughout his clinical record that I reviewed. That was not a diagnosis that his treating physicians had reached. But that was just one entry, it was in a list of historical diagnosis so I wouldn't know what they had based that on.  And it certainly was not supported by his clinical records.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,923,35,19,But is it your opinion that his clinical records did support a diagnosis of asbestosis at some point?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
152,926,35,22,"No, not the ones that I reviewed.  No, they did not.  That is noted on a death certificate, but there are other significant inaccuracies in the death certificate. So I think the clinical records did not conclude that he had asbestosis.  They did include that he had mesothelioma of course.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,933,36,3,"In your review of the death certificate, what are the inaccuracies in your opinion?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
154,935,36,5,"Well, the most glaring ones are the list of metastatic lung cancer followed by asbestosis.  I don't believe the clinical records that I reviewed supported either conclusion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,939,36,9,And why is that?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
156,940,36,10,"Well, hopefully we can agree here today that lung cancer is not mesothelioma.  They are totally distinct entities that really have little, if anything, to do with each other.  So I saw nothing in his record that this gentleman had had lung cancer. And, again, asbestosis is a diagnosis based on a variety of things, predominately the radiographic findings and the radiographic reports that I saw along with the clinical conclusions by his treating doctors did not diagnose him with that.  So those are the two most glaring ones. I guess from your perspective I would conclude that the absence of mesothelioma on his death certificate is an obvious error as well in my opinion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,954,36,24,Any other errors that you see on the death certificate?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
158,957,37,1,I don't think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,958,37,2,All right.  Are there any additional opinions in your report or outside of your report that we have not discussed today that you anticipate having opinions about if you were to testify in trial in this case?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer

176,999,38,17,I just have one follow-up.,side_chat,MS. MCMORRIS,start_question
177,1001,38,19,Is it your opinion that neither the Navy or Bethlehem Steel appreciated the risk of exposure to bystanders during the time period that Mr. Drummond worked at the Fore River Shipyard?,q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_chat
178,1005,38,23,"Objection to form.  Go ahead, Doc.",side_chat,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
179,1007,38,25,"So, again, I don't know the specific basis for Bethlehem Steel.  I would expect everybody to look to the medical literature to try to answer that. Certainly, in terms of exposure, I think there would be general understanding, which is not unique to asbestos, that certainly there is likely to be exposure. The question certainly has to do with the expected development of adverse outcomes and that throughout this period of time was felt not to occur if the level of exposure was be below a certain range. And certainly at this point, '56 to '62 in particular, I don't know of any epidemiologic based knowledge that would in any way suggest bystanders were at risk of disease.  I think there would be just a general understanding that there might be minimal exposure the further you get from a focal point. But, again, the point of dust production, the target was five million particles and below that adverse effects would not occur. So clearly it was not perceived nor reported that bystanders were at risk of getting any disease, especially mesothelioma.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
180,1030,39,22,"And so that risk, therefore, would not have been appreciated by either the Navy or Bethlehem Steel?",q,MS. MCMORRIS,start_answer
181,1032,39,24,"Oh, maybe I misunderstood.  I mean the risk of exposure to me is different than the risk of adverse outcome from that exposure.  So, again, I don't know the specific answer for Bethlehem Steel. I would expect and certainly from all the processes in place with the Navy they were aware that there was a risk of exposure, but not a risk of disease to bystanders at that period of time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
182,1041,40,7,Okay.  Thank you.  I think that's all I have.,side_chat,MS. MCMORRIS,start_chat
183,1043,40,9,This is Dave.  I just have a couple quick questions. CROSS EXAMINATION,side_chat,MR. SPEZIALI,start_question
184,1047,40,13,"Dr. Howard, for purposes of my questions, although you've made it clear it's not reflected in the testimony, let's just assume that insulation materials used in conjunction with the products at issue for General Electric and/or Westinghouse were asbestos containing.  Okay.  Just assume that for the purposes of my question.",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
185,1054,40,20,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
186,1055,40,21,"Okay.  For the time period for the activities described by Mr. Drummond and as you reflected in your report and your testimony today, would there have been reason for General Electric or Westinghouse to know or have reason or belief that exposure to asbestos insulation materials in conjunction with those products would have been dangerous for Mr. Drummond during the timeframes we're talking about?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
187,1064,41,4,"No.  And I was trying to answer that with Leah's last question I think.  Certainly the state of the art at that period of time '56 through '62 was clearly not that a bystander, if in fact that occurred, the type of exposure to thermal insulation was likely to cause any adverse outcome.  So no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
188,1070,41,10,"All right.  And let's again just for purposes of this question -- and I understand your opinions, and I understand why your -- when you say through '62, you're focusing on Mr. Drummond's apprenticeship years; is that right?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
189,1075,41,15,Yes.  There was a little bit of confusion beyond that because it was active military career.  But that's why I chose that period of time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
190,1078,41,18,"Okay.  And that's fine.  But let's just assume for purposes of our discussion so that there is no question as to where your opinions stand, we know that his career went through '71 and I recognize that his testimony differs substantially from his apprentice years to his later years. But if we expanded the question to include the period up through '71, in that timeframe again is there any reason to believe or know that the types of exposures that he describes would have created dangers for him in terms of insulation materials on the General Electric or Westinghouse products discussed in this case?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
191,1091,42,5,"No.  He made it clear that at most we're talking about what most of us would refer to as bystander type exposure.  So he's not the one involved in insulating for example. But if there was thermal insulation involved in these exposures that it contained asbestos and he was exposed in a bystander fashion, then to answer your question through '71 for sure bystanders were not perceived to be likely or at risk of developing disease. Many publications said in that time period that there are others who may experience exposures, but until we know that exposure is a problem or above a level that is considered a problem, it would be inaccurate to assume or conclude that all of those people are at risk of disease.  Certainly there would be some other who are exposed. And this concept is not at all unique to asbestos.  It's a dose response relationship that applies to just about any product or element.  Oxygen is always the one I think about when asked that question.  But dose response means that just because you have some exposure, which by the way all of us have had, that does not mean that you have a higher incidence of disease because of that exposure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
192,1116,43,4,"And in at least through '71, what was the prevailing threshold limit value that was -- that was established for asbestos through that timeframe?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
193,1119,43,7,"So throughout that time period starting actually in the 1940s, the threshold limit value was five million particles per cubic foot. At the very end of the time period that you're asking me about, there were suggestions by some to alter the TLV and that occurred I believe in the late '71, early '72 time period. Now that was multifactorial in part related to a change in the methodology for measuring dust rather than particles going to fibers.  But it was also based on developing literature that showed that the threshold limit value may need to be reduced, which of course it was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
194,1132,43,20,"Right.  And without revisiting and spending a lot more time here, did both Dr. Selikoff and Doctors Balzer and Cooper address the idea regarding hands on insulator exposures versus bystanders that you described in publications in the 60s and 70s?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
195,1137,43,25,"Yes.  Absolutely focused on the insulator population.  With of course some comments made by one of those authors about maybe we'll need to investigate other people, which it subsequently in his career and historically later on they did to try to determine if in fact there was a risk of disease.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
196,1144,44,6,And I understand from your report that you have actually met and discussed with Dr. Balzer his research in the 60s and 70s; is that correct?,q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
197,1147,44,9,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
198,1148,44,10,"All right.  I want to ask you one other thing. You were asked a lot of questions about the Navy's knowledge and the shipyard's knowledge. Let me ask you this.  Again, let's just assume for purposes of my questions and I understand it's -- let's just assume it, that Mr. Drummond is working with asbestos insulation materials during the period that he testified to in the shipyards for '56 through '71. That he -- again just assume that his testimony was that he's working at Fore River and that he's working on Navy ships, okay, just as he testified to.",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
199,1159,44,21,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
200,1160,44,22,And let's assume that those are asbestos containing materials being used by insulators in and around him.  Okay.  Just assume all that.,q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
201,1163,44,25,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
202,1165,45,1,"Would there have been reason -- if all that were occurring, would there have been reason for Westinghouse and General Electric to believe that Mr. Drummond would have been advised of any dangers in association with asbestos in his work and would have been advised of any precautions to take regarding exposures to asbestos in association with his exposures in work as he described?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_chat
203,1173,45,9,"Objection, form.",side_chat,MS. MCMORRIS,start_question
204,1175,45,11,Do you follow that?,q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
205,1176,45,12,"I think so.  I'm reflecting back on one of Leah's earlier questions.  The wealth of publicly available peer reviewed medical literature comes to mind, which certainly supports throughout this period of time that the Navy had in place as mentioned with variable degrees of compliance a variety of measures which they cited from the very beginning with the published Fleischer Drinker study.  I mentioned Captain Brown's publication as well in the 40s and then Marr's publication in '64. Those all come to mind immediately when you ask that question in that we have a variety of processes allegedly utilized by the Navy and reported in the medical literature that would suggest that communication, if you will, that there is a potential in addressing this fiber or these products and that has to be communicated in order for -- for this to be taking place, which is published. So in addition to the published medical literature, you know, the involvement of the National Safety Council, the ACGIH, the minimum standards that we talked about, all of these to me would support the idea that processes are utilized, which would require that communication. Not that I would expect the individual sailor to know specifics about the diseases in question or anything like that, but that would communicate some of the potential for hazard, which I think you can assume has to take place.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
206,1206,46,16,"All right.  So you mentioned three publications, you mentioned the Brown publication 1941, the Fleischer Drinker report of 1946, the Marr study of 1964.  There was also discussions of the Walsh-Healey Act.  So let's just focus on those four publications. If in fact Mr. Drummond was working either with or around asbestos insulation materials in the manner in which he described in association with Westinghouse or General Electric products or equipment, if he was doing that during the timeframe in question, would there -- would he have been advised or received information regarding respiratory protection as to asbestos if he was in danger from those exposures based on what was published?  I'm not saying it happened, based on what the Navy was telling the world.",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
207,1222,47,6,"Well, and I may need some help in understanding this.  Certainly, if there was a perceived risk, that without the respiratory protection there was risk of disease that would be reduced or eliminated with respiratory protection, then certainly that communication would have taken place. But from a state of an art perspective, especially from '56 to '71, if I'm understanding your question correctly, we have to put ourself back in that time period and without question mesothelioma was not considered a risk of bystanders in my opinion at that point. The risk was focused especially in the 60s as we've mentioned on insulators.  So insulators and when you read the Fleischer Drinker study it has to do with marine insulators, are encouraged to utilize a variety of measures including respiratory protection. Now from my reading of these deposition volumes, I saw no evidence that Mr. Drummond was an insulator.  So I think we've agreed that at best or at the worst he was a bystander.  And, therefore, the advice at that time would not be that if you're a bystander, A, you're at risk of getting a disease, especially something like mesothelioma and, B, that you as a bystander would be asked to wear respirators. Certainly, if you're an insulator after the Selikoff studies in the mid to late 60s, then of course that would be wise.  And of course with OSHA that's addressed specifically.  So I don't -- does that answer your question?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
208,1253,48,11,"Yeah.  In fact, let me make it easier so we have a cleaner record following what you threw in.  It was really a bad question by me. If there was a perceived risk of danger to Mr. Drummond from exposure to asbestos from the activities that he described, if, and I understand your opinion is that there was not, but let's assume that there was, okay. Based upon what the Navy -- well, not only the Navy but even the shipyards, based upon what was in the published scientific and medical literature, would Mr. Drummond have been advised of those dangers and the need to use respiratory protection doing the activities that he described if there was a perceived risk?",q,MR.

209,1267,48,25,"Certainly, yes, if the risk was of adverse outcomes, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
210,1270,49,2,"Okay.  Would he again based upon what was in the public medical and scientific literature, would he have been advised or would he have been -- or would have there been utilized ventilation and exhaust for dust control purposes in the areas that he talked about in the manner in which he describes?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
211,1276,49,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
212,1277,49,9,"Okay.  Would the Navy in the shipyard have put in place as part of dust control measures moistening of the materials and, again, I'm referring to the Brown article?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer
213,1281,49,13,"Certainly the wet methods were an engineering device that was recommended by many.  So, again, if there was a perceived risk, that would have been wise.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
214,1284,49,16,"Okay.  In simple -- in simple language, if there was a perceived risk based upon what is described in the literature during the relevant timeframe we're about, would Mr. Drummond have been made aware of those risks and dangers?",q,MR. SPEZIALI,start_answer

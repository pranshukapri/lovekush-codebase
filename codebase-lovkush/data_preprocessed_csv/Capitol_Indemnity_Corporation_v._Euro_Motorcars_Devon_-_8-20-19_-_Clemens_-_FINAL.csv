246,836,31,21,Yup.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

253,851,32,11,Okay.  So in the break between Section 2 and 3 at some point the opening was expanded from the original opening you told us about all the way up to the office almost?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
254,855,32,15,"I believe so, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

257,860,32,20,Okay.  And when did that occur?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

260,864,32,24,"And, again, the dates --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

262,872,33,7,Okay.  Which way are you going here?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

266,878,33,13,(Indicating.),a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,879,33,14,"So the record is clear, the witness just numbered the units from --",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
268,881,33,16,That we are going to use for this.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,882,33,17,"For this purpose, sure.  Just to be clear we, the original unit you bought was?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
270,884,33,19,"We bought 4, 5 and 6.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

272,886,33,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,887,33,22,"Then you eventually bought 4, 5, and 6.  How about Units 1, 2, and 3, did they come into the possession of the company at some point?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
274,892,34,2,"Yes, about a year later.  And then we did not do anything with those at the beginning, we had tenants in there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,895,34,5,"All right.  And when, if ever, did the tenants leave and Clemens start using those for operations?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
276,898,34,8,"Again, these dates are going to be, so I believe somewhere around 2000, Intertech had -- they had 1, 2, and 3.  Okay?  And then we bought the entire building and then they were our tenants, Intertech was our single tenant.  And then they built a building and moved out.  And then at that point when they moved out, we took Unit 3 and then we had two separate tenants in 1 and 2.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,907,34,17,"Okay.  And when you started to occupy Unit No. 3, were there any kind of punchouts put in the wall?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

279,912,34,22,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
280,913,34,23,"There was nothing put in here or anything here.  The reason that that was put -- the reason that we couldn't open this whole thing up, this is a separates level.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,918,35,3,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
282,919,35,4,"The floor was like, I'm going to say, 3 feet lower.  So this had, 1, 2, and 3 had a lower floor level, and then this had a higher floor level.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,923,35,8,All right.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
284,924,35,9,So we didn't -- we couldn't use it for production.  We used that for our warehouse.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,927,35,12,And did you ever expand your business beyond Unit 3 into 2 and 1?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
286,929,35,14,"So 2 was never, never, ever a possession of ours.  Just the tenant.  And then 1 at the end was, we were using that for some warehouse, but it was basically empty at the time of the fire.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,934,35,19,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
288,935,35,20,Because we were planning on moving the other people over.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

295,948,36,8,"All right.  And I want to talk now for a moment about what I'll call the parking lot side of the building.  Okay?  There were a series of garage doors at the rear of the property.  Can you tell us where those garage doors were at the time of the fire, where were those openings?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

297,958,36,18,"Well, the way I asked the question was garage doors.  Okay?  But maybe a better way is if you could just describe for us, starting at one end or the other, whichever you're comfortable with, what were the openings that were available at the back of the building, let's say the day before the fire?",q,MR.

306,985,37,20,"I'm pretty sure of that, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

593,1611,62,21,"I would imagine that our computer system would be able to tell you in service, out of service garments.

603,1650,64,10,"Oh, there was always new -- so we always had both.  So, in other words, if we need a size that we don't have, we would order that, you know, immediately.  But your common things, we would have that, you know, Navy blue pants and things like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

912,2313,90,23,"Again, this is not like a memory test.  I put this in front of you so that we have some background to review it from.

917,2333,91,18,They were deposited in our bank account.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

919,2339,91,24,"I mean, there was replacement, we had everything coded for replacement, uniforms and so, for instance, when we were buying all the uniforms for replacement, we had that under a separate general ledger account.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
920,2345,92,5,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
921,2346,92,6,"So that if you had, like, say a customer was a new customer going down two months later, that was under a separate account because that was something that wasn't lost in the fire.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
922,2351,92,11,"Okay.  But that section, the business personal property, also would have covered what I'll call the equipment, the operating equipment in the building.  Was that your understanding?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
923,2356,92,16,"No.  That's a separate -- you have to ask Janet, but that's a separate accounting thing.  Equipment is not under -- there's a separate accounting code for that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
924,2360,92,20,"Okay.  Under your books, I understand that.  But I mean under the insurance coverage, was it your understanding that Harleysville was the company that was reimbursing you for the actual equipment that was lost?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
925,2367,93,2,"I don't know that for a fact.  I don't know how they were paying or what they were paying.  They gave us the sheets of like the different calculations and they gave us the sheets as far as how they figured out the business interruption insurance, and so on and so forth.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
926,2374,93,9,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
927,2375,93,10,So I think Harleysville would probably be better to answer that question for you.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
928,2378,93,13,"Well, they can answer a piece of the question, which is what they wrote a check to you for.  Okay?  And so my two questions are, did you spend that 2 million replacing inventory and equipment?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
929,2383,93,18,"We spent that and a lot, lot more.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
930,2384,93,19,"Okay.  So then that leads to the next question is, what is the amount, okay, for equipment and inventory that you believe the company was not reimbursed for?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
931,2388,93,23,"So I believe that would be the 993, if that includes everything that we're talking about or if that's -- you're talking about business interruption --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

957,2455,96,15,"I put in front of you another document which is the Jerry Hammar report, which we've marked as Exhibit 8.  Have you ever seen this report before?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
958,2459,96,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
959,2460,96,20,Okay.  What was your understanding of what this report showed?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
960,2462,96,22,This is the report that shows every piece of equipment that we had in our location at the time of the fire.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
961,2466,97,1,"All right.  And did you personally sit with Mr. Hammar, who prepared this report, to go through with him and talk about the various pieces of equipment that were present?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
962,2470,97,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
963,2471,97,6,Okay.  And did you provide him with descriptions of the equipment?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
964,2473,97,8,"So he went and got the serial numbers off of the equipment where he could. He got the, did all the reference, you know, as far as, and he came back to me and there was one or two items that he couldn't find, like a purchase, like where to purchase it. And then we gave him, I gave him that information.  Like, I remember this recycle cake press, he couldn't find anything on that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
965,2482,97,17,That's item number 17?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
966,2483,97,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
967,2484,97,19,What is that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
968,2485,97,20,"So after the sludge comes out of the wastewater, the DAF, then it gets pressed into there, and then it gets all the water out and then the cake is dropped down so then you can dispose of that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
969,2491,98,1,Okay.  And do you remember what the other item was that he could not find?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
970,2493,98,3,I don't recall the exact item that he was having trouble with.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
971,2495,98,5,"Okay.  And before we came here today, at some point did Mr. Hammar provide you with a copy of this like before he finalized the report for you to review?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
972,2499,98,9,"He gave -- we sat down when he was trying to find everything out, and he asked like, where we bought these certain items because he wanted to have receipts, if possible.  Well, we didn't have the receipts because they were burned, so like some of the things he, you know, like I know that he wanted to get Pac's number and he wanted to get Frankford's number, because I think he was getting receipts or something from them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
973,2509,98,19,"And then after he compiled that information, did he give you like a preliminary version of this to review and say, ""This is accurate, everything is included""?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
974,2513,98,23,"I do not believe so.  I believe that after that initial or second meeting with him, I mean, I didn't have any input on pricing or anything like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
975,2518,99,3,Okay.  And at some point did the insurance company provide you with a copy of this report?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
976,2521,99,6,I believe it was similar to this report.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
977,2523,99,8,"And when you got that copy, did you go through it?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
978,2525,99,10,"Just like I did here, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
979,2526,99,11,"Well, today you did a very what I'll call cursory review?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
980,2528,99,13,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
981,2529,99,14,Did you at some point do what I'll call a detailed review of this report to see if it was accurate?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
982,2532,99,17,"So I went through and we, to make sure the equipment was on there and, you know, that was -- we made sure that we had everything that was on there, that it wasn't deleted or something.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
983,2537,99,22,"So to the best of your knowledge, Mr. Hammar was accurate in obtaining a list of everything that was lost?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
984,2541,100,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
985,2542,100,2,"Okay.  So there's nothing, as we sit here today, where you would say, ""Oh, by the way, Hammar missed the following three things""?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
986,2546,100,6,I would say that you're correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
987,2547,100,7,All right.  And have you done anything to review or analyze the values that Mr. Hammar put on any of the property?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
988,2550,100,10,"I mean, he had the receipts for most of the things, and the other things that said estimate looked like they were fair to me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
989,2553,100,13,"Okay.  And were all the, let's say the washers and dryers and everything that were lost, they were ultimately replaced with new equipment; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
990,2557,100,17,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
991,2558,100,18,"Okay.  And is the washing and drying capacity, like as we sit here today, in the new facility, is it larger, smaller, or the same as the capacity at the time of the fire?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
992,2562,100,22,"So it's a different configuration, but.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
993,2564,100,24,That's kind of why I asked it as capacity versus number of units; okay?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
994,2567,101,2,"Yeah.  I would say that the capacity is definitely higher on the washing, not so much on the drying.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
995,2570,101,5,All right.  And how much higher is it today?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
996,2572,101,7,"The capacity, well, we have two 450, we had one 75, so it looks like it would be -- let me just add this up.  So it looks like the washing is about 15% higher than what it is before.  The drying would be fairly similar. We had more, now we have less but bigger.  We had one linen ironer before, we have one linen ironer now.  We had two steam blowers before, we have one now.  Yeah, the presses are exactly the same for the dry cleaning stuff. The steam tunnel is exactly the same, that was the same thing.  So, you know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
997,2584,101,19,"How about like, I don't know what the right words are, but like all the towels, the tablecloths, and things like that that come back through, do they all get pressed as well?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
998,2589,101,24,"Yes -- well, not the towels don't get pressed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
999,2592,102,2,"I'm sorry, that's true.  But like all the tablecloths and napkins, how were those pressed in the old building?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1000,2595,102,5,"Same, like the ironer you see there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1001,2596,102,6,And so is the capacity of the ironing for those things the same?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1002,2598,102,8,"Yeah.  So the ironer is the same, it's what they called a 232.  I believe this one is a little wider, but just for the longer tablecloths, but yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1003,2602,102,12,"And you had mentioned earlier today, I think you called it the clothing sorter?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1004,2604,102,14,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1005,2605,102,15,So it sounded to me like in the old building there was like hand sorting; is that correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1006,2608,102,18,"There's still hand sorting, okay, it's not computerized or anything like that. But the way, what it is is, it's two systems back to back so that it's just much easier to process, takes up more space, but it's easier to process.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1007,2614,102,24,So in the old building like basically things came down the conveyer and there was some person or persons there who were doing all that sorting; correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1008,2619,103,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1009,2620,103,5,So what is different with the system today that makes it operate better?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1010,2622,103,7,"So we used to have to wash in smaller groups, so we'd have to keep like the accounts, you know, like three or four accounts together.  And then when they come through, then we would sort them out. So now we can run a larger batch together because we have two sorts, we have what we call a presort and then that that divides it up by account.  And then we have a post sort or man sort, and that divides it up by the man.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1011,2633,103,18,The man being the employee at a place?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1012,2635,103,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1013,2636,103,21,"Okay.  And so at the end of the day when the driver comes in, he's picking up his clean uniforms, that is all presorted by client and by person for him when he does that pickup?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1014,2642,104,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1015,2643,104,3,"All right.  And so if we went back to the day before the fire at the facility, how many employees worked inside the plant?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1016,2646,104,6,"Oh, I would have to get that number off, we had the payroll number.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1017,2648,104,8,Okay.  And how many employees work in the plant today?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1018,2650,104,10,I would say probably about the same.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1019,2651,104,11,"Okay.  And the business of Clemens Cleaning Village, how does it compare today in 2019 as compared to, let's say, 2015, the year before the fire?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1020,2655,104,15,"So I believe -- and I would have to get the records specifically for you -- we did lose a little business after the fire.  But I believe that we're up around, you know, probably 10% from, I don't know how many years ago that was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1021,2661,104,21,So about three years ago now.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1022,2662,104,22,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1023,2663,104,23,"When you say up 10%, is that 10% --",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1024,2664,104,24,Over 2015.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1025,2666,105,1,"10% of what, of the gross sales?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1026,2667,105,2,"Gross sales, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1027,2668,105,3,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1028,2669,105,4,"So our growth rate really, you know, decreased because of the fire.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1029,2671,105,6,What do you mean by that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1030,2672,105,7,"Because if you would look back over the time before that, four years before that, it would have been a higher growth rate than that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1031,2676,105,11,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_chat
1032,2677,105,12,I'm going to mark this next document as Exhibit 9.,side_chat,MR. BLUM,symbols

1037,2689,105,24,"So this is, the first receipts are what we paid to the subcontractors.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1038,2692,106,2,"Okay.  So there are a series of handwritten pages that run from page 3215 through page 3217, is that what you're talking about?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1039,2696,106,6,"Yeah.  This -- well, the first ones are from Town Valet Cleaners, a dry cleaning place.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1041,2700,106,10,The first three.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1042,2701,106,11,Okay.  So tell me what they were doing for you?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1044,2706,106,16,Okay.  And is this your handwriting or someone else's handwriting?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1045,2708,106,18,That's theirs.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1046,2709,106,19,Okay.  So is this their basically invoice to you for the cleaning they did for you in that period?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1050,2721,107,6,Okay.  So --,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1051,2722,107,7,"The question was -- so, in other words, you're asking, these were things that were done after the business interruption insurance ran out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1052,2726,107,11,"Okay, all right.  So is it accurate, then, that this receipt where it says 8/7 is not for 8/7/16, it's for 8/7/17?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1053,2729,107,14,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1054,2730,107,15,Okay.  And so that company had other invoices that were paid under the business interruption claim?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1055,2733,107,18,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1071,2764,108,24,"Like the first phase we were able to stop was the uniforms.  We were able to wash the uniforms, process the uniforms.

1072,2772,109,7,Okay.  So when did that first become available to you?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1078,2784,109,19,So you stopped then on or about 8/7 of 2017?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1079,2786,109,21,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1080,2787,109,22,Okay.  So I take it that the building was at least partially operational by like the first week of August of '17?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1094,2818,111,3,All right.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1095,2819,111,4,"So we discussed 3219, so going back to 3220, Absorbtech did roll towels for us, it's a minimal thing, and Kleentech washed the other towels.  So that was -- those were the last ones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1096,2824,111,9,All right.  So then by Absorbtech it looks like the last payment is 8/22.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1097,2826,111,11,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1098,2827,111,12,And then Kleentech is 8/31; is that correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1099,2829,111,14,"Yeah.  And that's -- could be a delivery thing -- see, okay, so on Kleentech it was every two weeks that they came here. So we basically, the Absorbtech and the Kleentech, we did away with theirs, the same thing, but they already had the things from before, so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1100,2836,111,21,"So by the end of August, then, that portion that they were handling for you was completed?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1102,2841,112,1,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1104,2845,112,5,"Okay.  Let's just stop for one second.  Let's just stick with the building, then we'll definitely come to that page. So is it accurate, then, that by the end of August of 2017, the operations of the actual company were all in the new building?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1105,2851,112,11,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1117,2879,113,14,"Okay.  So the sorting thing that you were asking about, all right, that wasn't installed until November.  So what we would do for the uniforms is we would take them from here into the back building, they would be sorted out, and then they would come up from -- they would come up -- actually, I guess they would stay down there and the drivers would pick them up there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1118,2888,113,23,So is it accurate that there were no subcontractors paid for extra work by the end of August of '17?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1119,2892,114,2,I believe that's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1120,2893,114,3,"All right.  So then you were going to also, you were looking at page, I think, 3224?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1121,2896,114,6,So 3224 is the amount that we paid to Bergey's for renting vehicles that we couldn't get the replacement trucks fast enough.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1122,2900,114,10,"Okay.  And were all of those vehicles on leases from Bergey's, the vehicles that were lost?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1123,2903,114,13,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1124,2904,114,14,Do you know how many of them were on leases from Bergey's versus how many you owned?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1125,2907,114,17,"No, I do not.  I can get that for you, but I don't have that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1126,2909,114,19,"And on the vehicles that were leased from Bergey's, what arrangement did they make for you for I'll call it the termination of the lease, what did they do about that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1127,2913,114,23,That was a bad situation because they -- we had to keep on paying Bergey's for the lease of the vehicle because Bergey's and Nationwide were going back and forth.  And so we had to wait that out till we could get a replacement for that vehicle.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1128,2920,115,5,And how long did it take for Bergey's and Nationwide to resolve all those issues?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1129,2923,115,8,A few months.  But that was just for the vehicle that caused the fire.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1130,2925,115,10,Okay.  So then was that the only vehicle that was leased?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1131,2927,115,12,"That had to be replaced, I am not sure about that.  I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1132,2929,115,14,So were there lease payments that no longer had to be made as a result of vehicles being lost?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1133,2932,115,17,I don't know.  I don't believe so. Janet would know that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1134,2934,115,19,"Then if we go to the next page, which would be 3225?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1135,2936,115,21,"Okay.  That was our transportation truck that we had to -- we had a truck rented from DelVal International, and it was a larger truck.  And that would make the route so it would go to Gemini, it would go to MacIntosh, it would go to Acme, take the dirty stuff there, pick up the clean stuff.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1136,2944,116,4,So that is the transportation cost from the existing facility to the subcontractors?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1137,2947,116,7,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1138,2948,116,8,Okay.  And how long was that truck in place?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1139,2950,116,10,"I believe that would have been, I think we kept that the whole month of August because to wait until everything was done.  I don't know.  I would have to check here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1140,2954,116,14,Okay.  And did the insurance company reimburse you for that expense up until June of 2017?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1141,2957,116,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1142,2958,116,18,"All right.  If you take a look at page 3226, what are those expenses, if you know?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1143,2961,116,21,"I believe -- I'll go back here -- so I believe that is the exact -- so that's related to 3225, you see 3225 doesn't have any amounts on it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1144,2966,117,1,Right.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1145,2967,117,2,So that is just what we discussed there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1146,2969,117,4,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1147,2970,117,5,So the tolls and then the rental of that vehicle.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1148,2972,117,7,"Okay.  Let's take a look at page 3227 through 3228, if we could.  Do you have an understanding of what this document is?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1149,2975,117,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1150,2976,117,11,And what is your understanding?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1151,2977,117,12,"So my understanding is that the invoices that we have listed on the first ten pages of this document that you gave, that is the backup for that.  So, in other words, K Cleaners is on there, Town Valet, MacIntosh, Gemini, Absorbtech.  And those numbers add up to 230,399, which is what the papers in the front should back that up. And then the next page was what we had talked about, the last item, the truck leases to the end of August.  So the total subcontract expense, 239, that's what I believe this is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1152,2991,118,1,"Okay.  And isn't it also true, though, that from those, like you didn't have to perform those services, your company, in other words, so you didn't have during this time frame expenses for all of the laundry detergent and everything else that would have gone into producing the same work that the subcontractor did for you?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1153,2999,118,9,"That would be correct.  But then we also have the added transportation and sorting and everything expense, too.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1154,3002,118,12,"Okay.  And have you done anything, though, to account for the amounts that were in fact saved?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1155,3005,118,15,"We haven't looked at it either way, what more cost us to have it and what loss it cost us.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1156,3008,118,18,"Then if you look down, continuing down on that page, it says ""Replacement Cost,"" okay, and in the total replacement cost it's listed as $674,928.  Do you see that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1157,3012,118,22,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1158,3013,118,23,"And then it says, underneath it, ""Insurance valuation,"" so is it accurate that the only amount being claimed by Clemens is the difference between those two, the 218?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1159,3018,119,3,"I don't want to say that.  I don't know, again, I'm not going to put that -- I don't have the copies of the receipts or what you're exactly asking here for.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1160,3022,119,7,Okay.  So let me ask you this:  Did you prepare this document?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1161,3024,119,9,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1172,3047,120,7,"According to this report, the company did not actually sustain from the day of the loss, June 15th through June 15th of 2017, the company did not sustain any loss of income and in fact had a higher income.  Do you agree with that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1173,3053,120,13,Absolutely not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1174,3054,120,14,"Okay.  And tell me what the basis -- again I use the word income, gross income, coming into the company, okay?  Tell me the basis for your dispute of that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1175,3058,120,18,"Because they're counting the monies that we -- that they were giving us as revenue, I believe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1176,3061,120,21,Okay.  Go ahead.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1177,3062,120,22,"So our profits were, they're counting that as profit but we didn't have any -- we were making very good money beforehand, and we didn't take any money out of the business at all, no bonuses, nothing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1178,3068,121,3,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1179,3069,121,4,So --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1180,3070,121,5,"Again, it was not a question of lost profits, okay.  The question was, was there a change in the gross income of the company?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1181,3073,121,8,I don't -- I don't know -- that's an accounting thing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1182,3075,121,10,Have you done anything to dispute with the insurance company its analysis?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1183,3077,121,12,"There were different things that we did, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1184,3079,121,14,And what did you dispute?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1185,3080,121,15,"There was one of the things on the, if you notice on the statement that you had asked about, there was a $10,000 payment made for, that was originally on the invoice for accounting, and that $10,000 was then paid out of some kind of a line item that they had.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1186,3086,121,21,"Okay.  So you made a claim to them for extra accounting expenses that the company had, they did not pay it, and eventually they paid you $10,000?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1187,3091,122,1,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1188,3092,122,2,Okay.  Anything else that you remember being disputed?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1189,3094,122,4,I don't know if it was a dispute. They had -- there was equipment that we had purchased and then resold at the end that we couldn't recover the money for.  And it was used just for our temporary use.  And so then they did come through and pay some of that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1190,3100,122,10,"Okay.  And is there some amount of that, I'll call that difference that you're claiming?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1191,3103,122,13,"That's not listed on your -- this happened before the amount was made on there, so it's not -- it has nothing to do with the monies that we have listed here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1192,3107,122,17,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1193,3108,122,18,"The only thing that is on there is that $10,000, that's a post thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1194,3110,122,20,"Okay.  And if we go back to that Interrogatory answer, I don't think there's anything in there for a loss that you incurred from equipment that you purchased and resold. Are you claiming some loss in this lawsuit about that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1195,3117,123,2,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1196,3118,123,3,"All right.  If you could take the document we put in front of you and look at page 1741, if you could.

BLUM,start_answer
1197,3126,123,11,Uh-huh.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1198,3127,123,12,Were you on like a monthly basis submitting those invoices to them?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1200,3130,123,15,Okay.  And were they all paid?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1201,3131,123,16,"As far as I know, these invoices were all paid.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1202,3133,123,18,"Okay.  And I believe their total that they show as having been paid, if you look on page 1758, is $1,976,815.39.  Do you have any dispute of that number?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1203,3137,123,22,I don't have a dispute with that number.  But I don't -- couldn't tell you off the top of my head if that number is exactly correct to the dollar.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1204,3142,124,2,"Okay.  There was also, I believe, under the business interruption insurance the first day of the loss was not covered; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1205,3146,124,6,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1228,3201,126,11,So it's the loss of rent from both the tenants that were in the building?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1230,3206,126,16,"Okay.  And then other than the loss of rent, what is the other expense that's being claimed?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1231,3209,126,19,"The expense for rebuilding the building of things that we weren't reimbursed for.  So we had to put all new sidewalks in, new storm sewers.  We had to put new -- what do you call it -- manhole covers -- I mean manhole.  We had to put new electric service. We had to repave.  Just, you know, things that were above what Millers paid.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1234,3223,127,8,I'll ask a better question. So the day after the fire there were portions of the structure which were still standing; is that correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1235,3227,127,12,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1236,3228,127,13,"All right.  And did you have an option at that point to say, we want to salvage pieces of the existing structure rather than knock it all down?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1237,3232,127,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1238,3233,127,18,Okay.  Why not?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1239,3234,127,19,"Because we weren't allowed to get -- nobody was allowed near the building because it was -- first of all, they had the investigation going on.  And then, secondly, the fire, I believe it was the fire chief or fire marshal said the building was unsafe, so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1240,3241,128,1,And was that the entire building or just sections of the building?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1241,3243,128,3,"He said the building is unsafe.  He didn't really say anything.  I mean, visually you could see that they tore the front of the building off during the fire, so you knew that was unsafe.  And then there was other places where there was cracks in the masonry because the heat was so high.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1242,3250,128,10,So was there ever any discussion that you had with an engineer about whether or not you could save any of the building?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

1246,3259,128,19,Okay.  And did you at the time of the fire have a personal opinion of what the value of the building was before the fire?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1247,3262,128,22,"Well, I mean, normally you figure on something like this, they figure around $100 a square foot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1249,3268,129,3,"27,500.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1250,3269,129,4,"All right.  And what in total were you paid by the insurance company on the building loss, if you know?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1251,3272,129,7,Millers would have that information.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1252,3273,129,8,"Okay.  And the extra expenses that you had, were they rejected by the insurance company or they were above the limit?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
1253,3276,129,11,"So some of the things, like I said, like when they brought the fire -- when they brought the backhoe or track hoe in here to tear out the front of the building, the fire marshal made them do that.  So it ruined the sidewalk, ruined the curbing, you know, because they brought that across there and everything like that.  So that in the policy it says, no paving, no, whatever, you know, no sidewalks, no curbing or anything like that, won't pay for that.  And then they had -- we had to put, bury the wastewater -- not wastewater, rainwater all into the storm sewers, not storm sewers, through the retention basin, which wasn't before.  So then that all had to be dug up and that had to be paved over, and they wouldn't pay for any of that.  And then we had to pay to rip the trees out, then we had the pay to put the trees back in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1268,3331,131,16,I believe you're correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1270,3336,131,21,"So the night of the fire, when they took me around to the different places, like they wanted to see what was chemicals, what was things.  They wanted to know what was where the Sprinter was parked.  And I said it was the Sprinter and that's, I said that's it. And they said because that area is exactly where the fire started.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1277,3363,132,23,Okay.  And was that within days after the fire?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

And then I believe Mercedes like flew a couple people in, and there was like 20 people here the one day.  And we had to pay to have security here to keep the thing secure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

You said the first person who told you that they believe the fire started in the Mercedes, I think you said someone who went into the fire.",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer

1311,3450,136,10,"He just put chairman, I think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1320,3475,137,10,And do you still lease vehicles from Bergey's?,q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1321,3477,137,12,"At this point I do not believe we have any left on lease.  We purchase the vehicles from Bergey's.  In fact, all the vehicles, all the trucks that you see out there, 20-some trucks, are all purchased from Bergey's.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1322,3483,137,18,"Let me ask, if you go to page 2480, Paragraph 9 of that lease, if you could, 9B says, ""Exclusive remedy.  In the event of mechanical failure of a leased vehicle, Customer's exclusive remedy shall be as provided in this agreement.  Under no circumstances shall Customer be entitled to recover from Lessor any incidental or consequential damage, including, but not limited to, damage or loss of property or equipment, loss of profits or revenue, cost of capital, cost of purchased or replacement equipment, or damage or claims for damages of Customers."" You knew that provision was in there when you leased vehicles from Bergey's; is that accurate?",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1323,3501,138,11,"So from what I understand is, that you're saying that if I take -- if you pick up a leased vehicle and you don't put the tire on right and I go down the street and I kill somebody, that you're not responsible?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1324,3506,138,16,"My question, sir, is did you read that --",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1325,3508,138,18,I didn't read it as you're saying.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1327,3511,138,21,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1328,3512,138,22,"Okay.  And when your father entered into this lease agreement, do you remember him having any discussions with anybody from Bergey's about that particular provision?",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1329,3517,139,2,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1330,3518,139,3,Did you ever talk to anybody at Bergey's about that particular provision?,q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer

1335,3527,139,12,"I'm not entirely sure, this is part of the recap of the damages that you're claiming, and I think this is something that's in excess of what you were paid insurance-wise.  Can you tell me what is --",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1336,3532,139,17,So the Nationwide policy has 30 days of rental coverage.  So you can't replace as many vehicles as we have in 30 days.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1337,3535,139,20,So these were rentals from Bergey's that your business incurred following the fire that was not covered by Nationwide; is that accurate?,q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1338,3539,139,24,Repeat that one more time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1339,3541,140,1,"Sure.  The expenses incurred here, the $40,000, is rental expense to the business that you incurred because of rentals that you got from Bergey's that was not otherwise covered by Nationwide; is that accurate?",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1340,3546,140,6,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1341,3547,140,7,"Okay.  And you said there was a dispute between Nationwide and Bergey's about some particular issue, and I wasn't sure what that was.",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1342,3551,140,11,The title.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1343,3552,140,12,And you're talking specifically about the Sprinter which --,q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1344,3554,140,14,Caused the fire.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1345,3555,140,15,"Okay.  So the dispute wasn't with respect to the items identified in 3224, you're talking specifically about the Sprinter at issue in this case; correct?",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1346,3559,140,19,"Yeah.  You said if there was any other -- I'm sorry, you didn't.  He asked if there was any other disputes of things, and I mentioned that one was the counting thing, and that was paid later and that was marked there. There was something that happened at the very beginning, okay?  The dispute was that we had to keep on paying Bergey's for a leased vehicle that was burned up and out of here, okay.  And it was because Bergey's wouldn't release the title to Nationwide, so that's what the whole thing was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1347,3572,141,7,Okay.,q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1348,3573,141,8,"And then, so then Bergey's continues to charge for the rental, so that's probably why it is, because they knew that they were going to get more money.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1349,3577,141,12,"Well, did Bergey's ultimately provide a replacement for the leased vehicle that was involved in the fire?",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1350,3580,141,15,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1351,3581,141,16,Okay.  Did you have any discussions with anybody at Bergey's about the fire or the cause of the fire?,q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1352,3584,141,19,No.  We needed to have the copy of the lease so that we could get paid for it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1353,3586,141,21,"Okay.  But at some point did you ever -- just so I'm clear, you never had any discussions with anybody at Bergey's about the cause of the fire or the Sprinter being the cause of the fire; is that correct?",q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer
1354,3592,142,2,I called over there to get the records for the vehicle and they said that they wouldn't release them to me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1355,3595,142,5,Any other discussions you had with Bergey's about the Sprinter that's at issue in this case? -- let me say after the fire?,q,MR. DIVIS,start_answer

0,0,0,0," SAMUEL C. WORDEMAN, Ph.D a witness herein, having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified as follows: EXAMINATION",,,start_question
1,121,4,23,Would you state your full name and spell your last name for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury.,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
2,124,5,1,Sure.  My name is Samuel Clayton Wordeman.  My last name is spelled W-O-R-D-E-M-A-N.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3,126,5,3,"Can you briefly describe your educational background, where you went to school, and what degrees you obtained?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
4,129,5,6,"Sure.  I did my undergraduate work at Washington University in St. Louis, where I obtained a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering with a focus on biomechanics.  And then I started my graduate work at the University of Cincinnati in a Ph.D. program for biomedical engineering and then subsequently transferred to Ohio State, where I obtained a master's degree and Ph.D. in biomedical engineering.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,137,5,14,What is biomechanics or biomedical engineering?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
6,138,5,15,"Sure.  So as sort of an umbrella discipline, biomedical engineering is any field that utilizes the principles of engineering and physics in the context of biology and medicine.  So there are biomedical engineers who design implants and hip or knee prosthesis.  There are biomedical engineers who design surgical instrumentation. And my specific area of focus within the field of biomedical engineering is what's referred to as biomechanics.  And essentially biomechanics is a field that takes the principles of mechanical engineering, so the principles of forces and, you know, stretches and strains and applies them to, in this case, the human body. So I spent a lot of time studying the mechanical properties of the tissues of the human body and how those tissues respond to stretching or straining and application of external forces. And then another field within biomechanics is sort of what I would refer to as injury biomechanics which is the type of force, the direction of force, and the nature of force required to cause particular injuries to the human body.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,160,6,12,What types of research have you performed in biomedical engineering?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
8,162,6,14,"Sure.  I have done a lot of different types of research in biomedical engineering.  When I was doing my graduate work, I worked in a lab where we had a big 3D motion analysis system, and we would actually measure the 3D motion of the human body.  So the same type of systems that you see at play when you see a Pixar movie or something where you see people with markers on their skin, and then you can track the markers in three dimensions. We use that same technology for more scientific type of analysis. I have also done a lot of research using cadavers or human tissue donations, people who have donated their bodies to science, where we'll actually take the part of the human anatomy and apply forces to it and measure the types of forces required to cause a particular injury and investigate what I would call injury mechanisms. I have also done a lot of research with regard to what I would call a computer analysis.  So we'll take the same type of analysis that we did with the cadavers or with the live subjects and we'll actually create a computer model or a 3D model in the computer to allow us to further investigate the effective various forces on the tissues of the human body. And then in addition to that type of research, I have also done crash testing research through the course of my employment with ARCCA, where I've actually measured the forces associated with automobile crashes.  And I have also done component testing of motor vehicle accidents in the context of a biomechanical analysis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,192,7,19,Where did you go after you obtained your Ph.D.?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
10,193,7,20,"Sure.  So shortly after I finished my graduate work, I stayed on board with Ohio State for approximately six months doing a postdoctoral research-ship, where I was essentially doing a lot of the same type of work I was doing as a graduate student, and I was also helping to get some new research projects off the ground, projects that I had helped obtain funding from the National Institutes of Health for.  And then after about six months, I went to work for a company where I am currently employed called ARCCA.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,204,8,6,What is ARCCA?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
12,205,8,7,"ARCCA is an engineering consulting company.  We do a lot of different types of engineering consulting.  We have people who do purely sort of accident reconstruction type of opinions.  We have people who are structural engineers who do structural engineering. We started out as a group of naval engineers in the 1980s.  These are guys who were involved with designing ejection systems and restraint systems from naval aircraft, and then they sort of found a natural niche in the automotive world after they got out of the military and into the civilian world.  And so we have a lot of different types of engineers, but we are an engineering consulting company that does a lot of different types of work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,219,8,21,"With respect to ARCCA, what is your role?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
14,220,8,22,"So my role is what's referred to -- my job title is a Senior Biomechanist.  So I'm in our biomechanics department, and my job is essentially to evaluate the safety of restraint systems and to perform what I would call biomechanical engineering causation analyses in automotive or occupational settings.  And -- so essentially I investigate injury mechanisms.  I investigate the types of forces associated with various incidents. And then I also do some work with the National Hockey League, making recommendations as to the safety of their equipment.  So, generally speaking, I'm involved in identifying the safety of various systems and identifying the potential for injury due to various circumstances.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,235,9,12,Have you published any of the results of your research endeavors?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
16,237,9,14,"Yes, sir.  I have about 22 publications to date, I believe.  Generally speaking, they all involve some sort of injury mechanism identification or identification of risk of injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,241,9,18,Have you ever presented your research to groups of other engineering professionals?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
18,243,9,20,"Yes; I have presented numerous times at the national level, numerous national conferences as well as some smaller conferences.  I've also been fortunate enough to receive recognition in the form of awards from national organizations for some of the research that I have done. So, yeah, I have presented on the national stage multiple times.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,251,10,3,Are you a medical doctor?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
20,252,10,4,"No, sir, I'm not a medical doctor.  And sort of the main difference between what I do and what a medical doctor does is a medical doctor is trained in order to identify and diagnose injuries and then put forth a treatment plan to help a patient recover from those injuries. My training really is in specifically understanding how those injuries occur in the first place. So I don't treat or diagnose patients.  I am essentially interested in the forces required to cause the injuries in the first place.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,263,10,15,"With respect to your work in this case, are you contesting any of the diagnoses that were made by any of Ms. Perez's treating physicians?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
22,266,10,18,"No, sir, certainly not.  As I mentioned, that -- really the diagnosis falls under the purview of the medical doctors and that's what they're trained to do.  So certainly actually accepting those diagnoses as fact is sort of the first step in my analysis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,271,10,23,Have you previously been qualified to give testimony in courts regarding the same topics you're here to testify about today?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
24,275,11,2,"Yes, sir; I have been qualified to testify in courts in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Illinois.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

38,303,12,5,"Doctor, what were you asked to do in this case?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
39,304,12,6,I was asked to perform what's referred to as a biomechanical injury causation analysis.  So essentially that is an analysis to determine whether or not a particular injury or set of injuries could have been physically caused by the circumstances in this case of the motor vehicle accident on May 28th of 2015.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
40,310,12,12,Can you explain for the jury how that is different from a medical doctor's diagnoses?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
41,312,12,14,"Sure.  So essentially the medical doctors identify the symptoms and come to a conclusion with regard to what the injuries are, based on medical imaging or a history. What I do is actually analyze the circumstances of the motor vehicle accident in this case and determine whether or not the forces present in that motor vehicle accident and the forces applied to the plaintiff's body are consistent with the injuries that are being attributed to that particular incident.  So it's a very different and in my opinion more robust type of analysis than a diagnosis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
42,325,13,2,What is involved in a biomedical or biomechanical injury causation analysis?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
43,327,13,4,"Sure.  So my analysis consists of five steps.  As I mentioned previously, the first step in that analysis is to identify the injuries that are being attributed to the motor vehicle accident.  And as I mentioned, I'm not a medical doctor, so I'm not coming up with these diagnoses on my own.  That particular step really consists of reviewing the medical records and identifying what diagnoses the medical doctors offer. The next step in the analysis is to determine the severity of the motor vehicle accident, so essentially how bad of a motor vehicle accident was this.  What were the -- there are sort of two numbers that I'm primarily interested in.  Those would be what I would call the Delta-V and the accelerations in the accident, and I'll get into more depth on those a little bit later here. The next step after I've identified or quantified the severity of the accident is to determine the kinematic response of the plaintiff.  And when I say ""kinematic response,"" what I mean is I'm looking at the way that the plaintiff would have moved relative to the interior of the vehicle, in this case the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu, and I'm analyzing her interactions with the vehicle and the motion that she would have experienced as a result of the motor vehicle accident. And then the next step is to determine whether or not that movement of her body and the interaction between her body and the interior of the vehicle would have created what I would refer to as the injury mechanism responsible for the injury being claimed.  And when I say ""injury mechanism,"" I'm talking about the types of forces, so the direction of force, as well as the magnitude of force needed in order to physically damage the anatomical structures that are being claimed to have been injured in this particular accident. And then the final step is to take into account the plaintiff's specific circumstances and the individual tolerance of the plaintiff to the types of forces that she experienced in this particular accident, and to analyze those forces in the context of the types of forces that she would have experienced on a daily basis doing fairly benign tasks that are generally not associated with injury.  So that's sort of the five-step analysis that I performed in this particular case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
44,371,14,23,What materials were you provided in reference to this case?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
45,374,15,1,"Yes, sir.  I was provided with a number of materials, and then I also generated a number of materials during the course of my analysis.  But I was provided with the police report, the Illinois Traffic Crash Report, as well as color and black and white photographs of both of the vehicles, the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu and the 2015 Toyota Rav4.  I also had the repair estimate for the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu as well as a prior damage report for the same vehicle, the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  I had the medical records for the plaintiff, Ms. Perez, both prior to and subsequent to the motor vehicle accident.  I had the interrogatories from the plaintiff, as well as the deposition transcript of both Ms. Martinez, the defendant, as well as Ms. Perez, the plaintiff, and then I had deposition transcripts of three medical doctors, Dr. Michael Lee, Dr. Matthew Bueche, B-U-E-C-H-E, and Dr. Asavari Javeri, J-A-V-E-R-I.  And those were the materials that were provided to me by your office, and then I also generated some materials during the course of my analysis, including specification sheets for the vehicles involved an analyses of the severity of the accident and numerous scientific references to support the opinions that I have in this case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
46,397,15,24,Is that your file to your right?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
47,399,16,1,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
48,400,16,2,"After you completed your review of all of those materials, you did your analysis, did you prepare a report?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
49,403,16,5,"Yes, sir, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
50,404,16,6,I'm going to show you what has been marked as Exhibit No. -- Defendant's Exhibit No. 2 for identification purposes.  Is it a true and accurate copy of your report?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
51,408,16,10,"Yes, sir, it is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,409,16,11,Would it be helpful for you to review either your file or your report while testifying here today?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
53,411,16,13,"Yes, sir, it may.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
54,412,16,14,"Please feel free to do so if it helps you. Generally speaking, after reviewing the materials we've discussed, how would you describe the subject incident?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
55,415,16,17,"Sure.  So after reviewing all of the available materials, it appears that on May 28th of 2015 Ms. Emilie Perez was the seat-belted driver of a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  All of the materials indicate that that vehicle was stopped facing northbound on South Ewing Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. Ms. Martinez was the driver of a 2015 Toyota Rav4, and as the Chevrolet was stopped, at some point there was contact between the front of the 2015 Rav4 and the rear of the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  And then according to the testimony of the plaintiff, there was subsequently a contact between the front of her vehicle and an unidentified vehicle in front of her at some point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,429,17,6,"Now, with respect to the contact between the front of Ms. Perez's Chevy Malibu and the vehicle in front of her, was there any mention of that in the police report?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
57,433,17,10,"No, sir, not that I identified.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

61,440,17,17,Was there any mention of a frontal collision in any of the medical records that you reviewed?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
62,442,17,19,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,443,17,20,You said the first step in your five-step analysis was to identify the injuries.  What did you do to identify the injuries in this particular case?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
64,446,17,23,"Sure.  So as I mentioned, that essentially consists of reviewing the plaintiff's medical records and identifying what the medical doctors say the diagnosed injuries were.  So I reviewed the plaintiff's medical records and identified that she was diagnosed with spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1, which essentially means that the 5th lumbar vertebra which is sort of the big bone in the lumbar spine was diagnosed as having been shifted forward relative to her sacrum or essentially her tailbone which is the lowest part of the lumbosacral spine.  So she was diagnosed with that, and then she had a previous diagnosis of what I would call a spondylolysis or a pars defect which is basically damage to the bones located at the posterior aspect of her lumbar spine.  And those two diagnoses were essentially related to one another, according to all of the medical doctors.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

66,466,18,18,"Doctor, in terms of medical training, did you complete medical school?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
67,468,18,20,"No, sir.  As I mentioned, I don't have a medical degree.  I do have training.  I took courses in physiology and human anatomy at the University of Cincinnati Medical School as sort of part of my initial training as a graduate student in biomedical engineering.  And so those are the same courses taken by the medical doctors at the University of Cincinnati or the medical students at the University of Cincinnati. And then as I mentioned, after those initial base work courses, myself and my engineering colleagues went on to study the forces required to cause damage to the human anatomy and the structures that make up the human body, whereas my colleagues in medical school went on to study how to identify what those injuries are and how to diagnose those injuries.  So I certainly do have training in what I would consider the medical field, but I don't have a medical degree.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,486,19,13,"With respect to spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis, are those diagnoses that were made by Ms. Perez's physicians?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
69,489,19,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
70,490,19,17,Objection.  Beyond 213.,side_chat,MS. GROSS,start_question
71,492,19,19,And you know that from reviewing the medical records and the depositions?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
72,494,19,21,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,495,19,22,What is the mechanisms for a traumatic spondylolisthesis?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
74,497,19,24,Sure.  So as I mentioned --,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
75,499,20,1,"Objection.  Objection.  Objection, pending motions in limine.  Beyond 213.",side_chat,MS. GROSS,start_chat
76,501,20,3,"So the mechanisms required to cause spondylolisthesis requires shear force applied to the lumbar spine.  As I mentioned, spondylolisthesis refers to relative movement of the bones in the lumbar spine.  In this case, relative movement forward of the fifth or the lowest lumbar vertebra relative to the sacrum.  So the mechanism required to cause that in a traumatic type of setting would require what I would refer to as a shear force applied to L5, pushing L5 forward relative to the sacrum.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
77,511,20,13,Motion to strike as to the medical opinion.,side_chat,MS. GROSS,start_question
78,514,20,16,"Now, the second step you had to determine the severity of the accident.  What does that mean?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
79,516,20,18,"Sure.  So essentially that is how bad of a motor vehicle accident was this.  And as I mentioned previously, the -- that really consists of identifying sort of two numbers; the first number is what I would refer to as the Delta-V, and that's basically the change in velocity or the change in speed of the vehicle as a result of the collision.  So to illustrate that point, if you were at a stop sign and your vehicle was stopped and then somebody were to come up behind you and contact the rear of your vehicle, and your vehicle was, say, at the end of the accident moving forward approximately 5 miles per hour, that will be a 5-mile-per-hour Delta-V.  The same thing if your vehicle was going 10 miles per hour and somebody struck you in the rear and you were rear-ended, and at the end of that accident your vehicle was going 15 miles an hour, that would also be a 5-mile-per-hour Delta-V.  So it's -- the Delta-V is how much your vehicle changes its speed as a result of the collision. But if you think about it, you know, you could be stopped at a stop sign and you could depress the accelerator in your vehicle and also go from 0 to 5 miles per hour, but that is a different scenario from the rear-end collision that I talked about.  The main difference there is that your vehicle would go from 0 to 5 miles per hour during a rear-end collision over the course of about one to two-tenths of a second, whereas if you were applying the accelerator, it would take quite a bit longer.  And so the quicker that your vehicle experiences that Delta-V, the higher the acceleration is associated with that Delta-V.  So that's what I would refer to as the G forces or the accelerations which are the second number that I attempt to identify when I perform a severity analysis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,551,22,3,What are the steps that you look -- that you took to determine the severity of the accident?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
81,553,22,5,"Sure.  So in any motor vehicle accident the first thing that I want to do is identify the vehicles involved in the motor vehicle accident.  So I use the vehicle identification numbers to identify the year, makes and models of those vehicles.  And then I utilize that information to identify specifications for those vehicles, so things like dimensions and weights of the vehicle. Next I generally in a case like this where you have bumper-to-bumper contact will identify the components that make up the bumper systems of those two vehicles, and then I'll utilize the laws of physics and accepted engineering methodologies or accident reconstruction methodologies to assess the damages to those two vehicles and use that information to come up with numbers for the Delta-V and the accelerations as we talked about previously.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,569,22,21,Can you briefly tell the jury what you found with regard to the bumper assemblies on each of the vehicles?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
83,571,22,23,"Sure.  So the bumper assembly on the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu consists of a steel reenforcement bar which is mounted to the rear body of the vehicle, and then there is a foam energy absorber.  So it's sort of a dense foam component that's called the energy absorber, and that sits between that steel reenforcement bar and the plastic bumper cover or what you actually see on the outside of the vehicle. And the vehicle, the 2015 Toyota Rav4, utilizes a similar type of bumper system.  There is an energy absorber and then there is a reenforcement bar that has mounting brackets attached to it, and those mounting brackets attach to the frame of the vehicle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,585,23,12,What was the damage to the plaintiff's vehicle?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
85,586,23,13,"Sure.  So the plaintiff's vehicle had damage to the rear bumper assembly, so the components that we talked about that make up the bumper assembly as well as the rear body panel and the trunk lid.  And so that was essentially the damaged components of the plaintiff's vehicle in this case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,592,23,19,What was your final conclusion with regard to the severity of the accident?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
87,594,23,21,Sure.  So in this case I determined that the Delta-V in this particular case for the rear-end collision would have been less than 6.75 miles per hour and the accelerations associated with that rear-end Delta-V would have been less than 1.8g's average.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,600,24,2,Can you explain to the jury how you came to those numbers?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
89,602,24,4,"Sure.  In this case I performed what's referred to as a damage-based speed change analysis.  And essentially what that is, is a damage-to-damage comparison between the plaintiff's vehicle and a vehicle that was subjected to a low-speed rear-end crash test.  So in this case I had low-speed rear-end crash test for a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu that demonstrated greater structural damage to that Chevrolet Malibu than was sustained to the plaintiff's vehicle.  Specifically the vehicle in the rear -- low-speed rear-end crash test sustained damage not only to the rear bumper assembly, but also to the rear unibody or what I would essentially call the frame of the vehicle as well as to the frame side member ends.  So those are really the stiffest sort of structural components of the rear of the vehicle and damage to the rear body panel and the rear floor pan.  So there was more energy imparted to that vehicle that was tested by the IIHS, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, than there was damage to the plaintiff's vehicle.  And as a result, I concluded that the plaintiff's vehicle experienced a Delta-V that was less than that sustained by the tested vehicle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,625,25,2,So the vehicle in the test was a 2004 Chevy Malibu which is the same type of car that was driven by Ms. Perez?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
91,628,25,5,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,629,25,6,And in that particular case they measured an actual Delta-V of 6.75?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
93,631,25,8,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,632,25,9,And the Chevy in that particular test had more damage than the Chevy involved in this accident?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
95,634,25,11,"Right, and it's more structural damage.  So, you know, damage to a tail lamp or something like that doesn't necessarily indicate a great deal of energy imparted to the vehicle.  We're talking about structural damage.  So this is damage to the strong structural steel components of the vehicle that we are talking about.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,640,25,17,Are you saying the Delta-V of the plaintiff's vehicle in this case was 6.75 miles per hour?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer

101,653,26,5,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,654,26,6,"Now, with respect to the damage to the rear of the Chevy Malibu, as part of your analysis, did you work on the assumption that all of that damage was from this accident?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
103,658,26,10,"All of the rear-end damage, yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,659,26,11,Would it be fair to say that your analysis takes into account a much more severe scenario than the severity of the actual incident?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer

106,663,26,15,Objection to the form.,side_chat,MS. GROSS,start_chat
107,664,26,16,Yes.  I want to give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt with regard to how severe this accident was.  And so essentially I would prefer to overestimate the severity of the accident as opposed to underestimate it.  So I think my analysis is very conservative in that regard.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,670,26,22,How did you determine that the accelerations were less than 1.8g's?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
109,672,26,24,"Sure.  So acceleration is defined as the change in velocity over the change -- or the amount of time required for the change in velocity.  So that's something you can find in really any physics textbook that you might find.  But in this case I utilized results from crash tests, previous crash tests, so vehicles with similar bumper systems, to determine that in my opinion this particular accident would have taken course -- taken place over the course of about 175 milliseconds, so just under two-tenths of a second.  And when you do the math on that, it works out to 1.8g's.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,684,27,11,Did you perform any further analysis as to the severity of the collision?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
111,686,27,13,"Yes, I did.  So I didn't want to just rely on the damage as described in the repair estimate, so I also performed what I would refer to as energy-based crush analyses of the vehicles, so essentially looking at how much crush damage there is to the back of the vehicles and identifying an upper boundary based on that.  So based primarily on specifications for those vehicles and photographs of the vehicles, and I performed that for both the rear end and the front of the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu since, as I mentioned, there was a report of a subsequent frontal contact, and then I also performed that same type of analysis to the front of the 2015 Toyota Rav4 and used the laws of physics to sort of calculate the subsequent change in velocity if that particular vehicle were to have sustained greater crush than it did in this particular accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,703,28,5,When did you perform the additional analysis?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
113,704,28,6,"As I mentioned, I didn't want to just rely on one piece of information in order to come to my opinions.  So I, you know, the damage based speed change analysis, would rely somewhat heavily on the repair estimate for the vehicle.  I also wanted to use the objective information contained in the photographs of the vehicles as a part of my analysis, and I also utilized some of the available testimony with regard to vehicle speeds and motions in accordance with the laws of physics in order to just sort of check my work and make sure that everything was consistent with the Delta-V being less than 6.75 miles per hour for the rear-end contact.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,716,28,18,Did any of those additional analysis contradict your opinion that this accident resulted in a Delta-V of less than 6.75 miles per hour or that the accelerations were less than 1.8g?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
115,720,28,22,"No, sir.  They were all consistent with my previously mentioned opinions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,722,28,24,"Now, with respect to this frontal collision, you are not offering an opinion as to whether or not that collision occurred, are you?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
117,726,29,3,"No.  For the purposes of my analysis, since the plaintiff mentioned it in her deposition, I went ahead and assumed that her vehicle did actually make contact with the vehicle in front of it, and then based on again the damage to the vehicle and the damage to the rear of the vehicle and the laws of physics, again established an upper boundary for the Delta-V and the accelerations due to potential frontal contact.  And in this case my opinion is any frontal contact, if it did occur, would actually have resulted in again a Delta-V less than 6.75 miles per hour and accelerations less than 1.8g's.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,737,29,14,"Was there any damage to the front of Ms. Perez's vehicle, the 2004 Chevy Malibu that she attributed to this accident?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
119,740,29,17,"The plaintiff testified that there was no damage to the front of her vehicle, and the repair estimate did not list any damage to the front of the Chevrolet Malibu. The photographs did appear to show maybe some minor contact damage or scraping damage to the front of the vehicle, but certainly nothing that would indicate a significant frontal contact or anything like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,747,29,24,"Now, the third step in your analysis was to determine the kinematic response?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
121,750,30,2,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,751,30,3,What is a kinematic response?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
123,752,30,4,"Sure.  So kinematics as a term refers to movement.  So in this case I'm interested in the movement of Ms. Perez's body within the vehicle.  And so in order to do that, basically the laws of physics dictate the general direction of her motion.  I wanted to go through and calculate various things like her seated height, based on her height and age and weight and sex and sort of determine how she would move relative to the interior of the vehicle.  So I calculated things like her seated height, and I also identified numerous clearances and sort of the space around her within the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu, and then I applied the laws of physics to this motor vehicle accident and verified the results of that analysis with motor vehicle or with previous crash testing, using cadavers or live human subjects. So basically in a rear-end type of collision the occupant inside of the struck vehicle would tend to move rearward, so toward her seat, relative to the interior of this -- of the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  And I determined that that would have been her general direction of motion. I also took into account the fact that the plaintiff testified that she was wearing the seat belt in the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  So based on the laws -- or based on federal law regarding seat belt assemblies, I determined that that seat belt assembly would have locked when her vehicle's accelerations reached 0.7g's which is the acceleration associated essentially with hard braking in the vehicle which is why you might notice that your seat belt assembly locks when you apply your brakes rapidly inside the vehicle. So I took all of that information into account and essentially determined how her body would have moved as a result of both the rear end and the front end collision in this accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,787,31,14,"So if I understand your testimony, Ms. Perez's 2004 Chevy Malibu was hit in the rear and pushed forward, but the occupant in the car, Ms. Perez, would have gone backwards?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
125,791,31,18,"Yes, backward relative to the inside of the vehicle.  So essentially what happens in a rear-end accident is the vehicle gets pushed forward, and the net effect is that the occupant's seat sort of gets pushed toward their back.  So at the end of the day what that results in is motion of the occupant toward the seatback rearward relative to the interior of the vehicle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,799,32,1,Is that an opinion or is that physics?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
127,800,32,2,"That's physics, sir.  That's well-documented in numerous scientific articles, and that's really the laws of physics that work in a motor vehicle accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
128,803,32,5,"Is that why when somebody hits the accelerator and the car goes forward, if they have something on their dashboard, it's going to end up in their lap?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
129,806,32,8,"Yes, sir, the same principles at work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
130,807,32,9,"And that's why when you slam on the brakes, if you have something on the seat, it's going to go flying off the seat?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_chat
131,810,32,12,Objection.  Counsel testifying.,side_chat,MS. GROSS,start_answer
132,811,32,13,"Yes.  So it's essentially, you know, if you're slamming on the brakes in your vehicle, the forces are acting in the same direction as if you were involved in a frontal accident.  It's causing your vehicle to slow down which results in everything inside the vehicle sort of continuing forward at the same speed that it was prior to braking or prior to the accident.  So it's all sort of the same -- same principles of physics at play.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,819,32,21,What would happen to Ms. Perez's body if she --,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
134,820,32,22,I'm sorry.  You cut out for a second there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,821,32,23,Strike it.  What would happen to Ms. Perez's body as she moved backward when the Chevy was pushed forward?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
136,824,33,1,"Sure.  So sort of as a general direction of motion or a general motion of her body, I determined that her pelvis and her torso would have tended to move toward her seatback.  Her pelvis and her torso would have been well-supported by the seatback in this vehicle, and essentially her body would have just loaded into her seatback.  And then if there was any forward rebound associated with this particular accident, given the low severity and the low accelerations of this accident, I wouldn't expect a significant amount of rebound.  But as I mentioned previously, the seat belt assembly that she was wearing would have locked as her body was moving rearward, and it would have really controlled any forward motion of her body off of the seatback after she initially moved rearward. So it's my opinion that her body and her torso and her lumbar spine specifically would have been very well-supported by the seatback in this particular vehicle, and her lumbar spine would not have experienced any forces or motions outside of that associated with normal range of motion or normal physical activities.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,845,33,22,"Now, you mentioned also that Ms. Perez testified she subsequently came into contact with the vehicle in front of her.  What kinematic analysis -- strike that. You mentioned that Ms. Perez testified she subsequently came into contact with the vehicle in front of her.  Did your kinematic analysis also come to any possible motion of her body due to a frontal contact?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
138,853,34,5,"Yes.  So obviously if the occupant is going to tend to move backwards in a rear-end contact, her body would tend to move forwards due to any frontal contact. So as I mentioned, her seat belt assembly would have actually locked before she started moving forward.  So it would have been -- her forward motion would have been extremely well-controlled by that three-point restraint that she was wearing. I did take into account the possibility that she was sitting all the way forward with her seat completely vertically and performed calculations to determine how far forward her chest would have moved, and determined that if we grant the frontal contact and we sort of took into account the most severe circumstance for her in a subsequent frontal contact, if we assume any contact occurred between her chest and the steering wheel in this particular vehicle, it would have only occurred at a speed of about two to three miles per hour.  So it's my opinion that her forward motion would have been very well-controlled as a result of her locked three-point seat belt that she was wearing.  And again she would not have experienced any lumbar spine motion outside of a normal range or the normal physiological range of motion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,877,35,4,"We have covered the first three steps of your analysis; the injuries claimed, the severity of the accident, and the kinematic analysis.  What is the next step in the process?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
140,881,35,8,"Sure.  So the next step after I perform the kinematic analysis, which is basically an analysis of the general motion of her body, the next step is to look specifically at the injured body part, in this case the lumbar spine at L5 and S1, and determine the types of forces that the lumbar spine was exposed to due to that kinematic motion or that movement of her body inside of the vehicle and to account for the mechanism of injury required to cause the injury being attributed to the accident and determine if that mechanism of injury was present.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,892,35,19,How do you do that?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
142,893,35,20,So that consists of again sort of looking at my independent analysis and the severity of the accident and performing some calculations in that regard.  It also consists of identifying previous crash testing literature where those forces have actually been measured in comparable severity accidents and determining then based on the known mechanisms of injury whether or not those -- the forces in this particular accident were consistent with injurious loading to the lumbar spine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,903,36,5,Did you come to a conclusion as to how this accident would have affected Ms. Perez's lumbar spine?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_chat
144,905,36,7,"Objection, pending motion in limine.",side_chat,MS. GROSS,start_answer
145,906,36,8,"Yes, sir, I did.  So with regard to the rear-end motion of her lumbar spine, as I mentioned, her seatback is located directly behind her lumbar spine in this vehicle.  And so any rearward motion of her body would have resulted in her lumbar spine essentially coming into contact with the seatback in this vehicle.  That rearward motion would have been very well-supported and all of the forces applied to her lumbar spine would have been spread out essentially over her entire torso.  And so really her lumbar spine in the rear-end collision here would only have experienced a limited degree of extension or sort of, you know, bending backwards very limited amount with regard to the rear-end collision. Now in any subsequent frontal collision, as I mentioned, her seat belt assembly would be locked.  And if you look at the lumbar motion associated with slight forward motion, it's again my opinion that her lumbar spine would not have experienced any motion outside of the normal physiological range.  And again the forces applied to her torso would have been disbursed over her entire torso due to the shoulder portion of her three-point belt. So it's my opinion that, you know, she would have essentially experienced greater forward motion bending over to tie her shoes than she would have in any subsequent frontal contact.  And her rearward motion or the extension of her lumbar spine would not have been significantly greater than essentially just sitting in the seat prior to the accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
146,935,37,12,"The shear forces, did you measure those?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
147,936,37,13,"I didn't specifically measure them.  I did identify literature where it was measured previously at comparable severity levels.  In this case it's my opinion that the shear forces experienced by her lumbar spine would have been, you know, limited to about 20 pounds of force which is very minimal in terms of the lumbar shear forces that the human body can withstand. The bony parts of her lumbar spine that were damaged, the pars interarticularis, is not the only part of her lumbar spine that resists shear force.  You also have bones in your lumbar spine called facet joints, and previous research demonstrates that those facet joints can experience, you know, more than 650 pounds of shear force before there is any damage to the lumbar spine.  So in my opinion the shear forces in this particular accident were extremely low in the context of those needed to cause injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

154,966,38,18,"With respect to the G forces that Ms. Perez experienced during this accident, can you put those forces into some type of context for the jury?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
155,969,38,21,"Sure.  So we've all heard the term G forces, but we may not be familiar with exactly what that means.  So 1g is the force due to gravity.  So that's the force that we're experiencing right now as we sit in our chairs. It's something that we all experience every single day. The human body experiences forces much higher than 1g during activities of daily living.  So there have been a lot of biomechanical studies aimed at understanding the forces and the accelerations that the human body experiences.  And one of the main reasons for that is to -- in order to design an implant or something that you are going to put into the human body, you have to understand the forces and accelerations that that implant is going to be exposed to on a daily basis. So the biomechanical community has studied the accelerations associated with various physical activities. To give you some context, if you were to, say, sit down quickly in your chair, your lumbar spine could be exposed to 3 to 4g's of acceleration. If you were to jump off of a step or jump up and land on your feet, your lumbar spine could experience accelerations on the order of 7 or 8g's even. If you look at something a little bit more comparable to sort of like a motor vehicle accident, as I mentioned previously, if you were to slam on the brakes in your car, that will be comparable to about 0.7g's of acceleration. And if you were, say, in a bumper car and that bumper car were hit very hard, you know, as about as hard as bumper cars can get hit, the vehicle accelerations of that bumper car could be as high as 4 or 5g's.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

157,1004,40,6,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
158,1005,40,7,"You also -- the fifth part of your analysis, and I think we started in that a little bit, but the personal tolerance of Ms. Perez, what is meant by her personal tolerances?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
159,1009,40,11,"Right.  So obviously everyone is different to some degree.  In this case I had previous medical records that demonstrated that Ms. Perez had a prior pars interarticularis defect.  So she had a fracture of the bony process behind her spine that predated this particular motor vehicle accident.  And so I wanted to take into account her personal tolerance, because obviously, as I mentioned, everybody is a little bit different.  So essentially that analysis consists of identifying the types of shear forces that her lumbar spine was capable of withstanding on a daily basis.  So I performed some calculations to determine just how much shear force her spine would experience if she were to, say, bend over at her waist. In this case, it's my opinion that her lumbar spine would experience greater shear force just bending over to tie her shoes than it experienced in this particular motor vehicle accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
160,1028,41,5,Did your analysis account for potential variations in the plaintiff's posture or the posture immediately before the impact?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
161,1031,41,8,"Yes, it did.  So obviously there are always going to be certain things when you are performing this type of analysis that you can't know with exact certainty.  So I don't know exactly how her body was positioned inside of the vehicle.  And in order to account for that, what you essentially have to do is account for a range of potential initial positions of her body and then ask yourself whether or not, you know, changing that posture has a significant effect on the ultimate opinions with regard to whether or not the lumbar spine injuries were caused.  And so in this particular case I accounted for the possibility that, you know, maybe she was leaning forward a little bit, maybe she was straight up against her seatback, maybe she was turned to the side or something like that, and ultimately came to the conclusion that in this particular case those were not factors that affected the outcome of my analysis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

170,1065,42,17,"What are your final opinions in this case, Doctor?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
171,1067,42,19,"Sure.  So in this particular case my opinions are that on May 28th of 2015 Ms. Perez was the seat belted driver of a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu that was involved in a rear-end contact and potentially a subsequent front-end contact.  The rear-end contact was caused by a 2015 Toyota Rav4.  The severity of the rear-end contact is consistent with a Delta-V of less than 6.75 miles per hour with average accelerations less than 1.8g's. As for the front-end contact or any potential front-end contact to her vehicle, that would also be consistent with a Delta-V less than 6.75 miles per hour and accelerations less than 1.8g's.  The accelerations that Ms. Perez experienced during this particular accident were within her personal tolerance and human tolerance levels and were comparable to or lower than those accelerations associated with typical daily activities. Her -- Ms. Perez's body would have tended to move rearward relative to the interior of the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu as a result of the rear-end contact to her vehicle, and that rearward motion would have been well-supported by the seatback that she was -- by the back of the seat that she was seated in, and she would not have experienced any lumbar motion outside of a normal physiological range as a result of that rearward motion. As a result of any front-end contact, her body would have tended to move forward, and that forward motion would have been well-controlled by the three-point seat belt that she was wearing, and again her lumbar spine would not have experienced any motion or loading outside of a normal physiological range as a result of that front-end contact. And then finally, it's my opinion that this incident did not create the mechanism needed to cause the lumbar injury that's being attributed to this particular accident.  And therefore, it's my opinion that the lumbar spine injury was not caused or exacerbated by this particular accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

220,1203,48,5,Okay.  So I'll represent to you that we were given on April 26th of this year an updated answer to 213 interrogatories where defendant counsel is disclosing your name and the opinions that you are going to have on this case.  Is it your testimony that you've never seen that document before?,q,MS. GROSS,start_chat
221,1209,48,11,Objection as to form and relevancy.,side_chat,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
222,1210,48,12,"Yes, ma'am, I don't believe I have.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,1211,48,13,"Thank you.  Doctor, is there any medical opinion that would change your ultimate opinion on this case?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
224,1213,48,15,"Not with regard to injury causation, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,1214,48,16,"Doctor, you testified earlier that you work full time for what we call ARCCA now, A-R-C-C-A?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
226,1216,48,18,"Yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
227,1217,48,19,And you've been there for three years; correct?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
228,1218,48,20,"A little over four years, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,1219,48,21,"I apologize.  You've been there over four years. And in this case specifically, working with Querrey & Harrow which is the defendant's firm, law firm, how many times have you worked with them?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
230,1224,49,1,I think approximately 15 times.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,1225,49,2,Sixteen with this case; right?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
232,1226,49,3,"Potentially, yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,1227,49,4,"And according to your answers to our expert interrogatories, you've been working with Querrey & Harrow for about three years; is that correct?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
234,1230,49,7,"If you go back to the first time I was retained by them, yes, ma'am, that's about right.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,1232,49,9,"Of those -- of these 16 cases that you had with Querrey & Harrow, I know at least two cases where it's a motor vehicle accident.  What about the other cases?  Are they also motor vehicle accidents?",q,MS. GROSS,start_chat
236,1236,49,13,Objection as to form.,side_chat,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
237,1237,49,14,"Yes.  Yes, ma'am, I believe they all were.  I can't recall a case where I was retained by them for something that was not a motor vehicle accident, if that is the question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,1241,49,18,"Thank you.  Mr. Wordeman, is your employment with ARCCA, any of the expert opinions that you had given while working for ARCCA, do you also work for plaintiff's side?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
239,1244,49,21,"Yes, ma'am.  I have been retained by plaintiffs previously.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,1246,49,23,And what would be the percentage that you're retained by plaintiff and that you're retained by defendants?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
241,1250,50,2,"I don't keep track of specific percentages, but I would say generally it's more defense than plaintiff work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,1252,50,4,To date on this case how much has ARCCA charged for your time?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
243,1254,50,6,For my time specifically or for the entire case? It's not all necessarily my time on this case.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,1256,50,8,"Well, let's do this.  How much ARCCA has charged Querrey & Harrow for the opinions, revision, of your opinion on this case?",q,MS. GROSS,start_chat
245,1259,50,11,Objection as to form and characterization.,side_chat,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
246,1261,50,13,"Sure.  I believe to date ARCCA has billed $4,687.50 in this case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

249,1265,50,17,"Oh, I don't have that one, because the invoice I have is 4,687.50 of April 2nd of 2019.  This is not counting your discovery deposition, nor your deposition today; correct?",q,MS. GROSS,start_chat
250,1269,50,21,Objection as to form and characterization.,side_chat,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
251,1271,50,23,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,1272,50,24,"Doctor, and you are still charging $350 an hour; correct?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
253,1275,51,2,"I am not charging anything, ma'am.  ARCCA is charging $325 an hour for my time under oath here today.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,1277,51,4,"And again notwithstanding previous objections, motions in limine pending, Mr. Wordeman, when you review medical records in this case, you are relying on what other doctors that treated Ms. Perez came up with, right, the diagnosis that they came up with?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
255,1282,51,9,"For the diagnoses specifically, yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
256,1283,51,10,And you testified earlier on that you reviewed MRIs prior to this accident; correct?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
257,1285,51,12,I don't know if I specifically reviewed MRIs prior to this accident.  I believe there were prior images.  They may have been MRIs.  They may have been x-rays.  I can give you more specifics if you wanted.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
258,1289,51,16,Sure.,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
259,1290,51,17,There is numerous office visits and office notes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,1291,51,18,"So my question is, regarding is specifically the images that you've seen --",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
261,1293,51,20,Yes.  So --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
262,1294,51,21,-- prior to this accident.,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
263,1295,51,22,"Well, I would not have reviewed the actual images.  I would have reviewed the reports associated with those images.  So I wouldn't be interpreting the images. I would be relying on the doctors' interpretation of those images.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
264,1301,52,3,Because you are not trained for that; correct?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
265,1302,52,4,Right.  That's not what a biomechanical engineer does.  A biomechanical engineer performs injury causation analyses.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
266,1305,52,7,So my information was correct?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
267,1306,52,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
268,1307,52,9,"Doctor, throughout your report you have a series of publications, books, and articles that you cite to support your opinion; correct?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
269,1310,52,12,"Yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
270,1311,52,13,"Of those articles, books, and publications, do any of them take into consideration the group in which my client belongs?  And by that I mean age, preexisting condition.",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
271,1315,52,17,"Well, certainly a number of the articles that I rely upon consist of individuals that would be either younger than, older than, or approximately the same age as your client, you know, taller than, shorter than, lighter than, heavier than, et cetera.  So they would span sort of a range that would include your client, but clearly, you know, it's unlikely that any of them were specifically the exact age, height, weight, et cetera, as your client.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
272,1324,53,1,"Well, more than that, is there any article that had height, weight, age, and evidently a preexisting condition as Ms. Perez has?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
273,1327,53,4,"I don't know if any of them specifically had pars interarticularis defects, but certainly again there would be individuals who would span that range in terms of age, height, and weight.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
274,1331,53,8,"So let's make it clear.  Is there any articles, books, or publications, that you cite on your report that account for the fact and the characteristics in which Ms. Perez presents?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
275,1335,53,12,"Well, it's my opinion that there are many that account for them.  They may not specifically include all of those individual characteristics in a single article, though, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
276,1339,53,16,"Doctor, are you familiar with the lay term whiplash?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
277,1341,53,18,"Yes, ma'am, I am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
278,1342,53,19,And what is your understanding of that to be?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
279,1343,53,20,"Well, generally speaking, whiplash is a term used primarily with regard to symptomatology generally following rear-end motor vehicle accidents, and it typically refers to pain at the cervical spine or the neck and potentially what I would refer to cervicogenic headaches.  It's not a term that biomechanists typically use in order to discuss specific injuries, because there is not broad consensus as to what an injury associated with whiplash is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
280,1353,54,5,You lost me.  So your understanding of whiplash is related to an injury in the body?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
281,1355,54,7,It's a term used to refer to various symptoms. There is not broad agreement as to whether or not it refers to injury to a specific part of the human body.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
282,1358,54,10,"Sure, and I wasn't asking for a broad agreement or what other people understand whiplash to be.  I'm asking for your understanding of the whiplash.  So it's an injury to the body?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
283,1362,54,14,"No, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
284,1363,54,15,Is that what you said?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
285,1364,54,16,"No, ma'am.  I said it's a term used to rely -- or it's a term used in regard to various symptoms or pain which is very different from injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
286,1367,54,19,So you don't understand whiplash to mean a movement of the body in the car?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
287,1369,54,21,It certainly --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
288,1370,54,22,"I'm sorry.  Let's try again.  Strike that. So you don't understand whiplash to be a type of movement of a body in a car accident, for example?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
289,1374,55,1,"Well, there is certainly a type of movement that's associated with whiplash, but, as I mentioned, it's not a term that specifically refers to injury to a specific part of the body.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
290,1378,55,5,"Sure.  Doctor, did I understand your testimony correctly that in your opinion this rear-end accident did not cause Ms. Perez's body to move forward because it was restrained by a three-point seat belt?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
291,1382,55,9,"Well, it's not that it wouldn't have moved forward at all.  First of all, her initial movement would have been rearward relative to the interior of the vehicle, and if she did experience any forward motion, it would have been extremely well-limited because of the three-point restraint she was wearing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
292,1388,55,15,Can you calculate how limited that was?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
293,1389,55,16,"Yes, I did, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
294,1390,55,17,And how was -- how limited was it?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
295,1391,55,18,"Well, in terms of rebound, I did not specifically perform that analysis, but in order to take into account the most severe scenario in terms of potential frontal contact, it's my opinion that her head would not have moved forward more than 242 millimeters, and her hip would not have moved forward more than 123 millimeters which would be -- correspond to forward motion of her torso or her chest somewhere in the ballpark of about 182.5 millimeters, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,1401,56,3,"Mr. Wordeman, did you arrive at a speed in which defendant's car hit my client's car?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
297,1403,56,5,I identified an upper boundary for the possible speed of the defense vehicle based on the upper limit for the Delta-V that I calculated.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
298,1406,56,8,And what would that speed be?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
299,1407,56,9,"So based on the laws of physics and the damage to the vehicle resulting in a Delta-V less than 6.75 miles per hour, it's my opinion that the defendant's vehicle would not have been traveling faster than somewhere between 9 1/2 and 13 miles per hour.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
300,1412,56,14,In that range; right?,q,MS. GROSS,start_chat
301,1413,56,15,Objection as to characterization.,side_chat,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
302,1414,56,16,"Well, somewhere less than that.  It depends on -- when you're performing that type of calculation, you have to come up with what I would refer to as a coefficient of restitution and accounting for a range of numbers for that coefficient of restitution.  The number would fall somewhere between 9 1/2 and 13, but again it would be less than that.  So it certainly could have been going less than 9 1/2, but it was most certainly traveling less than 13.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
303,1424,57,1,"So -- so we are clear, it was a range between 9 1/2 and 13 and, like you said, it could be less, but it's still within a range because we don't know exactly; correct?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
304,1428,57,5,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
305,1429,57,6,"Mr. Wordeman, you also testified that you relied on some pictures in assisting you with your ultimate opinion in this case; is that correct?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
306,1432,57,9,"Yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,1433,57,10,"And I think we went through this in your discovery deposition, there are about 116 pictures that you saw, some of them duplicates; correct?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
308,1436,57,13,Right.  Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
309,1437,57,14,"Do you know when those pictures were taken, either from the defendant's car or the plaintiff's car?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
310,1439,57,16,"Certainly all of the photographs of the defendant's car that I have appear to have been taken in February of 2016.  I do not specifically know when the photographs of the plaintiff's vehicle were taken, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
311,1443,57,20,So the defendant's pictures would have been taken about a year after -- almost a year after the accident?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
312,1445,57,22,"Almost, yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
313,1446,57,23,And you rely on defendant's testimony that there was no damage and that she didn't take her car to be repaired; correct?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
314,1450,58,2,"I certainly took it into account, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
315,1451,58,3,But you didn't see any pictures prior to February 2016?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
316,1453,58,5,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
317,1454,58,6,"Do you know if defendant on this case, Ms. Martinez, was at the scene of the accident when the police report was created?",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
318,1457,58,9,"I believe, if I recall correctly, the plaintiff went and subsequently had the police report generated.  So I don't know that the police report was actually generated at the scene.  I believe it was generated subsequent to the accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
319,1462,58,14,So there is nothing in the police report to account to defendant's view of the accident; correct?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
320,1464,58,16,To account for her view of the accident?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
321,1465,58,17,"For her -- yes, for her side of the story.",q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
322,1466,58,18,"No; I didn't see anything in the police report that would indicate that, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
323,1468,58,20,"Mr. Wordeman, you did not review the transcript from Dr. Wahi's deposition, did you?",q,MS. GROSS,start_chat
324,1470,58,22,I'm going to object as to form and characterization.  It was an evidence deposition.  He is not allowed to review that.,side_chat,MR. FLYNN,start_question
325,1475,59,2,"Well, based on the objections, did you review any transcripts of Dr. Wahi's?",q,MS. GROSS,start_chat

327,1478,59,5,"No, ma'am, I don't believe I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,1479,59,6,Did you review any records from Mr. -- or for Dr. Wahi?,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
329,1481,59,8,"I would have to go through all of the records that I have to be able to tell you for sure, ma'am.  I don't recall seeing any, but that doesn't mean that I didn't see any. Could you spell the doctor's names, ma'am?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,1486,59,13,Sure.  W-A-H-I.,q,MS. GROSS,start_answer
331,1487,59,14,I don't recall seeing any medical records from a Dr. Wahi.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

336,1499,60,1,So you did review and consider those in doing your analysis in this particular case?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
337,1501,60,3,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,1502,60,4,"You were asked a couple of questions about whiplash.  Is whiplash sometimes utilized as a generic term for acceleration, deceleration?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
339,1505,60,7,Yes.  I think that's generally what it is.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,1506,60,8,Is it also generic for sometimes flexion and extension?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
341,1508,60,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,1509,60,11,"And with respect to flexion, extension, is that something that you account for in your kinematic analysis?",q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
343,1511,60,13,"Yes.  So, I mean, generally speaking, whiplash is not something that's associated with the lumbar spine at all.  It's more related to the cervical spine, but certainly the extension, the level of extension, the level of flexion of the lumbar spine are something that I accounted for during my analysis of this accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
344,1517,60,19,You were also asked about the potential speed of my client's vehicle which you gave an estimate of 9.5 to 13 miles per hour?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
345,1520,60,22,Yes.  The upper limit for the speed of defense vehicle would be somewhere in that range.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
346,1522,60,24,Is that based upon the Delta-V at 6.75 miles per hour?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer
347,1525,61,2,Right.  It's based on a more conservative Delta- V than the actual Delta-V of this accident.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
348,1527,61,4,So you would expect it to be less than the range that you gave?,q,MR. FLYNN,start_answer

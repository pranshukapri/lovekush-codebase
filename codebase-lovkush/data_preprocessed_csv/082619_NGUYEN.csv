3,143,5,19,"Good afternoon, gentleman.  If it's okay with everybody, I'm going to give everybody instructions now.  That way it will cut our time a little bit. First and foremost, make sure you understand all of the questions that I or any of the attorneys are about to ask you.  If you don't understand a question, let me know. I'll be happy to rephrase it or change it so you understand the question. The interpreter cannot have a conversation with you.  He can only interpret what you say and what I say.  If you need clarification, just say that you need clarification and I will clarify the question. If you simply answer the question, I'm going to assume and the record is going to reflect a few things; first, that you heard the entire question; second, that you understood the entire question; third, that you gave an honest answer to that question. You need to answer all the questions with an actual word.  Shaking your head or shrugging your shoulders cannot be interpreted by the interpreter. If you don't remember something, tell me you don't remember.  If you don't know something, tell me you don't know.  If you can estimate something, like time, distance or speed, go ahead and do that.  Just let us know that you're estimating. Have you understood all of those instructions Mr. Nguyen?",q,MS. SCHWEIKERT,start_answer

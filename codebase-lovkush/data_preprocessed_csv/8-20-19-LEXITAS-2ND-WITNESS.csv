298,694,34,21,"The primary care doctor, the first time on the 3rd, examined me, went through the whole thing just to see why I was in pain in the rib on the right side and to the chest.

304,716,35,18,"Oh, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
305,717,35,19,Do you remember why?,q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer
306,718,35,20,"'Cause I was still experiencing pain.  And at that point, what they had done was they had prescribed some NSAIDs and Tylenol for the pain, but I really don't like taking the NSAIDs because of my, you know, heart and the reaction that it could have with the other medications. But I alternated that for a few weeks, and the pain was still there, so I went back at the end of the month, I believe, and told him that I was still having a lot of pain.  And at that point, it was really not only in the chest area, which was getting a little better, but mostly in the neck and shoulder area.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,734,36,11,"All right.  And the third time that you went to see your primary doctor, do you remember why that was?",q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer
308,737,36,14,"Because he had prescribed that I go for therapy after that time at the end of January, and I did go for physical therapy, maybe five or six sessions.  And they believed that it really wasn't helping me at that point, and they suggested that maybe I should see an orthopedic doctor. So I went back to my regular physician, and I believe he gave me a referral for the orthopedic doctor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
309,747,36,24,"All right.  So after going to your primary care doctor, you go to NovaCare Rehabilitation?",q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer

322,768,37,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
323,769,37,21,Then you went back to your primary care doctor?,q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer
324,771,37,23,"Well, the therapist there said that they think that maybe I should see my primary care doctor and see an orthopedic doctor, because they said that, you know, with all the repetitions and all the exercises that I was doing, I should be feeling better.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
325,779,38,6,Okay.  And then at that point is when you went to Upper Bucks Orthopedics?,q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer
326,781,38,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
327,782,38,9,And how many times did you go there total?,q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer
328,784,38,11,Four or five times.  I'm not really sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
329,786,38,13,What did they do for you?,q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer
330,787,38,14,"An examination of that whole area where my neck and chest -- I mean, my neck and shoulder.  Made me you know, try to lift my arm up, extend it, go to the front, to the back, to the side, just to see what kind of range of motion I had. Turning my neck to the right and to the left.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
331,795,38,22,"So every time that you went there, was it, essentially, an examination and a conversation with the orthopedic surgeon?",q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer

339,810,39,12,All right.  And did he ever share the results of those tests with you? What is your understanding of those results?,q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer
340,814,39,16,"What I understand -- this was the first thing he said that he saw in the shoulder, that there might be some sort of an inflammation in the area where the shoulder meets the rotator cuff or something.  He says there might be an area there that's inflamed, and I believe that's why he gave me another shot of the Depo Medrol, to help relieve that, and thinking that the steroid shots might help.  And --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

346,838,40,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
347,839,40,16,And has any medical provider indicated why there was a difference?,q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer
348,841,40,18,"Well, it could be that I might have had too much of that steroid, you know, whatever the medication is.  It's a steroidal medication that might have triggered the AFib episode.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

360,868,41,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
361,869,41,21,Okay.  And what did your cardiologist say to you?,q,MR. LAVIN,start_answer

1481,3058,269,21,"Yes.  So this is not even, probably, about                   five months into Greg Smith's tenure.  We were on a trip               on the West Coast.  I had just been given perishable                   consolidation, which is a project that is run out                      Corinne.  I did not start it.  I did not establish it.                 I did not deploy it.  But it was a mess, and they gave                 it to me because it needed end-to-end management.                      I took it on probably a couple of months                before this.  Greg was new.  He wasn't aware of it.  We                went to the DC.  It became a very contentious point.                   There were two VPs in the room that had initiated it and               led it.  They did not speak up nor did they own what had               happened previous to me getting it.  It was perceived in               that meeting that the whole project had been a mess                    because of my management.  There were three -- they                    weren't VPs.

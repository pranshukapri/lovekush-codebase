20,178,6,1,"Can you just give me a little, some background in terms of your educational background and training?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
21,181,6,4,"I have a graduate degree in public administration.  I trained to be a city manager, but I spent 45 years in healthcare, and that's how that goes.  I have worked overseas in healthcare, I worked for University Hospitals of Cleveland, in the early '80s.  I was kind of their ambulatory services guy, outpatient guy.  And I moved, relocated to Sylvania in 1988, and got a position as a VP at Flower in physician services. I've spent all my adult life working on the physician side of the equation, usually with the hospitals.  And then, you know, I -- we merged, that's the wrong word, but we merged with The Toledo Hospital in January of '96.  And then three years later, they -- I moved to work for a company owned by St. Luke's called Providers Solutions.  I worked there for about three years.  They decided to close the company, and I bought it. And that was a really good -- that was a -- it still is a good company, it's just not the size it -- 2008 kind of wiped everybody out. And my clients were all physicians, and they started baling to hospital systems, because there is just -- it's safer there, so they thought. And then I was approached by the president of the clinic around 2010 to apply for the administrator job at the clinic, and I did, and I got it.  And so that's what I did for that stretch of five years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
22,215,7,12,Okay.  Let me go through some general back -- have you ever given a deposition before?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
23,218,7,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
24,219,7,16,Okay.  What type of case?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
25,220,7,17,Medical.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
26,221,7,18,Malpractice type matters or -- or business?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
27,223,7,20,"One was -- I can't really recall. One was angry physicians, and you know, suing his former employer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
28,226,7,23,"Got it.  I'm going to go through basic ground rules.  There is a videographer, but the court reporter is the official transcript, so the formatting is question, then potential objection from your counsel, or Mr. Wiencek.  Give them a chance to make an objection.  If they're making an objection, let them finish it.  Normally, you can answer the question after objections are made, unless your counsel directs you not to answer a question.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
29,238,8,9,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
30,239,8,10,"So normally you'll answer, even if there is an objection, relevance, whatever. But try to keep it in that format. You and I will probably get a little colloquial.  My client says you're an easy guy to speak to, so we might get a little colloquial.  And when that happens, we start talking over one another, even if we're not trying to insult each other.  It becomes more conversational.  The court reporter has a difficult time.  She'll throw her hands in the air and tell us not to, so we'll try to keep that idea in mind of question, give the opportunity for the objection, then answer. If you answer a question, I'll assume you both heard and understood it.  And if for some reason so you don't hear or understand a question, please let me know. And then the last thing is to keep your answers audible.  Some people get into nods and shakes of the head, and have to be reminded, but as long as you keep your answers audible, we're fine.  So those are the basic rules. You also have attorney-client privilege.  Even though you're a former employee, during periods in time that you were employed there, and there is other parameters, you have an attorney representing you today, so I'm not trying to inquire about privilege matters, or your actual conversations with counsel today.  I'm just trying to seek your independent information.  Fair?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
31,273,9,18,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,274,9,19,Okay.  In terms of -- where did you graduate from college?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
33,276,9,21,Western Michigan University.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,277,9,22,"And so going back a second, just to go back, when you said 2008 wiped everyone out, what were you speaking about?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
35,280,9,25,"Well, you know, the stock market, the banks, it was a big push, and it just, you know, in small business, there is the quick and the dead.  That's about it.  So I survived it, but I lost about probably 60 percent of my clients right away.  And so I had to downsize and keep moving, and I mean, a little bit of downsizing, a smaller space, and it got harder to make a living.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
36,290,10,9,"And when you said you worked on -- and I just want to hit on one other point, in terms of a trend, I think you were pointing out, which was that physicians at one time were more independent groups, and then there was a flight or movement towards hospitals. Is that right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
37,297,10,16,That's my opinion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
38,298,10,17,When -- when did you start noticing that?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
39,300,10,19,"About two -- well, in Toledo, it's been cyclical over the years.  It literally has.  Because in the early '90s, ProMedica and Mercy started employing physicians.  And then they -- they went back and forth.  I worked for Flower Hospital.  We employed them, but we didn't have as many as those two groups, and we didn't build medical office buildings like they did.  We rented space.  And my physicians were happier than the ones working for the other system. We didn't have a noncompete, because I didn't believe in them, so my guys could go anywhere they wanted.  And the model worked really well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
40,316,11,9,"And you saw -- did you also see sort of a movement towards the large medical institutions acquiring or becoming -- strike that. Did you also see the fact that a ProMedica and Mercy, for example, each have their own insurance programs, or programs that would direct clients to them?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
41,324,11,17,I believe ProMedica had Paramount.  I'm not sure whether Mercy had their own insurance plan or not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
42,327,11,20,"ProMedica basically created like a captive insurance, so to say?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
43,329,11,22,They did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
44,330,11,23,"And then so when they did that, when patients would be ProMedica-insured patients, typically, those patients, just to your knowledge, would be referred to ProMedica institutions?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
45,336,12,3,"The thing -- and not in all cases, because not everybody has all the specialists.  And they have to cut pieces out, so that if the doctor, or the patient really needed to go someplace, it would happen.  But that was the goal, was to capture market share, in my opinion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
46,343,12,10,"Okay.  So basically what you have seen -- well, you saw, although it was cyclical with doctors, you have seen, or saw in the industry, where the large medical institutions started to employ physicians, as opposed to where they used to be --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
47,349,12,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
48,350,12,17,-- more independent groups?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

51,354,12,21,"(By Mr.  Archinaco) And then insurance, also, is sometimes is part of that, like with ProMedica.  Not necessarily always, but sometimes you see an instance where a hospital also will have their own captive insurance to help refer?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
52,361,13,2,"In the Toledo market, I would say yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,363,13,4,"Okay.  And I'm not asking you for anything else.  I mean, I -- I do work in Pittsburgh.  I could tell you all about UPMC and all kinds of stuff there, but that's not for you to worry about today.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

They're entrepreneurial, that's where they want to be. They don't want to be owned by a hospital system.  So that's the model.  It's a -- they're cash basis, they're for profit, they're good doctors, but they're very independent.

325,1175,44,10,"The clinic tried very hard to sit on the fence, but sometimes, in the case of ProMedica, you wouldn't get the patient back.

331,1199,45,8,"Well, it was being driven by Dr. Nahhas, okay?  This was his show.  We were trying to figure out how to make it work, fund it, do everything legal and by the book. You know, Mercy is a not-for-profit.  We're a for-profit.  It was kind of -- that's why you had to have attorneys from both sides in the room, because you don't want to mess it up.  But it was mostly like how do we get the business model up and running.  That was it.  Because our plan was, if it worked, which we believed it would, we could use it in other departments.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Because they're hard to find, especially to come to Toledo.  But of course, I -- I -- I did talk with Tom Arquilla.  We had a number of things we were trying to do with oncol -- we had multiple departments we were trying to see what we could do between the Toledo Clinic and Mercy.  Oncology was a big push, okay?  Cardiology was a big push. But again, I mean, that was -- these things were all in early stages.

Okay?  And they did hire, some Mercy oncologists joined the Toledo Clinic, okay, as employees of the Toledo Clinic.  I think we had about 12, 10 or 12 oncologists.

Okay?  And I was running a, you know, trying to run a $250,000,000 company, with a thousand employees, and 150, 180 medical providers, so I was happy to let Mercy help with that.

And I believe -- they did that with a couple of general surgeons, and I believe, and I'm not sure I'll get it accurate, so I'll put that disclaimer out there, but I believe they gave Mercy help with a year's worth of salary support, until they got on their feet.

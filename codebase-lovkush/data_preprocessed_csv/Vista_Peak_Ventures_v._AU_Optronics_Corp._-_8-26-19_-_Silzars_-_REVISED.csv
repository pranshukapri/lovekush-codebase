105,339,13,10,What additional reasons may you want to discuss today?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
106,340,13,11,"As I have reviewed this claim one, this particular phrase, and also reviewed the specification, and then tried to relate what the claim says to the specification-- and the patent particularly calls out that the claims are intended to be broader and that the claims are what is really the inventive feature, not just what's in the embodiments described in the patent. In that context, if I read this claim in its broadest view, then it basically says to me that as written, any columnar spacing that is positioned anywhere other than precisely over the center line of the gate, that one could claim infringement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,352,13,23,"So is it your opinion that if there is a columnar spacer that is not placed precisely over the center line of the gate, that that would practice the claim?",q,MR. TICE,start_chat

109,357,14,2,"I specifically said-- I think you said ""the gate."" It's the gate-- the gate line, because the columnar spacing is not over the gate electrode.  It's over the gate line. So yes, as I read this claim and how it very reasonably could be interpreted, is that any columnar spacing that is in any position, other than precisely over the center point of the-- let's use the term here, ""of the gate line,"" that's in the claim here, if it's not precisely over the center of the gate line, then it would be, one could claim, infringement of this patent.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

114,377,14,22,"If you turn to the last page of your CV, it mentions that you have over 100 publications. Do you see that?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
115,380,14,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,382,15,1,"It says that that list is available upon request, correct?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer

120,387,15,6,Do you keep an accurate and complete listing of these publications?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
121,389,15,8,"It's become more difficult to do that now with putting publications basically online.  It becomes a little bit more questionable exactly what is considered a publication. Most of the listing that I have would be publications that were in technical journals, that were in recognized magazines that one could pick up and read. Over the last few years that's become a little harder to keep track of because for a number of years I have written a monthly column, and for about a period of ten years it appeared in Information Display magazine, which was a publication that was printed. In about the mid '90s, that-- my column went online, and I have not kept track of every one of those, although I do have some listing of what I've published. In today's world, it becomes difficult to say what is a publication. In many cases journals are now just putting things online, and so the traditional concept of what constituted a publication has changed, so I've gone with that trend, but I can't tell you that I've kept an accurate record of everything that I've put out for people to view or read or access.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,413,16,6,"Okay.  So you may not-- your list may not have all of your publications, depending on how you define ""publication,"" but you do keep a list; is that correct?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
123,416,16,9,"I've kept a list of everything that's shown up in print. For example, the columns that I wrote that were printed in Information Display magazine, those I have a listing of. The others I have basically on my computer and a folder that contains all the postings that I put up online.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,423,16,16,Why do you keep this list?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
125,424,16,17,"Well, in the earlier times, when things were printed, it was more appropriate for-- you know, to have a list of publications, especially for people that are in academia. They will generally provide a list of everything they've ever published, everything that they've put on-- somewhere because, to some extent, that affects their status in academia. I have not been in academia, but I've been very involved in the Society for Information Display, international society.  We have academics, we have people from industry, so it's a list-- like I said, I haven't kept it with great diligence over the last few years. I kept it with more diligence earlier in my career.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

135,452,17,19,Objection; form.,side_chat,MR. APREOTESI,start_chat
136,453,17,20,"In the context of a liquid crystal display, which I think is what we want to talk about today, the liquid crystal material is placed between two substrates, typically glass, and the spacing between those two substrates has to be maintained very precisely. The liquid crystal molecules basically respond to an electric field, and it's important that the response be the same over the entire area of the display, so whether it's a laptop computer or a cell phone or a television set, this-- to maintain uniformity of the image, we have to have very strict uniformity of the spacing between the top and bottom substrates. For many years the spacing was accomplished with little spheres, so basically-- it is actually correct to say that basically these little spheres were put down like from a salt shaker.  They were randomly placed. So the little spheres would simply scatter, and they cover perhaps less than one percent of the area, but they were precise little glass or plastic balls precisely dimensioned, typically in the range of three to five microns, and that provided that uniformity of spacing. More recently, over probably about the last ten years, these little round spacers have been replaced by little columns that set the spacing, and they're typically hidden behind the black matrix. The column, the spacing, is very important and very crucial to the operation of the display because it has to be very tightly controlled.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,483,18,24,"(By Mr. Tice)  What do you mean by ""very tightly controlled""?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
138,486,19,1,"It has to be controlled to a fraction of a micron. The total height of the column, the spacer, is, as I said, typically in the range of three to five microns. That is the thickness of the liquid crystal layer. That spacing has to be controlled to a small fraction of that spacing, which would be a fraction of a micron.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,493,19,8,"So do I understand correctly, when you say ""controlled,"" do you mean-- you're referring to controlling of the height of the spacer?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
140,496,19,11,"Yes. What we have to control is the distance between the top and the bottom substrate, and so we control that by the size of the spacer or the height of the spacer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

145,513,20,2,"A common line would be the-- we could call it-- I think a term that is actually quite good to use is a ""wiring."" It is a connection that goes to all of the common electrodes. I think the important distinction-- the same way we distinguish between gate electrode and gate line, so the only way we can access this total area is by running basically thin metallic conductors. The thin metallic conductors are called the lines, and then the actual electrodes are distinguished from the wiring from the lines.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

149,529,20,18,The context is vague and not tied to any patents.,side_chat,MR. APREOTESI,start_chat
150,531,20,20,"Again, since I mentioned both gate lines and common lines, we can talk about both because they both have this distinction. A gate line provides the actual wiring.  It goes out to the edge and it contacts to an external voltage. Then under the thin film transistor, we have the gate electrode, and so the gate electrode is distinguished from the gate line because the electrode is what now acts to function as the gate for the transistor. In the same sense, a common line is the wiring that now goes to all of the pixel electrodes that function to modify the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules, so the distinction is that the common line would not be influencing the orientation of the liquid crystals.  It is simply the wiring. The common electrode would be what is influencing the orientation of the liquid crystal in conjunction with another electrode.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

Even if you're doing a-- I've done a number of presentations, and when you put up, for example, a TFT structure or put up how the pixels are constructed, that inherently requires a discussion because you have a photo in front that says-- that shows these common lines and gate electrodes, so in that general sense, but when you ask a very narrow question, have I written a publication that says something about common lines, no. I don't think such would even exist by anybody.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Again, I reviewed the patent, I reviewed the specific embodiments that were listed in the patent, I reviewed the patent language as to what it meant in terms of what the claim one states, and in particular, when I started seeing the confusion, that I couldn't quite understand this last phrase, I went back and read this phrase. It says, toward the end, ""On the contrary, it is intended for this subject matter of the invention to include all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the following claims,"" so I said, ""Okay, what the patent says is I need to read the claim carefully and not assume that the embodiments that are described are the only things that are claimed."" The embodiments were somewhat helpful in trying to understand this last phrase, but not entirely. I said, ""Well, I understand what the embodiment shows, but how do I read this in the context of this last phrase?""  And I could not. I could not interpret this last phrase, other than to come to this conclusion:  This can encompass everything. It doesn't define which common line.  It doesn't define how much we move. It doesn't really define which direction we move. The only thing I can get out of this is that it has to be over the center line of the gate line precisely, and that's what led me to discussion and feedback to say, ""I'm lost.  I cannot make this last claim term work."" That, I think, was the beginning of saying, ""Well, it's indefinite.  You cannot figure it out.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

There are many common lines within the display, so as this is read now, I can point to any of those common lines and say, ""Well, I'm going to shift toward that common line, and it could be above or below,"" so I could shift both ways. Then this phrase of ""toward above,"" I do-- those two words stuck together I have never encountered in the English language, so without an ""and"" or something, ""or,"" or something, in-between-- so that's just confusing from-- I don't know how to interpret those words stuck together. Then the other was this ""partially."" ""We have to space partially overrun from above""-- how do I partially overrun from above? I cannot interpret that phrase in any common sense way, again without using an embodiment, which is supposed to be limiting. And ""partially,"" how much is partially?  Is it still over the gate?

252,879,34,4,"I am distinguishing that from what would be really probably the most common, in terms of number of products, would be vertically aligned. On a vertically aligned display, the common electrode or the common surface is on the top, on the top surface. In the embodiments that are described in the '327 patent, the common line and the common electrodes are on the bottom surface. That's my understanding of this patent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,889,34,14,Does claim one of the '327 patent require that the common electrode and common lines be on the bottom substrate?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
254,891,34,16,"To the extent that it says that we need a common line parallel to the gate line, I would-- that would tend to imply that it's on the same substrate. Also, on a vertically aligned display where you have a common electrode on the top surface, the only common line might be way out at the edge, so there would not necessarily be anything you can identify as a common line.  It's a uniform conductive surface, which is typically ITO. So on displays that do not have the electrode on the bottom substrate, the common electrode, I think you would most likely not be able to find anything that you can point to as a common line. They might use them just to enhance the conductivity, but it wouldn't be as clear as-- for what I believe is the intent of this patent. Now, on the other hand, if we can find a display where there are common lines that are parallel to gate lines, but they're on the top surface, then it may-- this claim may fit that kind of a display, just based on that-- just based on that narrow term.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I could measure a tenth of a micron, which would be perhaps a normal manufacturing tolerance, and I could say, ""It partially overruns.  There, the product infringes.""

It could be anything I could find that is-- in fact, as I was saying earlier, I had looked at some actual photos of spacers, and they tend to be spaced somewhat nonuniformly. There is not a precise line I can look at and say, ""Do they""-- and say, ""Okay.  Well, that would partially overrun."" I think the other-- the other confusion, the other uncertainty here is, what do we really mean by ""overrun""? Does it mean it still has to have some contact to the gate line or does it not? Can it be-- if I go-- let's say I have a gate line and a common line, and I have a black matrix above, and I put my spacers down the middle.  They're not on either one.

Well, further it says, ""partially overruns from above the gate line,"" so that's-- let's read the entire phrase, that ""The spacer partially overruns from above the gate line,"" so I think it means that it may still be partly on top of the gate line.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
400,1612,62,9,What does it mean for the spacer to be on top of the gate line?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
401,1614,62,11,"Well, we've started this thing by saying that it has to be-- since we're calling this the shifting phrase, that we have to start from above the widthwise center of the gate line, so that's our starting point, is that we're going to find the center of the gate line and this is where the spacer would have been, I suppose, and then we're shifting so that it now partially overruns from the gate line toward the common line.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
402,1622,62,19,"So earlier when you said the spacer is on top of the gate line, did you mean it's above the gate line in a vertical sense?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
403,1625,62,22,"No.  What I meant was that it's positioned to sit above the center line of the gate line and be in contact with that location, so it sits, in a sense, above-- you have the gate line, and the spacer sits on top of the gate line, but it's actually part of the upper substrate, so when we assemble the display, we place it so that it's precisely centered over the gate line.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

407,1641,63,12,"(By Mr. Tice)  So when we're referring to all in the gate line or above the gate line, it's the physical-- not physical, but the vertical space above the gate line; is that correct?",q,MR. TICE,start_chat

409,1646,63,17,"Yes. I am not quite sure how to explain it more clearly, but it's the location. We're not talking about some height restrictions or vertical connections. We're simply talking about the positioning with regard to the lower substrate. The lower substrate has gate lines on it.  I pick a gate line.  I find the center of the gate line.  When I bring the top substrate down, it's now going to be positioned dead center over that gate line. That's my goal.  That's what this says was basically the starting point.

482,1875,72,12,"Okay.  Now, Column No. 5 that we discussed earlier talked about shifting the columnar spacer, and it showed the direction. Disclosed in that paragraph, is a columnar spacer being shifted toward that circle that you drew?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
483,1880,72,17,"According to-- yes, according to this description and this embodiment, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
484,1882,72,19,"I know we have gone through this briefly earlier, but do you understand the problems that the inventors of the '327 patent set out to solve?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
485,1885,72,22,"My understanding is they set out to solve two problems: One was that because of this-- what they called sort of a shadowing effect when they do the rubbing, that downstream from the rubbing roller, that they don't get the same behavior because of the column sitting there and basically bumping up against the rubbing roller, that they wanted to shift the column further over under the black matrix, so they were going to relocate it so that this shadow effect would be hidden under the black matrix. The second problem that they said they were working on was that when there is pressure placed on the display, that there is a residual image formed, and their belief was that it was formed because the spacers are unable to move in response to that pressure. They then suggested a configuration that's shown in Figure 5B where the part of the spacer that contacts the lower substrate is actually-- has slight indentations, rubbing-- it's hard to say. It has a roughening. The surface is a little bit rough and it has little features on it which presumably makes it easier for it to move in response to pressure on the display. Those were the two problems that I believe they were trying to improve upon.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
486,1911,73,22,"Going back toward that first problem that you discussed, if you look at Column No. 2 of the '327 patent, right around Line No. 6 or 7, it says, ""It is an object of the present invention to provide""--",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
487,1916,74,1,"I'm sorry, which line was it again?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
488,1917,74,2,"Sorry. It's the second line under the ""Summary of the invention"" heading. It starts with ""Specifically."" Do you see that sentence?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer

491,1924,74,9,"Okay, now I see it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
492,1925,74,10,"And it says, ""Specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal display device capable of eliminating an influence of shades (area where rubbing is insufficient) in rubbing an orientation film, the shades occurring due to columnar spacers."" Do you understand what is meant by that portion of the specification I just read?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
493,1933,74,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
494,1934,74,19,In your opinion would a person of ordinary skill in the art understand that portion of the specification that I just read?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
495,1937,74,22,"I think they would understand the description, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
496,1938,74,23,Why would columnar spacers cause shades?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
497,1939,74,24,"Because the rubbing is a mechanical process. You can think of it as kind of a roller that rotates, and so the orientation film is uniformly placed over the substrate, so the rubbing roller, as a mechanical device-- if we can think of it that I have a roller coming over and here's a spacer, and it hits the spacer, and on the opposite side of the direction that the roller is moving, I don't get contact with the roller nap as it crosses over the spacer-- so there's an area, a small area, where the rubbing is slightly different than over the uniform surface. That is this shadowing effect that they're addressing in this particular invention, so no-- I think as far as is it understandable to one skilled in the art? Yes. If you know how the rubbing is done, you would understand that it's a mechanical process, that the roller comes over these little bumps, and then on the back side of the bumps you may not get the same rubbing effect as you do in a smooth surface.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
498,1960,75,19,Would a person of ordinary skill know how the rubbing is done?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
499,1962,75,21,"Given our definition of who is a person of ordinary skill, yes, because that's now been described in textbooks. It's pretty much known in the industry. There is a highly proprietary part to rubbing, exactly what materials are used, exactly what pressures are used, but the fact that it's done by a mechanical abrasion, in effect, by introducing microstructures into the orientation film, that is known.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
500,1972,76,5,"And I believe you mentioned this in the previous answer, but which side of the columnar spacers would the rubbing be insufficient?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer
501,1975,76,8,"Well, basically it's on the side where-- the rubbing roller comes from, let's say, right to left-- left to right, so you have a column sitting up here, and the rubbing roller is rotating and is being brought across the surface. It would be on the-- it's the shadow side.  It's the side where-- where the rubbing roller approaches the column, it would not have a problem. Where the rubbing roller crosses over the column, it would be immediately on that back side where you might have a problem. By the way, since-- like I said, this rubbing technology is very proprietary.  There's all kinds of special methods. Not everyone would have the same level of issue or have the same level of problem. This is a particular situation that these inventors felt needed to be improved upon. Of course the other situation would be if I placed the spacers in a different place, I've compensated for this shadowing by my black matrix and I don't need to necessarily be concerned about this. That's what they're explaining here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
502,1999,77,6,What problems are caused by the rubbing being insufficient on the back side of the columnar spacers?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
503,2001,77,8,"If I don't have the same uniformity in rubbing, the liquid crystal molecules will not necessarily orient in the same way, and if they don't orient the same way, then the light transmission will be affected, so I would get what they call this light leakage effect where there's-- the liquid crystal molecules didn't get reoriented sufficiently, so now when I want to have a fully black display, and the back light, of course, is always on, that I might have little places where I can see slight amounts of light leakage coming through.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
504,2011,77,18,Do you know what the inventors proposed to do to reduce or eliminate this problem of shading on the back side of the columnar spacers?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
505,2014,77,21,"What they proposed to do was to relocate the spacers, to move them further under the black matrix.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
506,2016,77,23,How would moving the spacers further under the black matrix reduce or eliminate this shading effect?,q,MR. TICE,start_answer
507,2018,77,25,"Well, the shading effect is very localized. It's in that immediate vicinity of the spacer. In fact, the black matrix is used to define the active areas.  It's used to shade the TFT, so the black matrix is ubiquitous to all the displays. If I tuck the spacer further under the black matrix, this localized shadowing will be basically invisible to the viewer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
508,2027,78,8,"When you were determining the scope of claim one of the '327 patent, did you consider this problem and proposed solution by the inventors, as described in the specification?",q,MR. TICE,start_answer

523,2121,81,24,"Dr. Silzars, I only have a few questions for you. Earlier today you were asked questions about whether a device could possibly only have one common line. Do you recall that?",q,MR. APREOTESI,start_answer
524,2126,82,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
525,2127,82,4,What-- in that situation what types of devices would only have one common line?,q,MR. APREOTESI,start_answer
526,2129,82,6,"What I was describing at that point were generally basically all the possibilities for liquid crystal displays, and ones that are twisted nematic or vertically aligned, the common electrode is on the top surface, the upper surface where the color filters are. For those types of displays, we only need a connection.  We need to make one connection to that display, but the connection has to be to the outside world. Where we make that connection would be considered a common line, or the alternative wording that we sometimes use is ""wiring,"" so you have to connect to any kind of electrode, and the line is what we use to make that connection. If the electrode is of uniform over the entire surface, we only need one connection, so at the periphery we would need a common line or a common connection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
527,2146,82,23,"So in that situation, with a single common line for a TN or a vertically aligned device, would the common line also be on the color filter substrate?",q,MR. APREOTESI,start_answer
528,2150,83,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
529,2151,83,2,Same as the common electrode?,q,MR. APREOTESI,start_answer

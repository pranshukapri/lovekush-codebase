9,112,4,25,"We'll get into that.  Nevertheless, that general location, Grand Avenue, Bon Air, Eagle Road, right in that vicinity, is that where the accident occurred?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
10,116,5,3,Eagle is not even near that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,117,5,4,All right.  I'm going by the police report.,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
12,118,5,5,Okay.  I'm just saying --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,119,5,6,Why don't we cut to the chase.  Where did -- where do you think it happened?,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
14,121,5,8,Bon Air and Grand.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,122,5,9,"All right.  So May 24th, 2018, Bon Air and Grand Avenue is where the accident occurred?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer

17,125,5,12,"I'm going to be asking you some questions about that accident today, all right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
18,127,5,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,128,5,15,"I'm going to give you instructions before we begin. These instructions were probably given to you by your attorney, but I want to make sure on the record that you hear them from me, you understand them, and then we'll move forward, okay?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
20,133,5,20,Yup.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,134,5,21,"All right.  First of all, number one, don't answer any questions you don't understand, all right?  It's my job to formulate a question that you understand --",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
22,137,5,24,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,138,5,25,"-- not your attorney, not Ms. Brietman, not the court reporter, that only you understand.  So if you don't understand my question, just say, ""Mike, I don't understand.  Could you please rephrase it,"" and I'll do so, all right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
24,144,6,5,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,145,6,6,Another instruction:  You need to wait until I'm finished answering (sic) my question before you begin to answer.,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
26,148,6,9,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,149,6,10,The reason for that is because everything that's being said on the record is being taken down by the court reporter --,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
28,152,6,13,"Right, each time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,153,6,14,-- to your right.  So we cannot speak over one another --,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer

32,158,6,19,I'll have to work on that.  That's --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

34,160,6,21,-- gonna be tough for me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,161,6,22,"Your attorney or myself or even the court reporter may remind you from time to time, but it's really -- we're not trying to be rude.  It's really important that you try to stick to that.  Just wait 'til I'm done.  I know you're gonna anticipate what I'm saying --",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
36,167,7,2,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,168,7,3,"-- but you need to wait, all right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
38,169,7,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,170,7,5,"All your answers need to be verbal.  You're doing fine so far.  You can move your hands, shake your head, shrug your shoulders, do whatever you want, but you have to accompany that with a word.  Do you understand?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
40,174,7,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,175,7,10,"Try to avoid things like ""uh-uh,"" ""uh-huh,"" ""nah,"" ""yeah.""  We know what you mean, but sometimes that doesn't get transcribed well on the -- on the record, all right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
42,178,7,13,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,179,7,14,"Don't guess at anything, okay?  It's perfectly fine if you don't recall.  This, you know, happened what? almost like a year and -- and several months ago, so if -- if certain things don't come to mind, that's perfectly okay.  I may ask some -- a follow-up question to jog your memory, but if you still don't remember, don't outright guess. But the difference between an outright guess and knowing something but not every detail is this: If I asked you what you had for dinner last year on August 15th, even though you have pizza four times a week, you probably don't know exactly what you had that last year on this particular date, correct?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
44,193,8,2,Possibly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,194,8,3,"Right.  Maybe you did.  Maybe it was an anniversary or something.  But normally, people don't remember what they had for dinner a year ago.  That's an outright guess usually. But if I asked you something like, ""How did you get here today?"" you might not know every turn, every road, every street, but you probably can give me a good idea how you got here, correct?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
46,202,8,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,203,8,12,"All right.  That's the difference between an outright guess and maybe not every detail, but you know the gist of what I'm asking, all right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
48,206,8,15,Uh-uh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,207,8,16,You feel comfortable with that?,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
50,208,8,17,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,209,8,18,"You can take a break if you'd like.  I just ask that if a question is pending, that you wait -- that you -- that you answer the question before you take that break, all right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
52,213,8,22,Yeah.  I don't think we need a break.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,214,8,23,Fine.  But maybe you'll get a phone call or you need to --,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
54,216,8,25,I don't have a phone.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,218,9,1,"All right.  Well, in any event, you are not being held hostage here today.",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
56,220,9,3,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,221,9,4,"Okay?  So if you need to take a bathroom break, whatever you need to do, stretch your legs, whatever --",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
58,223,9,6,We're good.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,224,9,7,"-- we can take a break.  I don't expect this to be very long, okay?  I don't really have many questions for you.  Keep this in mind:  Number one, have you ever had your deposition taken before?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
60,228,9,11,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,229,9,12,"All right.  So this is all new to you, okay? Right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
62,231,9,14,"Yeah.  It's a little scary, intimidating.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,232,9,15,"Don't be.  Just a conversation between me and you, all right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
64,234,9,17,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,235,9,18,"I'm just asking you about the accident.  I'm gonna ask some background stuff about -- about your life, not many, but it's really just a conversation between me and you.  The only difference is that we're in a -- you know, we have a court reporter here.  We're in a conference room.  But it really is just a conversation, me asking you questions about this accident.  And then you're done, and you go on with your life, all right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
66,244,10,1,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,245,10,2,Is there any reason that you can think of that would give you difficulty in understanding me today and providing truthful and accurate answers?,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
68,248,10,5,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,249,10,6,"The oath that you took today, do you understand that that --",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer

71,252,10,9,"Hold on.  Hold on.  I know you know where I'm going. The oath that you took today, you understand that's -- that's the kind of oath you -- well, it is the oath that you would take in a court of law, in front of judge and/or jury, right?",q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer
72,258,10,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,259,10,16,And that requires you to tell the truth under penalty of perjury.,q,MR. GALLAGHER,start_answer

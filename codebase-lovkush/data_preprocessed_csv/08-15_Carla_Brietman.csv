121,285,11,16,What does the directer of an art gallery do?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
122,286,11,17,"The director of the art gallery works with clients, shows artwork, takes artwork out to clients' homes, makes sure that everybody else that is working there is doing their job.  I also do a lot of framing and help hang the gallery so that it looks wonderful.  I make -- make sure everybody is just doing their job, pretty much.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,292,11,23,Did you have any trouble doing your job after the accident?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
124,294,11,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,296,12,1,What trouble did you have?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
126,297,12,2,"So after the accident, once again, there were -- we took a van out to show artwork.  It was difficult for me to drive the van.  It was difficult for me to get in and out of the van, but to drive the van was difficult. The other part of my job is:  You would, you know, greet the client, show them around the gallery. And part of what I did was show them artwork.  A lot of the artwork is hanging already on the walls, but a lot of the artwork is put away in what we call ""bins.""  They're slots.  And these pieces can be as big as 60 by 60 and as small as 10 by 10s. So we have all different sizes of artwork, most of it was on canvas.  A lot of it is framed.  And then, the paper pieces, we usually framed.  So imagine the difference in weight. So my job was to show the artwork to the clients and then get an idea of what they were looking at, spend time on my computer, finding other pieces, make an appointment with the client.  You're then bringing the artwork to the clients' homes.  That was my job.  That's pretty much in a nutshell, and also making sure everybody was doing what they're supposed to be doing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,319,12,24,And what was hard for you?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
128,320,12,25,"So after the accident, I was no -- I -- I couldn't pull the artwork out of the bins, because of -- every time I did, it hurt my back.  I wasn't able to pick up even the smallest pieces to show them, because it would hurt my back. I had to -- usually, I was able to go on a lot of these appointments with just me and my installer to show the artwork.  I couldn't even pick up the lightest pieces.  So I have -- now have my assistant go with me on every single appointment. On the weekends, I don't have an assistant, so I hired a part-time worker to come in on Saturdays to help pull out the artwork and show the artwork to the clients and then put it away.  So manual labor, I need help with.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,336,13,15,"A couple questions about that.  So how heavy is the heaviest piece of art, would you say?  And I understand you're not weighing it, but if you could approximate for me.",q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
130,340,13,19,"Probably -- I mean we have pieces that are close to a hundred pounds, which I never lifted.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,342,13,21,What weight would you say you were comfortable lifting before May 24th of 2018?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
132,344,13,23,"First of all, the word ""lift.""  I was pulling.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,345,13,24,I'm sorry.  Okay.,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
134,346,13,25,"Okay?  So when you're showing things in the bin, there are some things that are on top that you would have to lift down, but those were always usually the lighter pieces that weren't framed.  On the bottom are the bigger. So I could pull out large pieces 'cause you're just really just pulling them.  So I could pull out large -- large pieces.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,354,14,7,The hundred-pound pieces?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
136,355,14,8,"No.  That, I could not pull out.  Let's say 50 and under.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,357,14,10,"And from the date of your November, 2017 accident until May of 2018, were you still pulling out the 50 pounds and under?",q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
138,360,14,13,"With my -- my right arm.  I -- if I could pull it out with my right arm, I was able to do that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,362,14,15,And when did you hire this part-time worker?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
140,363,14,16,"I don't -- after I did a lot of complaining to the owners.  I don't remember the exact date.  I wish I could remember.  I don't remember.  I'd like to say like -- she's been working with us for six months.  I don't remember. Before her, I always have somebody working in the gallery with me on Saturdays, so I would get them to do it.  But like I said, it just didn't seem fair that I was asking somebody who's a salesperson to do my lifting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,374,15,1,So less than a year since you've hired the assistant?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
142,376,15,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,377,15,4,"I'm sorry.  I guess I should say ""part-time worker for Saturdays,"" to clarify.",q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
144,379,15,6,Yeah.  She's -- she's purely part-time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

146,381,15,8,She only works Saturdays.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,382,15,9,Did any of your medical providers put a restriction on you for that pulling or lifting?  Did anyone tell you not to do it?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
148,385,15,12,No.  I think they let me use my common sense.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,386,15,13,And I mean did you discuss that physical part of your job with your treating providers?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
150,388,15,15,"Yes.  And one of the doctors gave me, which was helpful, this belt that you can really tighten up so that when you are doing things, it doesn't hurt as much.  It just tightens things up.  Even just walking up and down the steps, it would help me, because I would get zings. So that would help keep it all, I guess, contained so it didn't hurt as much.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,395,15,22,And which doctor gave you that belt?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
152,396,15,23,Dr. Walsh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,397,15,24,"That's Dr. Walsh at Premier, right?",q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer

155,400,16,1,And when did you get that belt?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
156,401,16,2,"See, you're asking somebody who just doesn't remember dates.  I don't remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,403,16,4,"Are you able to say -- I mean I'm not looking for a specific date, but a time frame.",q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
158,405,16,6,"Probably within the first three months, I would -- I would guess, I started complaining about it hurting to do things.  And she gave me the belt.  It could have been even earlier.  I don't remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,409,16,10,Any other problems doing your job that we haven't discussed?,q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
160,411,16,12,"It's very hard for me to sit for long periods of time.  It's hard sitting here right now.  So that's an issue.  So I then got a standing desk.  So I sit part of the time.  I stand part of the time. I also get up and move as often as I can, which means walking around the block, things like that, because that helps me being able to continue working that day.  I come in later because I exercise every morning for an hour.  And by ""exercise,"" I mean stretching. I also -- when I've had enough and I just can't take it anymore, I've been leaving work early.  I'm usually supposed to be there 'til 6:00.  I am not always there 'til 6:00.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

167,434,17,9,"Are you making -- according to your interrogatories, you're not.  Are you claiming you missed any -- or lost any money at work?",q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
168,437,17,12,"I have not been doing as well as I have in the past.  So it's a -- it's a purely commissioned job.  I get a base, but most of my money is made through commission.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,440,17,15,"So in your answers to interrogatories, which were those written questions, you stated you were not making a wage loss claim.  Is that accurate?",q,MS. KRENICKY,start_answer
170,443,17,18,"The reason why I say that is it's not definitive as -- as -- as definitive as you're making it.  If you have a bad summer, and then you're -- no one is gonna be making as much money.  It's really about -- I mean our economy is doing well, but everybody is scared to be spending money. People aren't buying artwork.  The housing market is tanking.  People aren't buying artwork.  So that's why I answer that the way it is.  I can't definitively say, ""It's because of the accident,"" but I'm not as productive because of the accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

And then, what I did is I switched to -- because I was getting no relief.  The problem with physical therapy:  It wasn't working. So I started going to a place up in Malvern called the Barnes' Myofascial Release Treatment.  And I went there I think it was two to three times a week.  And they worked on, I guess, the myofascial part of my injuries.  And I did get some relief from that, the first thing that really gave me relief, not to the point that I'm pain-free, but made it tolerable.  And they also taught me there a lot of stretches and exercises and things to do with pressure points to be able to treat myself.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

639,1297,50,14,"No.  I just started seeing Dr. Lerman just -- so I was continuing to see Walsh to see if there was anything else that could be done.  And he still gave me a couple more injections and, I think, a couple more dry needling. They don't work for me. So at that point, I had purchased Barnes' book and started doing a lot of self-help at home.  So I spend every morning of my life, about an hour to an hour and a half, doing stretches and exercises according to their philosophy.  And I also do it every single evening. During the day at work, I stop what I'm doing when I'm in pain, and I go and do that.  It does give me relief, but it doesn't last.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

So -- so by ""equipment,"" no, but there are things. There's something that you use to -- to help with your SI joint by putting your legs up a wall. There are things that you do, and it actually does give me a little bit of relief.  But it -- like I said, it doesn't last.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

So he couldn't give me -- there was a time period between injections that he could do.  So, you know, we'd make an appointment.

651,1345,52,10,"But as far as a medical provider, I think with Walsh, when you give an injection, the kind that he was giving me, you have to wait maybe four, five, six weeks to get the next one.

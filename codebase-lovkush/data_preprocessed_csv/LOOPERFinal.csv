219,556,21,22,"Yeah.  We -- we were looking at buying a telephone company in Bolivia, and the -- the transaction didn't go through.  But the earnout was where we had gotten to in the negotiations trying to reach agreement on that. And then it would have involved a use of a direct hardwired internet line from the ocean floor. And in the middle of that -- going through Chile. And then in the middle of it, Peru entered a contract with the state telephone company and to use their direct link and so our client backed out of the transaction.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
220,569,22,9,Okay.  I may have misunderstood something you said earlier about it.  You had gotten to the point of negotiating an earnout provision when your client backed out of the transaction?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
221,573,22,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
222,574,22,14,Did they back out in part because they couldn't come to terms on an earnout provision?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer

229,588,23,2,"Yeah.  It related to the environmental liability.  It's -- it's not how -- what you would think of as an earnout in this transaction, but it related to what was going to be the exposure. Exxon contended it was World War II, and our purchaser contended that it was oil and gas leaks under the tanks and -- but the -- the issue was almost a reverse.  That if we -- we got -- our client would get up to 20 million back if Exxon was not hit for liability.  So that's kind of a reverse of a -- of an earnout.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,599,23,13,So describe how that provision worked.,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
231,600,23,14,"I mean, I don't -- I don't remember a lot of the details of it.  I remember the transaction well, but I don't remember the specific details of the -- of the acquisition.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

237,613,24,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,614,24,2,And the provision that we're talking about called for a return of some portion of the purchase price depending on the amount of liability that Esso experienced?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
239,618,24,6,"The provision paid the purchase price, and a piece of it went into escrow.  And the -- at the end of the day, if Esso were hit for liability, they would have gotten that additional 20 million and -- or whatever piece of it was -- actually had to be paid out as environmental liability. And then if there were no liabilities or not 20 million, then that 20 million would be returned back to the purchaser.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,627,24,15,"Okay.  Do you consider that as an earnout provision, too?",q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
241,629,24,17,"I mean, you know, an earnout provision is -- is a -- and the way I understand -- the way we use typically in negotiating contracts is an earnout provision is the method by which you end up striking a -- an arrangement between the buyer and the seller. When the buyer sees the price, that being X, and the seller sees -- I mean, the buyer -- the seller sees it as X and the buyer perceives market or operations risk, in that case, environmental risk.  But that it's a way to create a formula, get the deal closed and allow both parties to wait on future operations or market conditions to determine whether -- who was right on the price.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,643,25,5,So you would consider that an earnout provision?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
243,645,25,7,"I mean, it's -- it's a -- it's a provision, as I said, in a way that's a reverse earnout.  But it's -- it's a way to create the difference between the buyer's ask and the seller's belief in what the price should be.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

248,654,25,16,Were there contingencies included in the provision?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
249,656,25,18,"There were four reverse contingencies.  But the one that was really significant was that if the -- if our client, the purchaser, was able to obtain from the government of Germany a release of Esso Argon, then the remaining amount in the escrow would be returned.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,661,25,23,Okay.  That was one contingency.  What were the other contingencies?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
251,663,25,25,"I've forgotten what the others were.  They were all things that were insisted by the seller that basically was impossible to achieve, but the one was very significant.  I remember it well because it was a very hard fought issue that we ended up resolving in the US.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,670,26,6,In what sense were the other ones impossible to achieve?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
253,672,26,8,"You know, I mean, I don't really recall what they were; but it would be like an example, proving that there's no environmental liability, there's no environmental exposure, you know, things that you could never do. But I don't remember now what -- exactly what the -- I just remember there were three, and the one that we fought for very hard was the one that we ended up succeeding on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

472,1113,43,7,"I've forgotten the exact numbers on the -- the total transaction.  But the -- the terms of the earnout, similar to this transaction, most -- most earnouts are always developed late in the game when the parties cannot reach agreement.

474,1121,43,15,"It was a five-year earnout that was based on the net profits of the company, as I recall, because there was -- I'm pretty sure it was on a net profit basis because there was a lot of discussion about expenses and what was approved expenses and what was not.

482,1153,44,21,If the seller's expectations are achieved.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
483,1154,44,22,"So why is it rational for a seller to accept as a cap what it actually wants instead of saying, I'm willing to accept less than what I want; but if it performs well, I need to get more than what I want?",q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
484,1159,45,1,That's not what I've said.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
485,1160,45,2,"No.  I'm -- I'm asking why isn't that the case? Why -- why in your experience negotiating these things, why don't sellers say, if I'm going to take the risk that I'm going to get less under this earnout than I think it's worth, I also want --",q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
486,1165,45,7,The buyer or the seller?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
487,1166,45,8,"The seller says, I'm taking the risk that I'm going to get less under this earnout than I think the property is really worth.  So if you hit a home run, I want to get more than what I think it's worth.  Why isn't that what the negotiation looks like?",q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer

489,1175,45,17,Okay.  So you've never seen an earnout provision that was capped at an amount that was greater than what the seller thought the property was worth when you add in the cap and when you add the cap and the sales price together?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer

491,1181,45,23,You've never seen that happen?,q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
492,1182,45,24,"That would not be true.  But it's -- it's because this is not like -- these negotiations are not like a list price.  It's not like they've published it in the paper, I want to sell it for X amount of money. It's a negotiation. So who knows what the seller really wants when they set up a price.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1549,3738,144,6,It was a topic we discussed earlier.

1842,4534,174,22,"No.  It would be -- you would have to do that and make it clear that that's intended to be the disposition of the equity ownership interest.  You can't use equity ownership interest and get rid of the affiliates. I mean, affiliates is there.  If you got rid of it, then you would be saying if NRP disposed of its equity ownership interests. But you're saying any of the affiliates of NRP.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1843,4545,175,7,"Well, if you assume that at the time the parties settled on the language that they signed off on, none of them knew what the restructuring would be, how would you draft a provision to capture that restructuring as a buyout event?",q,MR. WAWRO,start_chat

1845,4551,175,13,"A hypothetical way to do it would be to remove the definition of affiliates and to state expressly that it would include any tax -- any reorganization of the companies that would have the effect of reducing taxes, I guess. There's -- there's ways to be specific, but a general reference to ceasing down the equity ownership interest wouldn't include that.  No business person would think that it includes that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1846,4560,175,22,"(By Mr. Wawro)  Give me a second.  I think we're done, but... Take a look at section 2.6(e).  Just make sure we're looking at the right thing, it says, ""If at any time buyer or its affiliate ceases to own."" Why is taking or its affiliate out important to your opinion about how to phrase a buyout trigger event?",q,MR. WAWRO,start_answer
1847,4569,176,5,"Because by having affiliate there, it's referencing that there could be a -- at the time of this execution, a different affiliate didn't own that interest.  But by having the affiliate there, it has to contemplate that in some other manner, an affiliate may own it, and that's still okay. It's only if that affiliate then owns it and then ceases to own it that it would be -- trigger the event, the 2.6(e).",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1883,4644,179,2,"So at the date the contract is signed, NRP Trona is the buyer.  So it has or its affiliates.  So the only way or its affiliates could have any meaning is that it permits a transfer of the equity ownership interest to another affiliate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1898,4686,180,18,"If the court believed differently than I do that -- I believe that including the purchased interest is a method of ceasing to own, disposing of those could be a method of ceasing to own the equity ownership interest.

1842,4661,179,5,"Thank you, Madame Arbitrator, and thank you to everyone for participating in this process.  I do mean it.  I try a lot of cases and this was pleasant, and it was nice to see the witnesses and the lawyers being so pleasant to each other.  So to the other side our adversaries, thank you. The parties have agreed and so represented to you that this is a straightforward, breach of contract case, and it has been something of a curiosity to us, as I suspect the questioning has been clear, the other side's choices of the witnesses to present as their testimonial evidence in this case.  Pleasant people to be sure, but not people who were involved in the matters that seem most germane to a breach of a contract case where the parties are attempting to put forward different interpretations of the contract. KBR, of course, believes that the plain language of the contract, the unambiguous language indicates that MFC under Section 11.4 of the license Closing - Harrison agreement owes $2.85 million, has not paid it, and, therefore, is in breach. MFC, for its part, appears to have developed over time and with assistance of counsel, some creative arguments to try to argue that Section 11.4's termination fee does not apply.  And so if the Arbitrator is persuaded that there are two reasonable interpretations here, we think plain language does not allow that and it's plain that 11.4 applies, but if there is a perceived ambiguity, then under New York law, extrinsic evidence comes to bear, and it's in that regard that the quality of the evidence, not just the quantity, though the quantity to be sure, but the quality of the evidence makes a difference and that difference is a difference in helping to determine what the contract means, what the parties intended, how they acted, what their conduct was under the contract, what their conduct and e-mail traffic indicates once this issue was raised, but before the actual dispute, the 2015 waiver episode that we'll talk about, and then what the parties conduct was once there was a termination either in January 2016 or in March 2016 of the license agreement. Closing - Harrison The extrinsic evidence demonstrates not just powerfully, but we think unequivocally that MFC breached the license agreement, not by contracting with someone else or deciding to go with another bidder, but breached the license agreement by failing and refusing to this day to pay the fee that is owed under Section 11.4.  What I thought we might do is explore some of the contract language and some of the evidence that bears on this question. In a contract case, it's useful to begin with the contract much like Miss Barron did in the opening statement.  Here, we have a signed contract signed by Aman Ahmad of KBR who testified at some length in his witness statement and yesterday live and in person, and signed on the MFC side by Syed Ahsen Uddin, who did not testify by witness statement, did not come live, and yet is on nearly, perhaps, more documents than any other name in this case.  Certainly that's true on the MFC side.  One of the lead negotiators and he is not here to support MFC's story or to otherwise provide any testimony.  That is a curiosity. In this breach of contract case, it is, I think, undisputed.  I know it's undisputed, we've Closing - Harrison had admissions on this point from MFC, that the November 2013 license agreement did not allow, it prohibited MFC from using KBR's ammonia technology with a non-KBR-approved contractor.  Including, among others, TKIS, ThyssenKrupp folks, we find that prohibition in the language of 2.1.  We find that prohibition in the language of 9.1, the assignment provision, which also, quite clearly, provides that the license agreement shall not be assigned to a competitor of KBR in the field of ammonia process technology licensing.  And the Arbitrator was able to ask the witnesses some questions about ammonia versus nitrates versus urea and different technology that can apply to different parts of the project.  I thought those questions were useful. Here, the parties both acknowledge, more importantly, MFC acknowledges that ThyssenKrupp was a competitor, a direct competitor, not an authorized user of KBR's ammonia technology, and hence could not use KBR's technology if ThyssenKrupp is the EPC contractor. So let's look at the plain language. There are multiple termination provisions in Section 11 of the license agreement.  The three that have Closing - Harrison been identified here are those on the screen, 11.3, 11.4, and 11.5.  We believe that 11.4, which provides owner may terminate this agreement and the engineering agreement for convenience upon payment of the 30 -- upon payment of 30 percent of the KBR license fee.  We saw in MFC's prehearing brief and we heard in MFC's opening statement this idea that MFC has the right to pick and choose which termination provision it wants to exercise.  And the notion that if MFC chooses not to pay the 30 percent, the 2.85 million, then that somehow means circularly that 11.4 has not been triggered. That is not a fair reading of this agreement.  It is circular nonsense.  The notion that an obligation to pay only accrues if the party that owes it decides to pay it, that is a pure circle and it doesn't make sense and it's not the way the agreement reads. So what MFC tries to do is shoehorn the facts of this case into either 11.3 or 11.5, and at different times MFC has promoted different provisions.  And for a period of time before MFC's lawyers got actively involved, MFC equated 11.3 and 11.5 until it decided to try to draw some distinctions between the two.  Well, there are Closing - Harrison important distinctions.  We've explored some of that in cross examination.  One is this question of timing.  In MFC's prehearing brief, and we heard again in opening statement, and we heard a little bit with Mr. Qureshi, this notion of ripeness by that or another name, and that is it is still possible, we're told by MFC, that sometime in the future the project may be cancelled.  And if it is cancelled in the future, then MFC argues it ought to be able to escape its payment obligations.  The language of the contract doesn't allow that.  11.3 speaks in terms of this project is therefore cancelled.  More on ""therefore"" in a moment.  11.5, the language is, and its North American project is cancelled.  So we need to look at the timing of the events at issue, at what point did MFC terminate the license agreement, so that we can look at the termination provisions and see which applies. There's a two-month disagreement on the question of when MFC terminated the license agreement.  KBR believes that MFC terminated the license agreement on January 16, 2016, when MFC entered into its signed 100 page EPC contract with TKIS.  MFC, for its part, has taken the view that Closing - Harrison MFC terminated the license agreement with KBR, not in January 2016, but rather by MFC letter of March 28, 2016.  That's Exhibit 101.  There's a two-month spread there, two-and-a-half month spread. But either way, MFC had not cancelled the project at the time it terminated the license agreement.  MFC still has not cancelled the project.  And one of the germane items that MFC's current interim president and CEO and CFO offers to it, Mr. Les Wright, is that the project is continuing, even as we sit here today.  It has not been cancelled.  And, as MFC's public statements support, MFC's acting chief executive and president continue to believe in the prospects of the project. And so looking at 11.3 and 11.5 which require at the time of termination, these are termination provisions, that the project is cancelled.  The project isn't, wasn't cancelled at the time of termination.  It's still not cancelled. 11.3 and 11.5 don't apply. We're going to talk a little bit about MFC's lawyer-driven notion of trying to distinguish between project in 11.3 and project in 11.5, but before we do that, I want to look at this language Closing - Harrison here, because the argument that 11.3's project doesn't actually mean The Project the way the parties in all their communications and negotiations regarded it, but rather means, as I've discussed with Mr. Qureshi, the KBR license agreement, that is empirically impossible given what the parties used for language in this agreement. There are three dozen plus times in the KBR MFC license agreement where the license agreement is referred to as the license agreement or the agreement.  And 11.3 itself talks about and this project is therefore cancelled.  Owner may terminate this agreement without penalty or fee.  MFC's reading that this project with KBR technology which Mr. Qureshi equated with this agreement, and this agreement is therefore cancelled, owner may terminate this agreement.  It doesn't make sense and it's inconsistent with the way that the parties referred both to the agreement and to the project. It is not a reasonable reading.  And it's not one that any witness involved in the negotiations supports. But let's talk about ""therefore."" Because in section 11.3, there are some important Closing - Harrison differences between 11.3 and 11.5 and I think the Arbitrator will remember the cross examination of Mr. Ahmad on this point where MFC's lawyer tried to suggest that the only distinction between 11.3 and 11.5 was the requirement of best efforts.  11.3 required MFC to use best efforts to achieve financial close by the deadline.  11.5 does not have a best efforts provision. Well, cross examination cannot make contract language go away, it can shed light, for sure, but it doesn't make the language go away, and so here we have different language.  We have a causal element, as I discussed with Mr. Qureshi this morning, and that is for 11.3 to apply, it's not just the financial close doesn't occur prior to or by April 30, 2014.  It has to be that's the reason, because of that the project is cancelled. Well, MFC did not cancel the project however it's defined.  The project with KBR, the project using KBR's technology, the license agreement, the overall Posey County project. However it's defined, even accepted MFC's new notion of what project means in 11.3.  The project was not cancelled because MFC didn't achieve financial close Closing - Harrison by April 30, 2014.  MFC didn't cancel the project or terminate the license agreement or cancel any project in any way related to this on May 1, 2014, or any time in 2014, or any time in 2015.  It only did so after and in reaction to KBR declaring that MFC had terminated the project under 11.4 by virtue of contracting with TKIS in January 2016.  It was only in reaction to that that MFC purported to cancel the project, terminate the license agreement, cancel the agreement, however you want to call it. There was no causal relationship between not getting financial close by April 30, 2004, and project cancellation, project termination, however project is defined.  11.3 does not apply.  Indeed, Mr. Qureshi testified consistently on this point with the testimony of Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Divanji and the documents, which show that after April 30, 2014, the parties continued to work together to push out the notice to proceed date, continued to deal with each other, entered into a TSA, the purpose of which was for KBR to develop an EPC binding proposal, all through the rest of 2014 and 2015.  11.3 doesn't apply by its plain language and can't because of this important difference between 11.3 and 11.5, and Closing - Harrison that is ""and this project is therefore cancelled."" Now, 11.5 doesn't apply, plainly.  11.5 unequivocally, even MFC doesn't contest it, the North American project, that's the Posey County, Indiana, project, they admit that one, and it hasn't been cancelled.  It wasn't cancelled in 2014.  It's not cancelled today.  MFC is still going after it three-and-a-half years after they admit they terminated the license agreement.  Sections 11.3 and 11.5 are not available to MFC. Mr. Qureshi and I talked about some other differences in language, for example, how 11.3 uses the term ""prior to April 30, 2014,"" and 11.5 uses the term ""by 30 April 2014.""  Different configurations and different terms, even when right here within a couple of inches of text in a contract can still mean the same thing, different terminology, just as with project, by the way. What's the testimony on this point? Mr. Ahmad who negotiated the contract, he tells us ""project"" means and always meant and was always discussed in his negotiations of the license agreement and the termination provisions in particular, the whole project, the Posey County $2 Closing - Harrison billion plus project. Mr. Qureshi tells us this morning that he formed his opinion that ""project"" means project using KBR's technology earlier this year in 2019 with the assistance of three groups of lawyers from MFC's corporate counsel and prior counsel in this case at the Pillsbury firm, from MFC's current lawyers in this case at the Garvey firm, and from MFC's in-house lawyers all getting together and coming up with this interpretation that he's come to offer here despite his lack of involvement.  All this without talking, admits Mr. Qureshi, about the meaning of the language, without talking to the lead negotiators for MFC, Mr. Uddin and Mr. Dar. It's a -- we shouldn't get to a credibility determination on this point under the plain language of the contract, but if we do, we're comfortable with that.  We're also comfortable because before Mr. Qureshi himself got together with the lawyers quickly and responded to KBR's January 27, 2016, letter and invoice, and KBR's February follow-up because a month had gone by, silence from MFC.  Mr. Uddin of MFC sent this March 2, 2016 e-mail, JX-593, and copies Ausaf, Closing - Harrison that's Ausaf Qureshi, sends this e-mail to KBR, does not draw any distinction on project.  Mr. Uddin writes, ""Without covering all of them, we note that under the license agreement, Midwest Fertilizer has no obligation to make payments associated with the license in the event our project does not proceed. At this point, we have not yet closed the financing for our project.""  No distinction is made here.  No notion the project means anything other than the Posey County project.  That's what Mr. Uddin wrote. So what is the attempted rewrite?  The attempted rewrite that we've seen in this case from MFC is to take 11.3's ""this project,"" and to say this project isn't really this project, it's the project incorporating the KBR technology.  That's the formulation that we see in Mr. Qureshi's Exhibit 101, the March 28, 2016, letter in which they purport to terminate under 11.3, this provision. Well, that's, of course, not what the language says.  That's a lot of language to read into this.  Here is the letter from which the language comes.  This is Mr. Qureshi's writing, Exhibit 101 that I just mentioned.  New York law really doesn't tolerate, I mean, this is black Closing - Harrison letter law nationwide, but New York law in particular does not allow parties to rewrite the plain language of the contract.  You can't ignore the language of the contract.  You can't try to look to extrinsic evidence first and then try to back in to some rewritten contract language.  Extrinsic evidence has a role after looking at the plain language of the contract to help with the interpretation, if necessary.  That's not what MFC's doing.  We love the extrinsic language, the extrinsic evidence here to the extent there is any need to interpret the contract or the decide between competing interpretations.  But what MFC is trying to do, and expressly so, I mean, in writing, is rewrite the language of the contract.  That is impermissible.  So why then do we have some different language?  Why do we have ""prior to"" versus ""by""?  Why do we have ""April 30, 2014,"" versus ""30 April 2014?""  Why do we have ""project"" versus ""North American project?""  What we do know is these are different provisions, negotiated and written at different times.  Section 11.3 and 11.4 were negotiated months, half a year before Section 11.5 is proposed one day before the November 5, Closing - Harrison 2013, contract is signed in this three-day negotiating session.  Mr. Ahmad testifies without contradiction, that it was the day before, on November 4, 2015 [sic], that MFC proposes the language and KBR accepted it.  But that's an explanation for having these three differences in the language, they are not duplicative, they are not superfluous.  There are meaningful differences in the language, the best efforts, and the causal because ""therefore"" language. So having looked at the key contract language itself, let's do explore the extrinsic evidence. First, how did Section 11.4 come to pass? Well, we have testimony in this case from Mr. Aman Ahmad who lived and breathed this negotiation and who was involved in the proposing of the language. There is this three-day time period in June 21, 22, 23, 2013, months before the final agreement is signed where KBR proposes this language.  And Syed Ahsen Uddin on June 21, 2013, in Exhibit 8 acknowledges this.  He writes, this is an excerpt, ""a new clause of termination has been introduced by KBR where they demand 50 percent of license fee, if Closing - Harrison willful termination is exercised by MFC before notice to proceed/financial close.  And that notice to proceed/financial close we heard from Mr. Qureshi as a practical matter, these are same-day events.

Before you began your argument, I was just looking at the request for relief at the end of your brief and I understand you're asking for the $2.85 million payment.  There's also a claim for interest and there's a reference to Section 6.4.  There is, I think, perhaps just a typo in the request for relief and I just wanted to confirm.  KBR seeks and asks the Arbitrator to find a breach of the license agreement or in the alternative a breach of good faith and fair dealing and order a payment of 2.85 million in damages plus pre and post-award interest.  And then when you quote from Section 6.4, you've got a square bracket when you're talking about when payment is received at MFC's designated bank?",side_chat,ARBITRATOR COHEN,start_chat

1857,6142,236,4,"All right.  Madame Arbitrator, friends and colleagues, everyone who we've been spending a lot of time with the last couple of days.  I would ask that you bear with me. My presentation cannot be as long as Mr. Harrison's, because I only have 55 minutes, but I think that I'll be able to squeeze everything within that time. Mr. Harrison has just shown you why he is one of the greatest lawyers of his generation. Now, I know that because it says so on his web site. And I assume one of the ways that he got there is by taking a horse, painting stripes on it, and calling it a zebra, and convincing people that he actually has a zebra.  He's got a horse.  We've got a horse. But even though it's got stripes on it, it is not a zebra. You heard about a little less than two hours of presentation today, and of that two hours exactly five seconds, I believe, and I didn't time it, but exactly five seconds was spent discussing the actual language of Section 11.4.  11.4 says, and I'll read it again just to make sure the record is Closing - Heller clear",side_chat,MR. HELLER,start_chat
1858,6759,259,23,"So from your perspective, who -- I mean, who terminated it?  You just said that they -- MFC sent a letter saying ""You Closing - Heller terminated it, so we're terminating it""?",side_chat,ARBITRATOR COHEN,start_chat
1859,6765,260,3,"Right.  So it's two different things; one is termination of the project, the other is termination of the contract. So MFC's position in the March 2016 letter is that KBR terminated the project by sending out that letter saying, you know, ""We're done.  Send us back everything,"" et cetera, et cetera, even though we had no grounds to do so under 11.4.  So KBR -- MFC responded and said, ""If you want to play that game, here's how it's going to work.""  Okay? We have grounds now, which we didn't have before, to terminate under 11.3, and we're going to send you this notice, which we did, the project -- you need two things under the -- under 11.3 in order for MFC to be able to terminate.  First, it is not -- it has not reached financial close by April 30, 2014, that's Item No. 1.  The second one, the second thing is that this project is therefore terminated.  So those two things, now if they didn't exist before, which they may have, but now they certainly existed, and that gave MFC the opportunity, which it may not have wanted to use, but given that KBR started it, this is how it was going to finish. Closing - Heller So the termination fee, if -- if KBR is correct, and which it's not, but if it's correct that it can somehow be payable before financial close, notice to proceed, if this contract can somehow be construed as allowing this fee to be paid before financial close, then our position and I think it's supported not only by the law, but by the facts that have been elicited, is a penalty.  It's a penalty and it's unenforceable.  And, again, as I mentioned earlier, you heard testimony from Mr. Ahmad that KBR's damages, as far as he's concerned, he didn't quantify them, he doesn't even know what they are because he didn't bother to check, but he booked all of this to overhead.  I don't know of a single case which says you're allowed to charge somebody overhead if you haven't invoiced it.  This is certainly never invoiced, and you look back at Section 3.1 of the contract, it says that KBR is not entitled to do any of that anyway.  So none of this stuff was available to KBR as damages under the contract, and when you look at the penalty analysis, the penalty analysis limits itself to whether or not there was a penalty under the contract at issue, to whether or not the company Closing - Heller that or the party that is claiming its right to recover under this liquidated damage clause is actually looking to recover under a penalty clause. And also the case law will tell you that -- and I'll cite a case that unfortunately I don't have on the screen, but it's the Northern Shipping Funds case, and it's 998 F. Sub 2nd 301, which says that the terminology that the parties used to describe this clause is important, and it matters.  So we brought up five examples or four examples of KBR from different sources calling this clause a penalty clause, and I don't know how many times you need to see that.  It comes up, as far as we counted, at least 30 times in the documents that comes up, and probably more, we never really counted each one, but here are examples, and of course JX-60, which we quote below, which has Mr. Ahmad saying that if -- which is that term over there",side_chat,MR. HELLER,start_chat
1860,7142,274,16,"Thank you. So, I just want to go back to something you said about whether the termination is effective or not.  And I don't -- you know, I don't have Live Note in front of me, but when I was understanding -- I understand your argument to be that you made a comment about whether, if termination -- you think termination was effective, but I might find it's ineffective and if I find it ineffective, then there's a question about what damages, if any, could Closing - Heller be due to KBR and you argue nothing.  When I hear you use the term ""effective"", that makes me think about whether the contract is still -- is still in operation, and that's a different word than whether termination was valid, whether the grounds for termination that were asserted, whether a notice of termination of March 2016 asserting 11.3 is a ground for termination, validity, you know, as a practical matter, if the termination -- if, you know, the contract is dead, it's been killed, it's -- the question is from a legal perspective",side_chat,ARBITRATOR COHEN,start_chat
1861,7167,275,15,Okay.,side_chat,MR. HELLER,start_chat
1862,7168,275,16,Right?  Is that not the question that I'm asking?,side_chat,ARBITRATOR COHEN,start_chat
1863,7170,275,18,Yes.,side_chat,MR. HELLER,start_chat
1864,7171,275,19,"Rather than whether it was effective.  In other words, if the contract is still living and breathing between the parties.",side_chat,ARBITRATOR COHEN,start_chat
1865,7174,275,22,"Right.  So I think the only question to be decided there, and KBR's advanced this in -- in the course of this process, in the course of Mr. Harrison's closing. Closing - Heller How do you read 11.3?  If you read 11.3 the way we do, then that termination was effective. If you read it the way they do or they'd like you to read it, which we think doesn't make any sense, but it's possible that anyone, you know, I mean, things happen, you may find that their discussion is attractive.  If you find that that termination was not effective under 11.3, then as Mr. Ahmad said the other day, as they were discussing potentially renewing the relationship with MFC in 2017, after the notice to terminate was delivered, he said that he thought that that contract was still alive.  He didn't need to renegotiate it.  So from their perspective, and I'm not sure that I get it a hundred percent, but from their perspective, they believe, that there's a chance anyway, that that contract is still alive, and that if the termination was ineffective, it's not a wrongful termination, but it was simply ineffective, and that's -- and, therefore, the contract and whatever obligations are going to happen sometime down the road could kick in, and that -- that, I think, is what that means and that's why I say that if that termination was ineffective, if the -- if it wasn't something that Proceedings was available under 11.3, I don't think you can impute that the termination then becomes a termination under 11.4, because 11.4 is very specific.  You got to deliver the money.  It's at the owner's option, it's termination for convenience.  If the own, for some reason, made a mistake, and this was not the termination of the project, even though the other condition is satisfied, there's no notice to proceed, then it was not a wrongful termination, but it was simply an ineffective termination.  And if that is the case, that contract is still alive, they still have a potential claim later on when there is a -- a financial close, and that's it.  That's our position.",side_chat,MR. HELLER,start_chat
1866,7221,277,17,"Okay.  I understand your -- I understand your position. Mr. Harrison or Miss Barron, the -- when Mr. Heller was talking about the January 2016 circumstances, and he was making an argument about whether signing a contract with a competitor could trigger 11.4.  He spoke in detail about conditions precedent that are in the TKIS contract, and I haven't heard you speak much about the Proceedings conditional -- the argument that the EPC contract is not effective until certain conditions precedent have been met. So I'd be interested in having you comment on -- on that argument, line of argument by Mr. Heller.",side_chat,ARBITRATOR COHEN,start_chat
1867,7238,278,8,"JX-589 is the January 25, 2016, e-mail forwarding the press release news article about MFC and TKIS signing the EPC contract. We heard testimony about MFC going public with the lenders, and with vendors that it had this $2 billion plus contract.  We saw the public bond filings indicating that certain consequences flow from the signing of that contract. So while there were conditions precedent to the ultimate effectiveness, MFC held that contract out, that one-page contract, as a final EPC contract that had the effect of supplanting KBR's, the ammonia technology provider. In the interim, between January 16, 2016, when TKIS and MFC signed that hundred page EPC contract plus exhibits, and some ten months later, when TKIS ends up terminating that contract in late Proceedings 2016, MFC terminates the KBR 2013 ammonia license agreement that's at issue in this case.  So at the time that MFC terminates the KBR ammonia license, we say late January 2016, MFC acknowledges at latest March 28th, 2016.  The MFC TKIS EPC contract is in effect.  It is subject to conditions, but it is in effect, and that's the controlling contract, and it precludes the use of KBR's technology.  The fact that MFC on March 28, 2016, in Exhibit 101 unequivocally terminates and cancels the KBR ammonia license agreement at issue, as Exhibit 101 shows by it's language and as Mr. Qureshi, the author of that letter, admitted unequivocally here, makes that really easy for you and for us, because the TKIS contract was in force and effect at the time that MFC terminates us.",side_chat,MR.

1869,7276,279,20,"Yes, of course. Again, you can put stripes on the horse, but it's still a horse. So, yes, maybe they read these disclosures publicly, and maybe they decided that based on the public disclosures, you know, they're Proceedings upset.  So the way to do that is not to send out this litigation-laden notice, but to call up somebody, one of their contacts at MFC and say, ""Hey, what's going on here?  What did you do?  Did you actually sign an agreement with TKIS?  Are you going forward with TKIS?  Are you proceeding with TKIS?""  No one of that happened.  Instead, within days, two days after they saw this press release, they sent this notice to MFC",side_chat,MR. HELLER,start_chat
1870,7313,281,5,Mr. Harrison.,side_chat,ARBITRATOR COHEN,start_chat
1871,7314,281,6,"Just two more thoughts on that, if I could. One is that during this exchange of correspondence, as this dispute was coming to the fore in early and mid-2016, MFC never wrote back or said, ""Wait a minute.  We didn't terminate you,"" or ""The contract's still in force and effect between KBR and MFC,"" or, ""You, KBR, misunderstand the nature of our EPC contract that we publicly announced as filing with TKIS."" Second point, on this notion of conditionality and conditions precedent, as MFC's lawyer has just argued in closing, the KBR 2013 -- 2013 contract at issue itself was is not effective in terms of imposing obligations on KBR and technology fee payment obligations on MFC until the condition of issuing notice to proceed took place. These contracts in the project finance world and in the real world have some conditionality, but you have an effective contract at a certain time. Proceedings That's why Mr. Qureshi, for example, could not identify any prior instance in the 83 year history of the Fatima Group where they've had at the same time technology contracts with competitors with only one to be used. So the signing of the EPC contract with TKIS means that's the effective contract, that's the valid contract, that's the contract in force, and terminates us.  So this notion of conditionality somehow means the contract doesn't matter or doesn't replace is inaccurate. And just on this related point, I guess I'm glad that I did anticipate the before or after financial close argument, because the contemporaneous writings, this time inside MFC for Mr. Uddin, show that the termination clause was to apply before NTP, which makes sense.  If MFC issues a notice to proceed to KBR under the license agreement, then the obligations kick in and KBR is going to get the $9.5 million under the license agreement, plus the additional $32 million under the two companion agreements.  A termination for convenience fee like 11.4, as Mr. Uddin's contemporaneous March -- excuse me, I think it was Proceedings May 2013 e-mails indicate, applies of course before. This is the consolation prize if we get terminated.",side_chat,MR. HARRISON,start_chat

1876,7378,283,18,"Well, thank you to everyone for bearing with us for the last two days, and thank you to Susman Godfrey for the hospitality in providing hearing space for us. In terms of wrapping up the demonstrative that was just used for the closing for the respondents, we'll mark as Respondent's Demonstrative 1.  And if I can ask both sides to Proceedings e-mail copies of the demonstrative that were marked, we'll do that before the record is formally closed. As we previously agreed, we have these closing arguments in lieu of having post-hearing submissions.  Over the next day or so I will confirm that there's nothing further.  I don't think anything further that I need from either side, but I will go back to dot my I's and cross my T's and make sure that I'm not missing anything before I send a communication that formally closes the proceedings. As you're aware, under the ICC rules there is a formal requirement that I close the proceedings, and that's under Article 27 of the rules.  At the time when I indicate that the proceedings are closed, no new argument or evidence, no new submissions can be submitted unless requested by me.  We do, of course, have a date for cost submissions, so I would close the record except for the issue of costs so that we, you know, stick with the September 23rd date that we have for the cost submissions, and then once the cost submissions come in, I would, again, close the proceedings. In terms of a target date for the award, the ICC's expectation is clear that in a case Proceedings where a sole arbitrator is rendering award, the expectation is that a draft be submitted to the ICC for scrutiny within two months of the date of a last hearing or substantive submissions.  So that clock would run from today, even though you will get a letter from me formally closing the proceedings a few days from now.  So just less formally, for the interest and information of the parties, while I would intend to note in that letter that the -- that I would be meeting the two-month deadline, the reality is that I would expect to get that in much sooner.  My intention, since we had agreed on having an expedited transcript, is actually to work on that within the next week, and to finalize once I get in the cost submissions.  I do have some travel overseas, so I think the first week of October, realistically.  I don't have a firm behind me.  I do this by myself, so you're not going to get that date in your formal closing letter, but for your information, I do expect that around the first week of October that I would have an award to the ICC, they'll confirm when they received it, and then usually -- they say that it can be up to three weeks for them to do the scrutiny process, sometimes it's Proceedings less, sometimes it does take, you know, that length of time, but then it's once they get it back to me, about 24 hours for me to turn around any comments that they have and get it back to them.  So I would expect, knock on wood, that you would have a final award by, you know, two months from now.  I think it's likely that have you would have to in hand, I'm not going to but that in blood, but that is my expectation. And let me just doublecheck here for one second to make sure I'm not missing anything else.  Okay.

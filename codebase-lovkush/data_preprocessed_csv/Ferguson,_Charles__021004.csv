55,284,10,9,"I was in the military police, but I was a replacement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,286,10,11,"Now, I understand that you worked at Narragansett Electric for a certain period of your career?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
57,289,10,14,"Yes, many times.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
58,290,10,15,Okay.  When did you first begin working there?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
59,292,10,17,"Well, you start out in the trade as a helper, and I would say helpers are -- they go all over the place or improvers.  I would say sometime around 1947, maybe late '47 but it was 1947.  I was what they call on a permit. I wasn't in the union at the time.  What they do is they give you a permit to work.  And then over a period of time when they need help or whatever or need new members, they accept you into the union.  So I was on permit for probably two years.  And then in 1948, September of 1948 I was accepted into the union, Local 31, Asbestos Heating and Frost Insulators Union, Local 31, Providence, Rhode Island.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,308,11,8,"So while you had the permit for two years, you were working at Narragansett Electric?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
61,311,11,11,"Yes, I worked there quite a bit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
62,312,11,12,"When you say ""quite a bit,"" were you full-time working there?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
63,314,11,14,"Well, when you're in a trade or when you're an insulator and you're what they call an improver or helper, what you do is you work with a mechanic and then you have a helper. Well, what you do is you go and you work with different mechanics on different projects anyplace, you know, anyplace, Narragansett, Montaup, any of the places, but that's what your job is, you're actually a helper. And I worked there on different projects, new units, overhaul and repairs. Actually, what you do is you do a lot of cutting and carrying stock and that's what they call humping work, heavy work, you know. In those days they had the 100-pound bags of asbestos.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
64,331,12,6,"Okay.  And then in September 1948 when you became a member of Local 31, did you begin working -- were you still working at Narragansett?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
65,335,12,10,"When I went into the union, I probably was.  I can't pinpoint all that because I might have been on some other job, but for the first two or three years that I was in the local as a helper, I worked at Narragansett Electric, both South Street and Manchester, whenever they -- I worked wherever they needed extra help.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
66,343,12,18,So when you were on permit basically the union would send you wherever they needed help at a certain time?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
67,346,12,21,"Philip Carey, Armstrong, the different companies would say I need helpers, but the union business agent had control of where the helpers worked.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,351,13,1,All right.,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
69,352,13,2,"And usually when you went to one of these companies you stayed with them during your apprenticeship training and it was a period of four years.  Each year you became first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year improver.  And then if you're qualified, then you become a mechanic and you could work on your own, otherwise, you had to work with somebody.  You could not work alone.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
70,361,13,11,So who was your employer when you worked at Narragansett?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
71,363,13,13,Philip Carey.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
72,364,13,14,And is that for the entire time that you worked at Narragansett?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
73,366,13,16,"Yeah.  I worked with Philip Carey for almost 28 years, give or take a couple years maybe when things were slow.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,369,13,19,Were you ever employed by Narragansett Electric?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
75,371,13,21,"No, not by them individually.  I came out of the union.  Philip Carey used to do a lot of the work for Narragansett Electric, you know, both plants, in other words, the big jobs.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,377,14,2,"Beginning in 19 -- let's see, you said for the first two or three years that you were a member of the union beginning in the end of 1948 you worked at Narragansett.  How often were you working there?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
77,382,14,7,"I was there quite a bit because they put a new unit in, and you know, you change the piping.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,385,14,10,Was your position still a helper?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
79,386,14,11,"Yeah, yeah, you're an improver for four years, so anything from that period on for four years is all as an improver.  You weren't allowed to work by yourself more or less.  In other words, you did all the cutting.  The mechanic would give you the measurements and you'd cut them and pass them up to him.  That's what -- the helper did more than the mechanic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,395,14,20,Did your position ever change during the time that you worked at Narragansett?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
81,397,14,22,"No.  You bounce from job to job, but I spent a lot of time there in my early days in the trade.  And then of course when I became a mechanic, which was down the line, I did still work there as a mechanic when they put new units in or they had an overhaul or a repair, and I worked other places, too, other powerhouses, too.  They had their own prepared gangs, too. Narragansett had a -- their own one pipecoverer.  He did all the small work, but any of the big work they tear it out and we come in and do the job.  And I think I worked on one unit there and there was other unit over -- Manchester had a new unit put in.  But every seven years or six years or three years they tear the turbines, they take it down for insurance reasons, and they have to inspect it. I don't really know how that works, whether it's five years or seven years, but I know we used to have to go in there and do the covering, piping.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,421,15,21,When did you become a mechanic?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
83,422,15,22,"I'd say '53 or '54.  The reason why I say that is because when I got into the union, in other words, I had worked almost two years on permit.  And when you're taken into the union, those two years are supposed to count. In my case the business agent wasn't a very nice person and he made me revert back to a first-year helper because I wasn't in the union. So anyhow I had to go for four years, so actually it was six years -- I'd say close to six years before I received my mechanic's card.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,436,16,11,Do you recall what year was the last year you performed any work at Narragansett?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
85,438,16,13,"Oh, God, that's very difficult.  I've been retired for 20.  And what happened in the period before that, Narragansett used to have maybe some big jobs but not new units and stuff, and what they did was they took some members of their own repair gang or whatever, they had a crew, and what they did, they taught them how to put the covering on, in other words, become pipecoverers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,447,16,22,"Sorry.  My question was:  What year was the last year you worked at Narragansett, if you recall?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
87,451,17,1,I can't remember.  It's too far back.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,452,17,2,Can you recall a decade?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
89,453,17,3,"I retired in '84 but I know I didn't work -- the point I was trying to get at was I couldn't remember when it happened is the fact that they had taken over their own covering. Before that Philip Carey people used to go in and do the work.  That's why I mentioned that, but I couldn't honestly tell you.  15, 20 years before that, I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,461,17,11,Okay.  Did Narragansett have more than one location that you worked at?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
91,463,17,13,"I worked all over the place, all over the plant.  In other words, all areas because that's all it is is piping, piping and equipment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,467,17,17,Do you recall the locations that you worked at?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
93,469,17,19,Pardon?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,470,17,20,Do you recall the Narragansett locations that you worked at?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
95,472,17,22,"I worked in the turbine room, the pumping room.  Pipes go all over the place. There's no specific.  There's aerators, deaerators.  I can't think of some of the equipment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,478,18,3,"I'm sorry, I meant the street location.  Which plant locations?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
97,480,18,5,"Oh, you mean South and Manchester?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,481,18,6,Are those the locations that you worked at?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
99,483,18,8,"Yeah, both locations, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,484,18,9,Did you work at one location more than another?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
101,486,18,11,It was mixed up.  I can't break that down.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,488,18,13,Okay.  Do you remember Mr. Podedworny?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
103,490,18,15,Do I remember what?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,491,18,16,Mr. Podedworny?  Is that name familiar to you?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
105,493,18,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

108,497,18,22,-- how often would you work there over that two-year period roughly?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
109,499,18,24,"I worked there quite a bit, but I can't give you any specific time because sometimes I'd work there and then they'd pull me out and then I'd go back there again. Helpers were in demand.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,505,19,5,Would it be more than half of the year would you say?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
111,507,19,7,I couldn't tell you.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,508,19,8,"Okay.  As a Philip Carey pipecoverer, can you tell me what your duties were?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
113,510,19,10,As a helper?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,511,19,11,Yes.,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer

116,517,19,17,"Was this the same at either location that you would have worked, either South Street or Manchester Street?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
117,520,19,20,Pardon?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,521,19,21,Were your duties as a helper the same at South Street and Manchester?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
119,523,19,23,"Anyplace you worked, that's what you did.  And in some cases if it's small work, they would let you apply, you know, if it's a small building and stuff like that, they'd let you apply the material, but that didn't happen very often.  You always had to work with a mechanic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,531,20,6,Okay.  Do you believe you were exposed to asbestos while you were a helper?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer

135,559,21,9,"There's Philip Carey.  There's all kinds.  We used Philip Carey.  And then if they ran out or were short, they used to use all brands because at that time in the early part -- at that time in those years they were building a lot of powerhouses after the war and there was a lot of powerhouse work, and there was an awful lot of work for eight or ten years putting new units in and everything else, so a lot of times you'd use everybody's product.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,570,21,20,"Well, I'm trying to find out which manufacturers you recall of the pipe insulation product.  You mentioned Philip Carey.  Were there any others that you recall?",q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer

138,580,22,5,Okay.,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer

145,590,22,15,"Well, it came in sections, two halves, and then when you did -- if you had to do tube turns or 45s, elbows in the high-pressure steam lines, you would have to cut to go around the 90 degree or the elbow, you'd have to cut the insulation in pie shapes so that, you know, they'd block in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I know that was one of the names, Pitcher 88, P-I-T-C-H-E-R, and then MW50, that was Carey's, and then they had Manville products, too.

161,631,24,6,Okay.  Was the pipe insulation used on any other type of lines besides steam lines?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
162,634,24,9,"No, this was strictly for -- mag and the other material was all used on steam lines.  Actually, high-pressure steam lines you used to use the material that would withstand the heat and the temperature of the pipe.  And then in a lot of cases you'd block -- you'd have block boiler walls and flat surfaces and you'd use tube turns. You would use a high-temp block on the first layer which might be 2 inches thick or 3 inches thick, and then you'd put a second layer.  So most of them, when you had a high-pressure steam line, you'd have anywhere's from 3 to 5 inches thick. A lot of times it was put on in two layers so that when you put it on -- you'd never have a straight joint.  In other words, you break the joint.  You put the first layer on, the next layer you put on would cover that seam so that no heat is escaping.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,655,25,5,All right.  You also mentioned a block product that you believe contained asbestos?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer

166,663,25,13,They were the same as I said before.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,664,25,14,Okay.  And you said they were used to block the boiler walls?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer
168,666,25,16,"Boiler walls, yes.  That was back then.  Now they have a different method.  You know, you're asking me all the different questions on the material and everything else. I'm doing my best to tell you that I can remember, but back then this material we used, you know, today it's all changed completely. A lot of people -- some of you people around in this room here never heard of some of this stuff before, but it was all different and unfortunately or thankfully we found out at the time when I first worked with it. We didn't know how bad this stuff was, what it did to your lungs or anything else until Dr. Selikoff discovered how bad it was, so I might be confusing to you.  I don't know.  But I'm doing the best I can.  I have a pretty good memory but I could miss a few things.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,686,26,11,Okay.  Then you also mentioned a cement product?,q,MS. ZIVKOVIC,start_answer

204,790,30,15,"South Street, I don't think South Street had any boilers.  The steam was piped from Manchester to South Street.  I think they had three units at South Street, I'm not sure. And they had -- what else did they have?

224,854,33,4,"I didn't work solely there.  I just can't remember.  In this trade here, you have to understand that one day you can be working here and they can call you up and say they need some help on another job.  You might only be on that job for two days.  If I had kept a log, I would be able to tell you, but I never kept a log. And there's a lot of cases that -- I mean, right now I'm trying to go back since I talked to Vin, the places I worked, but I can't remember because we had so many different jobs.  Like I said, if they had a fire to put out, they were doing a job someplace, they'd call you up.  So I really can't pinpoint it for you.  It would be impossible.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I mean, you know, it's -- I probably could have -- they might have some of these small jobs to do where it's a two- or three-day job or something, they would send you out to do those.  You didn't strictly do powerhouses.  That was the trick to working in the powerhouses where a good mechanic -- where your skills came, you know, the trade showed up.  The others were small little buildings, small boilers and piping and stuff like that which could be mag -- not small tiny buildings, so you'd go there for three days and then you'd come out, and they'd send you back to Narragansett. You always went back to the job you had before.  If you finished the job up and you had no place to go, you'd go back to the job that you were on.  I mean, it's kind of -- you only had 80 members in the local, in the union, so they had to try to keep up with the other jobs.

I worked there a lot, teardowns, because at Montaup they used -- when you tore a turbine down for overhaul and repair, they had blankets, they had three layers of blankets that you put on.  You tied them on with stainless steel wire. Whereas, in Narragansett they used to spray the bottom of it and then you covered the insulation, the piping from it or the steam to it, but I worked at Montaup quite a bit on two or three units down there.

238,933,36,8,"That's the only way I can explain it to you is the shape of it.  Whatever curves, you would have to make a blanket with that shape so it would fit up -- it's very tight. You had about this much space where it comes to the turbine on the top and then all the steam and all the piping going to it coming in the bottom.  And that vessel or that part of the turbine, they claim that the steel was like 2 or 3 inches thick. And I have seen it with my own eyes when they have an overhaul or repair, you would have to go in and take the blankets off. Well, you could only work for ten minutes. And then the closer you got to the turbine, the bottom of it, you could see red hot, so anyhow, I happened to work on them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

They had blankets at one time, but I don't remember taking any blankets off there but they were the only ones that I know of that used the spray and they had a contract with Armstrong Cork.  I don't know what the business name was, but they used Armstrong Cork material. And they had a machine that sprayed this wet insulation on it.

Sometimes the boxes would come and there would be only one section in it.  It would be maybe 10-inch pipe so you'd only have two halves.

370,1319,51,19,"Yes, more or less.  Some of the material -- whatever -- in other words, high-pressure steam line.  In fact, some of the products that you use are simply just -- you know, they're not for ordinary steam or low-pressure steam, you wouldn't use some of this stuff. But a covering that we used to use that was suited for high-pressure steam was Kaylo.  That had more -- I guess it had more asbestos but it was so heavy.  It was very heavy and it was terrible stuff to cut. Nobody liked working with it, but I know they used that a lot on the turbines because it could withstand high pressure, you know, high temperatures is the word.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

406,1429,56,4,"I don't know.  I can't measure that but I do know that -- I thought maybe today maybe Mr. Roberts, the lawyer, the governor's nephew or something like that, he did a great job of leading the deposition.  But anyhow, they had asked me a question about Robert Beauregard, and in fact, this was his case and I had worked with Bob and Bob was a meticulous guy and he kept a record of every single job he was on.  We were all amazed but that was the type of personality Bob was.  He was an awful nice guy also.  And the poor guy on top of it all, he retired and he never collected his first check.  He died of asbestosis. But anyway, getting back to the story.  They asked me if I had ever worked near where Bob lived.  He lived on Tiffany Street in North Attleboro.  And they said are you sure you never worked at a place with him in Attleboro?  And I said no.  I said for the love of me I can't figure it out. So anyhow, don't you think about six months later, you know how something comes up like Vin called me about the Kaylo and stuff, and I said now I know, I did work with him. He and I worked at a bank there.  It was like a two-day job, ductwork and stuff like that, and I remembered it but it was too late, of course. And then I also remembered that at that time he was putting an addition onto his own house for his mother.  He made a little apartment for her, so on our lunch hour we went over and he showed me what he was doing so this is how sometimes things happen.  You ask me these questions today, right.

They had to keep the place so that dust didn't get into the machinery and stuff, but you know the sad part of it is that all that stuff, we didn't know anything about it. When I worked at -- they used to laugh at me, especially when I was a helper. The first day on the job, you know, I was down -- the first day I worked, I was down at Montaup Electric in Somerset, and I mentioned the name Betel Carlson, he was like a fourth-year helper.  So we had the job of mixing the cement in the tub, you know, the asbestos. So anyhow, I think it was the second day there.  He said get that wheelbarrow over there and fill it with water and he said mix a bag of asbestos.  So anyhow, I get the bag and I fill the wheelbarrow with water and I go over and I pick -- they were 100-pound sacks in those days, burlap, and then when you touch them a cloud of dust comes up.  So anyhow, I take the bag and I pick it up like this and it went plop. I've got asbestos all over me, in my eyes, all over my face.  He had to take me to the Trusdale Hospital in Fall River and I had to clean all my eyes out because they were loaded with asbestos.

And when we'd mix that mud, we called it mud, you could see all these little -- looked like little snakes dancing in the rays, and they were so thick that you couldn't see through them.

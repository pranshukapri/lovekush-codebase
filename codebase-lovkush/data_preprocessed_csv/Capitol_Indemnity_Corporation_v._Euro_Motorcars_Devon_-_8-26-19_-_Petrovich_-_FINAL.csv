1,119,4,7,"Good morning, Paul.  Again, my name is Joseph Blum.  I represent Mercedes Benz in a case that's been brought by Capitol Indemnity. I'm just going to ask you a series of questions this morning.  If at any time you don't understand my question, please tell me and I'll be happy to restate it. Also, we're doing this via video connection, so there is going to be some lag time at points where -- between when we speak. So I'm going to ask you to try to take your time and let me finish speaking before you respond.  Do you understand that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
2,132,4,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3,133,4,21,"All right.  And we do have to have you keep all your responses verbal, because the court reporter cannot take down nods of our heads or shrugs of our shoulders. Do you understand that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
4,139,5,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,140,5,2,Is there anything that would prevent from you testifying accurately this morning?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
6,142,5,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,143,5,5,Okay.  By whom are you employed?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
8,144,5,6,"Capitol Specialty Corporation, also known as Capitol Indemnity Corporation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,146,5,8,And how long have you been employed there?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
10,147,5,9,Seventeen years.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,148,5,10,And could you just briefly tell us the history of your employment there at Capitol?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
12,150,5,12,At Capitol?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,151,5,13,Yes.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
14,152,5,14,"I was hired as a property examiner, specifically for background in arson, which I had done previously in Chicago.  And then there was some curtailing of business, so I went and handled some other lines of business for about three or four years, liability, auto, because of my background on that, too, but then came back to property.  So essentially, out of 17 years I was probably doing property for 13 years out of the 17.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,162,5,24,"And over the last five years, what have you been doing?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
16,165,6,1,Property.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,166,6,2,Okay.  And is that --,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
18,167,6,3,Commercial property.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,168,6,4,"I'm sorry, say that again.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
20,169,6,5,Commercial property.  We don't do any personal lines.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,171,6,7,"Oh, okay. And are you typically on a day-to-day basis adjusting losses for business property?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
22,175,6,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,176,6,12,"Okay.  And before you came to Capitol, can you tell me just briefly what your employment history had been?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
24,179,6,15,"Immediately before coming to Capitol I spent a year and a half working for L.J. Shaw & Company in Lombard, Illinois, as an independent adjustor handling, again, commercial -- primarily commercial property but some residential as well there. Prior to that I worked -- I had my own construction company for four years, from '97 to 2001, servicing the insurance industry doing insurance repairs. Prior to that, from '87 to '97 I was with American States Insurance primarily handling commercial property claims but some homeowner's or residential, but 90 percent of the business was commercial. Immediately before that, from '81 to '87 I was with the Illinois Fair Plan Association, which almost exclusively handled residential property claims. And then prior to that, from '76 to '81 I worked for Economy Fire & Casualty basically doing a hodgepodge of residential property, auto, and even some bodily injury claims, minor ones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,204,7,14,And that was your first employment?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
26,205,7,15,Yes.  In the insurance business.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,206,7,16,All right.  Okay.  And tell me what your educational background is.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
28,208,7,18,I have a B.S. degree in business management from Northern Illinois University.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,210,7,20,And when did you obtain that degree?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
30,211,7,21,Let's see.  That would have been 1974.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,212,7,22,"And since you obtained your degree, have you obtained any other certificates or degrees or anything like that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
32,215,7,25,"Not specific degrees.  I've taken classes and courses, but not essentially -- not like a CPCU or anything like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,219,8,3,"Okay.  What, if anything, did you do to prepare for your deposition today other than speaking to Gus?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
34,222,8,6,"Looked up some of the information on the payments, because Gus had indicated you might be interested in knowing how those payments came to be.  And since it's been a significant period of time since I've worked on the file, I'm trying to refresh my memory here; it's not what it once was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,229,8,13,And the file that you're speaking about is your insured was a company called S-Bond; is that correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
36,232,8,16,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,233,8,17,"And this fire occurred in Lansdale, Pennsylvania. Have you ever personally visited the site?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
38,237,8,21,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,238,8,22,In the stack of documents that should be there with you there are I want to say the seventh document which is called the Plaintiff Capitol Indemnity Corporation's Responses to Defendant Mercedes Benz First Interrogatories. Can you see if you can locate that document for me?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
40,246,9,4,What was the name of that document again?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,247,9,5,"Sure.  It has the caption of the case on it, and it's entitled Plaintiff Capitol Indemnity Corporation's Responses to Defendant Mercedes Benz First Interrogatories.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
42,251,9,9,In front of me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,252,9,10,All right.  Have you ever seen this document before?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
44,254,9,12,Not that I recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,255,9,13,"All right.  I'm going to direct your attention, if we could, to the answer to Interrogatory No. 60, which appears -- the question is on page 14, and the answer is on page 15.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
46,259,9,17,Question 60 did you say?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,260,9,18,Yes.  That is correct.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
48,261,9,19,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,262,9,20,All right.  And that question is asking for a detailed itemization of the elements of damage that Capitol is claiming. Do you see that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
50,266,9,24,"Um-hmm, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,267,9,25,"And the answer that's provided here in the interrogatories is $248,843.17. Do you see that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
52,271,10,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,272,10,4,Is that an accurate statement as to what you're claiming?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
54,274,10,6,"Yes.  The only caveat to that is that includes the insured's $1,000 deductible.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,276,10,8,"Okay.  And can you tell me, are there -- there should be like groups or categories of damages that make up that 248,000.  What are the different groups?  Like property damage, business interruption?  Can you tell me what the categories are?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
56,282,10,14,"Well, the basic categories are business personal property and then business income and extra expense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,285,10,17,"Okay.  Can you tell me the business personal property, what is the amount of the claim that is being made by Capitol?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
58,288,10,20,"I believe it is 117,389.17.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,289,10,21,"And does that include the $1,000 deductible?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
60,290,10,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,291,10,23,"Okay.  So really your number before the deductible is 116,389.17?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
62,293,10,25,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,295,11,1,All right.  Can you tell me how Capitol went about determining that number?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
64,297,11,3,"Well, we hired an independent adjustor to meet with the insured.  The insured's business is fairly complicated, because I think they do some work for the government.  And I believe it has to do with satellites, but I'm not 100 percent sure on all of that.  But they've got a system where they were using what I would refer to as top-end electronic equipment for either calculating and/or effecting the actual work that they're doing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,307,11,13,And who is the independent adjustor that Capitol retained?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
66,309,11,15,I believe that was James Farr or Jamie Farr.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,310,11,16,And did you personally know Mr. Farr before this loss?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
68,312,11,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,313,11,19,Okay.  How did you come to hire him?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
70,314,11,20,"I've worked with Johns Eastern Company previously, and he was in the locale where the loss occurred, so I hired Johns Eastern.  They assigned Mr. Farr.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,318,11,24,What is your understanding of the business of Johns Eastern Company?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
72,321,12,1,They're an independent adjusting company.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,322,12,2,All right.  And was Mr. Farr authorized to act as your agent to adjust the loss?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
74,324,12,4,"For the adjustment purpose of the loss, yes, to talk to the insured.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,326,12,6,"Okay.  Correct. And that number that you gave us, the $116,000 number, does that represent a replacement cost for the insured or actual cash value?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
76,331,12,11,"I believe that would be replacement cost.  A lot of the items that were involved were, in fact, cleaned, because the insured was desperate to relocate to another location.  So they were trying everything in their power to clean items that they could use, but due to the nature of being electronic equipment, some of them were not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,339,12,19,"Okay.  I'm sorry, you lost me there a little bit. So in the 117,000 -- 116,000, does that include the effort to clean, or is that just the amount that was paid for replacement?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
78,344,12,24,"That is cleaning and also what I would refer to as pack-out.  Because obviously if they're going to take items from location one, wherever they were located at, Lansdale, and then move it to another property, they were going to clean the property before they moved into the other location. So you're paying for the cleaning of the equipment and then loading it into a truck, taking it over to the new location, as well as some items that could not be cleaned, had to be replaced.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,357,13,11,Okay.  And did you receive from Johns Eastern a breakdown of all of those costs?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
80,359,13,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,360,13,14,Okay.  And in what form did you receive that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
82,361,13,15,Usually it's in a summary of either damages that were allowed for replacement or cleaning invoices from specific companies that were hired and for moving the equipment as well.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,365,13,19,"All right.  And before you came to your deposition today, did you review the file that you had on this matter?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
84,368,13,22,Briefly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,369,13,23,Okay.  Did you see that summary of damages in your file?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
86,371,13,25,A specific one for each category?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,373,14,1,"Well, at any time.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
88,374,14,2,"Okay.  Yes, I saw inventories that were prepared by the insured that Mr. Farr reviewed and then analyzed and then sent a recommendation to our office saying I've looked at this and this is a recommendation for payment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,380,14,8,And did you follow the recommendations of Mr. Farr?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
90,382,14,10,For the most part since he was on site.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,383,14,11,"Well, do we know were there some which were rejected?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
92,385,14,13,I can't tell you off the top of my head for things that were done like three years ago.  I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.  I'm sure it might be something that was questioned.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,389,14,17,"All right.  And the copies of the invoices for the stuff that was cleaned and shipped, do you see those in your file?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
94,392,14,20,"There were invoices in there, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,393,14,21,"Okay.  And do you know of the items that were replaced, did you or anyone acting on your behalf determine what the actual cash value was of those items that were replaced?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
96,397,14,25,"Again, without looking at the documents, I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.  I believe a lot of them were replaced immediately because the insured, like I say, wanted to get back into business.  So if he needed a machine or a piece of equipment that we agreed was damaged, he would purchase it and then have it delivered to the new location where he was setting up his business.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,407,15,9,"And to the best of your knowledge, you have not seen any determination of the actual cash value of the equipment that was replaced?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
98,410,15,12,"I can't say that there was no determination on that, because I -- again, I'm not looking at each and every specific, you know, report and inventory.  There may have been.  I just can't say that I know what exactly that ACV or actual cash value figure is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,416,15,18,"And other than yourself, is there anyone at Capitol who would have known that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
100,418,15,20,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,419,15,21,"Okay.  And other than in your file for this matter, is there anyplace else where that documentation would have existed?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
102,422,15,24,Probably Mr. Farr's file.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,423,15,25,Okay.  And was Mr. Farr authorized to act on your -- on Capitol's behalf to make a determination of the actual cash value of the replacement for the equipment?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
104,428,16,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,429,16,5,And did you discuss your deposition with Mr. Farr before you came here today?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
106,431,16,7,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,432,16,8,Okay.  Did you discuss your deposition with anyone else?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
108,434,16,10,Mr. Sara --,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
109,435,16,11,Other than me.,side_chat,MR. SARA,start_question
110,437,16,13,Other than your counsel.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
111,438,16,14,Advised my immediate boss that I was going to be required to come for a deposition and mentioned it to Brad Temple who is the current supervisor of the file.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,442,16,18,"Okay.  Now, you had also mentioned that there was a claim for business income; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
113,445,16,21,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,446,16,22,"All right.  And is that separate from the extra expense, or were they together?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
115,448,16,24,"That's together, because the coverage is called business income and extra expense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,451,17,1,"And do you know what is the total amount that was paid by Capitol on that coverage, business income and extra expense?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
117,454,17,4,"Let's see.  I was printing some things out before I left, but the computer was not cooperative in terms of printing information. It's $131,000.  I just can't give you the specifics on it here, because it's, like I said, in the computer.  Somebody more computer savvy than I need to look at that to print it out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,462,17,12,"Does that include additional rent, that number?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
119,463,17,13,Yes.  That's part of the extra expense.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,464,17,14,"Okay.  Give me one second. I'm sorry, did you say 131,454?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
121,466,17,16,The 454 I didn't know off the top of my head. I knew the 131.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,468,17,18,Okay.  And are there any other damages that were paid other than the 117 and the 131 that we just talked about?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
123,471,17,21,"Just adjustment expenses, which is not included in any of this.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,473,17,23,"Okay.  Then as far as I can tell, my number does not add up to -- somewhere we're missing something in terms of the 248 total that you gave us.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
125,478,18,2,Okay.  What numbers are you adding?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,479,18,3,I'm just adding the 117 and the 131.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
127,480,18,4,And then did you -- that comes to 248 to me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
128,481,18,5,Okay.  I guess what I'm missing is the deductible.  That's where I was off.  Okay. Great. And so there are no other additional damages that were paid?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
129,486,18,10,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
130,487,18,11,"Okay.  The business income and extra expense, can you tell me how that was determined?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
131,489,18,13,I hired a forensic CPA firm called Insight Forensic Accountants.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
132,491,18,15,And did Insight Forensic Accountants provide you with a final report which listed everything that was paid?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
133,494,18,18,"I don't know about a final report.  They were giving me information leading up to it, because the primary extra expenses occurred in the first two or three months to pack out and move the business to the other location. If memory serves me correct, our insured wanted to move back to the building in Lansdale but was prohibited from doing so by the landlord, I'm not sure by what, if they rebuilt or didn't, but I believe he stayed in the building that he was at after the fire.  So there wasn't a pack-in back at the location for that reason.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
134,508,19,6,And were there a series of interim reports that you received to document the business income and extra expense?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
135,511,19,9,"I received some interim reports, but after a time the only thing that was being paid was the additional rents that were being incurred by the insured for having to rent this other location at a higher amount than they previously had been paid.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,517,19,15,"If you could take a look at the documents that are in front of you there, I believe you'll find that there are a number of reports there from CapSpecialty.  If you could just pull any one of them out, that would be fine.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
137,522,19,20,Reports to CapSpecialty?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,523,19,21,From CapSpecialty.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
139,524,19,22,Okay.  Reports from CapSpecialty to whom?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,525,19,23,Like to S-Bond Technologies.  I used the wrong term.  Correspondence.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
141,527,19,25,Okay.  I've come across one dated December 28th to S-Bond from myself.  Is that what you're referring to?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,531,20,3,"Yeah, that's a good example.  So every time -- my question is, every time that you sent a check or a payment to S-Bond Technologies, did you do so via correspondence like this?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
143,535,20,7,Ordinarily I would try to do so on every payment to document my file on what I'm paying and why I'm paying it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
144,538,20,10,"Okay.  And if we went through your file, would we find similar correspondence for each of the payments that were made to S-Bond by Capitol?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
145,541,20,13,"I would believe so, yes, similarly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
146,542,20,14,Okay.  And did you in the end receive a final sworn statement and proof of loss from the insured for all of the property damage claims that they made?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
147,546,20,18,"I can say that we got the property -- the proof of loss for the business personal property. In the short time I was looking at it before coming here, I didn't notice that we had a proof of loss for the entire business income claim, but I haven't gone through the whole -- we have electronic files only, so there's no paper, and that consists of 1700 pages of things, so I'm looking through a computer screen to see if I can locate this. So I can't say that definitely we have one or that we don't have one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
148,559,21,5,"Okay.  And if we asked you to look in your file for reports that came from Insight Forensic Accountants, where would you look in that file?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
149,562,21,8,In my file it would be under damages.  And they were producing reports --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
150,564,21,10,Okay.  And would those reports from Insight all be together?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
151,566,21,12,"They would be in the damage category in the computer file, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
152,568,21,14,All right.  And did each of those reports -- were they like a multiple-page report where he would have a schedule -- the accountant had a schedule attached?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
153,572,21,18,"Yes, but some of them became repetitious after the first six months, because the only thing that the insured was actually out-of-pocket was the difference in his rental income.  So we weren't reproducing that each and every time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
154,577,21,23,Okay.  Were you ever at any point involved in any inspections that had to do with the investigation of this loss?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
155,581,22,1,Me personally?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
156,582,22,2,Yes.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
157,583,22,3,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
158,584,22,4,And did you ever have any meetings or discussions directly with the insured?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
159,586,22,6,"I spoke to the insured on multiple occasions, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
160,588,22,8,Okay.  And were those conversations about the amount of the claim?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
161,590,22,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
162,591,22,11,Okay.  And were there ever any discussions with him about the cause of the fire?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
163,593,22,13,"Yes, we discussed it early on in the claim, but he, frankly, didn't know a lot about it, because the actual fire started in the next-door location, so it was only hearsay and information that he got from third parties.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
164,598,22,18,"And what, if anything, did he tell you about the cause of the fire?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
165,600,22,20,"That it started in the uniform -- I think it was a uniform or a rental -- a laundry place. There was some discussion that it may have started in or near a vehicle that was housed in the building.  Other than that, that's as specific as we ever got.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
166,607,23,1,Okay.  And have you ever had any discussions with Mercedes Benz or any representative of Mercedes Benz about this loss?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
167,610,23,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
168,611,23,5,And have you attended any other meetings or any meetings with any of the other insurance companies involved in claims for this loss?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
169,614,23,8,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
170,615,23,9,"And other than what we've talked about today, did you have any other involvement in the adjustment of this claim?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
171,618,23,12,"I did hire the cause and origin company initially after the fire loss to see if we could determine what the cause of the fire was. About as specific as it ever got was that it was in the building next door, they did believe it came from a vehicle, but they would require additional testing and, you know, inspections. And that, quite frankly, didn't take place within the time frame I was handling -- or supervising the file.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
172,628,23,22,Okay.  And what was the name of that company?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
173,629,23,23,"To be honest, I can't even tell you.  I don't recall the name.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
174,631,23,25,And I take it from your testimony that at some point the handling of this file was transferred from your supervision to some other person; is that correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
175,636,24,4,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
176,637,24,5,And when did that happen?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
177,638,24,6,"After determination of the claim payments, which would have been sometime in 2017. Because the fire happened in June of 2016, the insured has coverage for 12 consecutive months' worth of business income and extra expense, so that would have terminated in June of 2017.  So I would assume that this file was transferred in July or August of 2017.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

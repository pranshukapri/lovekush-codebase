I can go support my client, listen to them play music, and we can visit at the same time."" He said, ""Fine."" I picked him up.  I picked Michael Franklin up in my vehicle, and he said that his cousin was going to meet us down there; so we pulled up to the Czar Bar, and I remember a gentleman of, I believe, indigenous African descent whom I thought to this point was his cousin, showed up.

183,475,18,2,"But I guess -- because all this ends up being something that people want to hear -- what happened to cause the gentleman to go to the ground is based upon you assume happened, not based upon your examining the chair to see if it actually collapsed or not; is that true?",q,MR.

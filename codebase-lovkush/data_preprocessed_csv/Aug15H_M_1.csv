It ended up being like two properties involved, and he wanted to see where I think -- this is a few years ago -- where they actually built it on the wrong lot, from what I understand.  He wanted to see -- he wanted -- could I see who owned that and the title there. So I did some poking around.  It was virtually impossible to figure out.  It was like the land time forgot.  It was really different.  And they hired a bigger firm that does -- specializes in that, so...  I don't have anything.  I just told him -- I said, ""I looked around.  It was back in the 1700s.""  And it was just a big disaster, so I said, ""I can't do it, that's not really my specialty."" They hired a big firm that did it.  I know the people that did it, so...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

There was a tax taking that I got a photo of.  Then there was a Mass. tax lien that was released; so that's what my terrible handwriting -- I don't know if you can read it.

There was -- well, it was coming out of tax taking -- out of the city pursuant of them taking it for taxes, so the tax takings wouldn't have been -- they wouldn't have been outstanding.

In my business, if I have a plan, that's -- if there's no plan, you might get an assessors or an atlas, but the assessors aren't really -- they're not so much to look at, that I would look at.

I guess that's what happened. So we tried to determine who actually owned it, and it was a little beyond my scope of things I do.  I can't get bogged down with something that's going to take three or four weeks.  I just -- we do houses and refi's and, you know, pop them out, do small commercial stuff. So they retained another firm to do the research who -- I know who did that, and I spoke to him, and it took them quite a while from my understanding.  There was a big report.

And it was very -- the scope of it was something I don't do.  You know what I'm saying?  So they hired -- so I know Bruce hired a firm that kind of does this stuff.

520,1531,59,5,"Sure.  So somebody buys a house, they go to the bank, they get a mortgage.  The bank or the mortgage company would assign an attorney to represent them at closing for them to purchase the house, so a title search would be done.  It's usually through the lawyer.  Some lawyers do their own, most of them don't.  They would hire a firm like myself to do a 50-year search with a good start date, going forward.

He may have been in a hurry or, you know.  We have a different -- you know, I've just known him for so long, he'd say, ""Dave, hey, can you do a title?  Eagles, Dexter, they bought around 1970.""  I said, ""Sure.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

536,1591,61,15,"Yeah, he -- I think he got it from Natale. In fact, he said, ""Natale's buying the Eagles.  He wants to put some condos on the property, this Royal Order of the Eagles,"" or whatever -- I think I'm saying it wrong -- ""owns it.  Can you do a title on it?""  It was pretty -- you know, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I know there's some projects, some big developments, you know, that we do titles for, and they take a while to get going, but, you know, I don't -- that would just be a kind of opinion on my side.  It's not really on my -- purchase and sales, I don't see purchase and sales, or they really have nothing to do with me.  You know?  Every now and then, somebody will send me a purchase and sale just for a reference, but most of the time it's a form.  So I wouldn't be aware of when the property's selling or not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
539,1613,62,12,"Okay.  So what was conveyed to you in June/July of '09 was, ""Natale is interested, my client is interested in purchasing this piece of property to develop""?",q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
540,1617,62,16,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

545,1625,62,24,"Can you elaborate on that, please?",q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
546,1627,63,1,"Sure.  So typically on a sale, we typically do a 50-year search.  So this was 1970, so it was kind of close to 50.  I said to Bruce -- I said, ""Do you want me to go back and do -- this is a big tax taking.  They're all little lots.  So you have to go find the owner of the lot.  They got taken by taxes, and it goes through a whole series of stuff.""  And this was multiple.  It was just -- it would have been just a lot more work, a lot more expense.

I don't think it's written in stone, but it's -- originally, 50 years was -- from my understanding, was -- a mortgage could be 50 years, but they're really only 30, so that was kind of the idea of people doing 50-year searches.  So like I do 50- -- if I get a sale, I always do a 50-year search unless it's something like this where there's a big mess behind it.  I think I ended up doing the work anyways after the whole thing kind of...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

560,1674,64,23,"Well, the tax taking was complicated.  The description of lots on there was not complicated. Sometimes -- especially out by 495, you do titles that are like old farms, you know, Farmer Joe buys parcels here and there.  Then it becomes a big -- it becomes a very large title.  That's what I consider a title that's, you know, complicated and could be messy. This was just a perfunctory tax taking, going through the process, finding which lots, who owned it.  They took it, the town would take the property through tax taking, put a petition to foreclose.  Then they either withdraw it or they put a decree on barring rights forever, for redemption; in other words, your tax-taking person can come back and redeem those taxes -- they pay the taxes, they get the land back. So -- but towns particularly put a petition on saying, ""We're going to forever foreclose on you,"" so the people are out.  So that's -- so it gets a lot of, you know.  And this one was kind of pieced together, because it was two and three lots together, and not everybody was the same owner that they took it from. So it was just -- it would have been a lot more work, a lot more expense.  ""Did you want me to do that?""  He said, ""No, we're good from here."" That's what -- I don't know.  Do you know what I mean?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

830,2241,87,15,"When you spoke to Mr. Miller in 2009, before you did the title search, do you know whether his understanding of the property being owned by the Eagles came from his own research or was that information provided to him by Natale?",q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
831,2246,87,20,I got the impression it was from Natale.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
832,2247,87,21,Do you know how Natale came to understand --,q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
833,2249,87,23,I wouldn't have any idea.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
834,2250,87,24,"The report that you did, title report that you did produce for 2009, where did you find that in your records?",q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
835,2254,88,3,"That was on my emails.  I have a file that has all my titles that I've scanned over the years, so I probably have 35,000 titles, and I put it in by the town and by the street name.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
836,2258,88,7,Okay.,q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
837,2259,88,8,"So I went to ""Woburn,"" ""Dexter,"" and there it was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
838,2261,88,10,"Okay.  But you didn't search your emails for ""Bruce Miller,"" for ""Dexter Avenue,"" for ""Natale""?",q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer

848,2278,89,2,-- what -- so how did she end up doing that work that's represented in Exhibits 3 and 4?,q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
849,2280,89,4,"I would imagine that Bruce probably contacted me and said, ""Can you run these up?""  And I said -- and I would have wrote it down maybe on a piece of paper and handed it to her and said, ""Can you run these up?  These are run-ups or rundowns for the policy.""  That was kind of what she did, a lot of run-ups and rundowns, shorter versions of title searches.  That's kind of what -- they're easy to do online.  You want to do the full titles in the Registry, there's more resources.  So that was kind of her role at the time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
850,2291,89,15,"Do you know why he was asking you to do that in, I believe it was the 2013 and '14 time frame, in those two exhibits?",q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer

852,2295,89,19,Would you have sent him anything in response to what was done in Exhibits 3 and 4?,q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
853,2297,89,21,"No.  What she usually does if she does those, she just ends up faxing them from the office. We have a small office in Easton.  So she would have just shot him a fax because I -- I mean, I would have -- if I sent him those, it would have been on my -- in the Middlesex folder as far as that, and I would have, you know, checked and sent them along.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
854,2305,90,4,Do you keep a hard copy of faxes that you send along?,q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
855,2307,90,6,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
856,2308,90,7,"When Mr. Miller contacted you in 2009 or really at any point in time from 2009 forward, did you ever speak to anybody else other than Mr. Miller about either piece of property that was at issue on Dexter Avenue?",q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer

860,2317,90,16,Anybody else that you haven't mentioned yet?,q,MS. CLOUTIER,start_answer
861,2319,90,18,"No, no.  Nobody -- no title examiner would find this interesting.  You know what I mean?  It's all kind of boring.  So I just -- the guy, the kid that did -- was doing it for the mortgage company, and then the people Bruce hired from Marsh Moriarty, I spoke to that person a little bit about it because I was more -- I was interested in what was going on, what was the outcome and did they find anything.  I was more, you know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

882,2367,92,16,"I don't know, probably -- I think there's a rundown we did, maybe.  I'm not sure.  Years later, after everything kind of went, you know, to hell there, you know, got blown up, blew up, or whatever.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
883,2371,92,20,So in your initial title search you were not told at all --,q,MR. BENEVIDES,start_answer
884,2373,92,22,"I was not given a street number, but Bruce is casual.  That's how he does things.  I mean, ""Dexter Street,"" ""Eagles,"" that was it.  I said, ""Okay.""  Well, there we go.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

886,2380,93,4,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
887,2381,93,5,Why didn't you ask for one?,q,MR. BENEVIDES,start_answer
888,2382,93,6,"I didn't think I needed one.  If I found two or three different properties, deeds that they owned, then I would have said, ""Hey, what's going on here?  What do they own?  What's the address?""  But where I just found the one deed, I didn't -- it was on Dexter Street, so it was, okay, here we go.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
889,2388,93,12,"You don't have any written correspondence that you sent out that's not through email, correct?",q,MR. BENEVIDES,start_answer

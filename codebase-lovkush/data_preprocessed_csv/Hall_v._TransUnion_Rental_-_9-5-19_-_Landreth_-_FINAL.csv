2,154,5,16,Good morning.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3,155,5,17,"My name is Joe Hashmall.  I represent the plaintiff in this matter.  And I'd like to start just by talking a little bit about -- kind of the ground rules of this deposition, and -- and then we can get into some of the -- the substance. Have you ever had your deposition taken before?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
4,162,5,24,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,163,5,25,"Okay.  So a few basic things.  Of course, you know there is a court reporter here.  So -- and she's taking everything down in the form of a transcript.  So it's important to give verbal answers to questions that can be taken down in a transcript.  You know, a nod doesn't really -- doesn't really show up on the transcripts. And it's also important that we all try not to talk over each other so we can get an accurate record.  So I will certainly try and let you finish your answers; if you will try and let me finish my questions. Does that sound okay?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
6,177,6,13,Yep.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,178,6,14,Great.  And is there any reason that you can't give full and complete and truthful testimony today?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
8,181,6,17,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,182,6,18,Okay.  You should have in front of you a tablet -- you don't need to look at it right now -- that we're going to use to display exhibits for you. Do you see that?  I can't see exactly what you can see.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
10,187,6,23,Yes.  I have it in front of me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,188,6,24,"Okay.  Great. And if -- you know, if we have any trouble on that going forward, you know, we can take our time and work with it. And if -- if at any time you need to take a break, just -- just let me know.  I just ask, you know, that if I have asked a question, that you answer that question before we take a break. Does that sound good?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
12,198,7,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,199,7,9,Great. So can you tell me your current employer and job title?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
14,202,7,12,"My current employer is TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, and my current job title is product manager.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,205,7,15,And how long have you worked for -- is it okay if I call it TURSS?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
16,207,7,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,208,7,18,How long have you worked for TURSS?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
18,209,7,19,Just over eight years.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,210,7,20,And have you always been a product manager or have you moved through various job titles?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
20,212,7,22,I have moved through various job titles.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,213,7,23,Okay.  Can you give me a quick summary of your job titles over the years you've been with TURSS.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
22,215,7,25,"Sure.  I started out as a criminal data processor and then moved over to the account specialist team as an account specialist.  That was rebranded as a relationship manager team, so I was a relationship manager for a while.  And then I was a team lead of the relationship manager team --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,222,8,6,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
24,223,8,7,-- one of the relationship manager teams. And now I am a product manager.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,225,8,9,Okay.  And what are your responsibilities as a product manager?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
26,227,8,11,"I have responsibility for the criminal and eviction databases that TURSS has, as well as responsibility for the matching logic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,230,8,14,Just to backtrack a little bit.  In your initial job with TURSS -- and I can't read my own handwriting -- as a criminal data processor; is that right?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
28,234,8,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,235,8,19,Can you tell me a little bit about what that entails.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
30,237,8,21,"Sure.  So one of TURSS's products has a criminal recommendation service.  And so what I did was I reviewed criminal records that returned on a given applicant, and I reviewed those against policies that were dictated by a TURSS customer to see it -- whether those criminal records matched their policies in determining whether they were going to accept or decline that applicant based on their previous criminal history.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,247,9,5,Sure.  Would it be fair to call that adjudication? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague. Go ahead and answer if you can.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
32,251,9,9,"I don't know the definition of that word, I guess.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,253,9,11,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  And in your role as an accounts specialist and relationship manager and a team lead in that role, were you mostly working with -- with -- through these clients with landlords and employers?  Is that accurate?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
34,258,9,16,I primarily worked with the resellers of TURSS data.  I worked for the background data solutions product.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,261,9,19,I see. And what were your responsibilities in that role?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
36,264,9,22,"So initially, as an accounts specialist and relationship manager was to manage the relationships that TURSS has with those resellers to make sure, you know, customer satisfaction and all that good stuff. And then as a team lead, I managed more of the key accounts as well as the other relationship managers that were on the team.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,272,10,4,I see. And can you tell me a little bit about your educational background.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
38,275,10,7,Yes.  I have a bachelor of arts in psychology from the University of Texas in San Antonio.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,277,10,9,And when -- what year did you graduate?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
40,278,10,10,That was 2011.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,279,10,11,"So if I'm doing my math right, has working for TURSS been your career post graduation?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
42,281,10,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,282,10,14,Got it. And I was cruising your LinkedIn page.  Are you also pursuing an additional degree?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
44,285,10,17,I am.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,286,10,18,Can you tell me about that.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
46,287,10,19,Yeah.  I'm a JD candidate at the Denver University Sturm College of Law.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,289,10,21,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
48,290,10,22,The projected graduation date of 2022.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,291,10,23,"And you're, essentially, going at night.  Is that fair?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
50,293,10,25,It's a weekend program.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,295,11,1,"Cool. Just because you have that -- or you know, you're obtaining that legal training, do you have any responsibilities for legal compliance or FCRA compliance in your current role?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
52,300,11,6,Can you -- can you be more specific on that? I'm not working in a -- in a -- like a compliance capacity or anything like that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,303,11,9,Sorry.  You said you're not in a compliance capacity?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
54,305,11,11,Right.  I'm not in a role on the compliance team or anything like that.  But...,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,307,11,13,"Got it.  Okay. So in your -- in your current job, you mentioned that you have responsibilities for the criminal and eviction database and the matching logic. And I wanted to sort of zoom in on each of those. What -- well, let me just start with a broad question, and -- and we'll go from there. For each of those, would you have described your responsibilities as more managerial or more -- kind of technical? Are you -- are you a tech person or -- or not? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague and compound. Form. Go ahead and answer, if you can, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
56,324,12,4,I don't consider my job very technical.  I consider it more strategic.  Although I've -- I'm growing in -- I'm still growing into the role.  But I don't consider it as a technical role.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,328,12,8,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Sure. And how long have you been the product manager?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
58,331,12,11,Since August 5th of this year.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,332,12,12,Okay.  So just a few months?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
60,333,12,13,Yep.  Or -- yep.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,334,12,14,"Okay.  So your responsibilities with the criminal and evictions database, can you summarize kind of the scope of your role with respect to the -- to managing that database? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Form. Compound.  Calls for a narrative. Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth. I was going to say if you need to have the question read back, you can.  But if not, then just go ahead and answer the question.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
62,344,12,24,Can I have the question read back or repeated?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,347,13,1,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  I can just rephrase it if that's helpful. Can you generally summarize your responsibilities with respect to managing the criminal and eviction database?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
64,352,13,6,Yep.  So I'm in charge of -- of maintaining -- managing the database from the perspective of making sure it fits the needs of our customers and maintains its compliance standards.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,356,13,10,"Okay.  So what does that -- what does that mean in terms of like -- in terms of your day-to-day with the database? Like, what might, you know -- what might you have done yesterday or the day before with respect to managing the database? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Form.  Vague. Compound. Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
66,365,13,19,"So day-to-day BAU type of work would be -- I mean, a good example would be we update the database on a biweekly basis.  And my team -- an analyst and a specialist that work for me -- do the QA work -- basically, quality assurance work -- to make sure the updates are what we expect and there's no degradation of the database.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,373,14,1,Okay.  How big is your team?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
68,374,14,2,I have -- there's myself and then I have a specialist and an analyst that work for me.  So three.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,376,14,4,Okay.  So three including you?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
70,377,14,5,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,378,14,6,"And so you have relationships with the companies that supply this data on a biweekly basis, or is that someone else in TURSS that has those relationships? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
72,383,14,11,"Yeah.  I don't know what you mean by ""has the relationships.""  I work with some of the vendors, but I'm not -- I'm not in charge of contract negotiations or things like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,387,14,15,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  But on -- when it comes -- when it comes to this QA you were telling me about, if there was an issue with the update provided by a supplier, would you be the person to contact the supplier about that -- that issue and work to resolve it with them?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
74,393,14,21,"Depending on the issue, I might be, or it might be one of my team members.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,395,14,23,"Got it. And in terms of the match logic, can you tell me what your responsibilities with respect to the match logic are?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
76,400,15,2,"Yeah.  I think my responsibilities now are to maintain the match logic, the fidelity of the match logic, and again, make sure it suits the needs of all of our clients, that various TURSS products that use the criminal and eviction data, and hopefully, improve it over time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,406,15,8,"My -- is it accurate to say that the match logic comes from -- through this parent company, TransUnion? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague as to the term ""comes from."" Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
78,412,15,14,It certainly was influenced by a TransUnion's match logic that they had developed over the past few decades.  But it is distinct from TransUnion's match logic now.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,416,15,18,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Oh, I see.  And if a change is going to be made to the match logic, what's -- what's the process for that? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Calls for a narrative. Can you repeat the question, Ms. Court Reporter.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat
80,423,15,25,Question,side_chat,THE COURT REPORTER,start_answer
81,427,16,3,"So if a change were going to be made, we would -- we would analyze the before-and-after effects of that change, review it with our business -- senior business leadership as well as our in-house legal counsel to approve those changes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,432,16,8,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Is that sometimes referred to as the champion-challenger process?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
83,434,16,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,435,16,11,"Okay.  Before we go too deep, I want to circle back on some background. Can you tell me what you did to prepare for your deposition today without telling me the contents of any of your discussions with counsel.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
85,440,16,16,"Sure.  I met with Michael and Albert yesterday, as well as TURSS's in-house counsel, Matt Killeen.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,443,16,19,And anyone else you've met with or spoke with in the course of that preparation?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
87,445,16,21,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,446,16,22,What documents did you review in the course of that preparation?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
89,448,16,24,"I don't recall all the documents.  Some of them, I think, were the TURSS exhibits.  But we reviewed those briefly.  So I don't remember all of the specific ones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,453,17,3,Did you review any of the legal filings in this case?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
91,455,17,5,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,456,17,6,"Are you familiar with the -- the facts or allegations filed in this case or no? MR. O'NEIL:  I would ask the witness to exclude from his answer any information he received from lawyers in connection with the case. And with that exclusion, you can answer the question, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
93,463,17,13,So nothing outside of discussions with the attorneys here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
94,465,17,15,"Okay.  I actually just have a question briefly for Mr. O'Neil.  In our -- in our letter to you on July 29, we noted the insufficiency of the witness on a couple of the 30(b)(6) topics, specifically topics 3 or 4 -- 3 and 4.  And because those are related to the match logic and this witness seems to have some familiarity with the match logic, I just wanted to be clear and ask whether or not this witness is going to be designated on either of those topics. MR. O'NEIL",side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat
95,485,18,9,"Okay.  Well, I think -- I think that narrative misstates the contents of the letter.  I think the letter did pretty explicitly ask for an additional 30(b)(6) witness to designate.  But I understand your answer as indicating Mr. Landreth is not so designated.",side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_question
96,491,18,15,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  So I'd like to show you -- if you can grab that tablet -- a document that has previously been marked as Exhibit 13. If you -- it should be showing up on your screen now.  And it is somewhat lengthy, about 30 pages.  You can slide back and forth to scroll through it.  But I am -- I'll let you know that -- at least, initially -- I'm going to be focusing on the first couple of pages. MR. O'NEIL:  I'm sorry, Mr. Hashmall.  I just wanted to object to the use of this software to display documents to the witness.  The witness has never seen this software, is not familiar with it.  I haven't taken any training on how to use it. As you well know, prior efforts by plaintiff's counsel in this case to use this software has been problematic.  So I object to the use of this software to display this exhibit and potentially other exhibits, which really do not lend themselves to being reviewed on a tiny screen.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat
97,512,19,10,Noted.,side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_question
98,513,19,11,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  So, Mr. Landreth, if you -- take your time to look through this exhibit.  Like I said, I mostly -- for starters, I'm going to be asking you about the first two pages.  But let me know when you're ready to discuss it.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
99,518,19,16,"So are you in charge of this, or can I zoom in or -- I'm confused.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,520,19,18,"You can zoom, and you can go back and forth between the pages.  You should be able to do all of that.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
101,523,19,21,"Okay. MR. O'NEIL:  He's going to have to zoom because -- I don't know if you're using it, Mr. Hashmall, but you really can't see anything in detail on -- on the tiny monitor unless you zoom in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

103,533,20,5,Is that better or no?,side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat
104,534,20,6,Yeah.  I think it's marginally better or will be better. Yeah.  Okay. MR. O'NEIL,side_chat,THE DEPONENT,start_question
105,540,20,12,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  So looking at this -- the first page of this exhibit, which is labeled on the bottom TURSS 88.  My -- okay. Without, you know, commenting on the specifics of the individual who's filled in the document, can you just tell me what this type of screen is?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
106,547,20,19,"I can -- MR. O'NEIL:  I would ask the witness to exclude from his answer any information received from counsel. But if you can answer his question, please go ahead.",a,THE WITNESS,start_answer
107,553,20,25,I can only speculate.  It looks like some internal screen at TURSS.  Some sort of -- some -- one of the tools we have at TURSS.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,557,21,3,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  So are you familiar with the screen a applicant would see when they submit their information before a report is run on them? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Incomplete hypothetical. Go ahead and answer if you can.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
109,563,21,9,I am not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,564,21,10,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Let's -- oops. Let's move onto the next page, which is -- sorry -- which is labeled starting on 89.  It should be on your screen now. Does this type of screen look familiar to you? Is this something you see in your work?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
111,571,21,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

113,577,21,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,578,21,24,"Okay.  So I can represent to you that a previous witness testified that the bottom half of this page shows enhancement information.  So there's the application -- the applicant submitted information, and then on -- below that, there is enhancement information. Does that make sense to you? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Misstates the record severely.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat

116,592,22,12,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Does that make sense to you?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
117,594,22,14,It doesn't.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,595,22,15,Why not?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
119,596,22,16,"We don't log the enhancement information that I'm aware of.  And I'm not a hundred percent sure what's in front of me.  It looks like the beginning of a credit report.  If that's the case, those two things are not equal.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,601,22,21,"Okay.  So on -- for example, on the bottom of this page, it lists the three addresses.  Do you see that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
121,604,22,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,605,22,25,"Assume the applicant only submitted one address.  Where would the other two have come from? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Lack of foundation. This witness doesn't even know what this document is. And I think he's confused because you're misstating what the document is. But go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
123,614,23,8,"So if the applicant only submitted one address, I'm not a hundred percent sure where these additional addresses are coming from.  Again, if it's the beginning of a credit report, that's not a product I have any familiarity with.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,619,23,13,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Talking about the enhancement process generally, can you explain to me how enhancement works for -- for example, for names? MR. O'NEIL:  Mr. Hashmall, sorry to interrupt.  But if you're asking about the enhancement of address data for purposes of match logic as Ms. Duncan testified to, then I think this witness can answer that question. And I have now looked back at your July 29 letter which has a sentence that says -- it says -- you know, Ask -- Tell us if you're going to designate Mr. Landreth on the same topics that Ms. Duncan was designated. And so we will designate Mr. Landreth as an additional Rule 30(b)(6) witness on the topics that Ms. Duncan was previously identified as a witness. So can you please, Ms. Court Reporter, read back the last question for the witness.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat

127,650,24,18,Great.  Thank you. MR. O'NEIL,side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_question
128,652,24,20,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  So getting back on track a little bit, talking about enhancement, can you tell me your understanding of how enhancement works with respect just to name data?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
129,656,24,24,"Sure.  So an applicant would submit their information, name, address, date of birth, Social Security number.  And then that -- that's part of our -- what we call our enrichment process -- is sent to the TU database to confirm additional applicant information that might not have been submitted with the initial application.  And with respect to names, we can enrich with up to three different names. Regarding the logic of -- sort of which names we choose, I can't get into the specifics on that because I don't know it very well. But we have the opportunity to enrich with, you know, full middle names if they weren't provided, or maiden names and -- and different things like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
130,671,25,13,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Is -- is it also possible to enrich from, you know, like a nickname, or short and first names with full first names?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
131,674,25,16,Yeah.  I wouldn't refer to it as a nickname or short and first name as far as the enrichment phase goes.  But it is possible to enrich with a longer first name.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
132,678,25,20,"For example, would ""Bill"" be enriched to ""William"" or do you not know?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
133,680,25,22,It's possible.  It wouldn't -- not a hundred percent of the time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
134,682,25,24,"Okay.  And what about, like, suffixes, like junior or senior or things like that, do those sometimes get added in the enrichment process?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
135,686,26,2,Sometimes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,687,26,3,"Okay.  And then with respect to -- to address data, can you tell me a little bit about how enrichment works with respect to address data?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
137,690,26,6,Yes.  Address data is very similar to names. We look at the distinct addresses that are on that same file with the names.  We look at the distinct addresses and bring in up to 20 additional addresses beyond what the applicant originally submitted.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,695,26,11,"Okay.  And do you know -- do you know if there are, say, 50 addresses in the file, how the 20 are selected?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
139,698,26,14,I do not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,699,26,15,Okay.  Is there any enhancement done on date of birth and Social Security number?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
141,701,26,17,I'm pausing to think.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,702,26,18,Sure.  Take your time.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
143,703,26,19,There is enhancement that can be done with Social Security numbers.  I'm not a hundred percent sure about date of birth.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
144,706,26,22,Tell me how enhancement works for a Social Security number.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
145,708,26,24,"For example, if an applicant did not provide one, and we found one, it could be pulled in to be used for matching purposes later.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
146,712,27,2,"Okay.  So if the applicant provided a partial Social Security number, could that -- could it possibly be expanded to the whole thing?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
147,715,27,5,I don't believe any of our products allow for partial entry in the Social Security number field.  But I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
148,718,27,8,"Okay.  So then let's -- let me move a little further into this exhibit.  And I'm just going to sort of fast forward you there.  I'm showing you the page marked TURSS 114.  And let's see.  And I think I may ask you about the following pages as well. So take a look at that, and let me know when you're ready to discuss. MR. O'NEIL:  Look at what page?  Page 114?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat
149,726,27,16,"114 and 115, yes.",side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
150,727,27,17,(Deponent perused document.) Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,729,27,19,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  So can you tell me what this is? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Lack of foundation. Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
152,733,27,23,Are you referring to both pages?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,734,27,24,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Yes.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
154,735,27,25,"So it looks like the first page is a criminal report from one of TURSS's products.  The second page is the continuance of that, as well as the eviction report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,740,28,4,Okay.  And is this the type of thing that you are familiar with in your -- your responsibilities in your job? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
156,744,28,8,I do see criminal reports and eviction reports quite frequently in -- in the scope of my work.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,746,28,10,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Sure. And you're responsible for managing the criminal and eviction database, correct?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
158,749,28,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,750,28,14,"Okay.  And the information on these pages would have come from the criminal and eviction database? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Lack of foundation. Go ahead and answer if you can about this particular document, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
160,756,28,20,"So, yeah.  I think that's right.  Again, I'm not responsible for how it gets mapped to this page.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,758,28,22,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
162,759,28,23,And so there might be things that -- that the product includes that I'm not aware of or things that they omitted that were in the criminal database.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,763,29,1,I see. Who is responsible for how the data in the criminal and eviction database gets mapped onto this page or onto reports? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague as to types of reports. Go ahead and answer if you can.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
164,770,29,8,So I'm not sure the -- the -- I would start with the product manager of the product.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,772,29,10,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  If this was a SmartMove report, who would be responsible for the mapping from the criminal and eviction database under this report?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
166,776,29,14,"From a product management perspective, that would be someone named Kayleen.  And I don't know how to pronounce her last name.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,779,29,17,"Okay.  And so can you give me a sense of where your responsibilities end, in the kind of -- in the kind of work flow as -- you've talked to me about how records come in to the criminal and eviction database and that you have a responsibility for the match logic.  In terms of the actual matching and records coming out of the database, is that outside of your responsibility or outside of your purview?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
168,787,29,25,Can you repeat the last part of that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,789,30,1,"In terms of records actually being matched to the database and then information coming out of the database, is that part of your purview or not? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
170,793,30,5,"Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess I'm not sure of the question. I would treat -- I treat SmartMove as a customer of mine.  They use my products which are the criminal and eviction database.  They send requests.  I do all the work -- well, I don't, but the system does all the work to match records to their applicants, and I send those records back to SmartMove.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
171,801,30,13,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Got it.  Okay. And when you send those records back, what format are they in?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
172,804,30,16,"They are in a format called -- I think we call it, internally, the criminal entity or the eviction entity.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,807,30,19,The criminal entity. And is that -- do you know what type of file that is?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
174,810,30,22,I do not.  I believe it's XML.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
175,811,30,23,Okay.  And does -- and is it fair to say it's been the product manager's responsibility for translating that XML into something like -- like you see in front of you here on page 114? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
176,817,31,3,"It would be the current product manager's responsibility to update or make any changes.  But the mapping was built a long time ago, so it's just -- I guess the responsibility is to -- to maintain it or update it or improve it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
177,822,31,8,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  And do you know if it's been updated or improved in the last five years?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
178,824,31,10,I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
179,825,31,11,Are you aware of any times it has been changed?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
180,827,31,13,For SmartMove specifically?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
181,828,31,14,Yes.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
182,829,31,15,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
183,830,31,16,"Okay.  So is it fair to say, looking at page 114, that the -- on -- as to the information submitted by the applicant is on -- is in the top line, and then the results returned followed below? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Lack of foundation. Go ahead and answer if you can, sir.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
184,837,31,23,"Yeah.  I can't -- what do you mean by ""top line""?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
185,839,31,25,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  So where it says -- on the top of page 114, it says, ""Criminal records by state, William R. Hall, DOB 5-2-1968, SSN 186-58-2019."" Do you see that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
186,844,32,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,845,32,5,Okay.  That's what I mean by top line.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
188,846,32,6,Okay.  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't know.  It's a SmartMove report which I've never dealt with in my eight years at TransUnion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
189,849,32,9,You have no familiarity with a SmartMove report?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
190,851,32,11,"Not -- not their website, not their user interface.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
191,853,32,13,"Okay.  And the -- the information below where it says ""Criminal Report,"" does that -- are you able to identify that as information coming from the criminal and eviction database?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
192,857,32,17,"So where it says ""Criminal Report,"" it has the date there.  Below that is the applicant information submitted, which is why I asked my question about the top line.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
193,861,32,21,Got it.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
194,862,32,22,"So I believe that's the application information -- applicant information that was submitted.  And then below that, where it says ""William R. Hall,"" is the beginning of the credit report -- or I mean -- sorry -- the criminal report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
195,868,33,2,"Got it. And so the information below where it says ""William R. Hall"" is information that came from the criminal and eviction database that you manage?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
196,872,33,6,That information would have come from the criminal database.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
197,874,33,8,"Okay.  And moving down to page 115, the sections labeled ""Summary,"" ""Comments,"" and ""Court Action,"" would those also have come from the same database?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
198,878,33,12,"The ""summary"" is not something that's in the criminal database.  The ""comments,"" which are blank, would have been if they were there, if there was anything there.  And then where the ""court action"" and ""court charge,"" those things would have come from the criminal database.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
199,884,33,18,"Okay.  So looking -- and feel free to split between those two pages. Can you tell me ultimately where this -- this information came from, you know, both in terms of its original source?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
200,889,33,23,Just -- are you talking about the criminal report or --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
201,891,33,25,Yeah.  Just focusing on the criminal report.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
202,893,34,1,So the dataset name indicates to me that it was a dataset that ultimately came from the South Carolina Department of Corrections.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
203,896,34,4,Okay.  And TURSS received that information via a vendor; is that right?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
204,898,34,6,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,899,34,7,And is that under Themis?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
206,900,34,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
207,901,34,9,"And this -- the information -- the identifying information, the physical details, and then the things like date of birth, page, Social Security number -- which are blank -- would those also have come or -- from the South Carolina Department of Corrections via Themis.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
208,907,34,15,"So what we're looking at on the SmartMove criminal report, that stuff came from the criminal database.  I don't know that -- that SmartMove has mapped everything.  But the things on the page came from Themis to the criminal database.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,912,34,20,"Okay.  So, for example, it says -- next to Age, it says, ""N/A."" Do you see that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
210,915,34,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,916,34,24,"Is it possible that in the criminal and eviction database, there was actually age data and it just didn't get mapped on this report?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
212,920,35,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
213,921,35,3,Do you have any sense of why that might be?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
214,922,35,4,I don't.  That would be up to SmartMove.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
215,923,35,5,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
216,924,35,6,But --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
217,925,35,7,And that would be -- the Kaylene person you referenced earlier?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
218,927,35,9,Now.  Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
219,928,35,10,How long has she been in charge of the product?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
220,930,35,12,"I am not sure.  I think -- yeah, I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,932,35,14,Months?  Years?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
222,933,35,15,"More than a few months, less than a few years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,935,35,17,Okay.  Who was it previously?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
224,936,35,18,I believe it was Steve Hansen.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,937,35,19,Is Mr. Hansen still with TURSS?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
226,938,35,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
227,939,35,21,Okay.  I would like to show you another document.  It should pop up now.  It has previously been marked as Exhibit 30.  Feel free to take a look at it.  It's two pages -- or sorry -- three pages.  And let me know when you're ready to -- to address it.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
228,945,36,1,"Just to confirm, you're talking about 296, 297, and 298?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,947,36,3,Yes.  Thank you for clarifying.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
230,948,36,4,Okay. (Deponent perused document.)  Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,950,36,6,So are you familiar with the documents of this type in your position?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
232,952,36,8,Somewhat.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,953,36,9,Can you tell me what this is?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
234,954,36,10,"This looks like a printout of the record we were looking at earlier, but from the criminal database.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,957,36,13,Okay.  So it's a printout of the -- from the -- from the database that -- that you manage?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
236,959,36,15,"It looks like that.  The reason I say it looks like that is it's -- it's a -- it's rows instead of columns.  I'm used to all of these things being columns.  And it's very horizontal, the way I normally look at it, and this is very vertical.  But it looks like it's all the same fields that would be in the criminal database.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,966,36,22,"Got it. So I would just like to go through and discuss some of these fields and see if I can get a better understanding of them, and that would help me. And we can just start from the top. Do you know what -- what ""identity ID"" means?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
238,973,37,3,That is a unique number to this -- to the combination of identity information that's on this record.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
239,976,37,6,"And when you say ""identity information,"" do you mean the -- the defendant's name, or do you mean something different?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
240,979,37,9,I mean -- hold on.  I'm just looking.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
241,980,37,10,Yeah.  Take your time.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
242,981,37,11,"I think it goes all the way down to ""date time modified"" on 297.  That is the identity table, all of the columns that would be in the identity table. And so that identity ID is unique all the way across that row, if that makes sense.  It probably doesn't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
243,986,37,16,So this is -- is it fair to say this is a unique identifier for -- for this entire criminal record?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
244,989,37,19,"Not necessarily.  It is in this case, in this record.  But that's not necessarily true across the database.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
245,992,37,22,Why not?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
246,993,37,23,There can be multiple defendants on criminal records.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
247,995,37,25,"Oh, I see.  I see. So the identity ID is unique to the record; it's not to the defendant.  Is that right?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
248,999,38,3,Identity ID is unique to this defendant on this record.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,1001,38,5,"Oh, okay.  So if there are multiple defendants, would there be multiple identity IDs?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
250,1003,38,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,1004,38,8,Got it.  Got it.  Okay. So this identity ID is about William Hall in this particular court proceeding.  Is that fair?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
252,1007,38,11,"The identity ID only goes down to, like I said, date time modified.  And then the next set of rows there are in a different table.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,1010,38,14,Yeah.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
254,1011,38,15,So that --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
255,1012,38,16,"Okay.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Please continue.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
256,1014,38,18,"Well, I think that's all I have to say about that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
257,1016,38,20,"Okay.  On -- the next one down is ""source ID.""  Can you tell me what that is?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
258,1018,38,22,"The best way to think of the source ID is actually just where the ""state key"" is.  It's -- it's a unique number to identify the source of the data.  The state key is the same thing; the five-digit state key, which is next.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
259,1024,39,2,"And the state key here is listed as ""SCCO2."" And do you know, offhand, what that means?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
260,1026,39,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
261,1027,39,5,"If you'd like, we can flip back to Exhibit 13, which says the source of this record was the South Carolina Department of Corrections.  If you -- feel free to look at that.  I'm not trying to pull a fast one here. My only question is going to be whether you think ""SCCO2"" refers to the South Carolina Department of Corrections.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
262,1035,39,13,"I think that's true.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't have all of our state keys memorized as far as what source they go to.  So I think it's true in this record that the ""SCCO2"" corresponds to a South Carolina Department of Corrections dataset.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,1040,39,18,Got it. And is there a document at TURSS that kind of decodes that state key fields for following different sources?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
264,1044,39,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
265,1045,39,23,"Okay.  And next, we have the ""product type"" which is -- is ""criminal."" Is that just, essentially, identifying that this is a criminal record?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
266,1050,40,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,1051,40,3,"Okay.  I think I understand the next one, which is ""searchable source state."" Can you tell me what ""criminal ID number"" means?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
268,1055,40,7,That is a unique number to this criminal record.  That is -- it's something internal.  It's unique for TURSS.  So we can look -- like the way this document was produced was probably by using that number to identify everything to do with that criminal ID number.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,1061,40,13,"I see.  On -- and at some point on -- so I think most -- the fields we've talked about so far, these first -- one, two, three, four, five -- six on this sheet, are all fields that -- if I'm understanding you right -- are created or populated by TURSS internally.  Is that right?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
270,1067,40,19,"I can't answer definitively for ""searchable source state.""  But the --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
271,1069,40,21,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
272,1070,40,22,"But the others, I think that's accurate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,1071,40,23,"Sure. At some point we're going to get into data that came from the source.  Are you able to kind of identify the span of records that came from the -- the source -- the span of fields, I guess, not records.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
274,1077,41,3,"Yeah.  I mean, to exclude ones that didn't would take me some time to go through line by line, if you'd like me to do that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,1080,41,6,"Yeah.  It might actually be helpful if you can, yeah.  Yeah.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
276,1082,41,8,"So looking at page 296, skipping the fields we've already talked about, the ""parent ID"" is not something that would have come from the source.  But it came -- I believe it probably came from Themis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,1086,41,12,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
278,1087,41,13,I believe the rest on this page would have come from the source.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
279,1089,41,15,Got it. On --,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
280,1091,41,17,"Sorry.  Except -- sorry.  Except for ""photo identifier.""  That would have come from Themis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,1093,41,19,Okay.  Let's -- I think this is helpful.  So let's just press on and do the same things on page 297.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
282,1095,41,21,"So 297, you're seeing a lot of the same fields as the last page because of -- it's -- there's three different tables, and this is how they relate to each other.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,1099,41,25,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
284,1101,42,1,"The ""source_file_record _date,"" ""is expunged,"" ""date time created,"" ""date time modified,"" ""HID_ID,"" ""case ID,"" ""state key,"" ""identity ID,"" none of those would have come from the source.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,1105,42,5,I see.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
286,1106,42,6,They would have either been Themis or TURSS.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,1107,42,7,Got it. Then going down with the rest of the ones on this page would come from the source?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
288,1110,42,10,I'm about halfway.  So...,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
289,1111,42,11,Yeah.  Take your time.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
290,1112,42,12,"All the way down to ""date time created"" would have come from the source.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,1114,42,14,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
292,1115,42,15,"Then after ""date time created,"" ""date time modified,"" we're starting a new table here.  So again, you'll see all those fields that are not populated -- or not from the source.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,1119,42,19,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
294,1120,42,20,"Starting at ""sequence,"" it would be coming from the source through the end of the page.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
295,1122,42,22,Okay.  And then there's only a little bit left on 298.  So let's just keep pressing on.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
296,1124,42,24,"All the way down to ""is expunged"" would have come from the source.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
297,1127,43,1,Got it.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
298,1128,43,2,The rest would not have.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
299,1129,43,3,Sure.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
300,1130,43,4,Either Themis or TURSS.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
301,1131,43,5,"Sure. So one question.  I know -- is it your understanding that every two weeks when Themis sends an updated record, that the -- the old records are taken out of the database and completely replaced by new Themis data? Is that a fair way to characterize that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
302,1138,43,12,"I think that's fair.  Yeah, it's -- it's a replacement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
303,1140,43,14,"Okay.  And do these identifiers at the top of the -- at the top of the records -- specifically, like, ""identity ID"" and ""criminal ID number,"" do those stay consistent when the database is replaced in that way, or are they regenerated or changed in some way?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
304,1145,43,19,I think they generally stay consistent.  I don't think that there's a rule in place that they must stay consistent.  So I think there's a potential for changing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
305,1149,43,23,Why might they change?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
306,1150,43,24,"Depending on what changes within the identity data.  So, you know, a court could add another name here, a different name.  They could change ""hall"" to ""hallway"" or something like that, and that might affect those numbers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,1156,44,4,"I see.  That makes sense. But if the underlying data stays the same, would you expect those identifiers to stay the same as well?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
308,1160,44,8,"Generally, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
309,1161,44,9,"Okay.  And then just to -- a good -- about halfway down the page on 296, it does look like this record came with -- with an ""age."" Do you see that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
310,1165,44,13,"I see the ""age,"" yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
311,1166,44,14,"And again, feel free to look back to Exhibit 13 if you'd like.  But would it be fair to say that ""age"" was present in the criminal and eviction database but was not mapped onto the ultimate report? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection to the extent that you're suggesting, Mr. Hashmall, that document -- Exhibit 30 is the same moment in time as the record that was included in Exhibit 13.  So I would object to the extent that you're mischaracterizing the record. But go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
312,1177,44,25,"Yeah.  It's hard to answer without knowing when the Exhibit 30 was pulled out of the database.  So I can't say for certain looking at the two exhibits that ""age"" was present on this record the day that that report was run.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
313,1183,45,5,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  I see. Okay.  But you can -- you can say for certain that age was present on the day that Exhibit 30 was pulled from the database?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
314,1187,45,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
315,1188,45,10,"And it looks like birth date and birth year were not present, is that accurate, on the day that Exhibit 30 was pulled from the database?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
316,1191,45,13,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
317,1192,45,14,Okay.  And do you have records or tables indicating what data you generally received from various sources? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
318,1196,45,18,Yeah.  I don't know if you can clarify that at all or be more specific.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
319,1198,45,20,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Sure. Again, to be more specific, is there a document somewhere at TURSS that says, you know, for this South Carolina Department of Corrections, we usually receive age but not date of birth or anything like that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
320,1205,46,1,"There is a document that would indicate the number of records within this dataset that has age -- that have age on them.  That's all metadata, though. It doesn't tie back to specific records.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
321,1209,46,5,Sure. And is that historical or does that reflect to the database today? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Form.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
322,1213,46,9,"We pull these from time to time, so it would reflect the database as it existed on the day we pulled them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
323,1216,46,12,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Did you have a sense of how frequently that's pulled?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
324,1218,46,14,"We typically do that biweekly, every other week.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
325,1220,46,16,So what do you call that document?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
326,1221,46,17,"I would call that -- I think it's called the ""fill rate report.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
327,1223,46,19,And does the fill rate report include data for the rate at which various variables are filled in broken down by -- by source?  Is that fair?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
328,1226,46,22,It doesn't have the rate.  It has counts.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
329,1227,46,23,"Okay.  That's confusing.  It's called the fill rate report, but it doesn't actually have rates?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
330,1229,46,25,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
331,1231,47,1,"Okay.  Would you be able to calculate a rate by, you know -- does it have the total number of records that you divide and come up with a percentage?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
332,1234,47,4,"Yeah, that could be done.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
333,1235,47,5,"Okay.  So by -- going back to my question, is it -- does it have those -- does it have specifics broken down by jurisdiction, or how is it broken down?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
334,1238,47,8,"It's broken down by distinct state keys, that five-digit key near the top of the page.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
335,1240,47,10,Got it. And what use do you put those that you report to?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
336,1243,47,13,"I -- my team puts it to use to -- like I mentioned at the beginning -- to QA, the data, every other week.  So we look at variances between fill rate reports to see if there are any potential issues indicated by that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
337,1248,47,18,"So, for example, you might say, Oh, state tax used to report -- we used to get a hundred percent of dispositions and now we're only getting 50; what the heck is going on?  Is that sort of a basic example?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
338,1252,47,22,"Yeah.  Not at the state level, but at the dataset level, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
339,1254,47,24,"Sure.  Yeah. And do you -- have you analyzed these fill rate reports -- or have you looked at the fill rate with respect to age and with respect to date of birth? Has that been something you've focused on in your time, in your position?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
340,1261,48,5,"The -- yeah.  The extent to which I look at those reports is the variances between them.  And so, you know, if date of birth changed drastically in a dataset or across the board from one update to the next, I would -- I would look at it in that respect. Mostly, it's my team that does this stuff now.  So...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
341,1267,48,11,Sorry.  I didn't quite hear that.  Can you repeat your last sentence.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
342,1269,48,13,"Most of the time, it's my team that does the analysis.  And then, you know, escalates any issues to me or the vendor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
343,1272,48,16,"Sure. If they escalate an issue to you, do they, like, write a memo or do they send you an email or do they walk over to your desk?  Or how does that happen?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
344,1276,48,20,It would be all of the above except memos.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
345,1277,48,21,Okay.  Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
346,1278,48,22,So...,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
347,1279,48,23,"All right.  Let's talk a little bit about the match logic.  I think we've talked a lot about the -- about the criminal data.  I think that the match logic would be the next -- the next thing. MR. O'NEIL:  Mr. Hashmall, sorry to interrupt.  But I was going to ask to take a break.  Is this a good time to take a -- take a short break?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat
348,1287,49,5,This is a great time to take a short break. Do you want five minutes?  Ten minutes? MR. O'NEIL,side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat
349,1292,49,10,Sounds great.  Let's go off the record and meet back in five minutes.,side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,is brackets

351,1295,49,13,Let's go back on the record.,side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_question
352,1296,49,14,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Before I go to the next exhibit, I just wanted to -- I have one quick follow-up on the fill rate reports.  I was just looking at testimony from a prior witness. Is it -- is there -- within TURSS, their fill rate reports also called variance reports?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
353,1302,49,20,The variance report is the other thing I was talking about where we compare the differences between one fill rate to another.  So there are two -- two separate documents.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
354,1306,49,24,"So on -- am I correct in saying that if the -- if the fill rate has changed significantly, then a advance report might be filled out?  Is that -- is that accurate?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
355,1311,50,3,"The variance report is always filled out when -- before we do a change. So to answer your question, we wouldn't know something changed drastically between fill rates without making the variance report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
356,1316,50,8,"Got it. So -- is -- just to be clear, is the variance report one of these things that's drafted biweekly or it's only drafted when there's going to be a change of procedures?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
357,1321,50,13,It's done biweekly for the data updates.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
358,1322,50,14,Got it.  Okay.  That is helpful. Okay.  I'm going to show you -- it should be showing up on your page now -- a document that's previously been marked as Exhibit 22.  It's a two-page document labeled page TURSS 247 and 248.  And take a look at that and tell me if you recognize it.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
359,1328,50,20,"I do recognize it.  The second page has it -- looks like a redaction, but...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
360,1330,50,22,Can you tell me what it is?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
361,1331,50,23,"Looking at the first page, I refer to this document as the qualification table.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
362,1333,50,25,And can you tell me how it is used?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
363,1335,51,1,This is -- this table represents one step in the match logic -- the qualifications step.  So --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
364,1337,51,3,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
365,1338,51,4,Yep.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
366,1339,51,5,"And then let's run through the steps of the match logic, then. Is the qualification step 1? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
367,1343,51,9,"I don't understand the qualification step as being step 1.  When I look at the match logic as the products manager, I would consider in the enrichment phase that we talked about earlier to be step 1.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
368,1347,51,13,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Great. And then can you just walk me through the steps and then that will help clarify our future conversations. MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Calls for a narrative.  Form. Are you asking for a high-level listing of what you call steps, Mr. Hashmall?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_chat
369,1355,51,21,Yeah.  That's what I'm asking for. MR. O'NEIL,side_chat,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
370,1359,51,25,"Yeah.  So very high level, we get the applicant's information, we do the enrichment phase, then we pull records out of the criminal database -- so we call that the scoop -- then we do the qualification, and then the disqualification, and then some additional filtering that we've made on top of that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
371,1366,52,6,(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  So we talked about enrichment.  Can you tell me how the scoop works?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
372,1368,52,8,"So after enrichment, when we have the names and addresses that we want to use -- dates of birth, SSN -- we look at the criminal database to determine which records we think might be a match.  And those records are then sent to the next step, the next phase in the matching logic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
373,1374,52,14,"How did you determine what might be a match in that scoop step?  Is it just -- how broad of -- or what needs to match in order for it to be pulled into that step? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Incomplete hypothetical.  Calls for a narrative. Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
374,1381,52,21,"Yeah.  There are clauses that were written that I don't have memorized.  But that piece of the process is generally to find records that might be a match, like I said.  It's not -- it's not as tight as we get later on in the matching process.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
375,1387,53,1,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Does it -- so you -- do you know -- for example, you know, does it need to match on name and one other matching characteristic, or is it just -- is just a name enough to match or -- in this -- in this broader step? Can you put any kind of parameters on it?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
376,1393,53,7,"Yeah.  Like I said, I don't have it memorized.  I could speculate.  I think most, if not all, of the clauses have more than one element required.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
377,1397,53,11,"Are the clauses -- you know, obviously, I assume they are present in the code.  Are they -- is it true that they are in code somewhere through the system? And are they present or written down anywhere else?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
378,1403,53,17,"It is true that they are in the code.  I believe they are written down elsewhere as well.  But it's not something I work with a lot.  So I don't -- like I said, that's why I don't have them well memorized or anything.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
379,1408,53,22,"Sure. If you wanted to find where else they were written down, what kind of document would you ask for or who would you talk to?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
380,1413,54,1,"Well, if -- so I could look in some places, some shared drives that, you know -- that my team has and uses.  Or if I couldn't find them, I would ask a developer to interpret the code and write it down.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
381,1417,54,5,"Okay.  What -- if you were looking at a shared drive, what type of document would you be looking for?  What would it be called?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
382,1420,54,8,"I don't -- I don't know.  I'd search the word ""clause,"" probably, and see if I can find it that way.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
383,1422,54,10,Clause?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
384,1423,54,11,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
385,1424,54,12,"Why ""clause""?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
386,1425,54,13,"That's how they are referred to, as the scoop clauses, I think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
387,1427,54,15,"Scoop clauses.  I see.  Okay. So in the broad overview of the process that -- the match logic -- you gave me, the step 3 is then the qualification step, which relates to this table, Exhibit 22, you have in front of you. Can you give me a broad overview of how this table works?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
388,1434,54,22,"Sure. So looking at the top row, there are columns for Name, Low and High; Address, Low and High; SSN, Low and High; and Date of Birth, Low and High. Prior to the qualification step, all of those fields are scored, and those scores feed into this table.  So if the scores for each of those fields matches the ranges in each of those rows -- or in one row all the way across, the record would go onto the next step.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
389,1445,55,7,"Got it. And there are additional tables for name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth that define how these scores are assigned; is that right?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
390,1449,55,11,There are additional tables that -- that you can use to -- for those scoring.  But I'm not sure those tables really define what score is what.  But...,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
391,1452,55,14,"Okay.  And it's true that if any of the conditions on any of these 33 rows are matched, then that record has passed the qualification set.  Is that fair to say?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
392,1456,55,18,"Well, there's 35 rows.  Like I said, the two on the next page, I think they were highlighted in the Xcel document that this was probably translated from.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
393,1459,55,21,I see.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
394,1460,55,22,"But as it goes down from 1 to 35, if a record meets the criteria within one of the rows, it moves onto the next step.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
395,1463,55,25,"Got it. And generally speaking, is it fair to say a score of 1 is a really good match and a score of 99 is not a match?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
396,1468,56,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
397,1469,56,5,"And the lower the number, the better the match?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
398,1471,56,7,That is generally true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
399,1472,56,8,"Okay.  Are the numbers 99 and 88, do they have special significance?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
400,1474,56,10,"Yeah.  Like you said earlier, 99 would indicate a nonmatch and 88 would be indeterminate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
401,1476,56,12,"What does ""indeterminate"" mean in this context?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
402,1478,56,14,"So when you're looking at the scoring, you're comparing one name to another -- the criminal record name versus, say, the applicant name.  ""Indeterminate"" means one or more is not present.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
403,1482,56,18,"Got it.  Okay. So, for example, we're now looking at the underlying tables.  But if I were to put this into -- put in precise plain English, I might say, Well, row 1 means a pretty good match on the name and a pretty good match on the address, no match on Social Security number, date of birth not present.  That will allow you to match on row 1.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
404,1491,57,1,Is there a question?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
405,1492,57,2,Yeah.  Is that fair?  Would you agree or disagree with that statement?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
406,1494,57,4,"I would agree that, yeah, name is strong, address is strong.  SSN doesn't really matter for this row.  And date of birth either has to be matching or indeterminate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
407,1498,57,8,"Got it. So for row 33, the bottom row on this table -- and we'll look at the -- some of the underlying tables -- it looks to me like for row 33, if there's a really good name match and an address match at level 9, there doesn't need to be any Social Security number or date of birth present for there to be a match. Is that fair?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
408,1507,57,17,"I -- I would characterize ""SSN"" and ""DOB"" as they must be indeterminate for this row.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
409,1509,57,19,They must be indeterminate.  Got it. Do you do -- or have you -- you or your team -- ever conducted an analysis of what rows are the most likely to generate a match -- or most likely to qualify a record rather?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
410,1514,57,24,We do.  We look at counts of records by qualification row as part of the champion-challenger process.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
411,1518,58,2,Okay.  Do you know offhand which -- which rows are most likely to -- to qualify a record?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
412,1520,58,4,"I don't, off the top of my head.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
413,1521,58,5,"Okay.  I mean, is it fair to say that most criminal records don't include a Social Security number?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
414,1524,58,8,"That is fair to say, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
415,1525,58,9,So would it also be fair to say that rows -- say 17 through 29 -- which all seem to include -- to require pretty good Social Security match are not frequently used when criminal records are qualified?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
416,1529,58,13,"Yeah.  I mean, if I'm following your logic, I think that's probably fair to say, although I don't know that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
417,1532,58,16,"Okay.  Let's take a look on -- I'm going to show you, actually, two exhibits.  I think you should be able to toggle between them.  But if you're not, I'm happy to do it for you. Let me show you a document that's previously been labeled as Exhibit 27, and then a document that's previously been labeled as Exhibit 28.  And these are two versions of what appear to be the same thing as they are both labeled ""Criminal Record Address Ranks Table"" -- and -- or one is labeled ""Criminal Address Ranks Table"" and one is labeled ""Criminal Record Address Levels."" And my -- you can take a look at both of them.  And -- but you should know that my first question is going to be whether or not you know which one of these is presently in effect.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
418,1549,59,7,Yeah.  How do I -- can you go back to 27?  I don't know how to do it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
419,1551,59,9,Yes.  So here is 27.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
420,1552,59,10,"So between 27 and 28, they are different.  I believe both of them exist in the match logic.  28 -- 28 is going to be what feeds into what we were just looking at, the qualification table.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
421,1556,59,14,Okay.  What is 27?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
422,1557,59,15,"That's just -- that's the ranks table, which is distinct from levels.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
423,1559,59,17,What are ranks used for?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
424,1560,59,18,"So ranks, they are primarily used as part of TransUnion's credit matching.  To my knowledge, TURSS doesn't use this ranks table.  But I think it's in the environment that we use for matching logic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
425,1564,59,22,"I see.  So because -- so I'm going to show you -- go back to Exhibit 28, because it seems like that's the most relevant.  But that leads us to a larger question. You testified earlier that these tables -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that these tables originated at TransUnion.  But is it fair to say now that TURSS has kind of custody over them and is modifying them as it sees fit? MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague as to the term ""them.""",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_question
426,1576,60,8,"(BY MR. HASHMALL)  By the -- by ""them"" I mean the tables we've looked at so far, Exhibits 22, 27, 28.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
427,1578,60,10,"So I don't know if this answers your question, but TURSS has its own instance of the matching service, and we can -- and have from time to time modified some of these tables.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
428,1582,60,14,Okay.  Is it fair to say that the tables were originally created by TransUnion?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
429,1584,60,16,"If I were to speculate, I would say yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
430,1585,60,17,"And if TransUnion changes their matching logic, do they communicate that to TURSS in some way?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
431,1587,60,19,Not -- not always.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
432,1588,60,20,Do they sometimes?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
433,1589,60,21,Yeah.  We're aware of matching logic changes that TransUnion has made.  But --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
434,1591,60,23,And then -- go ahead.  Sorry.  Please finish.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
435,1592,60,24,The TransUnion doesn't dictate match logic changes for TURSS on a regular basis or anything like that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
436,1596,61,2,"Okay.  So when you become aware of -- by a TransUnion match logic change, do you consider updating it at TURSS or have you sometimes adopted those changes?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
437,1600,61,6,"Like I said, I've only been a product manager for a month, so I haven't yet.  But I think, generally, we would look at what sort of impact TransUnion was trying to effectuate with those changes and see how they might apply to criminal and eviction records.  And then if we were to adopt them, we would do a champion-challenger analysis the same as we always would.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
438,1608,61,14,"I see.  Okay. So let's go back to Exhibit 28.  It is two pages.  I think it's the -- the table has been broken up over two pages.  I think it would have continued across in the original exhibit at the Xcel document. But are you, you know, familiar with the contents of this table?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
439,1615,61,21,"Somewhat, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
440,1616,61,22,"Okay.  So can you -- so I see in the -- just kind of the body of the table -- a couple different letters.  I assume that ""Y"" stands for ""yes,"" and ""N"" stands for ""no.""  Is that correct?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
441,1621,62,1,"Yes, that's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
442,1622,62,2,"Can you tell me what ""P"" and ""I"" and ""N"" stand for?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
443,1624,62,4,"So I would -- I would say -- I mean, here's how I would define each of the letters.  ""Yes"" being an exact match -- or ""Y"" being an exact match.  ""P"" being a partial match.  ""N"" being nonmatching, and ""I"" being indeterminate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
444,1629,62,9,Okay.  Do you -- what -- where did the -- are you familiar with the underlying logic behind -- behind those scores?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
445,1632,62,12,"Scores being the ""Ys"" and the ""Ps"" and things.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
446,1634,62,14,"Yeah, exactly.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
447,1635,62,15,I'm generally familiar with that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
448,1636,62,16,"Do you -- for example, do you know how close something has to be to be judged partial versus indeterminate or not a match?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
449,1639,62,19,"I have a general familiarity with that regarding addresses.  Obviously, it would be different for the different columns.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
450,1642,62,22,"Okay.  So let's take a look at -- for example, street name.  So obviously, ""Y"" -- would ""Y"" only apply if there's an exact character to prepare for match for the entire street names?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
451,1647,63,1,Yes.  I believe that's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
452,1648,63,2,"Okay.  In what instance would you get a ""P"" for a street name?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
453,1650,63,4,I believe a P is one-third of the street name elements matching.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
454,1652,63,6,What is a street name element?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
455,1653,63,7,"So a descriptive example, 123 Main Street would have three elements.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
456,1655,63,9,"Okay.  So 123 is an element -- the number -- Main is an element, and then street is an element?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
457,1657,63,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
458,1658,63,12,Is that right?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
459,1659,63,13,Yep.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
460,1660,63,14,Okay.  I see. And sorry.  You said that P is two out of three?  I can't -- I've already forgotten.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
461,1663,63,17,I believe it's one out of three.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
462,1664,63,18,"One out of three.  Okay.  And then what result is an ""I""?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
463,1666,63,20,"""I"" is indeterminate, so one or more isn't present.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
464,1668,63,22,"I see.  ""N"" would be zero out of three matching?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
465,1670,63,24,"For the street name match column, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
466,1671,63,25,Got it.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
467,1673,64,1,"There's no Ns in the tables, so...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
468,1674,64,2,"Oh, sure. So, I see.  So, for example, to get in 88, which we decided was in no -- you know, there's nothing to compare it to, you get your -- your street name matches is an ""I,"" because there's no data to compare it to.  Is that fair?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
469,1680,64,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
470,1681,64,9,"Okay.  So -- and on the left, there are sequence numbers and levels.  Is it fair to say that if you match any of the -- the given levels -- or any of the given sequence numbers associated with the level, you get that level? Is that -- if that wasn't clear, I can clarify.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
471,1688,64,16,"Yes.  I mean, it's a sequence number, so you go into sequence, right?  And then if you satisfy sequence number 3, you get a level 4.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
472,1691,64,19,"Got it. And also, if you satisfy sequence level 10 -- sequence number 10, you get a level 4 as well.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
473,1694,64,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
474,1695,64,23,Got it. So the code works its way down this table. It starts with 1 and it goes all the way down to 30?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
475,1699,65,1,"That's a technical question.  But if you satisfy a row, it's -- like row 10, for example, it's not going to look at row 11.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
476,1702,65,4,"Got it. So is it fair to characterize level 9 as -- actually I have a -- sorry. Just to look at the second page of this document, is this second page a kind of a computer translation of the -- of the -- of the first page? Is that a -- would you characterize it that way, or some other way?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
477,1710,65,12,I know this as the programmers' view.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
478,1711,65,13,Okay.  Is it kind of a numerical version of what is shown on the previous page?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
479,1713,65,15,Yes.  It means the same thing to a programmer that the previous page means to the business.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
480,1715,65,17,"Got it. So let's focus on the one that we can read, which is page 290.  On -- is it fair to say that for a level 9 match, any of sequences 21 through 29, that what you need is for the state code to match?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
481,1720,65,22,"Yeah.  The state code must be an exact match for any of the rows for level 9, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
482,1722,65,24,"Okay.  And, in fact, for sequence 29, on -- if only this 8 is present, there's no street name, no city name, and no ZIP code.  But the state matches, then -- then it's a level 9 match?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
483,1727,66,3,"If -- if only the state code is present on either the record or the applicant information, then that -- that -- if it matched, it could level at a 9 on row 29 there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
484,1731,66,7,"Okay.  So on -- for example, if you had an applicant who provided their full address on -- but -- and then there was a criminal record with the same -- or there's a criminal record that only had the state associated with it, that would qualify based on sequence level 29.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
485,1737,66,13,"I wouldn't use the word ""qualify"" there.  It could level at a 9.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
486,1739,66,15,It could level at at 9.  Got it.  Sure. Because this is not the qualification table. This is the underlying table; is that right?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
487,1742,66,18,"For addresses, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
488,1743,66,19,"Got it.  Okay.  And okay.  That is -- is helpful. Let's move on to -- I'm going to show you a document that I'm going to mark as Exhibit 40.  It is labeled as TURSS 259.  It is 23 pages long.  And it is titled ""Names Levels and Ranks Table."" Do you see that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
489,1751,67,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
490,1752,67,2,Are you familiar with this table?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
491,1753,67,3,"I am generally familiar with this table. It's a lot of table, though.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
492,1755,67,5,Sorry.  Say that again.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
493,1756,67,6,It's a lot of table to be specifically familiar with.  But I am generally familiar with it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
494,1758,67,8,"Understood. And so when we were talking about addresses, there were two different documents; one gave levels and one gave ranks.  This one seems to have levels and ranks in the same table.  Is that right?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
495,1763,67,13,"Yes.  Several, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
496,1764,67,14,"So is it fair to say that for the purpose of the match logic, you focus on the levels and not the ranks?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
497,1767,67,17,"For the purposes of the qualification table, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
498,1769,67,19,"Okay.  Got it. And I don't want to go through every rank and level here.  But I do want to understand the -- the various characters in the table and then maybe go across the top as best as we're able. But let's start -- I see -- just looking at the table here, I see again, Y, N -- Ys, Ns, and Ps. But with all some sub variations.  There's Y1s, Y2s, Y3s, P1s, P2s, P3s.  So I'd like to touch on all those. Let's just start talking about the Ys. Can you tell me what the ""Y"" means on this table and what the variations in Ys mean?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
499,1782,68,6,"So the ""Ys"" mean different things between -- depending on what column they are under.  But Ys generally are exact matches.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
500,1785,68,9,"Okay.  So it looks like the place I see variations in the Ys is, for example, in last name match, I see Y1, Y2, and Y3. Do you know what those are?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
501,1789,68,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
502,1790,68,14,Can you tell me what each of those mean?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
503,1791,68,15,"So the way to think about Y is they are different forms of exact match.  So for last name matches, last names can have multiple elements.  So Y1 is an exact character-for-character match between the two last names after removing spaces. Y2 is that the name -- the last name with the least amount of elements matches exactly with the first part of the last name with more elements.  And Y3 is that the -- the last name with the least amount of elements matches the last name with the most amount of elements, character for character, except the order of the elements doesn't matter.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
504,1804,69,2,"Okay.  Let's -- let's take 2 and 3 again because I got confused.  And maybe some -- some examples would help. Would this apply, for example, in a sense where someone has, say, a hyphenated name and then they are also a junior?  Would all of those things be elements?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
505,1811,69,9,No.  This is just for the last name.  So the junior would be a suffix.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
506,1813,69,11,Okay.  Got it.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
507,1814,69,12,So this would be for last names with spaces or hyphens.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
508,1816,69,14,"Got it. So if -- so if someone's last name was -- on one record with Smith-Jones, and then the last name on the other record was just Smith, would that be a Y2?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
509,1820,69,18,"Yeah.  I mean, so you're using the word ""record"" and maybe differently than I would.  So I would say when the applicant's last name is Smith and when the record's last name is Smith-Jones, that would be a Y2.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
510,1825,69,23,Okay.  And can you give me a similar example for what would be a Y3?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
511,1827,69,25,If the applicant's last name was Smith and the record's last name was Jones-Smith.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
512,1830,70,2,Got it. The difference between Y1 -- Y2 and Y3 is the order?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
513,1833,70,5,"Yes.  Y2, it has to be the first parts -- the first elements match exactly between the two.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
514,1835,70,7,"Got it. Okay.  So I think we've covered the Ys. Let's talk about P.  I assume ""P"" means partial again in this -- in this table; is that right?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
515,1839,70,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
516,1840,70,12,"But again here, for example, in the Last Name Match column, I see P1, P2, and P3.  And are you able to explain those?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
517,1843,70,15,Not with the same degree of certainty I can with the Ys.  But --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
518,1845,70,17,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
519,1846,70,18,-- yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
520,1847,70,19,"Well, can you give it with whatever degree of certainty you're able?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
521,1849,70,21,Sure.  So Ps -- so these are different levels of partial matches.  So the way I -- I guess the way I would think of it is the elements -- so I know P2 better than I know P1.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
522,1853,70,25,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
523,1855,71,1,But you can think with Addams with two Ds versus Adams with one D.  That would -- that would be a P1.  And then --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
524,1858,71,4,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
525,1859,71,5,"And then a P2 and P3 goes into those elements, like the different name elements, like Y2 and Y3 go into.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
526,1862,71,8,Got it. Are there -- is there a document that -- that defines these characters in TURSS?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
527,1865,71,11,"Yeah.  I think a Word document exists that walks through some of these steps, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
528,1867,71,13,Okay.  Do you know what that would be called?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
529,1868,71,14,I don't.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
530,1869,71,15,"If you were going to ask someone to email you that document, what would you say?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
531,1871,71,17,Yeah.  I would ask someone to send me the really long Word document that explains match logic.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
532,1873,71,19,"Okay.  So then on this table there, there is -- there are also ""Ns,"" which I assume continues to mean not a match -- or I think you had a better definition for it?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
533,1877,71,23,Yeah.  Nonmatching.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
534,1878,71,24,"Nonmatching. And then there are ""Is"" as well.  Does that mean that particular data is not -- not present to match with?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
535,1883,72,3,"Yeah.  ""I"" would mean indeterminate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
536,1884,72,4,"Okay.  Okay. So let's take a look at the top -- sort of shaded -- shaded portion of this table. Just looking at the very first row, there are a number of different sort of categories.  There's Last-Last, First-First, First-Middle, and so on.  Can you explain what that means?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
537,1891,72,11,That's what is being compared between the record and the applicant.  So the last name versus last name.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
538,1894,72,14,"Okay.  So on -- and then as you get further into the analysis at some point, you're comparing unlike elements; for example, you're comparing the middle name to a first name?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
539,1898,72,18,"Yeah.  If there are Ys -- yeah, it looks like there are.  So, yes, eventually, you do start doing those comparisons.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
540,1901,72,21,"Sure. Because some people, you know, take their -- use their middle name as their first name, things like that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
541,1905,72,25,"I don't know.  I didn't design this, so I wouldn't want to speculate the reasons for that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
542,1908,73,2,"Okay.  So in the last-last comparison, there are two columns.  It looks like -- the first one it's called 1st Char. And can you explain to me what that -- what that column represents?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
543,1913,73,7,Yeah.  So this is what I was talking about earlier.  The Ys and the Ns mean different things as you go across columns.  But this is a first-character match.  And so it can either be true or false.  So it has a Y or an N.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
544,1918,73,12,"I see. And then there's Last Name Match, which we've talked about a lot.  And I think I have a pretty good understanding what that means. So it looks like, for example, for the level 1s and the level 2s, you need a last name match.  But for level 3s, you need -- you can get -- you can get a qualification with a partial name match sometimes if there's a first character match. Is that -- is that fair?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
545,1928,73,22,"If you're just -- so you said ""partial name match.""  If you're just talking about last name, that's fair.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
546,1931,73,25,Yeah.  I'm only focusing on that last-last comparison.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
547,1934,74,2,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
548,1935,74,3,"So then moving across this, there's a first-first comparison of the first name of the applicant with the first name on the record.  Is that right?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
549,1939,74,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
550,1940,74,8,And then there's a 1st Char there and a Name Match.  I assume that analysis is similar to the last-last that we discussed?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
551,1943,74,11,"The name match for first-first is -- so it actually defines what type of match it is, right?  And the last-last, it's called ""last name match.""  That's the type of matching that's done.  That's why there's Ys and Ps and different variations of those. In the first-first, it's just name matching, so there's only Ys, Ps and Is and Ns.  There's no Y1s.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
552,1950,74,18,So there's not -- I see. Because first names aren't often hyphenated and complicated in that way?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
553,1953,74,21,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
554,1954,74,22,Okay.  There's Nickname.  Can you explain to me what that analysis is?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
555,1956,74,24,"Yeah.  So in a row with Nickname, we would look at the Nickname table and compare the first name to that Nickname table.  And if it matches the nickname, then that would be a Y.  If it doesn't match a nickname, it would be an N.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
556,1962,75,4,"Got it. And it looks like there aren't any Ns, at least on this first page I'm looking at, but there are blanks.  Does it ever populate the N, or is it just -- it's just the Yes if the nickname doesn't match?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
557,1967,75,9,"Well, I would have to look at all the pages, but I would assume it would be a bad match.  If -- if we're looking at the table and saying, No, there's no nickname match, we wouldn't want it high up on this table to score at a level 1 or 2.  It might be further down the table if you want me to look.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
558,1973,75,15,No.  That's okay. Then the next column is Shorter Within Long. Can you explain to me what that means?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
559,1976,75,18,Yes.  So if a first name is the shorter of the two contained within the longer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
560,1978,75,20,"So, like, Tim and Timothy.  Is that an example?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
561,1980,75,22,"I think that's a valid example, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
562,1981,75,23,Okay.  So then there's the first-middle comparison which seems to mirror the first-first comparison.  Is that fair?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
563,1985,76,1,As far as what is looked at in that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
564,1986,76,2,"Yes. Actually, I skipped a column.  But you can answer that question, and I'll come back.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
565,1989,76,5,"It's similar, but there's a Name Pair column.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
566,1990,76,6,Okay.  What does that column mean?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
567,1991,76,7,It's similar to nickname matching.  It's just a different table.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
568,1993,76,9,"Okay.  And then in First-First, there's a column Length of Shorter = 1. Can you explain to me what that column is used for?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
569,1997,76,13,Yeah.  It's just asking if the length of the shorter of the two first names is one character long.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
570,1999,76,15,"Okay.  Got it. And now with disqualified, for example, the shorter within longer match, if the shorter one is just a single letter?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
571,2003,76,19,"Yeah.  So you're using the word ""disqualify,"" which is much later in the process for me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
572,2005,76,21,Okay.  Sure.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
573,2006,76,22,"But it -- the rows you're looking at here, the values, all of this matching has already been done. And so the length of shorter equals 1, when that is set to ""no,"" that's what that first -- that first row looking at, among all the other values.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
574,2012,77,2,Sure.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
575,2013,77,3,"So this table isn't setting the value.  The values have already been set, and we're just seeing where on those tables those values fall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
576,2016,77,6,"Got it.  That makes sense. So after the First-Middle category, there's a middle-first.  And is that basically the same analysis; it's just kind of -- it twists in terms of -- rather than looking at the -- is the thing the first-first the applicant name or is it the record name?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
577,2022,77,12,I'm not sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
578,2023,77,13,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
579,2024,77,14,It would apply the same either way.  But...,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
580,2025,77,15,"Got it. So the first-middle, it compares either the first name of the applicant with the middle name of the record or the first name of the record that's the middle name of the applicant, and the middle-first is the opposite.  Is that fair?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
581,2031,77,21,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
582,2032,77,22,Okay.  And then middle to middle is compared to middle name of the applicant with the middle name of the record?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
583,2035,77,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
584,2037,78,1,"And I see, under Middle to Middle, there's a Name Reversal column.  What does that mean?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
585,2039,78,3,"The name reversal I'm less familiar with.  I believe it -- it works with multiple elements again, like we were talking about with the last name.  And it reorders them into all possible combinations and then compares them and the signs and the score.  But like I said, I'm much less familiar with that, so I can't get more specific than that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
586,2046,78,10,"Okay.  I think that's all I have about the name table. So I'm going to show you what's previously been marked as Exhibit 29, which is also a four-page document that is titled Date of Birth Levels and Ranks Table.  It's also -- it's a four-page document starting on page TURSS 292. Do you see that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
587,2054,78,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
588,2055,78,19,"Okay.  This one, it looks like shorter, which is nice.  And I assume this is how the match logic determines whether a date of birth is a match?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
589,2058,78,22,Yeah.  It assigns it a level on a rank.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
590,2059,78,23,"Sure.  And again, for the match logic, you're more concerned with -- with the level than the rank; is that right?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
591,2063,79,1,For the purposes of the qualification table.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
592,2064,79,2,"Got it. So it looks like here, again, we have Ys, Ps, and then a P2.  Can you explain what -- and an N. Can you explain what those mean in the context to this table?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
593,2069,79,7,"So, yeah.  I can't explain the P1s and the P2s on the date of birth.  I'm not familiar with that. But again, the Ys and the Ns would mean the same thing as previous tables; it's just depending on what column you're in.  But generally, Y means yes or matching, and N means no or nonmatching.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
594,2075,79,13,"Got it. So it looks like -- just to go through the columns pretty quickly, after Rank and Level, you get Birth Date Overall Match, which I assume it just means the whole birth date matches.  Is that fair?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
595,2080,79,18,I think that's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
596,2081,79,19,And then the next column is CCYY Match.  What does that mean?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
597,2083,79,21,"So that's the century and the year.  So, essentially, the year of birth.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
598,2085,79,23,"Got it. So ""CC"" is the first -- the two digits of the four-digit year, and the ""YY"" is the last two?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
599,2089,80,1,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
600,2090,80,2,"Got it. The next column is CCYY 1 Year Difference.  I think I can get what that means, but why don't you tell me.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
601,2094,80,6,So I think that's just looking at the year of birth and looking for plus or minus one year.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
602,2096,80,8,"Okay.  Then CCYY Position 1 and/or 2 Difference, can you explain what that means?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
603,2098,80,10,Yeah.  So comparing the two years of birth are either of the Cs different.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
604,2100,80,12,I see. So position 1 is the first C and position 2 is the second C?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
605,2103,80,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
606,2104,80,16,Got it. So the next column -- I think I'm learning -- is called CCYY Position 3 Difference.  So that would be looking to see if the -- the first Y is different?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
607,2108,80,20,Yep.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
608,2109,80,21,"And so would that be -- to get a Y, if the other three digits match, but that have one digit doesn't?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
609,2112,80,24,So that column is only looking at that digit. So I think the answer is yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
610,2115,81,1,I see.  Got it. Then CCYY Position 4 Difference would look at the second -- second Y and determine if those two digits are different?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
611,2119,81,5,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
612,2120,81,6,"CCYY Position 3 & 4 Transposed, I assume that would look to see for -- for example, if 89 has been mistyped as 98.  Is that -- would that be an example of that?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
613,2124,81,10,Yeah.  So that would get a Y in that column.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
614,2125,81,11,"Sure. And then Birth Date Estimated Condition, do you know what that is?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
615,2128,81,14,"So I know, generally, that this is -- this column is asking, Is this an estimated birth date?  But to satisfy an estimated birth date -- like to say, Yes, it is estimated -- I don't know what the logic is for that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
616,2133,81,19,"Okay.  Then Month Match, I assume, it's looking at whether or not the month matches?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
617,2135,81,21,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
618,2136,81,22,And the same for Day Match?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
619,2137,81,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
620,2138,81,24,"Okay.  Now, I'm going to again show you two exhibits previously labeled as Exhibit 24 and 25.  I'm showing you two because these are the -- both labeled Disqualification tables. And my question was going to be which -- which one is currently in use.  Again, if you want me to flip you back and forth between the Exhibits 24 and 25, tell me, and I'll be happy to do so.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
621,2147,82,7,Okay.  Let me look at 25 real quick.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
622,2148,82,8,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
623,2149,82,9,That's the one I'm on?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
624,2150,82,10,Yeah.  You're on 25.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
625,2151,82,11,Yeah.  I'm -- I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to an answer on which one is used right now.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
626,2154,82,14,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
627,2155,82,15,I'm not seeing a big difference other than the highlighted row in -- or highlighted column in row 25.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
628,2158,82,18,Yeah.  Okay. So let's -- let's just take a look at Exhibit 25?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
629,2161,82,21,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
630,2162,82,22,"On -- so you should have that in front of you.  And can you just tell me -- so I -- in your -- in your general overview of these, the match logic, after the qualification steps, there comes the disqualification step, which I assume had had to do with this disqualification table. But can you give me a general sense of how disqualification works and what it is?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
631,2171,83,5,"Yeah.  So disqualification is only invoked for records that make it out of qualification.  And then similar to the qualification tables, it looks at the values that have already been assigned to these various column headers and to see if it satisfies a row on the disqualification table. And if a row on the disqualification table is satisfied by the values that have already been assigned, it is disqualified, and the record does not proceed to the next step.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
632,2181,83,15,"Got it. I see.  So, for example, in row 1 in the Disqualification table, if the SSN is 99, which is not a match, then that record is disqualified. Is that fair to say?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
633,2186,83,20,It's got to -- it's got to satisfy all of the values in all of row 1.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
634,2188,83,22,Okay.  So the Social Security number is not a match.  The middle-to-middle comparison is not an alpha match.  There's no name reversal.  There's no middle-first use.  Then that record is disqualified. Is that fair?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
635,2194,84,2,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
636,2195,84,3,"Okay.  So let's just go through these and just make sure I understand the columns, and then we can -- we can move through this. So before I -- before we do the columns, let's take a look.  So it looks like there's a -- a combination of values on this table.  There are -- in some columns, you're looking at levels.  In some columns, you're looking at these, you know, Ys and Ps. Is that accurate?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
637,2204,84,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
638,2205,84,13,"So while you're looking at levels, is it fair to say you referred to the relevant table and you figure out what that level means?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
639,2208,84,16,"Yes.  I believe that's correct, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
640,2209,84,17,"So, for example, for row 15 in the Disqualification table, so I wanted to know what, you know, what SSN level 1 was, I should look at the SSN table and figure out what level 1 means. Is that fair?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
641,2214,84,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
642,2215,84,23,"And the same for the Address level table.  If I want to know -- if I'm looking at row 25 and I want to know what address level 9 is, I should look at the address table and see what level 9 is?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
643,2220,85,2,That's correct.  Although those levels and ranks tables aren't exactly descriptive on what a level 9 might be or is in a specific case.  Right?  There are different criteria that can be satisfied for a level 9.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
644,2224,85,6,"Sure.  Thank you for clarifying that.  Sorry for speaking over you. And then on -- for some of these other columns, we're back to the Ns and Ps and Ys.  So -- and it looks like -- where it looks like -- for example, under First-First, that looks pretty similar to the Name Match table. And would it then be fair to say that the N in the First-First block of columns means the same thing as the N on the Name Match table?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
645,2234,85,16,"Yeah, I think that's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
646,2235,85,17,And the same as the P and the Y and so on?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
647,2236,85,18,"Yeah, I think that's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
648,2237,85,19,"Okay.  And then I understand most of this, then. At the bottom of this page -- at the bottom of page 255, there are a number of inactive rows.  Can you explain to me what those are?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
649,2242,85,24,I cannot.  I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
650,2243,85,25,Okay.  That is okay. So on -- it looks like most of these columns are already columns we discussed in the name matching table or date of birth table.  But let's take a look at the -- I think one thing -- one column we haven't discussed is the generational suffix. Can you explain to me what that is?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
651,2251,86,7,"So the gen suffix is -- it's like junior, senior, that type of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
652,2253,86,9,Okay.  And it looks like there are a couple of different values there.  There's an N and then an I1. Do you know what an I1 is for -- in that context?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
653,2258,86,14,I do not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
654,2259,86,15,Okay.  But N would mean there's no generational suffix match?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
655,2261,86,17,Yeah.  The gen suffix between the two are nonmatching.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
656,2263,86,19,"Sure. So after enrichment and after the scoop of the records and then after the qualification and the disqualification, you mentioned that there were some additional steps that were taken to -- before a record is, you know, added to a report. Can you tell me about those?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
657,2271,87,1,"Yep.  So we have -- after disqualification, we have two steps of what we call compliance filters. And there are some national FCRA filters and some specific statewide filters that we've implemented.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
658,2275,87,5,Okay.  And you -- are you able to list those as you sit here today?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
659,2277,87,7,I am not able to list them exhaustively.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
660,2278,87,8,Sure. Are you able to give me an example of one or two?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
661,2281,87,11,An example of an FCRA filter would be no nonconviction records over seven years of age.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
662,2283,87,13,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
663,2284,87,14,An example of a statewide filter would be no nonconvictions regardless of age.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
664,2286,87,16,"And that might be, for example, in California?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
665,2288,87,18,It might be.  I can't remember.  I think there are a couple of states.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
666,2290,87,20,Okay.  Is -- is there a list of those compliance filters written down somewhere?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
667,2292,87,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
668,2293,87,23,"Okay.  If you were asking someone to email it to you, would you just say, Email me the list of compliance filters, or would you refer to it in some different way?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
669,2298,88,2,"I'd refer to both sets, because I think they're -- I don't know.  They are probably written down somewhere together.  But I think I know of them in two different places separately, national FCRA filters and statewide filters.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
670,2303,88,7,Got it. Okay.  I'd like to show you a document that -- sorry -- that has previously been marked as Exhibit 31.  And this has to do with -- do you know what this type of document is?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
671,2308,88,12,"Yes.  This is -- this looks like XML, to me. I can't say definitively that it is, but it looks like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
672,2311,88,15,Sure. Do you know what this XML document is?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
673,2313,88,17,"Yeah, I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
674,2314,88,18,"I mean, is this similar to the type of thing that comes out of the database you manage after all the steps we've talked about?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
675,2317,88,21,It looks like this is -- this is more akin to something that comes out of one of TURSS's products and is sent to a partner that integrates with us technically.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
676,2321,88,25,Got it. Let's talk -- we have a few more things to discuss.  I want to talk more about changes made to -- to the procedures that you all receive.  We talked a little bit about the champion-challenger process. Have you run a champion-challenger process in the time that you've been in your current position?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
677,2329,89,7,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
678,2330,89,8,Okay.  Have you taken part of that process in your -- in your prior roles?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
679,2332,89,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
680,2333,89,11,Okay.  Would you say you're familiar with how it works?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
681,2335,89,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
682,2336,89,14,Okay.  And when was the last time you remember taking part in the champion-challenger process?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
683,2339,89,17,Yeah.  It would have been early this year.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
684,2340,89,18,Okay.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
685,2341,89,19,But I don't know.  Since -- between now and March of this year.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
686,2343,89,21,Okay.  And do you remember what the proposed change was?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
687,2345,89,23,Not off the top of my head.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
688,2346,89,24,Okay.  Have you ever -- are you ever aware of a champion-challenger that was run -- that had to do with all the use of the age variable in the -- in the database or the match logic?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
689,2351,90,3,You're referring to the age that we looked at a few exhibits ago and from the database?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
690,2353,90,5,Yes.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
691,2354,90,6,I am not aware of a champion-challenger regarding that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
692,2356,90,8,"Okay.  And when a champion-challenger is run, what kind of documentation is produced?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
693,2358,90,10,"We produce an impact analysis.  The one that we -- that we present to our in-house counsel, as well as executive leadership, looks at the impact that the change had both on our false-positives and our missed records.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
694,2363,90,15,Okay.  And tell me -- tell me a little bit about how those conclusions are reached. What do you do to determine how the -- how the proposed change would impact false-positives and the missed records?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
695,2368,90,20,So we look at samples.  It's a sampling analysis between -- we look at samples of all the variances.  So where the champion returned records and the challenger didn't and vice versa.  And there are different iterations of that.  We look at records and confirm whether or not they match the consumer by calling courts or sending court runners or things like that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
696,2377,91,3,Okay.  So would it be fair to call it a manual review process?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
697,2379,91,5,It's a manual review of sample data.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
698,2380,91,6,Okay.  So how big is the sample?  Is there a standard size to this business process?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
699,2382,91,8,"The sampling is always at 30 or all of them, whichever is less.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
700,2384,91,10,Sorry.  30 what?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
701,2385,91,11,"Yeah.  So this is the sample. So like I said, champion returned records and challenger didn't.  We would look at 30 cases of when that happened and figure out if that result is good or bad.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
702,2390,91,16,"I see. So I guess that's helpful, but my question was a little broader. So when you run the champion process and the challenger process, how many records do you run -- those prophecy done before you do this review?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
703,2396,91,22,"We don't look at a specific number of records.  With the last champion-challenger, for example, we ran a hundred thousand applicants.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
704,2399,91,25,"Okay.  By the way, every champion-challenger doesn't necessarily run with that -- a number?  You might change it depending on the process?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
705,2403,92,3,"Yeah.  I mean, I think that's our general -- that's our general number.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
706,2405,92,5,"Okay.  So you chose a hundred thousand records -- or applicants.  You run the champion on those hundred thousand, you run the challenger on those hundred thousand, and then you look at where those -- the results are different? Is that a fair characterization of it?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
707,2411,92,11,"Yeah.  We categorize the differences, and then we -- we manually review samples of the differences.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
708,2414,92,14,"Got it. And that's where we said you either do -- you manually review either 30 or -- 30 of the differences or all of them, whichever is fewer?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
709,2418,92,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
710,2419,92,19,"Got it. And then after that manual review process you produce -- which you called, I think, an impact statement, which then goes to the higher-ups would then make the ultimate decision as to whether the change would be adopted?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
711,2425,92,25,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
712,2427,93,1,"Okay.  How often do you think the -- would you estimate the champion-challenger process is run, say, every year?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
713,2430,93,4,Can you say the last word again?  Sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
714,2431,93,5,"Every year. For example, how many champion-challengers would you expect to run over the course of the year?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
715,2434,93,8,"Yeah.  I mean, we don't -- I don't know.  We run them when there's changes either that we want to make or that we're asked to make or something like that.  So I think, if I had to guess an average, it would be two to four times a year.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
716,2439,93,13,Got it. Can you characterize the types of changes that lead to this champion-challenger process?,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
717,2442,93,16,I can give some examples.  I don't know if they'll be exhaustive.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
718,2444,93,18,Yeah.  Examples would be great.,q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
719,2445,93,19,"But any time we want to change the match logic, the champion-challenger must be run.  If we were to bring in a new criminal or eviction data provider, the champion-challenger must be run.  Those are the two biggest examples I can think of.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
720,2450,93,24,"Got it. And when you say ""change the match logic,"" would any change to any of the tables we looked at today trigger a champion-challenger?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
721,2455,94,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

And we track those over time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
726,2471,94,19,"Okay.  And if -- if you saw a significant change in the type of dispute, it's going to say spike in a separate dispute like that lead to a proposed change in the match logic and the champion-challenger?",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer

And I just realize that I did not ask you about the final column on this.  It says, Name Ranks and Levels Table [sic], which is a little different from the other ones. The -- in the middle of the comparison, there's a column called Alpha Match, which I realize is not part of the other comparisons. Do you know what an ""alpha match"" is in that context.",q,MR. HASHMALL,start_answer
748,2534,97,4,"It's -- it's still just middle-to-middle comparison.  Alpha match is just a little bit different than name matching.  I don't know that I could succinctly -- I don't think I could explain the differences.  They are very similar, though.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

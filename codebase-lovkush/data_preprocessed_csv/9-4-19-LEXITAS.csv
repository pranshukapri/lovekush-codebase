30,176,19,23,Yes I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,177,19,24,"Could you describe that history for the Judge, please?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
32,180,20,2,"Sure.  She said that about 15 months earlier, so July 8th, 2017, she was involved in an accident.  She said that she was a restaurant manager, and she was walking between rooms when she slipped on a rug and fell onto her right side.  She said that she hit her head and her shoulder, and then landed on her butt. She said that she blacked out for a brief period of time, meaning that she had lost consciousness.  She reported that when she came to, she was sort of helped up by coworkers and was taken to an Urgent Care center.  She thought at that time that she was suffering from headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and imbalance. She said she was diagnosed as having a concussion and was sent to a concussion specialist, who then sent her for different modalities of treatment, and she was given different medications for the symptoms that she had. In addition, she said that she had musculoskeletal injuries on top of her concussion.  She went to the Einstein Neuroscience Center where she was evaluated by a psychiatrist.  She was evaluated by an another concussion specialist and again received more types of therapy.  She said that after her fall, she began to experience headaches. She said that she really didn't have a significant history of headaches, and after her fall, she developed headaches which had not improved at all.  So, in the 15 months between her accident and me seeing her, her headaches had not improved. She said that with the headaches, she can experience symptoms like nausea, and that bright lights and loud noises bother her. She also reported that following her injury, she had imbalance, and her imbalance had only improved about 30 percent. Next she said that she had cognitive problems, so she had difficulty with her memory, maintaining her attention, concentration, and up to ten times a day, she would completely forget what she was doing.  Unusually, she reported that her cognition was actually getting worse.  I asked her if she had received any sort of formal cognitive or neuropsychological evaluation or therapy, and she didn't think that she had had any. I asked her, you know, did she think it was unusual that some of her symptoms were actually getting worse, and she said that she didn't really have an explanation for why that would occur.  She knew concussions typically get better, and she had said usually more on the sooner side than the later side.  But now, here we were 15 months out, and her memory and cognition were getting worse.  And, again, she couldn't explain sort of that inconsistency. She also reported that she developed tinnitus or ringing in her ears, and she said that too had been getting worse.  Again, there was no explanation how that could be getting worse, and she hadn't been evaluated by an ears, nose and throat doctor. I had asked her if she had been involved in any other accidents, and she said that when she was 14, she got thrown off of a horse, hit her head and had a concussion for about three months.  And in 1986, she had a car accident, and while she did hit her face, she didn't think she had a concussion at that time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,265,23,12,Did she tell you about any other more recent injuries besides this work injury?,q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
34,268,23,15,"No, she did not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,269,23,16,Did you receive any sort of past surgical history?,q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
36,271,23,18,"Yes.  So from a medical perspective, she said that she didn't have any long medical problems, but that she had had two surgeries.  One was an appendectomy, and the other was back surgery to her lumbar spine in 1993.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,277,23,24,Did you receive a social history?,q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
38,279,24,1,"Yes.  She said that she was single and had one child.  She denied any history of drinking, smoking or drug use, and she had not returned to work in those 15 months.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,284,24,6,"On October 3rd, 2018, did you perform a physical examination?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
40,286,24,8,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,287,24,9,"Could you describe that for the Judge, please?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
42,289,24,11,"Sure.  So the whole purpose of a neurologic evaluation is to assess the brain, the spine and the nerves, so we evaluate someone's cognition.  While we don't do a formal neuropsychological evaluation, there's obviously not enough time.  We assess someone's thinking, their language. Next we move on to the cranial nerve examination where we evaluate the nerves that control your vision, your eye movements, your facial movements, the movement of your mouth and tongue. Next we go on to a motor examination where we evaluate someone's power, the strength in their arms and legs. We do a sensory examination where we look at the sensation to different modalities like touch and temperature, vibration. Next we check someone's ability to move their arms and legs in a coordinated fashion.  We have someone walk, and we evaluate their gait.  And then we finish up with the reflexes.  We take good old reflex hammer and check the reflexes in the arms and legs, and her evaluation was pretty unremarkable.  There's no evidence on her exam that she had any injury to her brain or spine, or nerves.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,319,25,16,"As part of your evaluation, did you have records available for your review?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer

88,406,29,3,"That was normal.  There was a single white spot, which is normal.  As an individual ages, it's what we would consider an incidental finding of no significance, not related to trauma, and asymptomatic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

92,423,29,20,"So she initially presented, you know, after her accident, and at that time, they were the first doctors that evaluated her.  She denied any loss of consciousness. She denied any cognitive problems like trouble with her memory.  She said that she fell and hit her head, and had dizziness, nausea and imbalance. They did a review of systems where they asked her a lot of other question, and it was normal.  And her examination was normal.  Again, those are the first doctors that she sees, and she's denying at that time any loss of consciousness or cognitive issues.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

100,474,31,21,Okay.  Thank you.,side_chat,MR. KENNY,start_question
101,477,31,24,"Doctor, what did you glean upon your review of the report from Jefferson Concussion Center from September 11th, 2017?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
102,482,32,4,"So that was another report in which she documented that there was no loss of consciousness, and that she did have these symptoms of headache, nausea and ringing in her ears.  And that, otherwise, her history and exam were benign.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,488,32,10,What did you glean upon your review of the records available from Princeton Brain and Spine?,q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
104,491,32,13,"So they had been treating her for some time for chronic pain dating back to a motor vehicle accident that occurred in what they said was 2003.  They said that she was involved in this accident, and that she, again, initially reported that she did not loss consciousness.  And that she had numerous subjective complaints such as headaches; bright lights and loud noises bothered her; memory loss and dizziness. She was receiving different modalities of therapy, and then later in other records, it reported that she had a history of not only chronic pain, but she had a history of migraine headaches.  She had a history of multiple mood issues including depression.  She had posttraumatic stress disorder. And, then, now her story was changing, and she said she did loss consciousness.  So in realtime, it appeared the medical records documented that initially, she said she did not lose consciousness, did not have any cognitive issues.  Then, with time, it was unclear if she lost consciousness, and now she's saying she did lose consciousness. She also had the history of prior drug abuse, which she had denied to me, and she had a history of numerous psychosocial stressors in her life.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,523,33,20,What did you glean upon your review of the records from Mid Atlantic Concussion Alliance?,q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
106,526,33,23,"So they evaluated her for approximately one year, and those medical records were interesting in that many of her symptoms in those records were documented as continually improving as they saw her.  And some of the symptoms that she reported had actually resolved, when she told me that really nothing was improving. I think the only thing that she told me that was a little bit better was her imbalance, but her headaches had not improved.  Her cognitive dysfunction was actually getting worse, and the ringing in her ears were getting worse. Those medical records also indicated that she was receiving different types of medications for treatment and different modalities of therapy, and, you know, they were also using very, sort of, crude tests for cognitive functioning, what's called an ""Impact Test.""  If someone really is worried about someone's cognition, often they'll be sent for a formal neuropsychological evaluation and have formal cognitive therapy.  Impact testing is really just sort of a screen typically used for individuals who play sports.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

116,581,36,3,"And what did you glean concerning just the history portion of the records from June 20, 2018?  What was Claimant reporting in terms of her activity level to Dr. Watanabe at that point in time?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
117,586,36,8,"She reported that she was getting a lot of sleep, between seven and seven-and-a-half hours of sleep, without interruption, and that she was waking up feeling well rested.  She said that she was active, you know, cooking, walking her dogs, doing yard work, and she said that she was cleaning her grandmother's house out.  And she was active again, going to stores, cooking, going to Doctor's appointments. She said that she had recently visited her family in California and was considering moving there long-term in what she considered about six months from that point.  She was, again, fixing up her grandmothers house because she was planning on selling it and, again, moving from Philadelphia to California.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,606,37,3,"Doctor, based upon the history that you received from Ms. Daccardi, your review of records, the MRI of the brain, your examination from October 3rd, 2018, can you tell the Judge what was your diagnosis?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
119,612,37,9,"My diagnosis was that, you know, if she indeed fell and hit her head, whether she did or didn't lose consciousness, it was certainly possible that she had a concussion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,617,37,14,"Did you have an opinion as of October 3rd, 2018, to within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, as to whether she had fully recovered from the concussion sustained at work in July of 2017?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
121,622,37,19,Yes.  I did think she recovered fully.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,624,37,21,Do you have an opinion as to whether she had any ongoing work restrictions relative to her head injury from July of 2017?,q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
123,629,38,1,"No.  I don't think she required any testing or treatment, or had any restrictions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

125,635,38,7,No more treatment.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,636,38,8,"Briefly, for the Judge, just explain why was it your opinion that she had fully recovered from any concussion sustained from this work accident?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
127,640,38,12,"Well, to begin with, a concussion is like the vast majority of traumatic injuries which gradually improve with time. She's an individual who literally slipped and fell, and hit her head at work.  We know that these types of concussions improve.  Just like an ankle sprain over a short period of time, some people get better within a few days, and some people, it takes a few weeks, maybe a few months. But certainly at 16 months, the natural history of a concussion is that she would be better. In addition, all of the testing that she had was objectively normal, and her physical examination was completely normal. Next, all of the medical records sort of documented that her condition, as we would expect, was not only slowly improving, but her activity level was one that you would expect in an individual who had recovered.  She was performing all of her, what we call, activities of daily living.  She's washing, dressing, cooking, cleaning, managing her finances, driving, going to doctors appointments.  Not only that, she's probably being more active than most people.  She's cleaning her grandmother's home.  She's planning to move to California. So, it was my opinion that, you know, she had fully recovered, and no more testing or treatment was needed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

131,684,40,6,"Well, there's a record from August 21st of 2018 which reported that she had met her cognitive goals, and that she had had strategies to manage her symptoms.  And that she had improved and was able to handle any sort of stress and challenges that would come her way, and she was given resources for her to, essentially, return to work.  And that they didn't think that additional treatment was indicated.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

133,697,40,19,"No.  It just further supported the fact that the people who were treating her felt like she was making improvements, and she didn't require additional treatment. And she could go back to sort of being active.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

138,711,41,8,"And in terms of the history she provided Dr. Watanabe on March 6th of 2019, what did you glean upon review of the history in terms of her activity level?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
139,716,41,13,"So this report indicated that there were numerous other inconsistencies regarding what she told me and what was documented in many of her other medical records.  And, then, in this medical record, first he reported that she had a history of significant migraines.  She reported to me that there was no significant history of headaches, and she actually indicated that the headaches she was experiencing now were nowhere near as severe as the headaches she had had with her migraines in the past. She also indicated that she had a history of multiple concussions when, with me, she reported that she had only had one concussion.  With me, again, she had said that she was sort of blacked out for a short period of time, and, again, she had told many other doctors that she didn't lose consciousness.  She told this doctor that she had lost consciousness for 45 seconds.  That is a long time to be out cold. And then she reported that she actually drove to the Urgent Care center. She had told me that she required -- she was basically taken to the Urgent Care center.  You know, if an individual has head trauma and loses consciousness for 45 seconds, it would be extremely unusual for that person to drive themselves to the emergency room or an Urgent Care center. Next, he reported sort of this back history of her having been abused as a child, and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

141,760,43,7,"Sure.  He had mentioned the horse injury that I had talked about, and that was sort of the beginning of her chronic pain requiring her to be on chronic pain medications.  This also indicated that she had been involved in a severe car accident in which her vehicle rolled over. Finally, the records indicated that her pain was actually doing much better.  She reported that her pain was well controlled, and she was weaning off a lot of her medications.  She said that she was still getting pain medications from a Dr. Amann who she had only seen once, but was sending multiple pain medications to her home, and she was, basically, stockpiling different boxes of medications like Gabapentin, which is a pain medication, Baclofen, which is a muscle relaxant, different types of patches and creams. The medical records also indicated that she was doing better with her memory and her cognition, and she had recently been on a vacation.  She was reluctant to try certain medications that had been prescribed to her because she was concerned that they would have an impact on her sexual drive. And then she also reported that she was going back and forth to California every few months, and she was hoping that she would move there once she was more financially stable.  And that she was involved in a Workman's Compensation case, and that she wanted that to settle.  She noted that she had already had a job set up in San Diego for once she was able to move to California. And, then, last she said that she had a new relationship with someone in Colorado, and she had traveled to Colorado as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,805,45,2,"And I just want to be clear, because you indicated a moment ago that she wanted her Workers' Compensation case to settle, but could you read the actual words from the history portion of the report because I want to make sure the right context is in the record?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
143,812,45,9,"Sure.  ""She reports she has been traveling to and from California every few months to be with her -- but ultimately hopes to be able to move there once she is able to do so financially and once her Workman's Comp case has settled, noting that she has a job already lined up in an office setting in San Diego.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

145,825,45,22,"No.  And, again, like I said, with the other records, it just gives sort of more evidence that she indeed probably has recovered.  She is extremely active.  She's traveling.  She's doing all these things. She has a job already t'd up.  Obviously an individual who is having cognitive complaints and physical complaints that she believes limits her ability to work would not have sought a job and have a job lined up in the coming months. His report also indicated that under, later, his assessment and plan, when it says she has a history of concussion, he reported that he suspected that her residual postconcussive symptoms are probably more related to her mood.  And, again, that would agree with what I'm saying, that I think she's fully recovered from her concussion, and that's no longer an issue.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

241,1094,56,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

245,1100,56,22,Just the report.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,1101,56,23,"Okay.  And you would agree, Doctor, as a neurologist, that you can have a normal MRI of the brain, and you can have a normal clinical neurologic examination, and still suffer from postconcussion syndrome and posttraumatic headaches; is that correct?",q,MR. KENNY,start_answer
247,1109,57,6,"That is correct, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
248,1110,57,7,"Now, you wrote in your report that you felt that -- I don't want to -- it's your opinion that ""almost all people recover from concussions in two to four months of treatment, and beyond that is excessive.""  You document that in your report, correct?",q,MR. KENNY,start_answer
249,1117,57,14,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,1118,57,15,Okay.  You actually make the analogy that it's similar to recovering from a right ankle sprain; is that correct?,q,MR. KENNY,start_answer

253,1126,57,23,"Well, I think what I'm referring to is in this case.  There's obviously different types of concussions people have, and there's different histories people have. So if someone were to fall off a building 50 feet from the air and hit their head, that's considered a traumatic brain injury.  And if someone were to be on a motor cycle and be ejected at 70 miles an lower, hit a tree, that could also be a traumatic brain injury and a concussion. So there's different degrees of everything.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,1141,58,13,Okay.,q,MR. KENNY,start_answer
255,1142,58,14,"When someone slips and falls, and hits their head on the ground, that type of concussion is certainly what we would consider self-limited, and, again, recovery would be expected in a few weeks to months. The analogy with the ankle is right if I'm playing basketball, and I twist my ankle, it would get better in a short period of time.  If I jumped off a building and broke my ankle, and fractured it into 20 different pieces, that would obviously be different, and the recovery would be longer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
256,1157,59,4,"Okay.  And you've obvious treated patients who had concussions and posttraumatic concussions that last four months, correct, depending on the circumstances?",q,MR. KENNY,start_answer
257,1162,59,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
258,1163,59,10,"Okay.  And as you stated, it's expected, but it's really patient-specific how they recover; is that a fair statement?",q,MR. KENNY,start_answer
259,1166,59,13,"Yes, again, within a reasonable amount of time.  I mean, I see people all the time who are referred to me because their stories don't make sense to either their primary care doctor or a rehab doctor, or a sports medicine doctor, or an orthopedic doctor; people who have had concussive symptoms for longer than what would be expected and coming to me for a second opinion because the story doesn't make any sense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,1177,59,24,"Now, you went in detail through the medical records that you reviewed, and I'm just going to briefly go over a few things.  You talked about the Express Narberth records that are listed on Page 5?",q,MR. KENNY,start_answer

300,1264,63,11,"On cross, you went into this discussion about analogies between head injuries and ankle injuries.  Were your opinion concerning that some sort of consideration of the mechanism of injury that Ms. Daccardi had; is that what you were trying to explain?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer

Posttraumatic headaches was mentioned on cross, and traumatic brain injury was mentioned on cross.  Did you assign either of those diagnoses to her work incident in this case?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
303,1281,64,3,"No.  Although, by medical definition, a concussion is often used synonymously with a mild traumatic brain injury, so those are essentially the same thing.

That's different than someone who had a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury, which we are not talking about here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

The words in medicine are the same with all types of guidelines. Concussion and mild traumatic brain injury are the same thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,1304,65,1,"If we were to assume that the Judge were to find in this case that she did have a mild traumatic brain injury with respect to this date of injury, do you have an opinion based on the information you had available to you in October of 2018 as to whether she had fully recovered at that point in time from any mild traumatic brain injury sustained?",q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
307,1313,65,10,"Definitely recovered, yes.  Same exactly thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,1315,65,12,Did you assign any posttraumatic headache diagnosis to this incident?,q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer
309,1317,65,14,"No.  So now we're just getting into language, but if someone hits their head and has headaches, usually you call that a posttraumatic headache.  If they have a concussion with headaches, usually the headaches fall under the concussion umbrella, so usually you don't say it's a posttraumatic headache.  But, again, we're just sort of splitting hairs here. You could also say that, you know, headaches are a part of concussion, so I think she recovered from all of those things.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
310,1331,66,3,And is that opinion to within a reason a reasonable degree of medical certainty?,q,MR. BUCILLA,start_answer

99,450,17,21,Okay.  Can you describe what that obligation was?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
100,452,17,23,"The obligation would be governed under the IDE process.

107,475,18,20,I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

113,492,19,11,"The best of my knowledge is an IDE study is undertaken to -- from a clinical study perspective that is part of then a submission to the FDA, it's part of the data that goes into the FDA in terms of seeking approval for that device to market it.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
114,499,19,18,Okay.,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_question

118,510,20,3,Okay.,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_question
119,512,20,5,So let's say that there was an IDE for a device first.  Do you understand?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
120,514,20,7,Yup.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,515,20,8,Okay.  And then a supplemental PMA is submitted.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
122,517,20,10,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

127,529,20,22,Sorry?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer

129,535,21,2,I'm talking about the time period between when the supplemental PMA is submitted and when it is approved by the FDA.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
130,538,21,5,"So I will tell you the answer to that is the 803 regulations would not kick in until approval, so that gap period would not require MDR reporting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,542,21,9,Okay.  And I'm -- okay.  Understood.  Thank you. And are there any other rules and regulations that apply during that dependency of the supplemental PMA?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat

142,574,22,15,I don't know for certain.  My estimate -- best estimation would be they probably would have.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,577,22,18,Probably would have what?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
144,578,22,19,"The implants would have -- outside the U.S., would have been occurring prior to our submission to the FDA.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,581,22,22,Okay.  I'm going to represent to you that the implants took place after the supplemental PMA was submitted.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
146,584,22,25,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,586,23,1,"So my question is:  What were the requirements in terms of reporting on those events that occurred in those implants outside of the United States while the supplemental PMA was pending, but before it was approved by the FDA?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
148,592,23,7,Is your question relative to clinical reporting obligations or post market reporting obligations?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,595,23,10,"Well, let's take both.",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
150,596,23,11,"Okay.  So the question again is post supplement to the FDA, but -- I want -- I'm sorry, you've asked a lot of pre and post.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

155,604,23,19,-- and to aid you in answering the questions. So the supplemental PMA for the Cognis and Teligen devices were -- I'll represent that that was submitted to the FDA in December of 2007.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
156,609,23,24,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,610,23,25,And I'll further represent that doctors began implanting the Cognis and Teligen devices in patients outside the United States in February of 2008.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
158,615,24,4,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,616,24,5,"And then I will finally represent that the FDA approved the supplemental PMA for the Cognis and Teligen devices in -- on -- on or about May 8th, 2008.",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
160,620,24,9,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

162,625,24,14,Okay.  I'll answer from an MDR first --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,626,24,15,Okay.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
164,627,24,16,-- because it's probably easier for me.  The MDR 803 rules do not apply until a device is marketed or approved.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,630,24,19,Okay.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
166,631,24,20,"So if you're telling me the approval was in May of 2008, it would have been upon approval that at that time we would have began reporting for an MDR.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,635,24,24,Okay.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer

198,704,27,15,"Is the regulations are not black and white, and our analysts are forced every day to make judgment and exercise based on their interpretation of the regulation.  We have procedures that do the best we can to make that as easy for them so there isn't ambiguity.  And my interpretation here would be there was something that we identified that wasn't as clearly documented as we could have made it, so the action was to go back and try and remove that ambiguity to make it clearer, our interpretation of the regulations, so that our analysts could appropriately report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

235,822,32,3,-- and then I will answer.,a,THE WITNESS,is brackets
236,823,32,4,"(Reviews document.) Okay.  So at one point in time the -- our interpretation of the FDA regulations related to similar was not as broad as we ultimately made it, meaning it had to be more specific. The regulations don't tell you the definition of similar, so our interpretation at the time was more limited such that when that COGENT 4 study was taking place, it did not meet the definition of similar at that time, so we were not filing MDRs. What this is saying is based on learning from that deep dive, which I believe came through some feedback that we got from FDA on another site within the Boston Scientific family, but not within the CRM or the management division, we took and listened to that feedback and figured out we -- we should be looking at how do we apply it within CRM. It's important to note we were under different quality systems at the time, so what's referred to here as legacy BSC would have been different from cardiac rhythm management.  So what it's saying here is we took the feedback that we received, that we just talked about at a QSAT meeting, and we ultimately updated our procedures to define the definition of similar device.",brackets,,start_question
237,854,33,9,"Okay.  And is this meaning that if a -- if Boston Scientific has a defibrillator device and it's -- it might still be under an IDE, but there's an adverse event that happens, does this mean that an MDR should be filed for that event?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat

244,874,34,3,"I would go back -- yes, but let me go back one step earlier.  It -- the definition of -- it's not as broad as saying a defibrillator. It had to be of the same product code. There's an FDA pro code that's assigned by the FDA, and that is how we like -- put like categories together and that's how we met the definition of similar. So if you -- if your question is if it met the definition of similar, meaning it had the same pro code, and we walked an MDR decision tree and we got to a decision that yes, it should be reported, yes, it would be reported as an MDR.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

256,921,35,24,"So a pro code -- once it's approved, a pro code is assigned by the FDA and there is a database within the FDA that, I believe when you submit your registration, the pro code is part of that process, so we then as a manufacturer know what pro code to use when we do submit MDRs.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

261,938,36,15,Correct.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
262,939,36,16,"Okay.  Let me read it.  (Reviews document.) Okay.  So it's saying that we did this deep dive, again, as I mentioned learning from feedback -- from FDA from different parts of Boston Scientific, we looked internally within our CRM process and we identified we were not filing MDRs on Cognis/Teligen that were part of COGENT 4. And as I stated earlier, at the time we did not have the definition of similar in place, so it was therefore not applied.  And the rationale I'm stating here is we viewed Cognis/Teligen as a different platform and, therefore, not similar, meaning we weren't using pro code as our basis for similar.  The quality system assurance team agreed with that. We aligned to make the interpretation change on a go-forward basis, so we decided not to go back and file MDRs, but we update our procedures on a go-forward to align with that pro code classification. And that's very consistent with any change in interpretation that we have with regulations, we will make them, very typically, on a go-forward basis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,966,37,17,Can you explain why?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
264,967,37,18,"Well, as I stated earlier, regulations are not black and white, so interpretation of those regulations is always evolving as we learn more.  So unless we viewed it as a -- a nonconformance where we clearly identified we -- we did not follow the regulation, but rather we evolved our understanding of the regulation, that's on a go-forward basis. There's -- it's very difficult to -- there's -- there's not a line in the sand black and white.  There is a continual evolution of interpretation.  And so when we make those changes, we make them going forward.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

We also get devices back that we do testing on, but those devices don't always come back within the 30-day window. So because of the volume, FDA granted a larger period of time for pacemaker and defibrillators in this case to allow us to be able to submit report, hopefully having the majority of the information as opposed to filing multiple supplemental reports.

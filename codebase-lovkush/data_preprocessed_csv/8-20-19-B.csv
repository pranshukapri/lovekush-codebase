54,283,12,6,During the 2007 to 2009 time frame we were part of the IT department.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,285,12,8,"Okay.  So if you can start just from a very big picture, generally speaking, how did Boston Scientific, during this time period, maintain information about adverse events that happened with its devices?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
56,290,12,13,So my understanding is that Boston Scientific leveraged either the RET system or the Lighthouse system to manage and summarize adverse events.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,294,12,17,Okay.  And what was the RET system?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
58,295,12,18,"The RET system was a quality system that ran, I think from '96 was the start date of it through 2008, October of 2008, and that system contained all of the event summaries and also all of the MDR medical device reports, the 3500A data as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

61,307,13,4,I don't have an understanding specifically why they moved from one system to the other.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
62,311,13,8,Did Lighthouse have the same function as the RET system?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
63,313,13,10,My understanding is it has very similar functionality.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
64,315,13,12,Did it also contain the event summaries of adverse events and the Form 3500As?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
65,317,13,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
66,318,13,15,Okay.  How would information get into the -- either RET system or the Lighthouse system?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
67,320,13,17,My understanding is that people in the quality team would enter that data into those systems.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,323,13,20,Okay.  And where would that information originate from?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
69,325,13,22,"You know, I'm not a hundred percent sure on that, when it comes to the business side of that transaction, just that data would be ingested into that system.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
70,330,14,1,Okay.  So there's a kind of a document called a Product Experience Report; is that right?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
71,332,14,3,Product Experience Report?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
72,333,14,4,Does that term mean anything to you?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer

74,335,14,6,"Okay.  What about technical services, does that term mean anything to you?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
75,337,14,8,Technical services is a department at formerly Guidant and now Boston Scientific.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,339,14,10,Okay.  And would technical services take in information about adverse events?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
77,341,14,12,I can't say with a hundred percent confidence that that's the case.  I -- I can't say with confidence that's the case.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,344,14,15,"Okay.  Do you know if a practicing physician experienced an adverse event and wanted to report it to Boston Scientific, what were the avenues by which that physician could do that?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat

83,362,15,7,"I have heard of a PI number, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,363,15,8,Okay.  So I'm trying to understand what information would be associated with each adverse event and would it be associated with a PI number.  Those are two different questions.  Why don't we start with the -- I guess the first one about the PI number. Maybe the answer -- I'll just reask the question and you can answer. Was there a certain PI number associated with each adverse event in either the RET system or the Lighthouse system?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
85,374,15,19,"You know, I can't say with a hundred percent confidence on that if that's the case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,376,15,21,"Okay.  And do you know outside of the event summaries and the Form 3500As what information, other information about every adverse event was housed in those two systems?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
87,382,16,1,Can you repeat that question?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,383,16,2,"Sure.  Outside of the event summaries and the Form 3500As, what information was associated with each adverse event in either the RET system of the Lighthouse system?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat

91,392,16,11,Okay.,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat

93,397,16,16,Okay.,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_question
94,399,16,18,"So if a call was placed to Boston Scientific to technical services, do you know whether that call would be recorded?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat

97,406,16,25,Okay.,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_question
98,409,17,2,"And do you, know would those calls then -- the -- strike that. Would those recordings then be associated with that adverse event in the RET system or the Lighthouse system?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
99,414,17,7,My understanding is those calls would be transcribed and associated back with those events.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,417,17,10,So would the recording of the call be associated with the event or not?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
101,419,17,12,You're saying the actual audio of that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,420,17,13,Yes.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
103,421,17,14,My understanding is just the transcribed data would be associated with it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,423,17,16,So the recording existed in some other database?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
105,425,17,18,The recording would have existed in the Merlin system for a period of time --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
106,427,17,20,Okay.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
107,428,17,21,-- and then it would have dropped off.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,429,17,22,Do you know how long it would have existed in the Merlin system?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
109,431,17,24,"So it depends on the time frame, but it's either a 90-day or a 2-year retention, but both of which -- well, I'll leave it at that. It's either a 90-day or a 2-year retention.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,436,18,3,"Okay.  And so in the 2007 to 2009 time frame, were there some events -- strike that. Were there some calls that were recorded on a 90-day basis and some recorded on a 2-year basis?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
111,441,18,8,"My understanding is that some of them, during that time frame, would have been held for the 2 years and some would have been held for 90 days based off of the policy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,445,18,12,Do you know what the policy is?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
113,446,18,13,It would have been the disaster recovery policy.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,448,18,15,Okay.  Do you know what -- strike that. Do you happen to know the number of that policy?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
115,451,18,18,"I do not, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,452,18,19,Okay.  Do you know why some call recordings were kept for 2 years and some kept for 90 days?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
117,455,18,22,I -- I -- I do not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,456,18,23,Okay.  Was it possible to have kept those calls from the Merlin database for longer than those time periods if someone had wanted to keep them for longer?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat

122,467,19,8,"Let's say that there was a patient who had a device implanted and there's an adverse event in which the patient died or had a serious injury, and before the call was deleted the patient, you know, had sued Boston Scientific.  Would it have been possible to keep that call recording if a litigation hold had been put into effect before the record was deleted?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer

124,480,19,21,"Yeah.  Well, no, I'm not asking specifically about the tape.  I'm asking about the information, the recorded audio.",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
125,483,19,24,"I mean, my understanding is that the -- the actual text from the calls was what was kept as the record as opposed to the audio, so I -- I'm not sure, I mean, I'd be speculating if I were to -- to guess on anything on that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,489,20,4,So you don't know whether or not it was possible to keep the recorded audio information?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
127,492,20,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
128,493,20,8,Okay.  Do you know who transcribed the calls?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
129,494,20,9,"I do not know whose function that was, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

135,506,20,21,"I do not, no.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,508,20,23,So did these transcriptions from technical services calls become part of the event summary for an adverse event?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
137,512,21,1,"Yeah, that's my understanding.  Yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,513,21,2,Do you know what other information was in the event summary?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
139,515,21,4,"You know, I don't have a list of the fields or an intimate understanding of that business process.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,518,21,7,Okay.  How long does the event summary information stay in the Lighthouse database?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
141,520,21,9,So the Lighthouse database is set without any auto purging.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,522,21,11,Okay.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
143,523,21,12,"However, those records are -- supposedly have a lifetime of 75 years.  So at some point in 75 years they could be deleted.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
144,526,21,15,Okay.  Do you know why the recorded audio information had a shorter retention time frame than the event summary information?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
145,529,21,18,"Again, my understanding is that the transcription of -- of that was the record as opposed to the audio portion of it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
146,532,21,21,"So I'm going to move to strike that answer, because that wasn't responsive to my question. I'm asking if you know the reason why the audio recording wasn't kept longer than the event summary information?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
147,539,22,2,I -- I do not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
148,540,22,3,Okay.  Are the -- strike that. What is the time period during which the Form 3500As are kept?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat

152,549,22,12,And so could we back up just -- when you say -- are you talking about the data associated with the Form 3500A or are you talking about the specific Form 3500A.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
153,554,22,17,I would like to know about both.,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat
154,556,22,19,Okay.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

156,561,22,24,Objection to form.,side_chat,MR. ROBINSON,start_chat
157,562,22,25,"So my understanding is that data that is populated into that Form 3500A comes from the Lighthouse system, comes from that database, and those data points that are in there would follow that retention schedule of no purging and potentially a 75-year retention schedule.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
158,570,23,7,Okay.,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_question
159,572,23,9,Does that process happen automatically or does somebody pull up the information in Lighthouse and then fill out a form either by hand or on the computer?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
160,576,23,13,So you're saying in order to create that --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

162,578,23,15,-- 3500A form?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

164,581,23,18,Objection to scope.,side_chat,MR. ROBINSON,start_chat
165,582,23,19,So my understanding with the Lighthouse system is that you can manually create that 3500 form individually where you can bring up a record and generate that specific form.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
166,587,23,24,Okay.,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_question
167,590,24,1,And then do you know what happens to that form once the data is populated?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
168,592,24,3,"Well, it -- it creates it, it takes about five to ten minutes for that PDF to be created per record.  It's individual, so you go through and you create it and then that is available for printing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,597,24,8,Okay.  Do you know whether copies of those PDFs were retained?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
170,599,24,10,My understanding is that they were not retained.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
171,601,24,12,Okay.  Do you know the process by which the Form 3500As were submitted to the FDA?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer

179,620,25,5,I'm just looking for a general description.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
180,621,25,6,"So my understanding is a project team was pulled together to manage that data migration and that, you know, ultimately they came up with a plan to migrate data fields from RET into Lighthouse.  And I -- my understanding is that there was -- were some differences in the way that Lighthouse handled the product issue tab, and so the product issues from RET, back then it was called an event summary, that that was brought across a little differently in the form of a text file, as there was not a like for like fields to bring across.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

216,718,28,25,Objection to form.,side_chat,MR. ROBINSON,start_chat

218,726,29,7,And is that what happened when a Form 3500A was submitted to the FDA?,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer

220,732,29,13,"So do you know what this -- strike that. I'm just -- let me explain my question.  I'm trying to understand what this would look like from the FDA's perspective receiving this. Would it be, you know, an e-mail with a hundred PDFs or would it be some sort of other file format?",q,MR. ELLERBE,start_answer
221,740,29,21,"My understanding is it's a batch file so, you know, similar to maybe a CSB file or an Excel spreadsheet that would have all the fields in there and then they would take that data and review that data.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
222,746,30,1,Okay.,q,MR. ELLERBE,start_chat
223,747,30,2,All right.  No further questions. FURTHER EXAMINATION,side_chat,MR. ELLERBE,start_question

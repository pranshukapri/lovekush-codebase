0,0,0,0," a witness named in the notice heretofore filed, being of lawful age and having been first duly sworn, testified on his oath as follows: E X A M I N A T I O N",,,start_question
1,202,7,15,"Good morning, Mr. Buffett.  I introduced myself before, but my name is Randy Baron.  I'm going to ask you some questions here today. I don't anticipate that we will spend much time ago.  I think I have some understanding of, you know, at least how you typically do business. I think I wanted to start off with asking you if you have an understanding as to what the lawsuit is to which you are here to testify?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
2,211,7,24,"In a general way, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3,212,7,25,What do you understand it to be?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
4,214,8,1,"Well, as I understand it, there are two lawsuits.  Maybe I'm incorrect.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,216,8,3,Yes.  I only have one of them.,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
6,217,8,4,"Oh, okay. Well, your suit, I presume relates to the question of whether the directors of Precision Castparts acted properly during the sale process to Berkshire Hathaway.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,222,8,9,"So you understand that the focus of our lawsuit is conduct by the officers and directors of Precision Castparts and the company prior to its acquisition, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
8,226,8,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,227,8,14,"All right. And do you understand what the basic factual contention is, what it is that we said was done wrong by the officers and directors of Precision Castparts or the corporation?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
10,232,8,19,"I haven't read the complaint, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,233,8,20,Do you have any understanding of that?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
12,234,8,21,"Well, I have a general understanding, but I have not -- I have not read the complaint, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,236,8,23,What is your general understanding?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
14,237,8,24,"Well, my general understanding is that the plaintiffs feel that the directors did not behave according as they should according to the state law in which it is incorporated, which I believe is Oregon.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,243,9,4,All right. Do you have any understanding as to whether or not our claims have to do with information that was set forth in the proxy statement?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
16,248,9,9,"Yes, I have heard that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,249,9,10,"And do you have -- do you have any belief as to what you think a company that you are buying, to seek shareholder approval of that purchase should say or do in the proxy statement?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
18,253,9,14,"Well, I think generally we have bought a fair number of companies, and the directors usually get one or more advisors.  And they listen to those advisors, but they also form their own opinions as to whether the shareholders are receiving fair compensation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,259,9,20,"You understand that the rules, at least the federal rules that companies have to go by, is that the information in the proxy statement is supposed to be a full and fair disclosure of information that is accurate -- accurate and necessary for shareholders to make a decision to vote yes or no, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
20,267,10,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,268,10,3,And is it your expectation when you are buying a company that the information that the directors and officers are telling their shareholders is the truth?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
22,272,10,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,273,10,8,"All right. And you also expect, and I have read a number of things that you have said publicly, you have a strong belief, if I understand it, that you expect to get truthful answers and sort of truthful information from the companies that you are going to buy, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
24,280,10,15,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,281,10,16,"All right. And I think that when, you know, you talk -- you had an interview in connection with this acquisition, and I think that you said something about the fact that, you know, what you do is, you know, you look the people in the eye and you try to get a real sense as to whether they are honest and telling you the truth. Is that accurate sort of representation sort of the way that you do it?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
26,292,11,1,"I look at 10-Ks, 10-Qs, competitors' information, recent -- any recent transcripts of information they have conveyed to the public. But it is certainly important that whoever is going to run the company that I feel confident in the fact that they are truthful and able.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,298,11,7,Did you understand that the lawsuit that we are bringing is fundamentally of the position that the directors and officers of Precision didn't really tell their shareholders the same thing that they were telling you about the company?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_chat
28,303,11,12,"Object, lacks foundation.",side_chat,MR. GARVEY,start_chat
29,304,11,13,I --,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
30,305,11,14,You may answer.,side_chat,MR. GARVEY,start_chat
31,306,11,15,"Yes. I have no idea except for what I read in the proxy at the time.  I haven't read the proxy since that time, so it is not like it is fresh in my mind.  But I have no information -- I don't think I have ever met any of the directors of Precision Castparts except for Mark Donegan.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,315,11,24,"And my question was really sort of, did you understand that sort of the nature of our lawsuit is that we think that what was represented to you as to what the nature of the business and the business plan was is not what was represented to shareholders?  Sort of a snapshot, where we think the company is at the time of the acquisition?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_chat
33,323,12,6,Same objection. You may answer.,side_chat,MR. GARVEY,start_chat
34,325,12,8,"Well, the only thing that was represented to me was what would be in public documents.  I think it would be the same thing that would have been presented to the public.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,331,12,14,"Well, so let's talk a little bit about that, and sort of what you -- what your belief was about Precision Castparts. First, as I understand you, and I think what you have said in the past, and I can show you sort of the transcript or the -- or the article about what you said, but fundamentally what I understand is that you made your decision to go ahead and acquire Precision Castparts after about 10 or 15 minutes of meeting with Mr. Donegan, is that an accurate statement?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
36,342,12,25,No.  I decided based on the fact that Todd Combs had had a favorable view of the company.  But I did not decide after 10 or 15 minutes to buy the company.  I decided to find out whether they were interested or would be willing to accept a proposition that I could make if they were -- if they were willing to -- to listen to one.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,350,13,7,So you had a conversation with Todd Combs for -- a relatively extensive conversation with Mr. Combs before you met with Mr. Donegan?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
38,353,13,10,"I don't know about extensive.  No, I met Mr. Donegan.  Actually, he had a date with Todd -- people frequently come to see -- CEOs frequently come to see Todd.  Sometimes I drop in on those sessions and sometimes I don't. But my memory is that I dropped in at the end of the conversation, which would be the customary way I would do it.  Very seldom do I listen to the whole conversation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,362,13,19,"Well, tell me the background that you did before you, you know, had the look in his eyes and tried to assess whether he would be interested in being acquired by Berkshire Hathaway. What was your due diligence or what efforts did you personally take?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
40,368,13,25,"Beforehand, there wasn't any due diligence.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,371,14,2,Okay. What did Mr. Donegan tell you about the company?  What did you understand?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
42,374,14,5,I just -- the only impression I came away with is that he was passionate about the company.  I could read everything else.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,377,14,8,Did you read other things before you --,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
44,378,14,9,"Not beforehand, but later I read.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,379,14,10,We are going to have slow down because she has to take us both down and we are having a conversation.,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
46,382,14,13,I'm sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,383,14,14,"Which is fine, but we have to sort of measure our conversation.  Let me ask the questions, take a breath, answer the question.",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
48,386,14,17,"Good enough. I shouldn't say ""good enough"" quite so soon, but good enough.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,389,14,20,Exactly. Okay.  So help me a little bit on the timing.,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
50,392,14,23,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,393,14,24,"So the timing was you knew that Mr. Combs thought it was a good possibility of an acquisition to acquire Precision Castparts, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
52,397,15,2,No.  That is not correct. I knew that he thought it was a good stock to own in his portfolio.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,400,15,5,"Okay.  And then how did -- then I understand, Mr. Donegan came in to speak to Mr. Combs. At that point in time, you stopped in and said hello, is that correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
54,405,15,10,"I stopped in and listened probably -- this is not a clear memory of time at all -- but I stopped in for the latter part of the conversation. I thought he was there 15 minutes, it might have been there 30 minutes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,410,15,15,And at the time that you stopped in at that time was it contemplated that you would possibly buy Precision Castparts?  Or did you just stop in for just a general conversation?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
56,414,15,19,"I stopped in because it was a portfolio company of Todd's, and so -- and sometimes I did that and sometimes I didn't. This was a company I really wasn't that familiar with ahead of time, but I knew that Todd liked it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,420,15,25,How long after -- and how long after that meeting did you consider buying Precision Castparts?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
58,423,16,2,"I said to Todd, afterwards, I don't remember the specific details of whether I said it that day or the next day, but I said, and I have said this with many other companies, and I have done it many times without the Todd prelude where I have met through other people. I said, Let's ask, let's ask the CEO, in this case, Mark Donegan, let's ask him whether if Berkshire would make a bid, whether that would be an act they would be fine with, or they would rather not have us do it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,434,16,13,"So -- and at least according to my calendar, the meeting with Mr. Donegan and Combs was on July 1st.  And it was really on July 2nd that Mr. Combs then called Mr. Donegan and said that they were interested in an acquisition. So it would have been that same day or the next morning where you had that conversation, is that accurate?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
60,442,16,21,That would be correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,443,16,22,At the time what did you know about Precision Castparts?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
62,445,16,24,"I knew that Todd thought it was an attractive company.  He probably has 15 companies or so in his portfolio, and that means that among many hundreds of companies he thinks that those 15 are companies that he regards as -- as meeting his test in terms of valuation as a stock. And considering a whole bunch of qualitative and quantitative factors, that he thinks that they are the 15 that he likes better than the other thousands.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,456,17,9,What did he know about the company's business model?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
64,458,17,11,Very little.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,459,17,12,"What did you know, though?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
66,460,17,13,I don't know that I could say that I knew anything about the model of the company.  I knew what they did in a general.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,463,17,16,What did they do?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
68,464,17,17,Primarily supply aircraft parts.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,465,17,18,"Okay. And did you have some sense as to the growth profile of the company, whether it was at a steady state?  Whether it was growing?  Whether or not it was organically growing?  Whether it was growing through acquisitions?  Anything else, did you have any sense of that?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
70,472,17,25,"I can't speak to that specifically in that I can take myself back in time three years and say exactly what I knew when. But I had -- I certainly -- I knew Todd liked it.  I knew that he felt that the record had been good.  I think the stock did -- had been disappointing recently, and that is about what I knew, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,481,18,8,You had no idea of whether or not it was a growth company at the time or at a steady state or anything to that effect?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_chat
72,484,18,11,Object to form.,side_chat,MR. GARVEY,start_chat
73,485,18,12,"Well, I knew that over time it had grown, obviously.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,488,18,15,Do you know whether it was still in a growth phase?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
75,490,18,17,Pardon me?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,491,18,18,Was it still in a growth phase?  Was it a company that was still planning to continue growing?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
77,493,18,20,I wouldn't -- I wouldn't have known that back then.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,495,18,22,"At some point prior to making the offer -- now there was a offer made pretty soon thereafter on July 9th. Between that first conversation where Mr. Combs talked to Mr. Donegan and Mr. Donegan said, yes, we would be interested in entertaining an offer, did you gain any more information about Precision Castparts actual business model?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
79,504,19,5,"A lot more information, as much as I could get.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,506,19,7,"Okay. So prior to making the over at 235, that was the offer and you never moved off that, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
81,509,19,10,That's -- that's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,510,19,11,Who comes up with that number?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
83,511,19,12,I come up with it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,512,19,13,And how do you come up with that number?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
85,513,19,14,"I look at the business.  I look at its history.  I think about its competition.  I think about the nature of the business.  I think like any perspective owner would think about a business, what are the prospects of this company and is there somebody there to manage it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,519,19,20,So you look at -- and if I understand --,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_chat
87,520,19,21,Excuse me.  I think he was -- go ahead and continue.,side_chat,MR. GARVEY,start_question
88,523,19,24,Go ahead.  I'm sorry.,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
89,524,19,25,"Also relevant, but I don't need to look at it, but interest rates, the economy, and other things that are an influence.  But in terms of the specific company, I read everything I can get.  And I probably asked Todd questions after I read things, knowing that he can helpful in clarifying certain things.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,532,20,7,"Yes.  Obviously other issues like the capital markets, if you are going to want to finance it; those other issues come into play in your decision-making process?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
91,536,20,11,"To varying degrees.  It depends on the size of the acquisition, our own cash position and that sort of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,539,20,14,"Exactly. So now, as you started to do your research before you got to that 235, at that point in time, did you get a stronger understanding of what the company did?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
93,544,20,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,545,20,20,"And so after that strong understanding, what did you understand about, again, what that company's business model was?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
95,548,20,23,"Well, I understood what was in the 10-Q. I understood what they talked about at investor presentations. I learned that -- I asked a lot more questions of Todd, and it is what I frequently do. I made a decision a couple of months ago on a 10 billion-dollar investment in Occidental Petroleum, and I heard that there was a possibility of it on a Friday.  And I met the people on Sunday. And an hour later, we committed $10 billion.  And in between, I thought about Occidental a lot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,560,21,9,Some people can do that.,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
97,561,21,10,"Well, it isn't always successful.  Believe me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,563,21,12,"So, again, just so I understand your frame of mind, your frame of mind is what they are saying in their 10-Ks and Qs, and what they describe in their business model from your perspective is how you viewed the company?  They say that we are, you know, selling airplane parts as our primary business model. You accept that to be true.  If they tell you that oil and gas is their primary business model, for example, you would accept that?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
99,573,21,22,"I wouldn't use the term ""model.""  I would say activity, all right?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,575,21,24,"All right.  Well, that is a fair point. When I say the phrase ""business model,"" what do you think of when I actually use that phrase?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
101,580,22,3,"Well, we don't have a business model at Berkshire Hathaway, no.  We have a lot of business activities.  And day-by-day, Berkshire gets reformed.  Sometimes we go a long time in between those days.  But we don't -- we don't have a model. We have never -- we have never used the term ""business model"" at Berkshire. We say -- we have certain principles which we put in the back of the annual report about our attitude towards shareholders and time horizons and that sort of thing.  But we do not have the customary, what some people might call a business model.  It is just not a term.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,593,22,16,"And what do you think that means, the customary term ""business model""?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
103,595,22,18,"Well, I think the way that management consultants would use it, it would involve a long-term strategy perhaps, and it would involve a lot of jargon that we don't use.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,599,22,22,"Well, when you are acquiring a company, is that not something that you are concerned about.  I understand that Berkshire Hathaway itself, because it is a conglomerate of a bunch of different companies.",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
105,605,23,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
106,606,23,3,"All that have sort of different goals and aspirations. But when you are acquiring a company, do you have some interest in, again, the traditional frame of a business model or what its strategies are, what its future strategies are intended to be?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
107,612,23,9,"I'm concerned with the business activities, and what I think competitive positions will be five or 10 years or 20 years out, and whether I have the right person to maximize whatever opportunities there may be.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,617,23,14,"And so Precision Castparts and throughout their 10-Qs and Ks, they talk about their activities in sort of fundamentally three ways; right?  They talk about their aerospace activities, their oil and gas industries, and then sort of their growth -- their growth through acquisition activities, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
109,624,23,21,"Well, they -- they certainly for the record have the latter third.  But with every company, that there is a possibility of acquisition, some of them more active in the past, and you can assume that they may have more interest in that. But I would not want to buy any company that thought that their main purpose was to make acquisitions. Precision had a history of doing acquisitions, but I looked at their activities as being in those -- primarily in the aircraft field. But obviously turbines, and they have other activities.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,638,24,9,"Well, they represented to you and your Board of Directors, again, that acquisition was a significant part of the activity that they actually were involved in, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
111,642,24,13,"They didn't represent that to me.  I looked at the history of the company, and seeing that they had done a number of acquisitions.  But nobody represented anything to me about future acquisitions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,647,24,18,"But they did explain that their business model moving forward involved a very detailed plan as to looking for acquisitions, how they make the acquisitions, how the acquisitions fit in, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
113,651,24,22,I don't remember that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
114,652,24,23,"Pardon me, Mr. Buffett. Randy, could you clarify what time frame you are asking about here?",side_chat,MR. GARVEY,start_question
115,657,25,2,I'm talking about at any time prior to the transaction closing.,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
116,659,25,4,"I don't -- I don't recall -- I'm not saying it is not in there, but I don't recall in the 10-K or in investor presentations.  They had a record of acquisitions, but I don't --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,663,25,8,I'm sorry.  Hold on.  I need to --,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
118,664,25,9,"I will say this, I was not making a proposal based on the idea either that they would or would not make acquisitions.  You hope any company that you buy finds good things to do.  And some do and some don't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,669,25,14,"Well, you understood that they actually had staff and employees whose job it was to search, continually search for acquisitions, look for a pipeline of acquisitions, try to determine whether or not where and when they could fold in a new acquisition, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
120,675,25,20,"I don't remember that.  I'm not saying that somebody didn't say it at some time, but I have no recollection of that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

137,719,27,12,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,720,27,13,"All right. In this document, if you take a look at it, it talks in sort of a detailed analysis -- when is the last time you saw this document, by the way?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
139,724,27,17,"When we passed it out -- it is customary if we buy a major company, we have a once a year meeting of the board offsite.  It is the only meeting, really, that we have.  And we do it in the fall; we are doing it again this fall.  And if we have a new big acquisition, I usually invite the CEO to come to the board and describe his business.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,731,27,24,"Okay.  And what is -- describing the business, are they talking about, you know, what the business was historically, what the business is since it was acquired?  Or what is sort of the framework of that discussion?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
141,737,28,4,"I let them do it their own style.  I just tell them, look, we have got -- in the case now, 14 interested directors, and they don't know that much about your business and tell them about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,741,28,8,All right. So have you -- so do you have a recollection of having seen this document before?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
143,744,28,11,"Well, I accept the fact it is document that we sent out in the fall of 2016 to the directors meeting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
144,747,28,14,All right. And do you actually comment on this document at all?  Or do you just take --,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
145,750,28,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
146,751,28,18,-- the document that the CEO prepares and give it to the board?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
147,753,28,20,"Well, the CEO, we -- I can't be 100 percent sure in that particular year, but sometimes the -- the presenting CEO will send out some background figures to the directors.  Sometimes they will just present it by slide.  Well, they will send out some kind of document and they will present slides and talk through it.  And then they will answer questions.  The presentation is up to them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
148,762,29,3,And did Mr. Donegan actually give this presentation -- give a presentation to the board with this document?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
149,765,29,6,He certainly gave a presentation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
150,766,29,7,"So, if you turn to this document and sort of it goes through, and let's sort of walk through it.  There is -- it talks about a history snapshot that you see on the first page, on page 2. And then it talks about, you know, the initial -- it gives the historical numbers and it give history revenue and EBITDA numbers. Do you see that on page 4? And you said, yes, you see that. That is clearly talking about even before Berkshire Hathaway?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
151,777,29,18,"Yes, I know.  It is the history.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
152,778,29,19,"Then it identifies sort of its calendar year 2016, forecasted sales by segment.  You see it on the organization chart on page 5.",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_chat
153,781,29,22,Object to form.,side_chat,MR. GARVEY,start_question
154,783,29,24,"And then you see on page 6, there is a sales by market sort of graph, it talks about its sort of overall sales and where the sales come from. Do you see that?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
155,788,30,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
156,789,30,4,"All right.  It talks about locations. And then on page 8, it talks about acquisition strategy.  So it is the one page before that.  The page before that, on page 8.  It just says, Acquisition Strategy, at which point literally there is a multi-page discussion of an acquisition strategy by Precision Castparts, including with a history on page 13, and then a return on investment capital on page 14. Do you see that?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
157,799,30,14,Yes.  Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
158,800,30,15,Did you understand that this acquisition strategy was a new strategy or an old strategy by the company?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
159,803,30,18,"Well, I didn't know -- what I would call a strategy.  I knew they had a history of acquisitions and that generally they had been successful.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
160,806,30,21,And that they were planning on continuing them?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
161,808,30,23,"Well, that would depend on the opportunities.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
162,810,30,25,But again --,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
163,812,31,1,"We have actually -- our subsequent acquisitions that have not worked out that well, as you probably know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
164,815,31,4,"I do understand that. But you understood as of a year later that there was -- they had historically made acquisitions, and at least in Mr. Donegan's view, there was a strategy to continue making those acquisitions under certain formulations, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
165,821,31,10,There was a strategy to continue to look for acquisitions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
166,823,31,12,"All right. And again, my point was, that wasn't a new strategy, that was a strategy that you understood was the strategy that the company had at the time that you acquired it, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
167,828,31,17,"I knew that -- like many of our companies, including Berkshire itself, we are looking for acquisitions every day.  But ""strategy"" implies something beyond what we do, I will put it that way.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
168,832,31,21,"And all I'm looking for, Mr. Buffett, is very simply, I'm trying to get a sense as to whether, with regard to what the company was doing prior to the acquisition -- prior to the acquisition by Berkshire Hathaway, and what it wanted to do even a year later, whether there was any change or whether or not this was sort of a consistent business, you know, whether you call it strategy, an outlook, a forecast, all of those things didn't change in that year, is that correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
169,843,32,6,"No.  But the ability to successfully make acquisitions varies enormously depending on the environment in which you are in. But -- but the same situation for us, we have probably maybe 50 or 60 acquisitions, but in the last few years, we haven't made any to speak of.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
170,849,32,12,The market will dictate what you can do?,q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
171,850,32,13,"So the strategy can't be to make acquisitions.  It can be to -- to have an open mind about acquisitions, but we do not want any strategies that are committed to making acquisitions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
172,855,32,18,"Oh, absolutely. You don't want to make bad acquisitions, you want to make good acquisitions.",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
173,858,32,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

175,861,32,24,You want to think -- you don't want to stretch.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
176,864,33,1,"But at the time -- at the time of the acquisition for Precision Castparts, you don't know -- you didn't know one way or the other whether or not the environment for acquisitions was going to be good or bad in the year, two years, or three years following, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
177,870,33,7,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
178,871,33,8,"Because if you knew that, that would make life a lot easier, if you knew in advance whether the market was good or bad.",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
179,874,33,11,I will just take one week.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
180,875,33,12,"But it was, in fact, your belief, at least at the time, that not only had Precision Castparts made many acquisitions prior to the acquisition, but that you believed that they were going to make many more, at least at the time of the acquisition?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
181,880,33,17,"I don't believe they were initially going to make many more.  I believe that they would -- would like to make more acquisitions, and the question is whether the environment allowed it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

189,905,34,16,I see that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

200,930,35,15,"Let me -- well, in addition to just sort of understanding its business -- well, actually, let me pull back. When you told the shareholders, the Berkshire shareholders that Mr. Donegan had made many acquisitions and will make more, what was your basis for that knowledge? Was that just reading the SEC filings or was that also an assurance by Mr. Donegan that he would do that?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
201,940,35,25,"I knew by nature that if he found good acquisitions, he would like to be able to do them. And Berkshire, not needing dividends and having a lot of capital would be available, if acquisitions made sense.  But -- but I never -- I never instructed any management to -- to make acquisitions. I like it generally when they do, but I think I have actually commented in one of the annual letters that, telling a manager to make acquisitions is little like telling your teenage son to have a normal sex life.  I mean, you really don't need that extra push.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

RANDY BARON,start_answer
205,965,36,24,"Again, I have not -- I wouldn't have encouraged him in terms of any strategy.  I would always encourage all of our managers to look for acquisitions -- even in their line own or dimensions of others, from other companies, which has had contact.  That has happened at Berkshire, they have referred other companies to us, because they have said they had a good experience being acquired by Berkshire.

234,1068,40,23,"Speaking of -- that is interesting. When you talk to your shareholders, your Berkshire shareholders, do you tell them that you are just continue to look for acquisitions, that that is sort of what you are hoping to achieve if, in fact, there are good acquisitions in the market that will allow them to happen?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
235,1076,41,5,"Yes.  Our intention at Berkshire would be, we are retaining 25 billions dollars or so of earnings per year, and fortunately we have two prongs.  I explain that to our shareholders, we are fortunate that we have two options that most companies, really large companies don't think of having. One is we can do it through the acquisition of part of a company, by buying stock in the company, and secondly, we can buy entire companies. And our preference is to buy entire companies, but it is a lot easier to buy marketable securities.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

241,1109,42,12,"Well, my partner, Charlie Munger and I, look at them as their partners, basically, and we want to give them, in as simple terms as possible, what they can and can't expect from us, and what we are going to try and do with their money, which is exactly what we are doing with our own money.  In my case, I have 99 percent of my capital in Berkshire.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

256,1168,44,19,"Well, did you get any sense as to whether or not the idea of what you want to do with the business of Precision Castparts, you know, including its acquisition as an acquisition, options, whatever we want to call it, that doing so as a member of the Berkshire family was more in sync with his desire -- his way of running a company as opposed to a public company?",q,MR.

264,1193,45,18,"With regard to Mr. Donegan, do you have any sense of whether or not he acknowledged that benefit?  You are talking -- you don't have to deal with the same level of the analyst calls the analyst -- the same expectations of, you know, meeting your earnings numbers to the same extent, all of those things make it probably a better job to be a CEO under the Berkshire umbrella then alone in the public markets, would you agree with that?",q,MR.

You can -- you can actually tell with a reasonable degree of assurance, I'm sure I have gotten fooled sometimes, but you can tell by how people talk about their business, and they -- their personality, their conviction, their passion for it comes through. I think it probably comes through with me about Berkshire, because it is what I think about, you know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
297,1315,50,10,"How does -- and is it just because of your history and the way you have acquired companies, or do you do something to make clear to the managers that you are going to be part of the family, I'm buying this company, but I'm buying this company with you at the helm?",q,MR.

Again, but by anybody who is going to be acquired, they want to know whether they have got a job, if you acquire them and, you know, fire them and put in a whole new management team. How do they get that assurance from you?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
300,1330,50,25,"Well, they can look at the record.  I mean, I can't recall a time when I've ever bought a company to fire the guy the next day. We are dependent on the management.  We don't have --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

302,1337,51,6,"Well, we don't have a corps of people here. I mean, we have 395,000 employees, we have got 25 at headquarters.  We don't have anybody to run companies.  I can't run them.  Todd can't run them. Debbie would probably be better than -- but we don't have anybody to run the companies. And we need managers who, for reasons other than money, they have got to be paid fairly, but for reasons other than money, that is just plain -- that is what they want to do in life. Because probably three quarters of our managers are financially independent.  They don't need to do it to live well.  They have got to do it because they love doing it.  I can't put that in them.  I can mess it up, but I can't put it in them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

306,1363,52,6,"I think -- I think when they come to the annual meeting, they are heros to 40,000 people.  I think that -- I mean, they show their wares there at our meeting.  I think there is some prestige, perhaps joined -- joined with Berkshire now.  That wasn't true 40 years ago. But I think now that -- that I think -- on balance, if you run a company owned by Berkshire that it is regarded as something different, perhaps. Maybe I'm kidding myself. I think that -- I think they understand generally that they are not going to be subject to some 25-year-old MBA telling them, you know, what to have for breakfast in the morning, if you are with Berkshire.  And that culture will extend beyond me, because at my age, they don't know whether I'm going to be around tomorrow.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,1380,52,23,"So do you ever have to tell the managers, look, you know, I'm buying this company with the expectation that you are going to be around a long time, or do you just assume that they know that because it is Berkshire?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
308,1386,53,3,"Well, I think -- they know I wouldn't be buying -- I couldn't name -- name another person at Precision Castparts.  I'm not there.  It is one thing, I -- I count on them living a long time. That doesn't mean they will. But I had one woman who worked for me until she was 103.  I use her as an example.

In there it appeared that you were indicating that you would, you know, accept some financing or you may look for some additional financing for the acquisition.

340,1492,57,5,"I don't know.  I know -- I know that I'm interested in doing them.  I know that there is no way to predict what will come along when -- I don't know what the competition will be.  Right now private equity, for example, is extraordinary competition. It wouldn't make any sense.  I want to be prepared.  I'm always prepared to make acquisitions. I like have a loaded gun in terms of having the cash, some fair amount of cash available and access to credit, if needed.  But we have never had a plan like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
341,1504,57,17,"If a company that you are considering purchasing were to present you with a forecast as to their future rate of acquisitions, is that something that you would rely upon in deciding whether to go ahead and try to purchase that company, or actually sign up an acquisition of that company?",q,MR. ROBERT BARON,start_answer
342,1510,57,23,"It might -- it might worry me a little bit if they actually had numbers.  I mean, you can't forecast acquisitions.  You can -- you can have a very keen interest in a subject, and we have it at Berkshire.  And some of our subsidiaries do and some don't. There is no sense having an acquisition plan of See's Candy, but if it seems sensible to be willing to look at acquisitions at a Marmon, for example, but we have no forecast on that sort of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
343,1522,58,9,Is it unusual for the operating companies under the Berkshire umbrella to study potential acquisition candidates on a regular basis?,q,MR. ROBERT BARON,start_answer
344,1525,58,12,"Well, a number do and a number don't.  I mean, in the insurance business it -- it would be very, very, very unlikely that -- Geico is not going to consider an acquisition.  But it can consider expansion. But, on the other hand, let's take Shaw, a carpet company, if you take Marmon, which has acquired a number of companies over the years. Uber has always had an interest, but their record has been very poor since we bought it, in terms of acquisitions.  But they had acquired companies over the years.  And still, if something good came along, we would be interested in doing it. But there are certain industries we are in where it is -- it may make some sense, but BNSF, it is very unlikely they ever make an acquisition.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
345,1542,59,3,"You made some reference during your testimony in response to the questions from plaintiff's counsel to the acquisitions that Precision had made since the closing of Berkshire's acquisition.

356,1588,60,23,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

RANDY BARON,start_answer
362,1613,61,22,"Well, in effect, when I buy a company I'm making one myself.  It may not be precise, or -- but I'm saying overall, it is a good idea to lay out X for this company, because I expect that we will get a decent return on X over time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

375,1650,63,7,"All right. And so it is not that Berkshire doesn't -- doesn't forecast out, project for acquisitions, it just doesn't forecast out its overall business model beyond, you know, what it hopes it can achieve in a very short time?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
376,1656,63,13,"Well, not even in the short time.  But I would say this, I do make sure that I know where the month, quarter where cash is going to be.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
377,1659,63,16,"Exactly. But, again, the other Mr. Baron made comments about you don't forecast out acquisitions, but you don't really forecast out anything at Berkshire, correct?",q,MR. RANDY BARON,start_answer
378,1664,63,21,"I don't do it in the specific sense of forecast.  Obviously, when I buy a business, I'm projecting a future in my mind that I think is satisfactory in terms of the capital we are laying out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

380,1675,64,6,"Well, I don't set it aside.  I'm just -- I'm always in a position where I could look at things that are large, and I would even look at things where we might have to borrow money, although I would want ample liquidity after we borrowed the money. But I would never put Berkshire in any position where if the stock market closed for a month, or commercial paper couldn't be sold or anything like that that, that Berkshire would have a problem.

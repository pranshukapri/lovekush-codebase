207,519,20,19,"George and Alan's table was on the opposite side.  So the two tables that, I guess, had an issue with one another were next to each other, so they were about here and here.  George being here, and then the other table being here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

215,536,21,11,"Yeah.  From my table I saw a commotion going on between the two tables.  I walked over there.  It was kind of not that big of a commotion.  They were both kind of taunting each other.  I basically went over there to calm them down before we got security involved because typically, if there's an issue at one of our events, before we get the necessary parties involved, we try to talk to the people ourselves basically and kind of see what's going on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
216,547,21,22,So you say you see a commotion.  Can you describe this commotion?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer

228,569,22,19,And what was security's response when you made them aware of the commotion?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
229,571,22,21,"Well, there was a specific person that caused it.  It was actually on George's table. He had a friend that was too drunk. From my understanding -- actually, while I was standing there, he had fell over on a girl who I knew.  I can't remember her name off the top of my head, but he fell over on her, and then that kind of increased the commotion a bit.  I'm like, okay, this kid is too drunk and he has to leave.  I made security aware of that.  And from that point, I didn't see anything done.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,584,23,9,"And when you say you didn't see anything done, what do you mean?",q,MS. ALVES,start_answer

And then I see George, and I was kind of like, hey, guys, what's going on.  Told them to calm down. And then I looked to the other table. I'm like, guys, what's going on, tell them to calm down.  They basically told me, hey, we're not here for this.  We're just here to have a good time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

244,614,24,14,Okay.,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
245,615,24,15,"So I said cool and left it at that, but then within that mix, that's when George's friend kind of fell over into the girl.  And then after that, that's when I grabbed security and made them aware.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,620,24,20,"Okay.  So after you alert security, you said -- you suggested that George's friend leave the venue?",q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
247,623,24,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
248,624,24,24,But he was still -- he remained in the club?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer

261,647,25,22,"Okay.  So at any point in the night, did you see alcohol being delivered to either one of those tables?",q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
262,651,26,1,"From where I was -- I mean, typically, throughout the night, especially when I'm working an event, I'm moving around a lot.  So it's not something I'm paying attention to if someone is getting served.  If they're getting served, I wouldn't see it.  The only people that I really see get served would be people that might be at my table or myself.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,659,26,9,Okay.  Did you see any individuals at George's table holding any bottles of alcohol?,q,MS. ALVES,start_chat

274,678,27,3,Okay.  Did you see George leave the venue?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
275,680,27,5,"No.  So prior -- actually, prior to people leaving, I spoke to Joe O'Connor that night who was actually my connection to booking the venue, and I made him aware of the situation that I told the security guard to remove the gentleman, he didn't, so there may be -- potentially be a situation when we're letting everyone out. So he then suggested that, okay, we'll let George's table out through the back, kind of separate them, and then the other table will be let out through the front with the remainder of the crowd.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
276,693,27,18,"And this was Joe O'Connor, you said, that made that suggestion?",q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
277,695,27,20,"Yeah, because he wasn't aware of the situation until I made him aware, so that means security didn't tell him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
278,698,27,23,Objection.,side_chat,MR. MCINNIS,start_question

282,705,28,5,Okay.  And do you know what position Joe O'Connor has at Red Lantern?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer

284,709,28,9,Okay.,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
285,710,28,10,But he was there to support me that night seeing as how he booked for me on my behalf.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
286,713,28,13,Okay.  So you didn't see security take George out the back; is that correct?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
287,715,28,15,"No, I did not see it, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
288,716,28,16,Okay.  And did you see the individuals from the other table leave out the front?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer

295,730,29,5,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,731,29,6,What's your understanding of what happened?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
297,733,29,8,"I mean, when the security guard came in, he actually had like a bloody eyebrow because he got hit in the face with something. He told me a kid threw a bottle of something at him.  And he was basically, like, there's a brawl going on outside right now.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

305,757,30,7,"Briefly, but I don't really remember the conversation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,759,30,9,Okay.  So do you know what happened that night outside?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
307,761,30,11,"Yes.  So when I walked out there after they cleared the commotion, I saw an ambulance. I saw George holding his head, and then I forget who I asked what happened, but I was made aware that he was hit in the head with a bottle, with a champagne bottle at that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,767,30,17,You don't know who made you aware of that?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer

316,782,31,7,"I mean, from what I remember, he told me that he let the guys out the back like he said he would.  He said they came back around to the front.  I'm not sure why they did.  And that's when the commotion happened because, you know, the streets weren't even cleared yet. You know, it was still the let out, so to speak, so there was still a lot of people outside. And typically, from my experience doing events, when you do a let out, it's security's job to clear the street and not let anybody else on that street until it's clear, and that didn't happen that night.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
317,796,31,21,What do you mean that didn't happen that night?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
318,798,31,23,"I mean, when I went out there -- I mean, not when I went out there, but it was just from the sound of it, sounded like there was a lot of people outside.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

325,815,32,15,"I didn't observe that but that's -- looking at the situation, that's probably the only way that anyone would have been able to leave with a champagne bottle at the venues.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
326,819,32,19,Objection.,side_chat,MR. MCINNIS,start_question
327,820,32,20,So what makes you think somebody was able to leave with a champagne bottle?,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
328,822,32,22,"When they serve bottles, they're supposed to take it from the table whenever they're not at the table.  If somebody was able to get their hands on one, that would only explain -- the only thing that makes the most sense is that the waitress either forgot to take it with her or someone had it in hand and she didn't see it on the table to take it with her.  Probably the only two things that would probably make the most sense in regards to someone walking out with one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

334,847,33,22,Not that I remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

339,858,34,8,"I would say the time frame between the let out and just -- yeah, I would just say the time frame of the let out.  I mean, there's no way that someone would have got their hands on a champagne bottle that fast after exiting the venue.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,864,34,14,Okay.,q,MS. ALVES,start_answer
341,865,34,15,"Because we were still clearing the space unless they were, like, parked right outside, which is not a possibility.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

And yeah, like, when he fell on her, I don't recall him punching her in the face or them getting into an altercation, but I recall him definitely like hitting her pretty hard when he fell. But when I had left, I also heard that she got kicked out.  She got removed from the premises for actually fighting him.  And I spoke to her at a different event, and she told me that they kicked her out instead of him, and he was the one who started the whole thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

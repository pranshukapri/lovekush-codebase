14,97,5,5,It's been a while.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,98,5,6,"Let me just go over some brief rules of the deposition for you so we both are on the same page with how this works. It's very informal, as you can see. But it is important that you speak verbally all of your responses because the court reporter is taking down everything everyone is saying, and she cannot accurately record head shakes, head nods, uh-huhs, uh-uhs, things like that.  They become very difficult to decipher months down the road on a black-and-white transcript.  So please make sure that you answer yes, no, or I don't know, or make sure all of your answers are through verbal words. Make sure that we don't speak over one another.  It's sort of like a shortwave radio where I ask my question, I stop, and then you give your answer.  Then I wait until you're finished until I ask my next question.  Talking over one another muddles up the record and is also very accurate -- very difficult to accurately record if we're both speaking at the same time. Your lawyer may make certain objections today.  He's doing that because he's doing his job for you.  Unless he tells you not to answer, which I don't anticipate, you can go ahead and answer the question.  But this isn't meant to be a memory test necessary -- well, I guess it is a little bit of a memory test, but it's not meant to be so oppressive on you because we're going to be talking about a lot of dates and a lot of prior history.  So give me your best answer. If you don't feel like you know the answer, you can simply just tell me you don't know the answer, and that's fine, and we'll move on hopefully.  If you need a break, let me know. If you need to use a restroom, if I can refill your water, let me know.  We can certainly do that.  It's not an endurance test either. Do you understand all those -- all of those instructions?",q,MS. ALEXANDER,start_answer
16,143,7,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,144,7,6,"One final one is if you need me to rephrase my question because you don't understand my question or I haven't asked it in a way that's understandable, please just tell me that you don't understand my question before you give me your answer, and I'll be happy to rephrase my question.  If you answer my question as I word it, I'm going to assume you understand the question, and you're giving me the answer to that question.  Fair enough?",q,MS. ALEXANDER,start_answer

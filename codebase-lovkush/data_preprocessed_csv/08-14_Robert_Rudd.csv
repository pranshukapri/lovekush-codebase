Because I can't do the steps that he does.  You know, I can't walk along and -- and take care of a sick person.  That'll make me sick, you know? I'm fighting for my health as well.  You know, I have an enlarged heart, so I have to do robust things, do athletic things, walk, jog to keep my heart in pace.  And so now, working with a friend that been impaired physically, I can't no longer do it, because it's impeding on my health.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1179,2260,87,12,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1180,2261,87,13,All right.  And what you -- you also want us to know is Marvin has made some driving accommodations in that he tries not to drive during busy rush hour or heavy traffic.  Why is that?,q,MR. CRANE,start_answer
1181,2265,87,17,"Well, because traffic causes a problem to him as a left foot driver not used to using left foot.  So you have to have a mind-set that:  I'm driving unorthodox.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1182,2268,87,20,Yes.,q,MR. CRANE,start_answer

1184,2272,87,24,"Right.  And so Marvin knows that he has a deficit driving a car, and to try to help that deficit, he drives at -- at hours where the traffic is lighter, such as at 1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m., he leaves your house.  That's what you're telling us, right?",q,MR. CRANE,start_answer

I said, But in the process of getting well, this is a part of it.  'Cause you can't get well using the -- the things that you're using.  The cane won't do it.  That will 'cause more agitation to the physical limitation, you know? I said, ""A lot of people use chairs.""  I had to -- I had to tell him I had to use a cane for maybe a year in my life, off -- off and on.  But I would do it when I felt my anatomy weakening.

1568,3020,116,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1570,3024,116,22,Yeah.  We worked out a routine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1571,3025,116,23,So how often after the accident was he coming to see you?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1572,3027,116,25,"Again, maybe every two months.  'Cause now, the -- the -- the surgery is coming about, and we -- he was shopping for doctors, so to speak.  So he had to find a doctor that he wanted to perform the surgery.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1573,3032,117,4,"And so why -- why did he have to do that in Philadelphia, at your house versus in Kingston?",q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1574,3034,117,6,"Why did he -- explain yourself again, sir.  Ask the question a different way.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1575,3036,117,8,"Well, I was asking you how often he came down, and you started talking about he was shopping for doctors, so I didn't really understand.  Was he researching doctors while he was with you?",q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1576,3040,117,12,"Yes.  When we set out for the -- half of it, he did by phone and by conversations with other people to find a doctor that could repair his -- his -- his toe with a minimum amount of surgery and -- and disadvantage to himself physically.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1577,3045,117,17,"Well, when he would come to see you, are -- are the two of you going to doctors' offices to interview doctors?",q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1578,3047,117,19,Yes.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1579,3048,117,20,So you actually go to -- with him to doctors' appointments for the purposes of interviewing doctors to figuring out who the best surgeon would be for him?  Is that what you're telling me?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1580,3052,117,24,"Yes.  As I recollect, he started at -- what do you call it? the Rothman Institute and gaining information there, particular types of surgery and one of the better clinics or -- or hospitals with better quality of doctors that he couldn't find in the hometown --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1581,3058,118,4,All right.  Let me ask you --,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1582,3059,118,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1583,3060,118,6,"That's fine.  I don't mean to cut you off, but I'm just curious:  So how many different doctors did you go to with Mr. Bassett to interview them to figure out who the best doctor would be?  How many times did you actually do that?  How many different doctors did you go see with him in terms of shopping or searching for a doctor to perform his surgery?",q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1584,3067,118,13,"Well, for his foot, I could remember twice visiting the Rothman Institute.  And then, after he found some information on Dr. Mann that he was -- I made maybe two or three visits before the actual operation.  He -- he liked the prognosis that Dr. Mann has given him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1585,3072,118,18,"But in any event, so Mr. Bassett has been coming to see you about every other month since the accident, correct?",q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1586,3075,118,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1587,3076,118,22,And has that been primarily for the purposes of socializing with you?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1588,3078,118,24,"No.  That -- for the past year and a half, it's been a wellness aspect for me and him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1589,3081,119,1,Right.  And what does that mean?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1590,3082,119,2,"It means that, to physically put yourself back together, you're gonna have to do something physical.  To psychologically put yourself back together, you're gonna have to do something psychological.  And we did both.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1591,3086,119,6,All right.  So why is -- why -- what were you doing with him to assist him physically and psychologically?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1592,3088,119,8,"Okay.  Psychologically, I was being his friend. Physically, I was helping him with his handicap, I would say.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1593,3091,119,11,And how are you helping him with that?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1594,3092,119,12,"Well, again, as a friend, I told him the -- the psychological impairments that he would go through.  Me having a stroke I alluded to -- to earlier, that I went through all the pains and ills physically and mentally, you know, and spiritually, if we can say that, being let down, being depressed.  I told him some of the -- the psychological dissidence he would have in going through trying to get well and stay in a permanent aspect in the reality of life.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1595,3101,119,21,"All right.  So -- and that was all -- all that assistance that you were giving to him was done by you in person with him, correct?",q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1596,3104,119,24,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1597,3105,119,25,And you think -- and that was the -- the principal reason he was coming to see you every other month after the accident?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1598,3109,120,3,"Yes.  He seen me -- I told him about a stroke that I had ten years ago, and I had did my --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1599,3111,120,5,I understand all that.,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1600,3112,120,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1601,3113,120,7,"All right.  And then, also, so when he would come down there, you guys would go out, and you'd go to lunch, and you would do other things, I take it, other than -- or would you primarily just, you know, sit in your -- your apartment or your house?",q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1602,3118,120,12,"No.  We tried to do the things that he was somewhat able to do with limitations.  And by me being an old geriatric worker, I knew what his physical limitations were and how he could get through it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1603,3122,120,16,And -- and -- and how often do you talk with him on the phone?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1604,3124,120,18,"Now, at least three to four times a week.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1605,3125,120,19,And is he still coming down to see you?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1606,3126,120,20,The last he was here was just about two weeks ago.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1607,3127,120,21,And what did you guys do during that visit?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1608,3128,120,22,"I went with him to a -- I -- I think that that particular time, he was telling me that he was getting ready for a procedure with his postate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1609,3131,120,25,All right.  And did the -- did Mr. Bassett ever tell you that he had injured that foot before?,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1610,3134,121,2,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1614,3142,121,10,"Yeah.  He -- he did have a small limp.  He told me about it in -- in passing.  Now that I recall, Marvin, at three years old, was shot accidentally with a shotgun and -- when he was an infant.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1615,3146,121,14,Okay.,q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer
1616,3147,121,15,It was either an infant or --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1617,3148,121,16,"So prior to this accident, you remember him walking with a -- I think we can call it a small limp; is that correct?",q,MR. SHERIDAN,start_answer

1,96,4,8,"Good afternoon, Doctor.  We met a few minutes ago. I am taking your deposition today, and I am going to assume that I don't need to give you instructions on testifying at a deposition.  Am I correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
2,102,4,14,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3,103,4,15,"If we need to straighten anything out, we'll do it along the way. Your title here is the Chief of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
4,107,4,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,108,4,20,"And you're an M.D., correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
6,109,4,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,110,4,22,And you're an employee of duPont/Nemours?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
8,112,4,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,114,5,1,Did you review any records in preparation for your deposition today?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
10,116,5,3,I just looked at my operative report.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,118,5,5,And from what date?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
12,119,5,6,I believe they're in March 2014.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,120,5,7,"Well, I have one that I'm going to show you from the 27th.  That's your original --",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
14,123,5,10,Operative report?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,124,5,11,"-- procedure, right.  And then the second one is from the 29th, which was when you were called emergently in.  Okay?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
16,127,5,14,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,128,5,15,"So aside from the records that you reviewed, do you have any recollection of Lily Lynn Trudnak and recollection of events that occurred on March 29th when you were called in emergently?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
18,133,5,20,Some.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,134,5,21,Some.  Okay.  All right. What do you recall about it?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
20,136,5,23,"This was a patient with tetralogy of Fallot and some respiratory issues who came from Connecticut Children's Hospital. And I remember receiving a phone call from a physician who used to be a trainee here stating that they had this complex case, that it was, you know, turning to sort of an unmanageable situation for them. And the baby had several cardiac arrests and hypoxic episodes and was paralyzed, and they had a very difficult time providing adequate ventilation. And the patient had tetralogy of Fallot that needed to have repair, and so the expertise, seemingly after a conversation, of that institution was that was not present there and that they were seeking for the opportunity to get care somewhere else.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,157,6,19,"Okay.  And she was admitted to duPont specifically for the cardiac surgery, as I recall.  Is that correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
22,160,6,22,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,161,6,23,Okay.  What was her condition like preoperatively as far as her neurologic picture?  Do you recall?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
24,165,7,2,"Hard to say considering that this is a patient who is mechanically ventilated, sedated.  It's a newborn, and therefore besides gross motor movements and opening eyes, certainly not -- I wouldn't be able to give you more information than that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,172,7,9,Okay.  Understood. I want you to look at your report of the 27th.  And I will find that for you.  Unfortunately I didn't bring -- I should have brought a separate mouse for you.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
26,178,7,15,"Now, you control this, or I do?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,179,7,16,I control.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
28,180,7,17,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,181,7,18,"But next time I do this I'm going to bring a mouse for my deponent so they can do that. So this is the beginning of your operative report, and can you see it?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
30,186,7,23,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,187,7,24,"Okay.  So this is the report you were referring to, the first document that you reviewed.  Is that correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
32,191,8,3,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,192,8,4,"Okay.  So the report speaks for itself.  For the record, this is Bates No. 152, and it continues.  It's a report signed by Dr. Christian Pizarro, and it's of a procedure dated 3/27/2014.  The note was submitted or signed or filed, it looks like at the top left, at 4/7/2014.  And it describes an operation that occurred on March 27, 2014. In the category under surgeon and assistant, you're listed as the surgeon.  There's a Dr. Glenn Pelletier listed.  Who is Dr. Pelletier?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
34,205,8,17,He's another cardiothoracic surgeon who works here.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,207,8,19,Okay.  He's full-time here?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
36,208,8,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,209,8,21,Okay.  And Edward Woodford I had the pleasure of meeting a week or two ago. He is a physician assistant that works with your department regularly.  Is that correct?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
38,215,9,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,216,9,3,"And John Ostrowski was the anesthesiologist, correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
40,218,9,5,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,219,9,6,Okay.  That's what's listed here.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
42,220,9,7,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,221,9,8,All right.  And you've had the opportunity to review this report.  Was there any particular difficulty -- and I'm putting it in a layperson's term.  I don't pretend to have the expertise that you have in the ins and outs of intricate surgery like this.  But was this a procedure that went pretty much as you expected it to go?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
44,229,9,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,230,9,17,"Okay.  No particular problems with this surgery per se, correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
46,232,9,19,"No.  I would say that, yeah, things went according to plan.  The patient had, you know, a good anatomic repair, and it seems like cardiac function was good and there were no issues to the point that we closed the chest.  Any time we will have a concern, we'll leave the chest open.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,240,10,2,Right.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
48,241,10,3,"And so, yeah, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,242,10,4,"Okay.  And it's also mentioned in here sort of in the middle of the page I'm showing there that there was assistance of Dr. Baffa.  I understand that Dr. Baffa is an intensivist, cardiology intensivist.  Is that correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
50,248,10,10,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,249,10,11,What is Dr. Baffa's specialty?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
52,250,10,12,"She's a cardiologist who has special training in imaging, so she's the person who helped with the assessment of my echocardiogram at the end of the procedure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,254,10,16,"Okay.  And that was an epicardial echocardiogram, correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
54,256,10,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,257,10,19,Baby's esophagus was too small to pass the scope?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
56,259,10,21,"Well, there was a concern about the size of the baby as well as the fact that the airway was questionable, and therefore we didn't want to add any potential encumbering, you know, issue associated with that.  So, you know, a probe is generally not designed for patients of this size, so they tend to be oversized, and that's a problem.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,269,11,6,"And if I may, what was your understanding of the airway problem that this baby had?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
58,272,11,9,"Well, the baby received a tracheostomy at the previous institution because of the difficulties that they had in spite of that.  The patient did have several episodes when it was important, desaturation that led to arrest, and therefore that was part of the issue is the cardiac defect was the respiratory problem, anatomic problem. And therefore when the patient came we evaluated that, you know, anew and we established that obviously the tracheostomy provided a good access to the airway and that the airway in fact were not all that small. And the patient at the time had an annoying, you know, infection with Serratia, which is a Gram-negative organism that makes -- obviously could aggravate matters, and that was, you know, being treated. But we thought that considering the ability to ventilate effectively, the presence of a concurrent infectious inflammatory process in the airway, it certainly would not be, you know, an absolute mandate to try to tackle the cardiac defect and the airway surgery at the same time considering the fact that that combination certainly has far important morbidity, mortality, and risk compared to just the isolated cardiac surgery. So we thought that that was certainly not something that we should try to address at that particular time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,309,12,21,"Understood.  And you note that the area, actually the area of her trachea, cross-sectional area had increased over time.  Is that correct?  You said there was, I think in the sixth line from the bottom or seventh line, significant increase in size compared to the previous study from seven weeks before?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
60,318,13,5,Seemingly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,319,13,6,"Right.  And you then went to the trouble in your history here of explaining particularly, I think as you stated, why you did not want to do any particular tracheal intervention as far as a tracheal reconstruction at that time, the same time that you were performing the cardiac surgery, but that you would rather reassess that at a later date.  Is that correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
62,328,13,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,329,13,16,"Okay.  All right. So moving on, what -- I know the reason, but what is the reason that in this procedure and in other cardiac procedures where patients come to the operating room with a tracheostomy and they need a median sternotomy, what's the reason that the tracheostomy tube is removed at that time?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
64,339,14,1,"Well, generally speaking it's severalfold, but importantly you want to, A, have the anesthesiologist get direct access to the airway, which would be in the face, correct?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,344,14,6,Correct.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
66,345,14,7,"And therefore easier than, you know, below the chin, particularly in a patient who is about 50 centimeters long. So that goes without saying. The second is the fact that ideally you want to -- you know, there is a risk of contamination and deep-seated mediastinal wound infection every time you have a contaminated source, you know, immediately adjacent to the sternotomy. So ideally you want to see if you could create some form of a barrier to separate those two, and so it's impossible to do with a tracheostomy in place. And therefore generally we will just take the tracheostomy out, if feasible intubate a patient, you know, orally or nasotracheally, you know, from above, and then seal this and then prep the sternum -- I mean the chest where the sternotomy is going to take place.  So --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,367,15,4,To your knowledge was there any difficulty on the part of the anesthesiologist in exchanging the tubes?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
68,370,15,7,I have no recollection.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,371,15,8,Okay.  So then --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
70,372,15,9,"It wasn't brought up to me, but I have no idea.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,374,15,11,Okay.  Is that something if there was a problem that you would have noted in your -- put in your operative note?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
72,377,15,14,"Not in my note, but it would be probably noted by the anesthesiologist, I would imagine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,380,15,17,Fair enough. At some point then postoperatively a tracheostomy patient with need for a tracheostomy is going to have a tracheostomy tube reinserted.  Is that correct?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
74,386,15,23,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,387,15,24,"Do you have or is there at duPont here -- I'll do this separately.  Is there at duPont any policy, procedure, or protocol for how long after the initial cardiac operation one should wait before reinserting the tracheostomy?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
76,394,16,6,"I'm not sure of a written policy. I think that in general as a medical guideline we operate, you know, under the principle that generally if all is well, within, you know, 24 to 48 hours we will reinsert a tracheostomy considering the fact that it's amazing how quickly a tracheostomy orifice will close down. And then once that starts happening and you're trying to dilate and put this foreign body there again, there is possibility of bleeding, et cetera, et cetera, and that's the last thing we want, is blood in the airway, particularly in someone who has these kind of, you know, issues. So I would say the norm is probably 48 hours, you know, give or take.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,412,16,24,I think you said maybe even as early as 24.  Is that correct?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
78,415,17,2,"If everything is well, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,416,17,3,"Well, I looked at the date involved here.  The surgery was on 3/27.  That was a Thursday.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
80,419,17,6,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,420,17,7,"The procedure that we're concerned with where you were called in emergently was on the 29th, which was a Saturday.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
82,423,17,10,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,424,17,11,"Is that a usual thing here at duPont for -- in a patient like this who needs a tracheostomy exchange, to do it on a Saturday?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
84,428,17,15,It wouldn't be unusual.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,429,17,16,"Were you aware that it was going to take place in this case, in Lily Lynn Trudnak's case, that Dr. Barth was going to do it on a Saturday?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
86,433,17,20,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,434,17,21,And you said you -- would you have an objection to waiting another couple of days until a Monday if that were necessary?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
88,437,17,24,I wouldn't see a reason to wait.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,439,18,1,Okay.  But would it cause a problem?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
90,441,18,3,"Well, it's hard to -- it's hard to know.  You know, I've seen trachs close in, you know, less than 72 hours or just about where it's been difficult to reinsert, you know, the tube again.  So yeah, we generally don't go there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,447,18,9,"Okay.  All right.  So who determined when the tracheostomy was going to be changed?  Was that your determination, or was that Dr. Barth?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
92,451,18,13,I think it was probably a discussion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,453,18,15,Okay.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
94,454,18,16,"I mean, I don't have a specific recollection of that, but generally speaking that's the way it will go. We will talk with the person who -- or the team that would generally be doing that, which would include ENT, anesthesiologist, and, you know, people in the ICU and surgeon and said everything looks good, we should go ahead and do this. That's generally the way this goes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,465,19,2,And were you aware that it was going to be done that Saturday?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
96,467,19,4,"I believe so because -- yeah, I believe so because I believe I was on call that weekend.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,470,19,7,"Okay.  So when you're on call, you don't stay in the hospital.  Is that correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
98,473,19,10,No.  Unless there's something that requires my attention.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,475,19,12,How are you notified if there's an emergency that you have to attend to?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
100,477,19,14,I generally get called.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,478,19,15,Telephone?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
102,479,19,16,"Telephone, beeper.  Generally, yeah, telephone or beeper, direct call.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,481,19,18,"On a weekend -- I understand that there's a full team that needs to be assembled to do a cardiothoracic operation, and you have -- there's a special dedicated cardiothoracic team here including nurses --",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
104,487,19,24,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,489,20,1,"-- and physician assistant and perfusionist and so forth. What's the availability of that team, to your knowledge, on the weekend? Are they here at the hospital, or are they on call remotely?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
106,495,20,7,"No.  The vast majority are on call within I would say, you know, 15 minutes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,497,20,9,Okay.  And that was my next question.  Is there sort of a distance or a time limit?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
108,500,20,12,"I mean, most folks, if you looked at them, we're incredibly close.  I live eight minutes away.  The perfusionist is probably ten.  The scrub nurse is five.  So yeah, we're pretty close.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,505,20,17,And do you recall where you were when you got the notification you were needed that day?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
110,508,20,20,"No.  Most likely home, but no, I don't recall specifically.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,510,20,22,Do you recall how long it took you to come in?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
112,512,20,24,"Nothing.  I mean, I was here in really -- the time I got the call until -- it would have been certainly less than ten minutes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,517,21,4,"Do you recall who notified you, who called you?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
114,519,21,6,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,520,21,7,"And do you know what information you were given, anything as to why you were needed?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
116,523,21,10,"My recollection was Baby Trudnak, they were doing the trach change and they had difficulty and --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,526,21,13,I'll go to that part.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
118,527,21,14,-- they need you to come in emergently.  That's all.  And then that was it.  I was on my way.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,530,21,17,"That is -- I have now in front of you your note from that day, the 29th, which is Bates No. 157 --",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
120,533,21,20,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,534,21,21,"-- and, for the record, continues to 158.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
122,536,21,23,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,537,21,24,So we can refer to that if you need to. Did you proceed immediately to OR 1 when you got here?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
124,542,22,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,543,22,5,Okay.  And who was -- do you recall who was already in the operating room when you got there?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
126,546,22,8,"I believe that a scrub nurse of cardiac and a perfusionist and Dr. Barth and one of our anesthesiologists and a number of other people who I don't know who they are, but I remember other people.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,551,22,13,"Okay.  The record reflects that that was Dr. Seshachar.  Everybody refers to him, I'm learning, as Dr. Abhaya.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
128,554,22,16,"Abhaya, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,555,22,17,Does that refresh your memory?  Was it Dr. Abhaya who was there?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
130,557,22,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,558,22,20,And what was going on when you came in?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
132,560,22,22,"I think they were doing cardiac compressions.  I'm not entirely -- I think they were doing cardiac compressions, and they were still talking about the airway. I'm not entirely sure.  You know, when I came in, I see that they're doing cardiac compressions, and then I just went on to do what I do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,569,23,6,Okay.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
134,570,23,7,"And so I'm not really looking around what else is happening.  And at the time my job was to make sure we could get the chest open and if need be put the patient on ECMO.  And so people are getting things ready.  We're opening the chest. And then basically the baby had, you know, return of circulation and we didn't put the patient on ECMO.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,579,23,16,"And fair to say in order to open the chest, you would have that same concern with the tracheostomy, if a tracheostomy goes in, you would need to have an endotracheal tube placed?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
136,584,23,21,"Not really.  If you're in that scenario, then it's like a different -- a different sense of priorities.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,587,23,24,"Do you remember whether there was a tracheostomy in the field, tracheostomy tube or not?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
138,591,24,3,I don't recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,592,24,4,And I've had some testimony from Mr. Woodford --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
140,594,24,6,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,595,24,7,-- that when he arrived you were already there.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
142,597,24,9,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,598,24,10,"You were gowned, and you instructed him don't worry about scrubbing or changing into scrub clothes, just put on a gown.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
144,601,24,13,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,602,24,14,Is that consistent with your recollection?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
146,604,24,16,Probably.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,605,24,17,Is that what you likely did yourself?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
148,607,24,19,"If someone is dead, just about, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,609,24,21,And who else was with you at the table during your part of this procedure?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
150,611,24,23,Probably a scrub nurse to my right and someone in front of me.  You tell me it's Woodford.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,615,25,2,"Woodford, yeah.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
152,616,25,3,Then it's probably Woodford.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,617,25,4,Okay.  And where was Dr. Barth when you arrived?  Do you recall?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
154,619,25,6,He was in the room.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,620,25,7,Okay.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
156,621,25,8,"Because I remember having two or three words with him, but I don't know specifically.  I remember sort of like the voice and then what we exchanged.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,625,25,12,"Okay.  Do you remember not necessarily the words but sort of the gist, the essence of what it was that you exchanged at that time as far as information about the patient?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
158,630,25,17,"Basically we took the patient to get the trach changed and things, you know, deteriorated and the baby arrested.  And I think the endotracheal tube was in place by then.  That part I'm not entirely clear.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,635,25,22,Fair enough.  Fair enough. Did you ever learn or did you get information at that time or sometime later how long she had been in arrest by the time that you arrived?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
160,641,26,3,A few minutes.  I don't have the specifics.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,643,26,5,Okay.  And when you opened the chest --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
162,645,26,7,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,646,26,8,-- did you find anything structurally amiss or disturbed from your prior surgery?  Was everything in place and as you expected it to be?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
164,650,26,12,"Yeah.  I mean, I'm just reading. But my recollection is that, to your question, is no, I didn't find anything unusual.  Then reading my note seems like the obvious things that you looked at, there was nothing out of the ordinary.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,656,26,18,"She was -- when the chest was open, however, there was no cardiac activity at that point, correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
166,659,26,21,"Seemingly, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,660,26,22,And you performed direct massage of the heart at that time?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
168,662,26,24,"That's what is written, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,664,27,1,And following that within how long would you say it took for the spontaneous activity of the heart to return?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
170,667,27,4,"Oh, very shortly because normally if we open the chest and there is no activity and we don't get it going, we cannulate right away.  And that happens generally in a period of five minutes, and so this has got to be less than five.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
171,673,27,10,"And Mr. Duncan, the perfusionist that I deposed --",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
172,675,27,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,676,27,13,-- said there's always a bypass apparatus primed --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
174,678,27,15,Ready to go.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
175,679,27,16,-- set up and ready to go.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
176,680,27,17,You got it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
177,681,27,18,And that oddly enough the room in which it is is actually right off --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
178,683,27,20,"Adjacent, yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
179,684,27,21,Which is -- Room 1 I understand is not the usual room that you operate in.  Is that correct?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
180,687,27,24,No.  Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
181,689,28,1,But in this case it was right next door if they needed it?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
182,691,28,3,"Well, let me just correct that. It's a room where we commonly do cardiac procedures.  But usually we reserve another room for open cardiac surgery.  So if there is an emergency, then we use that room, an emergency that requires open cardiac surgery like an aortic dissection or something like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
183,699,28,11,So then in your note you say the sternum was left open.  Just can you explain for me why you decided to leave the sternum open at that time?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
184,703,28,15,"I generally do as a precaution in anyone who has arrested.  I don't know how they're going to behave, and that would expedite, you know, us getting back and do what we need to do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
185,708,28,20,Okay.  Fair enough.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
186,709,28,21,So yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,710,28,22,"And then you brought her back for closure the next day, I think.  Let me see if I can get that.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
188,714,29,1,"Okay.  Yeah, closure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
189,715,29,2,Looks like -- there we go.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
190,716,29,3,Woodford was there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
191,717,29,4,"Woodford was there, and Dr. Seshachar was there again, correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
192,719,29,6,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
193,720,29,7,"And I'm looking at, for the record, that note starts on page 158, Bates No. 158. You stated in there -- you can see my highlighting.  Okay?  I didn't mean for you to see that, but it's okay for you to see that. It says postoperative recovery has been excellent.  You meant that in terms of her cardiac status.  Is that correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
194,731,29,18,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
195,732,29,19,Did you have any knowledge at that time about any other -- any injury she had experienced due to her cardiac arrest?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_chat
196,735,29,22,Objection to the form of the question. You can answer.,side_chat,MR. BALAGUER,start_answer
197,739,30,1,"I think that the reason why we left the sternum open is to make sure that her hemodynamics would be sound and they would not be an issue, and that would allow us a period of observation.  So after that has taken place and everything seems fine, then we proceeded with the sternal closure. Now, regarding your question, it's impossible really for anyone to say what kind of morbidity she could have suffered from this particular event considering that she's had multiple events that were more profound than this in the previous hospitalization.  So it would be really impossible to say, okay, here is the causality for this. All we know at this particular time is that circulation is good, there is no evidence of any organ dysfunction, liver function's normal, patient is making urine, and the renal function is normal and there is no other evidence that would make us believe that circulation remains vulnerable.  So we closed the chest.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
198,764,31,1,"Now, in the -- following that closure --",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
199,766,31,3,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
200,767,31,4,"And I'm going to go down to the next day, I think it was, or two days, three days.  Two days later.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
201,770,31,7,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
202,771,31,8,On the 1st of April Dr. Richard Schmidt -- do you know Dr. Schmidt?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
203,773,31,10,"He's one of the ENT specialists, yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
204,775,31,12,"Dr. Schmidt then brought Lily back to the operating room.  This is his note. I don't expect you to be familiar with it, but I'll represent to you that they did a direct laryngoscopy --",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
205,780,31,17,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
206,781,31,18,-- bronchoscopy --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
207,782,31,19,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
208,783,31,20,-- and were able to exchange the endotracheal tube for a tracheostomy tube. Is that your understanding?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
209,786,31,23,"Based on the document, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
210,787,31,24,Okay.  Do you know why it was Dr. Schmidt and not Dr. Barth who brought the patient back?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
211,791,32,3,"I have no idea.  Maybe he was on call, meaning the services structure their work differently, some people in the OR some people do consults, et cetera.  I have no idea.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
212,796,32,8,So fair to say that you did not specifically request him to do this part of the procedure?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
213,799,32,11,"Oh, no.  No.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
214,800,32,12,"And then you continued.  She did, from my understanding from the hemodynamic standpoint, then, she did well after this. Is that correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
215,804,32,16,"Yes, that's my recollection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
216,805,32,17,Okay.  And we're going to skip way ahead --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
217,807,32,19,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
218,808,32,20,-- to the next time that you --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
219,809,32,21,"I mean, mind you, this patient is VACTERL, correct?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
220,811,32,23,She's VACTERL.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
221,812,32,24,"So -- association.  So that brings, you know, a host of different medical issues, and no surprising the patient remained, you know, in the hospital for an extended period of time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
222,818,33,5,Absolutely.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
223,819,33,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
224,820,33,7,"Absolutely.  And my understanding is that then in October, October 16th to be specific, and I'll find that page.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
225,823,33,10,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
226,824,33,11,"You then brought her back.  You were involved along with Dr. Schmidt in revising her trachea or reconstructing her trachea, correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
227,828,33,15,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
228,829,33,16,And -- I hope I don't make you dizzy moving these page like that. So tracheal stenosis.  This is Dr. Schmidt's report.  I don't expect you to be familiar with that.  But here we have your report.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
229,835,33,22,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,836,33,23,And did you review this in preparation for today as well?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
231,839,34,1,A piece of it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
232,840,34,2,Okay.  I'll represent to you that Dr. Schmidt says that this was a sleeve reconstruction.  Any reason that you and Dr. Schmidt selected that procedure?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
233,844,34,6,You mean sliding?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
234,845,34,7,Sliding.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
235,846,34,8,Sleeve and sliding are two different operations.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
236,848,34,10,Are they different?  Then I misspoke.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
237,850,34,12,Very different.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,851,34,13,So this is a sliding reconstruction.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
239,853,34,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,854,34,16,"And explain for me, because I'm not familiar with it, explain for me what --",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
241,856,34,18,Sliding?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,857,34,19,-- what the sliding consists of.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
243,858,34,20,The sliding consists in the fact that you basically transect the trachea --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,860,34,22,Right.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
245,861,34,23,"-- and open, you know, one end anteriorly and the other end posteriorly, and then you slide one on top of the other. So you effectively shorten the trachea, but you widen it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,867,35,4,Understood.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
247,868,35,5,The advantage of that is that it doesn't use any foreign material.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
248,870,35,7,Right.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
249,871,35,8,It has the possibility and potential for growth.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,873,35,10,And it doesn't interrupt the vasculature?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
251,875,35,12,"And it doesn't -- well, any surgery in the trachea doesn't, I mean, must not interrupt the vasculature, otherwise you've got a brig problem on your hands.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,879,35,16,"You could have necrosis, correct. Okay. And did that procedure go well as far as your recollection is concerned?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
253,883,35,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,884,35,21,"And then after that did you continue to follow Lily?  I'm going to refer to her as Lily, Baby Rancourt.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
255,887,35,24,"I mean, I will speak with a parent. I mean, after the recovery from this part, you know, of reconstruction and whatnot, the care was largely driven by a host of other medical issues, and so I would not be the primary person coordinating that and would not -- but I would certainly touch base and visit with the parents, particularly when they're in the step-down unit, just to see how things are going until the time that she was discharged.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
256,899,36,11,After her discharge did she come back down to see you again?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
257,901,36,13,"I don't recall that.  And that would be unusual because she spent years, such a long time, then by now, everything that has to be cleared after a surgical reconstruction has the clear, and you're pretty much healed.  And so it would be rather unusual for someone to spend, you know, several months in the hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
258,909,36,21,"You would expect she would need cardiology follow-up, though.  Is that correct?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
259,912,36,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,914,37,1,Did you have any recommendation that you gave the Trudnaks for who to follow up with when they got back to Connecticut?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
261,918,37,5,"I think that we had a conversation when they were here as to who would be the point person in cardiology.  And I think that generally the way this will work is that that individual would, you know, make a call as to who should be the person for them to follow with up there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
262,925,37,12,You meant --,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
263,926,37,13,I don't recall making a recommendation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
264,928,37,15,You meant the point person here?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
265,929,37,16,The point person here will connect with the person there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
266,931,37,18,Got it.  Gotcha. And have you had any contact with the family or with the patient since she was discharged?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
267,935,37,22,"I don't recall.  Certainly not in the recent past, but no, I don't recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
268,937,37,24,"Okay.  All right.  Now I'm going to ask you some questions, I just want to know any conversations that you remember having with other persons about the incidents on 3/29, about the emergency case.  And in this I don't want to know anything that you discussed with your attorney, obviously, but for other physicians that you worked with, any of the nurses, any of the staff. First off, did you have any discussion with Dr. Seshachar, either during or after the case, that you recall?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
269,950,38,12,I don't really have a specific recollection about a conversation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
270,952,38,14,Okay.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
271,953,38,15,"I am pretty sure, though, that we had a peer review during our, you know, review of cases that we commonly and routinely do on Thursdays.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
272,957,38,19,Okay.  I don't want to know anything about what went on at that peer review.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
273,960,38,22,"No.  And I don't recall what went on there, but I'm sure that she made that list and a conversation, you know, was had about the events, the entire episode of care, the beginning surgery, the second surgery, the fact that, you know, there was this, you know, event in between.  I'm sure this is -- that's routine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
274,969,39,6,"Did you have any conversation -- what I'm looking for is any conversations that you may have had with any other care providers or any other persons outside of the peer review process itself, outside of that meeting, or outside of your conversations with your counsel.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
275,976,39,13,I have no recollection of that.  I can't really tell you anything because I just don't remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
276,979,39,16,Do you remember anybody from risk management or hospital administration approaching you and asking you about this case?,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
277,983,39,20,"I don't.  I don't remember.  I don't think so, but I have no certainty.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
278,985,39,22,"Do you remember, getting back to the case.  I'm sorry to jump around.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
279,987,39,24,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
280,989,40,1,"While you were in the operating room we know that there was an anesthesiologist there, Dr. Seshachar.",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
281,992,40,4,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
282,993,40,5,And you and your team were there.,q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
283,994,40,6,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
284,995,40,7,"Do you recall any of the cardiologists or intensivists being there, anybody like Dr. Baffa or any of the intensive care people?",q,MR. ZAKEOSIAN,start_answer
285,999,40,11,"Perhaps the person who was on call in the intensive care unit that Saturday, as you said, but that would be an assumption.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

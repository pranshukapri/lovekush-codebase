910,2109,80,16,"Well, you got some rust, dent, whatever.  You do the best you can getting rid of the rust and the dent, and you apply your Bondo.  You mix it up with the hardener and apply that like a putty or a paste, smooth as you can get it, let it dry.  And then you plane it down and then sand it down and maybe put a little bit more on there until it looks good.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
911,2117,80,24,"And that process that you just described, is that how you would apply body filler regardless of the vehicle?",q,MS. VELLUCCI,start_answer
912,2121,81,3,Depending how big your damage is.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
913,2122,81,4,"So if the dent was larger, would you put more?",q,MS. VELLUCCI,start_answer
914,2124,81,6,You might have to put a piece of sheet metal over it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
915,2126,81,8,"Okay.  But as far as when you were working with the body filler product, those are the steps that you followed?",q,MS. VELLUCCI,start_answer

917,2130,81,12,Okay.,q,MS. VELLUCCI,start_answer
918,2131,81,13,It was a long time ago.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
919,2132,81,14,"And I think the answer may be that it depends on the size, but could you approximate how long it is that you spent sanding the body filler?",q,MS. VELLUCCI,start_answer
920,2136,81,18,"Depending how big the damage is.  You sand it fairly simply.  It's fairly soft material.  You had sanding boards.  You had different tools, you know.  You had like screen -- I forget what they're called now but like a rasp-type thing for when it was really rough, you know, you knock all the heavy stuff off.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
921,2145,82,2,So you'd first use a rasp to sand it down?,q,MS. VELLUCCI,start_answer
922,2147,82,4,"If it was bad enough, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
923,2148,82,5,And then you'd use sandpaper?,q,MS. VELLUCCI,start_answer
924,2149,82,6,"Yeah, you could use paper.  We didn't have that many power tools back then.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

930,2159,82,16,"Yeah.  I mean, I got the car -- I got the car around June of '72, so it would have been the end of the Argo -- it would have been the end of the Argo experience, you know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
931,2163,82,20,You also mentioned doing some carburetor work on this vehicle.  Did that involve a gasket as well?,q,MS. VELLUCCI,start_answer

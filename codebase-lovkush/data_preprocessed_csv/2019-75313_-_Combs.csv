1,195,7,11,"Good afternoon, Mr. Combs.  We met briefly off the record before the deposition.  My name is Rick Atwood.  I'm an attorney for the shareholders in litigation involving the Berkshire acquisition of Precision Castparts. Did you participate in the drafting of the merger proxy that went to Precision Castparts shareholders in connection with their vote on the merger?",q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
2,204,7,20,I wouldn't say I participated in it.  I reviewed it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3,206,7,22,Did you review it before it was final?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
4,207,7,23,"I reviewed it before it went public, but I can't say -- I mean, nothing changed after I looked at it, to my knowledge.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,211,8,1,Do you recall how it is that you came to be reviewing a draft of the proxy?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
6,213,8,3,"I don't remember who sent it over to me, but just in the normal course of business, it got sent to me.  It said, Take a look at it, review it. Let me know if anything should be changed or anything is different than your recollection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
7,218,8,8,Did you provide any responsive comments?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
8,219,8,9,No.  And everything checked out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,220,8,10,Okay. When did you start with Berkshire?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
10,222,8,12,"Late 2010, early 2011.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,223,8,13,"And at the time you started, did Berkshire have any investment in Precision?",q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
12,225,8,15,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,226,8,16,So you initiated that position?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
14,227,8,17,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,228,8,18,When?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
16,229,8,19,"Ah, I believe 2012, if I remember correctly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,231,8,21,Do you recall -- was it set up as a purchase of shares on the open market?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
18,233,8,23,It was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,234,8,24,Do you recall how many shares you purchased?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
20,237,9,1,"I don't.  I don't remember how many shares. We ended up owning maybe 3, 3 and a half percent of the company, if I remember correctly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,241,9,5,Do you recall what you paid for your initial investment in Precision?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
22,243,9,7,Oh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,244,9,8,In terms of per share?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
24,245,9,9,"Right.  I would be guessing, but I think it is an approximate guess, it would be about $150 a share.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,248,9,12,"Do you recall, as Berkshire added to its position over time, the prices -- the range of prices that it paid per share?",q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
26,251,9,15,I don't remember the range.  But we didn't add that much after the initial purchase.  It was mostly done all at once.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,254,9,18,So virtually the full 3 to 3 and a half percent was that the first investment?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
28,256,9,20,Right.  To my recollection.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,257,9,21,Why did you choose to invest in Precision?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
30,258,9,22,"It was a great company.  It had a great track record, with a great management team.  And it was well positioned in the aerospace business, and I thought it was relatively inexpensive at $150 a share.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,264,10,2,What kind of investigation did you do before making the purchase?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
32,266,10,4,"So I'd say there was both quantitative and qualitative.  On the quantitative side, you look at the history, whether it is Value Line, Morningstar, you look at the performance.  The operating margins by individual business lines to see if there is anything aberrant or one time or cyclical, speculative, that kind of thing. Then on the qualitative side, we spent a lot of time doing what are often times referred to as channel checks, talking to customers, suppliers, ex-employees, et cetera, to gain a better understanding of what -- how the numbers come about, what the mode of the business is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,279,10,17,How long did that process take before you made the purchase?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
34,281,10,19,"Well, that is hard to say because in this instance, we were doing checks on the aerospace industry as well, and so the two morphed. But to give an approximate timeline, it might have been somewhere between 3 to 6 months, as best I can recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,287,10,25,Who worked on that with you?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
36,289,11,1,"I had an analyst, Liz Barney.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

41,294,11,6,Do you know where she is now?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
42,295,11,7,"Yes, she's at a firm called -- oh, I will have to think of it.  I'm blanking on it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,297,11,9,Do you recall why she left?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
44,298,11,10,"She had been with me for eight years, and, you know, there was really no option -- she was an analyst for me.  She primarily did channel checks. You know, she wasn't going to move into a portfolio management role or anything like that, and so where she went to, she is in that role.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,304,11,16,Were you happy with her work?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
46,305,11,17,Yes.  She was a good analyst.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

50,320,12,6,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,321,12,7,What is it?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
52,322,12,8,"These are -- I believe this is a note to myself in my calendar.  I was putting in a call, probably to Jay Khetani, who was the investor relations person for Precision at the time.  I had never spoken, as it points out, to Mark and the stock had fallen.  And I was reading some transcripts where Mark had been at some investor conferences and he sounded frustrated.  And so I was making some notes to myself and saved it in my calendar, reached out to Jay, and wanted to speak to Mark, wanted to set up a meeting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,333,12,19,So were these notes of things that you intended to say once you had the conversation or things that you said after the conversation?  Notes of what you had sent?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
54,337,12,23,"Before.  These would have been notes that I gave to myself, you know, to talk to Mark beforehand.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,341,13,1,Did you actually get a chance to talk with him?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
56,343,13,3,"Not -- not on this date at this time, no. I spoke to Jay, who said that, as I recall, that, and he said that he passed my thoughts and comments on to -- on to Mark.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,347,13,7,So when is the first time you had direct communication with Mr. Donegan?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
58,349,13,9,"Direct communication would have been, as best I can recall, is when he came out to Omaha in June, I believe it was. I don't think it was him that called me back to set it up.  I think Jay emailed with some dates.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,355,13,15,"I note the reference to ""recruiting firm"" here in this exhibit.  It is the very last item.",q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
60,357,13,17,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,358,13,18,What is that about?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
62,359,13,19,"You know, there were -- well, he was -- he was -- Mark was clearly frustrated on some calls. As I referenced before, we do a lot of channel checks.  There were plenty of ex-employees out in the industry.  I can't remember whether it was one of them or another asset management firm. Somewhere -- someone somewhere along the line had mentioned that they -- and this is just gossip, it was never verified -- that -- that Mark may or may not have been talking to a recruiting firm. So this was a note to myself to make sure that he was going to be there, because he was a core part of the thesis in managing the company.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,373,14,7,Did you ever hear that he had been planning to retire from the company toward the end of 2015?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
64,376,14,10,"Not at this time, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,377,14,11,Did you subsequently hear that?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
66,378,14,12,I said -- I didn't -- not that unequivocally.  I had heard rumors.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,380,14,14,Did you ever ask him about it?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
68,381,14,15,"I didn't.  No, I didn't ask him because I feel -- by the time that I heard that, I knew Mark well enough to know, and we had had enough conversations about his future at Berkshire and his commitment to the company when we did the acquisition, that I wasn't concerned about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,387,14,21,"As a result of those conversations, you were --",q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
70,389,14,23,"I felt confident that he would be around, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,391,14,25,"And then just above that it says, ""Just want you to know that not only do you have our full support, but I can unequivocally state that we only own the shares because of your presence."" What did you mean by that?",q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
72,397,15,5,"Yeah.  And hence the reference to recruiting firm under.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that I was baiting him, but what I was doing was seeing -- you know, no -- the CEO is not in a fiduciary position to tell if they were looking, necessarily. So I wanted to put him in somewhat of an awkward position to say, hey, look, we love the company, keep doing exactly what you are doing, don't make any short-term decisions.  We are going to be here, we are long-term supporters, and by the way, you are an important piece of that, just to see what his reaction was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,410,15,18,Did you ever get a chance to communicate that to him?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
74,412,15,20,"When he came out in June, I'm sure I did, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,414,15,22,Do you recall that conversation or how it went?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
76,416,15,24,"I don't recall the specifics of it, but what I would say is that I recall, from that June meeting, would be that he showed unwavering commitment to the company, which is pretty much what you would expect a CEO to say. I felt -- I believed him and I felt confident that he was going to be there for the long term.  But that is exactly what I would have expected to him to say, too.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,426,16,8,Did you communicate to him the notion that you were invested in the company because of his presence?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
78,429,16,11,"I'm sure I did, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,430,16,12,So was this a meeting where part of it was without Mr. Buffett and part of it was with Mr. Buffett?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
80,433,16,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,434,16,16,Do you recall whether you communicated that sentiment in the without Mr. Buffett part or the with Mr. Buffett part?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
82,437,16,19,"That would have been probably without -- without Warren, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,439,16,21,Who else was there at that meeting?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
84,440,16,22,"Well, as I can recall, it would have been myself, Mark, I think Shawn and probably Jay.  Shawn Hagel, the CFO.  So the three of them were on one side of the table; I was on the other.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,445,17,1,When did you first start mulling over the concept of acquiring the company outright?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
86,447,17,3,"Well, I would say, you know, these things are always gray, right?  Because there is no black and white.  But I would say that when they came out here and we discussed -- we discussed really the company in June.  And so I guess the best way I can answer your question is when I then subsequently reached out to Mark, and it was after that meeting in June.  So it would have been some time around the 4th of July, as best I recall. And that is when I kind of extended an olive branch, so to speak, to say, hey, we loved the meeting, we love the company.  All of these things reiterated, if you ever want to do something with us, let me know, and we can proceed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,461,17,17,"So did the -- did the concept, at least from your perspective, of maybe buying the company outright occur between that meeting and that call?",q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
88,464,17,20,"Yes.  The purpose of that meeting was twofold in my mind. One, I had never met Mark, so it was to get to know him, get a better read on him.  I already knew the company, so there wasn't anything they really told me that I didn't know, that I can recall.  And it was to get Warren to meet Mark, and to get to know the company a little bit better, which, you know, we frequently do. And so after that, then, I had a couple of conversations with Warren, brought him up to speed. He asked some questions.  And that is when I reached out to Mark after talking to Warren to extend the olive branch.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,479,18,9,Did you talk about the conversation with Mr. Buffett?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
90,481,18,11,I'm sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,482,18,12,The conversation that you just referenced with Mr. Buffett --,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
92,484,18,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,485,18,15,-- as that -- was there a discussion in that conversation about maybe buying the whole company?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
94,488,18,18,"I'm sure there was, yeah.  When I -- when I would have reached out to Mark, to extend the olive branch, it was only on Warren's authority.  It wouldn't have been on mine alone.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,492,18,22,Was there any discussion of a potential purchase price between you and Mr. Buffett during that time frame?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
96,495,18,25,"Well, that was -- things were still preliminary at that point.  So the stock was trading, as best I can recall, around 210.  You know, we probably said something to the fact that, you know, if you take a 20 percent premium that would put it around 250.  And I think I could have seen Warren saying something to the effect, well, it is -- maybe it takes X amount to get it done, but it was still very, very preliminary at that point. And so I took some notes.  I called Mark. I did not extend a price, because things were still very preliminary.  I just wanted to feel him out. And he said exactly what I would expected him to say, which is I will take it to my board as a fiduciary, et cetera, et cetera.  And so it wasn't until -- to answer your question, it wasn't until after Mark then came back and expressed some interest in proceeding and wanted to know a price, then we had to come up with a price.  And that is when we came up with the 235.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,516,19,20,And what was the mechanism for coming up with the price?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
98,518,19,22,"Well, there is no formula or anything to it.  You know, Warren and I talked about the company, 95 percent of what we discussed in these things is qualitative.  And so he asked me what the key risk factors were.  We talked through the margins of the company, how consistent they had been.  How they had slowly trended up.  The dependence and reliance on aerospace, where we were in the cycle.  So it was a very qualitative discussion. And at the end of the day, you know, I use Morningstar; Warren uses Value Line, and, you know, he came up with a number.  And we discussed it, but he came up with it.  And, you know, there is no real formula to it or anything.  It is -- the stock had probably trailed off a bit by then to maybe 190 and change or something.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,536,20,14,Was it a premium to the stock price like before?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
100,538,20,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,539,20,17,Did you have any discussions with Mr. Buffett in the time frame leading up to making the offer about the acquisition's component of Precision Castparts's overall strategy?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
102,543,20,21,I'm sorry.  Can you say it one more time? I'm not sure I followed.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

107,554,21,6,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,555,21,7,It gets a little confusing.  We are talking about an acquisition involving acquisitions.,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
109,557,21,9,"That is why I wanted to make sure I was answering your question properly. No -- well, the only -- so going forward, no.  What Warren and I would have discussed is when we were looking at the historical numbers, I'm sure that he asked me how much was acquisition driven. And I would have walked him through, in fact, I even vaguely recall laying out, you know, by quarter, or by year how many deals they had done.  And we talked about most companies do not do deals very well.  And so that is -- it can sometimes be a red flag. And so, and you want to know whether a company has achieved their growth organically or through acquisition, through one big acquisition; lots of small acquisitions. We talked about it in a historical context, but not in a going forward context.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,575,22,1,And what was the view of how Precision Castparts had performed in terms of its acquisition activity compared to some of the examples that you just mentioned?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
111,579,22,5,"Yeah, I think given their track record overall, you don't really, really know, to be honest.  Because companies, you know, melded in. Most of their acquisitions were small, tuck-ins.  I remember Timet was one in particular that Mark and I did talk about when he came out, because they had just recently completed it.  And according to Mark, it had done well. But you don't really know from the outside looking in, almost with any acquisition, how it goes.  And you know the amalgamation, the results, but, you know, we have enough pattern recognition, looking at these things, our general sense that they had done pretty good.  You can look at good will write-offs and things like that.  Yeah, I don't -- yeah, I'm sure there were some hits and misses in there.  I think overall they had done okay. But they have a good core business, too. So...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,598,22,24,And Berkshire expected Precision to continue on with its business plan including potential acquisitions of its own if the merger took place?,q,MR. ATWOOD,start_answer
113,603,23,3,"You know, we didn't have that discussion. I think the expectation from us generally is that each of our managers, you know, the way we are structured, generally speaking, they generate a certain amount of cash, they have a necessary component to reinvest in the business, and we are the allocators of capital. And so whether it is -- any of our subsidiaries, small, medium or large, it is generally expected within some reasonable threshold that they come to us, because we are the allocators of capital. And so we never really had any kind of, I would say -- I think putting the term expectation on it would be too hard or too heavy.  There wasn't any kind of discussion of that. I think the general expectation was that they would continue to execute well in terms of the market share in the aerospace industry, and continued to gain a higher dollar component of -- with Boeing and Airbus and GE.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

So after the acquisition, I certainly spoke to both Mark, and I believe his name is Kirk Pulley, who is his M & A guy on specific deals. And I want to be clear, there was not conversations about nebulously doing deals.  So in terms of expectations, or how much do you think you will be able to allocate this year, those kind of conversations didn't happen. But when Mark or Kirk had a specific deal, we would and still do discuss those.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Well, it looks like they reported third quarter '15 earnings, and my analyst, for any company that she covers, and my current analyst, we have about a dozen names in the portfolio, and they -- the purpose is they literally update me on the earnings. And in this case, it looks like -- I'm just skimming it -- that Precision missed.  And so then it looks like the purpose is her explaining, and it looks like due to oil and gas, and so forth and so on, and there was some de-stocking taking place and so forth.  And so she was kind of explaining why they missed. And I normally follow up with some questions.

140,724,27,20,"That, as I recall, she -- the -- the hit that so -- so oil, and I'm going off memory here, oil prices got cut in half or something from 80 to 40 around this time period. We -- she had spent all of her time focused -- all of our time on the aerospace side. So the oil and gas side caught us by surprise.  It wasn't something that we had really talked to the company about. And so then when we started to get our arms around it, you know, I think she's saying here, that she's just basically writing off oil and gas at zero in terms of our intrinsic value analysis. Although, all else being equal, she's saying, they will gain share, et cetera, et cetera, but I'm not giving them any credit for that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

142,747,28,17,"Well, she would have been saying -- although she had no buy, sell, or hold authority, she was just giving me her color in terms of, you know, at 200, she would like it.  And she probably either meant hold it or she would be okay buying more.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

So most analysts, when you are close to situation, you know, have a resistance on the way down. And so I felt like there was probably another shoe or two to drop.

And so my nature kind of proclivity would be to go back and say, did we miss anything? And you would -- I would naturally start with their acquisitions.  And so I probably asked her to go back and take the last five largest acquisitions they did, which is what this looks like, and just kind of re-underwrite them and talk to some ex-employees, see how they were doing, and kind of lay it all out for me so that I had a better kind of framework to think through that, is what I'm think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

207,942,36,4,"I was in Warren's office, and I was taking notes.  We were talking about the company itself. And as I said, I think the 250 came from the stock. As I can best recall, it was probably around 2 to 210 at the time.  So at a 20-ish percent premium would have been about 250. And I don't remember exactly, but I could see Warren saying something to the effect of, you know, that is what it would take to get done. And Warren would have said, why don't you give him a call?  And give Mark a call and feel him out, would be how Warren would say it. And this was all incredibly tentative. You know, this was not a months long process; he had literally been in here just a couple of days before. And so two things, I remember distinctly going through my mind is one, this felt very, very early, and two, I didn't -- I thought -- well, three things.  Two, I thought, if we got to that point, Warren should be the one extending the offer, not me.  It would mean more to Mark coming from Warren than me. Three, or -- and back to one, it felt very, very early because we were still early in the process. Three, I had no idea how he would react. And I didn't want to put in a compromised position where I'm giving him a number, and then you cross a threshold at that point where he has to take it to his board.  Maybe it puts the company in play and so forth. And so I just felt like it was too early all around to do that.  And so I did not go there. And even if you feel the conversation out, and if it were in person -- and also Warren -- I mean, Warren did not know this company as well as he knows some other larger companies.  And so having worked with him already at this point for five years, I also had a pretty good feel for Warren's comfort level.  And Warren hadn't gone through my documents or my notes at this point. So I just kind of knew Warren well enough to know, like, hey, look, we don't have to rush with this.  We can give it a week.  And to my recollection, that is exactly what happened.  Mark said, I will take it to the board and I will come back to you.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

I was probably going through the Qs, and I have got 10-K marked over in kind of the left-hand column there to actually add up how much they spent on acquisitions. And just kind of laying out me, either for myself, or for Warren, you know, how much they had spent.  It is a little bit of a fruitless exercise because you don't know what the earnings are associated with -- with this.  But you know how much they spent, certainly over a three-year time horizon, most of which was Timet. So I think I was probably trying to frame either for myself, or Warren.

Like, hey, they've spent $7 billion over three years, over a third of it was on Timet.  Here is their Timet-type thing.  And then these notes were probably either with Warren talking about the break up fee and, you know, language on walking away and getting approval from China.  It can always be challenging.

The core aerospace business has performed relatively in line, I would say.  It probably hasn't grown to the extent that we thought it would.  And then the other areas, they have certainly had some issues in fasteners, in Wyman Gordon and forged products and I believe in airframe products. So in an industrial company, when you have -- they call them incrementals on the positive side and decrementals on the negative.  And so those decrementals come through at a very, very high levels.  And so those margins, particularly in those lines of business, have hurt the company's overall performance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

245,1144,43,24,"Sure. When that dollar of revenue you lose on the top line in a high fixed cost business like an airline or something, it falls -- that dollar falls directly to the bottom line.  So rather if the business has a 10, 20, 30 percent margin, instead of falling at a 10, 20, 30 percent margin, it falls at a 100 percent margin. And so if you lose 10 or 20 percent top line in a fixed cost business, you have a massively outsized impact on the incremental margin.

And to some extent, you run into a law of large numbers at some point. And they have great market share where they are.  There aren't a lot of great acquisitions to make there.

Hopefully, they would never bring anything that's six to 8 deviations.  We generally trying to work with them. I strongly dissuaded Mark, in particular, from the Schultz acquisition.  But, ultimately, it was -- it was his decision as the CEO.  And he decided, chose to go forward with that. And so, as I referenced earlier, we feel like we are not operators of businesses, as Warren has publicly stated.  We are capital allocators. And so some of our managers like to look at acquisitions, some don't.  And sometimes the ones who are looking shouldn't, and sometimes the ones who aren't, should.  And that is the nature of the beast. And so we give our opinion, and if it were a huge acquisition that were completely out of left field, we would veto it.  But it takes a very high threshold for us to get to that point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3,585,16,16,Good morning.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
4,586,16,17,"My name is Larry Sugarman.  I'm one of the defense attorneys, and I'm going to be asking you the initial questions today.  I represent several of the defendants in your lawsuit. Just to go over a few quick ground rules to help today go smoothly, the first is although it feels like we're having a conversation back and forth, the court reporter is taking everything down that we both say while we're on the record.  For that reason, I'd ask that you do your best, and I will do the same, not to talk over one another. There will be many times when I start asking the question and you will know what the rest of the question is going to be, but I just ask to do your best to allow me to finish my entire question, and I will do my best not to begin a new question while you're in the middle of an answer.  Okay?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
5,607,17,13,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
6,608,17,14,"Because, again, we're creating a transcript.  In conversation it's very normal and acceptable to shake your head or say uh-huh because people know what you mean, but again, because this is for a court proceeding, because we have a court reporter, just do your best to give verbal responses to questions.  Okay?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
7,615,17,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
8,616,17,22,"If you can do your best just to keep your voice up so people on the phone and in the back of the room can hear you, that will be appreciated.  That, I can tell, already is going to be our biggest challenge.",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
9,622,18,3,I'll do my best.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
10,623,18,4,"I may ask questions from time to time that are just poor questions.  Again, I didn't come with a perfectly written list of questions that are grammatically correct.  So if I ask a question that doesn't sound right to you or it's confusing, it's probably just a bad question by me. So if that happens, don't answer it. Just tell me I don't understand the question, could you rephrase it, and I'm happy to.",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
11,633,18,14,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
12,634,18,15,"Because if you answer a question, we're going to assume you understood it.  Fair enough?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer

And what Larry just said is very accurate, and most of the time I'm sure the attorney will be accurate, but you're here to testify to your memory so I just don't want anyone referencing what Buck said or didn't say because they may be accurate, may be a little inaccurate.  Just go based on your memory.",side_chat,MR. DEATON,start_question

196,1017,33,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
197,1018,33,24,And he said he was a laser production engineer; does that sound right to you?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
198,1021,34,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
199,1022,34,3,Do you know anything more about what he did work-wise there?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
200,1024,34,5,"I actually only know from him telling me what he would do and how much the owners relied on him.  If a machine went down, they called him.  He would repair it, basically saving them a lot of money so they didn't have to call in the repair people from the companies that put the machines in there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
201,1031,34,12,"And when you're talking about doing repair work, do you know, for example, if the repair work he's doing is more computer-based versus kind of getting your hands dirty taking apart the machines?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
202,1036,34,17,Correct.  It was taking apart the machines and getting it up and running again.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
203,1038,34,19,Okay.  Do you know one way or the other if any of these machines contained any asbestos components?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
204,1041,34,22,I would have no way of knowing that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,1042,34,23,"Okay.  And again, Mr. Collins told us he worked at Laser Technologies -- back up -- strike that. Mr. Collins told us he worked at Metal Spinners from 1995 until about 2000.  Does that sound about right to you?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
206,1049,35,5,Sounds about right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
207,1050,35,6,"And then next he told us he worked at Laser Technologies in Concord, Massachusetts from 2000 to 2002 as a project engineer and CNC production engineer.  Does that sound right to you?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
208,1055,35,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,1056,35,12,Do you know during his employment at Laser Technologies whether he did any maintenance or repair work on any equipment at that facility?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
210,1060,35,16,"I think at that point he pretty much did whatever was required to get the job out the door.  And if that was to fix the equipment or program the equipment, he would do both.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,1064,35,20,Okay.  Do you know one way or the other if Mr. Collins would have worked with or around any asbestos products or components there?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer

219,1082,36,13,Do you know one way or the other if Mr. Collins worked with or around any asbestos components or parts while employed by Route 3A Motors?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
220,1086,36,17,I have no idea.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,1087,36,18,"Okay.  And then Mr. Collins told us that when he left Route 3A Motors in 2006, he then went on to work -- go back to Metal Spinners?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
222,1091,36,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

230,1102,37,8,Sadly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,1103,37,9,"I mean, as you know, we had the opportunity to speak with your husband, so we already know a lot of the details, and I'll try and keep it kind of brief and to the point because I know it's obviously emotional for you. I know he may have officially retired on July 31st of 2018, but was there a point in time when before that that he just couldn't work anymore?  Meaning like he stopped working at a certain point of time even though his retirement date was later?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
232,1115,37,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,1116,37,22,Do you recall when that was?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer

236,1120,38,1,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,1121,38,2,Okay.  And at that time how did he or the two of you together decide that he wasn't going to work anymore past May of 2018?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_chat

239,1127,38,8,"He had no quality of life, couldn't get out of the chair.  And I told him, I said, why don't you retire and get that stress off of your shoulders.  And so he agreed because it was always about work calling, how are you doing, do you think you're coming back soon. I'm like, you just got to get that off, so that's why we decided to do it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,1135,38,16,"Okay.  When he left the company, was there any type of severance package or retirement plan that he had?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
241,1138,38,19,"Initially, no.  I called his -- I was the one communicating with his boss and saying that I think this is the road we're going to be going down, and what is the severance package. And he said, well, there isn't one. So then when Buck and I talked -- I don't know how you refer to him -- I called him back and I told him that this was not our plan and if he could consider having, you know, do something because he was just a valuable employee, and he said he'd get back to me.  And so he did the next day.  He had talked to his brother the night before.  And they had decided to give Buck a package based on the number of years that he was there, and I think it rounded out to about 7,500 dollars.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,1155,39,11,"7,500 dollars a month, a year?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
243,1156,39,12,"No, total.  That was the severance package before taxes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,1158,39,14,"And since Mr. Collins retired in July of 2018, has he done any other type of work even if part-time?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
245,1161,39,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,1162,39,18,"Now, just shifting gears a little bit. Mr. Collins told us about your two daughters and how when they were infants and required diaper changes that both of you would participate?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
247,1167,39,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
248,1168,39,24,"Can you tell us, for your older daughter Molly, how long was she in diapers, approximately?  We won't tell her you told us.",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
249,1172,40,3,"Please don't.  I called her pediatrician crying one day saying, I can't believe she's still in diapers.  She said, don't worry, I never heard of a kid going off to college wearing one.  But anyways, she was very late wearing a diaper.  She was probably about three.  Yeah, it was three because my father was helping us at that point with her so I could start work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,1181,40,12,"So from the time she's a newborn until about age three, she's in diapers?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
251,1183,40,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,1184,40,15,"And then when it came just to Molly for that period of time, responsibility between you and your husband for changing diapers, how did that break down?  Meaning -- and again, I don't want you to get the wrong idea thinking on this particular day I did it; on that particular day he did it.  Just if you look at that three-year period of time.",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
253,1192,40,23,General.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
254,1193,40,24,"And if it helps to take first year, second year, third year, he just wants you to break it down any way that you can.",side_chat,MR. DEATON,start_question
255,1198,41,4,Whatever is comfortable for you.  Just over that three-year period of time if you had to break down between you and your husband what percentage of the time you changed diapers versus he did it?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
256,1203,41,9,"A standard day would be him going to work at 5:00 in the morning and coming back at 3:00 in the afternoon.  So from 3 to 5, he had her.  He wanted her.  I cooked.  It allowed me to do other things around the house. So from that other time -- so half the day, she was all mine.  The other half of the day, she was all his.  And he would get up in the middle of the night, change her diaper, let me sleep.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
257,1213,41,19,"But roughly, if you can, and I don't want you to guess, but just roughly if you had to think, I'm not trying to put numbers in your head either, but did you change the diapers half the time and he did it half the time, or did you do it more than he did it overall?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_chat
258,1220,42,1,Don't guess unless you know.,side_chat,MR. DEATON,start_answer
259,1222,42,3,I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
260,1223,42,4,"But if you can give Larry a fair estimate, again, including when he's at work and you're at home, you know, any way that you can do it is what he's looking at.",side_chat,MR. DEATON,start_answer

263,1232,42,13,That's 5 a.m.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
264,1233,42,14,To 3 p.m.?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
265,1234,42,15,To 3 p.m.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

268,1239,42,20,Roughly?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
269,1240,42,21,"Roughly.  And that was the first year. We were real hands on and we both wanted to -- I had my way of playing with her, and he had his way.  And you know, he wanted to do everything that I was doing, feeding her, bathing her, you know.  He was a very hands-on dad.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
270,1248,43,4,"And for diaper changes, did you and Mr. Collins, you know, put anything on Molly before the new diaper was put on such as a cream or powders, anything like that?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
271,1252,43,8,"Well, ideally, we would wipe her clean and then powder her.  And if she had a rash or anything, then we would put, like, a cream on her like a Desitin or something and still powder her, yeah, dry her up, so to speak.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
272,1257,43,13,"And for any of the powders that you used on Molly, you know, when she was in diapers, do you remember the brand names, trade names, or manufacturers' names?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
273,1261,43,17,"Absolutely.  It was Johnson & Johnson baby powder.  I grew up on it, powdered all my siblings with it.  It was what you did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
274,1264,43,20,"Now, how about with respect to Anna, how long was she in diapers?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
275,1266,43,22,She was a quick study.  She was out of diapers by two.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
276,1268,43,24,"Okay.  And with respect to Anna, if you can, can you give us a sense as to how often it was that you would change her diapers versus Mr. Collins?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
277,1273,44,4,"I would have to say the same because I was working when Anna came along, so he definitely had full responsibility when I went off to work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
278,1277,44,8,"And just so we're clear, when you say ""same,"" what you mean is that the division of labor for Anna was similar to what it was for Molly?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
279,1281,44,12,Exactly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
280,1282,44,13,Okay.  And did you continue to use some type of a powder when putting new diapers on her?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
281,1285,44,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
282,1286,44,17,And did you and Mr. Collins use the same products and follow the same process?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
283,1288,44,19,"Well, I wasn't there to say what his process was, but I believe that that's what he did.  We always had the same products.  You know, we used it when we went to the beach to get the sand off of them.  We used it diapering them.  I used it on my own self.  Yeah, I mean, it was a product that was in the baby's changing bag, on the table, in my room, in the beach bag, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
284,1298,45,4,"Okay.  And specific to Anna, what brand name, trade name, or manufacturer's name of powder did you use?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
285,1301,45,7,The Johnson & Johnson.  It was the same product.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
286,1303,45,9,"Okay.  While you lived with Mr. Collins, do you know whether or not he used any powders on himself?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
287,1306,45,12,I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
288,1307,45,13,"Okay.  Now, something else that Mr. Collins told us about during his deposition was that he had been involved in doing some maintenance and repair work on his own cars and even some motorcycles?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer

293,1320,46,1,"I have known that about him since when I first met him.  They were -- that's what the guys did.  You'd hear all the stories, oh, the time that Buck had the Volkswagen and it broke down on 95 going up to the lake or the one that he stripped down and rebuilt, so you hear all the stories of his youth before I knew him, before I really started being part of his life. But then my first car was a Volkswagen Beetle that he bought for me -- not for me but with me.  I bought it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
294,1331,46,12,"At any point in time, did you ever assist him with any type of maintenance or repair work on cars or motorcycles?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer

301,1345,47,1,When I was dating him.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
302,1346,47,2,"Okay.  And how long did that continue, meaning, how long was it?  Over how many years do you recall Mr. Collins doing that kind of work and you seeing him do it?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
303,1350,47,6,"Again, it was something that he continued to do, and to the point where he's sitting on a chair showing my daughter how to do things so she can take care of her car.  He always worked on our cars.  We never had a mechanic. He was like the neighborhood guru. Anyone had a problem with their car, they'd call him.  Even my mother drove up to my house, lost her power steering just the other day. Buck walks out there and opens up the hood and is like, oh, yeah, this is what's wrong.  The difference is he would have fixed it.  He can't.  He can't do that anymore.  That's what he loved to do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
304,1365,47,21,"And from what you just told me about him sitting on a chair and showing your daughter, am I correct that that would be more recent in time?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer

306,1371,48,2,Within the last couple of years maybe?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
307,1372,48,3,"Within this last year, yeah.  He can't loosen a lug nut.  He can't do things like that anymore, and that was his life.  He wasn't in a bar.  He didn't go to bars.  He didn't go out. He came home and he had his hobbies and he worked.  He was always home and always doing things.  He never sat.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,1379,48,10,"Now, if we just focus just for a moment on, say, cars as opposed to motorcycles, just looking at cars, do you have a memory of the different kinds of automotive maintenance or repair work that he would do over the years? Again, I'm not going to --",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
309,1385,48,16,Meaning?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
310,1386,48,17,"What I'm not going to do is say for this particular car, you know, do you remember what he did.  I'm just trying to get a sense as to over the years the different kinds of maintenance and repair work that you can recall him doing?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
311,1392,48,23,"Oil changes, brake changes.  He's taken engines out and rebuilt cars, complete engines, mufflers.  He's replaced muffler systems.  Yeah, he's done a lot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

313,1403,49,9,I'm afraid not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

400,1646,59,2,"Brigham and Women's.  And then yeah, I really thought I was losing him.  I thought this was the end because he couldn't do anything.  They put him on prednisone.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
401,1650,59,6,How long was he in the hospital?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
402,1651,59,7,"He was in the hospital, I want to say, maybe two days.  I really didn't want him in the hospital.  I felt like, you know, this is where he's at.  Tell me what I need to do and let's get him home.  I don't want him in here; he's going to get sick. So they really were working with us to get him out of there to stabilize him.  And so I think it was Friday afternoon, maybe Friday afternoon that I brought him home on prednisone.  And yeah, so the prednisone he turned around, and that really did amazing things for him. And he unfortunately has to stay on it because every time they take him off of it or wean him down on it, he doesn't do well again. So right now he's on a new chemo.  It's the third treatment, second round.  One round is two weeks on, one week off.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

409,1684,60,15,"Now he's on his fourth treatment, fourth new chemo.  So he started a year and a half ago on the first one, and that lasted quite a while.

410,1691,60,22,Okay.,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
411,1692,60,23,"And then the end of, I want to say, August, the end of August, they were going to try and do another round of immunotherapy, but his cancer was growing.  So the immunotherapy and the other chemo were not doing anything for him, so they started him on this new chemo drug.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
412,1700,61,6,Okay.,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
413,1701,61,7,"And that was -- so what the new regimen is is two weeks on, so he has chemo, chemo, then he has a week off.  So that's one round of the new drug.  He's on the first week of the second round with the new drug. And other than being on the prednisone, he seems to be doing okay handling the chemo.  It still knocks him on his butt, but during that time -- oh, when did he lose all the weight?  That was just recent.  He's holding his own. He still has -- his quality of life isn't great right now, so his family -- we go every year up to Prince Edward Island, and I had cancelled it.  I said we're not going.  I said -- this was in July.  I said forget it, but then by the grace of God, there he was, having to deal with him, and I'm like, we need to do something.  We can't sit around the house anymore, so we scooted him up to PEI for, like, four days.  It takes 12 hours to get there, but anyways, it was worth it just for us to be together.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

421,1736,62,17,"He's going to be scanned in two weeks, and we'll find out if it's working, and then we'll go forward.  Why am I going to clutter my brain up with all that if I don't even know if it's doing anything for him?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
422,1741,62,22,So the point is he's receiving this new course of chemotherapy.  You don't know yet whether or not it's helping or not?,q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
423,1745,63,1,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
424,1746,63,2,"But in a couple of weeks, there will be a scan, and then the doctors will talk to you about whether it's helping or not?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
425,1749,63,5,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
426,1750,63,6,"Do you know if there's any course of treatment that's planned after that, or you're going to wait and see how he responds?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
427,1753,63,9,"Actually, what I do know is this is the last treatment for him that's been approved by the FDA.  So I think that's probably why I'm not asking questions.  Yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
428,1757,63,13,"When he kind of has the treatment and then kind of gets past the symptoms that he has from the chemo, kind of like when he's at his best, how is he doing?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
429,1761,63,17,"With this new treatment, he hasn't been doing well and so his doctor, his oncologist, I called him on Friday.  It will be a week ago tomorrow that I called him and said he's not doing well.  And so he said we're going back up to 40 on the prednisone.  So he hasn't really -- so that, I think has helped balance him a little bit with his treatment that he had on Tuesday.  Plus he is just, I don't know, I'll find out Friday, Saturday how he's doing. Last week he wasn't doing good.  He couldn't eat.  So, you know, it's -- every week is a new week.  And each time he has a treatment, he comes out of it different.  So like this one hits him the day of the treatment.  The one that worked for him in the beginning didn't hit him until the weekend, and he's always received treatment on Tuesday.  So yeah, it's just one of those things you just have to wait and see how he's doing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
430,1783,64,14,"Assuming he's feeling better versus his worst, does he get out?  Does he take walks?  Does he exercise at all?  What does he do to get out of the house?",q,MR. SUGARMAN,start_answer
431,1787,64,18,"He'll walk around the supermarket pushing a cart.  He can't just walk around.  He doesn't have the energy to do that, but if he pushes a cart, he can.  He will force himself to do a lot of things just to keep the girls and I happy, but a lot of times we'll just stay in the house with him because we know we want to make him happy, too, and not make him go out and do things. He knows that if he stays on the prednisone, he has to do PT to keep his legs strong because his legs get real weak.  I haven't had a normal with this new drug.  Like there has been no week that's been normal since May.  So every week it's different, and we do kind of push him a little bit to do things with us.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

And we were like what?  How are we supposed to know what's in it if it doesn't say.  So, yeah, that's how we started finding out about it because before that we were, like, I don't think so. So that's probably where you got the minimal.  But then once we started talking with people and it was, like, oh, my gosh, asbestos is everywhere and we had no idea, no idea from the powder that I'm putting on my daughter to, you know, the powder that I put on my brother and my siblings when I was taking care of them, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I want to live, this is the day, and I don't think they can tell me really, to be honest with you, so why would I want them to give me something, you know, just a fictitious number, and it's like having to go back to work and it's like forget the work, honey, just retire.

So my husband and I are looking at each other like, oh, crumbs, what's happening here.  He said, I never thought he was going to make it to his first appointment, his first treatment. And so that was like -- that actually made us feel real good because it was like, oh, yeah, we're glad that he never said that to us because if he had said that, that's a negative. And I believe that sick people -- well, we all need it anyways, but particularly sick people need to be fed positive, and that wasn't positive and the doctor knew that, and he was always about that, too.  So yeah, I don't know if I answered your question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1214,3676,140,7,"And is the reason why you don't ask those prognosis questions, those life expectancy questions is so you don't experience the kind of life that you did when you thought you were losing him on a daily basis?",q,MR. DEATON,start_answer
1215,3681,140,12,"Right.  And I do believe in the power of prayer, and we pray every day for a miracle. We feel like we're doing everything humanly possible getting him the best care, talking to the doctor -- one thing I do talk to the doctors about is I do look at clinical trials that are out there and we talk about those because this is the last treatment that's available for him and only 20 percent of the people respond to it.  And it's like, even knowing that, it's like, ugh, I wish I didn't know that. And so, you know, it's just like, okay, what's next.

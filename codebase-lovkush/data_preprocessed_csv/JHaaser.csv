And if he didn't have any consults that day, he would not come in and let the PAs see their postop patients.  And so then he would, if he did have consults, and he wanted to come in on a different day, he would switch that over to another day, which caused the PAs to be in clinic more than necessary, in their opinion, and so they were just frustrated, because they could be rounding, and so that made them stay later in the day when that happened.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

The PAs would see and evaluate the patient, come up with a plan of care, and then later Dr. Holland would be upset, because he did not agree with that plan of care.  So they were frustrated by that. I think the example I used there was testing, where they may have ordered a test, and he didn't think they needed a test.

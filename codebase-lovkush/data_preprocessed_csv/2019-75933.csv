We had proposed         giving also our witnesses a brief           period to testify.  That was withdrawn      with the expectation that would have        been denied.  So to the extent that         this is direct examination, we object.      There is no room in the schedule for        direct examination.

So I think the ten       minutes which you can point to matters      in the testimony, but nothing to add.       So if we're trying to warm-up the           witness, that's fine, but there's no        new evidence.                              ",side_chat,ARBITRATOR COHEN,start_chat

And that     information included information, for            example, with regard to proprietary              equipment.  We disclosed approved vendor         lists.  We helped MFC identify sources of        equipment in different countries.  There was     a very specific conversation where MFC did       not want to source material and equipment        from India that required us to take certain      vendors off our list.

There was never any intent from       our side to tie technology to EPC, which is      why technology agreements were executed as       the first agreements with no relation or         obligation for MFC to sign EPC with KBR.

167,1708,66,2,"It's absolutely correct.  We spent    a lot of time developing it and we had our       name out there and MFC's, you know, when they    were filing for extension of their bonds, it     was being projected in the bond filing that      they had executed contracts with KBR.

605,3328,128,10,"Well, MFC could -- and this is        something that we also do very routinely, you    know, we could commence work under what we       call an early works agreement and provide MFC    with a lot of the deliverables that they were    asking, which would be a paid exercise, and      provide MFC with a lot of the deliverables       that they were asking us to provide before       the contracts were signed.  What I'm             referring to over here is that usually, as I     mentioned earlier, if you sign a contract and    you have an enforceable effective contract,      at that time, you don't need an NTP.  That       means the work is kicked off.                    In this case, MFC was very keen to    sign the agreements with KBR, but not give an    CROSS - A. AHMAD NTP, so that they could go to market and         demonstrate that they had signed contracts       with KBR for Ammonia licensing.

So at least under the     terms of the negotiations that you were          having with KBR, I'm sorry, with MFC at this     time, you meaning KBR, KBR was told by MFC       that MFC would not be issuing Notice to          Proceed before it signed these contracts,        right?

The intent before that, because MFC       was very keen to actually sign the agreements    in June.  In fact, I believe that at one         point MFC's Mr. Ahsen Uddin even said, you       know, there was no talk of deferrals, there      was just talks of a discount.  And they were     saying they were ready to sign the agreements    in June of 2013.  Once MFC realized that the     Financial Close would be pushed out, they        told us that, you know, we are not going to      CROSS - A. AHMAD be able to commence the work officially under    the agreements until much later.  And that's     when we introduced the NTP language.  So the     NTP language was then produced around June       2013.                                           ",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

At the same time,      they wanted the agreements, because they         wanted to show that agreements had been          signed and it was being used for raising, you    know, being used with their other investors      or other entities or, you know, financial        institutions.  So they wanted the agreement      signed and the way to overcome that hurdle of    not paying the 10% license due upon              effectiveness was to introduce the NTP clause    in there.

The only way to get a           binding number is if it's based on a             licensor's technology.  That's what is of        most interest to the lenders.

And that     CROSS - A. AHMAD was the sole purpose of putting that 11.4 in     there.  In fact, when we introduced 11.4, I      believe the reaction from the MFC side was       that they were expecting us to, at some          point, introduce a clause like that, given       how much work we had done in developing that     project.

So we believe       that there was no doubt in anyone's mind that    the only way 11.4 would occur is if MFC chose    to go to the KBR competitor.                    ",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

It was     patently clear the intent of 11.4, because,      again, I want to take you back to June 2013,     there were only two clauses in there at that     time, 11.3 and 11.4.  11.3 was actually --       11.4 was introduced after 11.3.  So everybody    was clear the intent of 11.4 was to              compensate KBR in the event MFC goes to a        competitor.                                     ",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

When we are     agreeing on things, we are not documenting       those in emails and saying this is the           intent.  We are -- we have got a projector       with a redline.  We are addressing redlines.     We are agreeing to things, we are putting        things in.  Whatever is left open is then        captured as an open item.

And I believe     subsequently to that, Mr. Uddin got internal     acceptance for 30% and felt that that was a      fair amount.                                    ",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

The License Agreement at no        point stated that MFC has to buy KBR             technology.

We were also concerned that after     MFC moved towards TKIS, there were some --       you know, just like our customers, we had        very close relationships with our vendors and    our close suppliers.

You        know, one example I cited earlier was when we    had signed the License Agreement, MFC's bond     counsel came to KBR and asked KBR to provide     a letter, an official letter from KBR,           stating that the life expectancy of this         plant will be 25 to 40 years.  Now, that         letter on KBR's letterhead, an official          communication, was used by MFC to progress       things with the bond counsel.                    Of course, concern on our side        would be that that letter was used to achieve    a certain objective.  If, months later, the      bond counsel hears that a different licensor     has stepped in, then it does compromise our,     you know, position in the market somehow.

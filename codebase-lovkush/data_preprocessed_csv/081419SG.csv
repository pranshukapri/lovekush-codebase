152,458,18,9,"Yeah, our psychotropic meds and our narcotics all have to be opened and crushed because the inmates have a habit of cheeking their meds, hoarding them, selling them, things like that.

162,498,19,24,"Is there any other way in your mind -- well, let me rephrase that.

We have our dispensary and then the blocks that are closest to it we put certain medical individuals there because they're closer to us.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

876,2044,81,20,Why?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
877,2045,81,21,Because it could be anxiety that they're throwing up.  A lot of times people say they're throwing up and really it's just acid reflux or they're just spitting.

900,2095,83,21,And you put refused.  Can you explain to me what that was and what happened?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
901,2097,83,23,That's in regard to the question right above it if there was a sexual assault that occurred.  If you click the button no for the release of information for whatever reason our computer generates a task saying that there was a sexual assault but there was not.  So you have to click refuse to avoid all of this sexual assault triggers and tasks and things like that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
902,2105,84,6,All right. So this is actually going back -- this is going back a ways into the questionnaire.  There are questions about -- generally about sexual assault?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer

905,2113,84,14,"Correct, we asked about sexual assault.  He said he had not been sexually assaulted.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
906,2115,84,16,Okay. And then you get down to a question about release of information of sexual assault and the computer makes you say refused otherwise it's going to report that he was sexually assaulted?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
907,2120,84,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

919,2141,85,17,"Yes, that's one of the options you select.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
920,2142,85,18,Is that automatically done when you put someone in detox?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
921,2144,85,20,You have to select NP/PA or mental health or I think maybe dentist is one of them.  So I select PA because that is part of the detox protocol.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
922,2147,85,23,Okay. You have to actually do it but it's dictated by the protocol?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
923,2151,86,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
924,2152,86,3,"Okay. Then and there's questions of was patient given a full explanation of medical services available at the facility you say yes.  Is that part of an explanation, a verbal explanation you give everyone?",q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
925,2157,86,8,"Yes, I give a verbal explanation.  It's also in their consent packets that they sign.  It's also posted in reception, in my intake room, on each block and at the entrance of medical.

930,2175,87,1,I understand.,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
931,2176,87,2,"I would say -- I would hand the packet of papers with the consents and it has that sick call information on it.  I would say if you have any medical concerns, mental health concerns, any changes in your medical status, any medical complaints at all or mental health complaints, could be dental, detox, again, mental health, there are various ways of getting in touch with medical which would be you can utilize the officers, you can utilize the phone system for sick call, you can write out a paper sick call and then the kiosks on the block do it as well, I believe, with the phone system they communicate.  And I explain those to them and that's it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
932,2189,87,15,Okay. That's what you would tell them to explain the medical services at the facility?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer

936,2197,87,23,You said the phone system allows you to call medical; is that right?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
937,2200,88,1,"You use the phone system and you can pick different options for whatever complaint you have and then it goes to the computer system that the officers use which we have access to for the sick calls.  It's the officers computer system but we can use it for the sick calls, if that makes sense, to see who put in the telephone sick calls and what their complaint is and then we see them for that.  So that's the phone system.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
938,2208,88,9,And is that in the phone room on the blocks?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
939,2209,88,10,"Yes, the phone room is accessible to anyone that's not locked.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
940,2211,88,12,Where are the sick call slips?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
941,2212,88,13,"The slips at that time the officers had them and the inmates could either give them to the officers, give them to any of the medical personnel that was on the blocks for med cart, detox checks, segregation rounds or they can put it in a sick call box which is by the chow hall and we check that box several times a day.  Yeah, so that's the paper ones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
942,2219,88,20,Where do you get the slips from?  You said the officers have them.,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
943,2221,88,22,"Yeah, so the inmate can ask the officer for a green slip.  The officer doesn't know if it's for us, for mental health.  It could be for probation and parole, public defender.  It doesn't have to be specifically for medical.  They are not asked -- the inmates aren't asked by the officers to clarify it because it's not their business.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
944,2229,89,5,"And you said kiosks, so what are those?",q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
945,2230,89,6,It's where they order commissary on the block. I believe that they can have the same thing.  I think it connects to the phones perhaps and they just use those.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
946,2234,89,10,After those call slips are -- or sick call slips is that what you call them?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer

951,2241,89,17,"The nurses get them if -- like I said, we're on the blocks several times a day for meds, detox checks, segregation rounds or if we just have to go to the block for a random reason the inmates can give them to us or the officers can give them to us or they're in that box by the chow hall which we check repeatedly throughout the day.  They have moved now to put in a box on every single block so that has changed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
952,2250,90,1,When did they do that?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
953,2251,90,2,A few months ago.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

964,2270,90,21,What are those abbreviations?,q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer
965,2271,90,22,CorEMR is the nurse's charting system so the officers don't have access to that but the nurses and medical team can see the alerts.  And RMS is the officer management system.  So that's our way of communicating with the officers that people have these alerts and are on watches.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
966,2278,91,4,"It looks like you entered that watch at 10:35, that would have been before you spoke to any provider; is that right?",q,MR. INSCHO,start_answer

977,2296,91,22,Regular watch medical they're getting checked every 30 minutes by the officers or the inmate monitors.

1176,2739,109,15,If I was getting calls or if I was getting orders from a provider on-call it would have been a weekend.  So his intake would have been done on a weekend when there's no providers there so we have to physically or we have to call the provider and get our orders.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

92,370,32,9,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,371,32,10,"In a moment I'm going to ask you to work -- walk the jury through your physical exam.  But before I do that, I would like to know prior to your examination of Ms. Thornton, did you have an opportunity to review any treatment records regarding her care?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
94,376,32,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,377,32,16,And what were those?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
96,378,32,17,"So I did review her magnetic resonance imaging of her cervical and lumbar spine.  I did -- I do have some records also from Dr. Holding about the patient's electrodiagnostic study results and from her chiropractor, from Dr. Petrarca, and some of the notes that was given to me from Mercy Hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,384,32,23,"And Doctor, the records from Mercy Hospital, were those given to you by my office at a later date?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
98,386,32,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

100,390,33,3,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,391,33,4,"Doctor, you had mentioned some diagnostic tests that you reviewed.  And what were those tests?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
102,393,33,6,So MRI of her cervical and lumbar spine as well as the electrodiagnostic studies of her upper and lower extremities.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,396,33,9,"And Doctor, what did the MRIs show?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
104,397,33,10,"The MRI of her cervical spine it shows normal results, and then the MRI of her cervical results are normal.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,400,33,13,"And Doctor, what does an MRI image show?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
106,401,33,14,Um --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,402,33,15,"What is it -- I'm sorry.  That was a bad question.  What is it -- what is the test taken for or what is an MRI, rather?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
108,405,33,18,"So MRI stands as magnetic resonance imaging. What it does it uses powerful magnets and radio waves. With the help of the computer, it can generate all of this films.  It doesn't emit any radiation in comparisons to x-rays and CAT scans.  It's a very safe procedure, a very thorough test.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,411,33,24,And you had mentioned also an EMG test.  What is an EMG?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
110,414,34,1,"EMG is really electrodiagnostic studies.  It involves two portions which is the first one is the nerve conduction studies and that one is a needle electromyography.  So nerve conduction study, so it will tell us if there is any nerve pathology, and then the needle EMG it will show if the nerve pathology is an acute or a chronic.  So it's how the muscle responds to any nerve stimulus.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,422,34,9,And so what is the difference in what an EMG tests and what an MRI tests?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
112,424,34,11,"So MRI the way we see the MRI it easily represents the anatomy of the problem.  So it will show us if there is any anatomical problems of the spine or in the subcutaneous tissue or in the spinal cord.  In comparisons to electromyog --electrodiagnostic studies, it's more on the function of like where the nerve coming from the neck down to the arms, if there is any problems on the way from the neck down.  So it's more on the physiological side.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,432,34,19,And what did the EMGs taken of Ms. Thornton reveal?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
114,434,34,21,"She has two electrodiagnostic studies.  Her lumbar electrodiagnostic study shows no evidence of lumbar radiculopathy or peripheral nerve entrapment, and her cervical, her upper extremities, electrodiagnostic study shows cervical radiculopathy involving bilateral C5-C6 and right C6-C7 nerve roots.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,441,35,2,"And Doctor, we can keep talking about cervical and lumbar.  Could you tell us what the cervical spine is or what part that is?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
116,444,35,5,"Cervical is mainly the neck area, so it is composed of a seven vertebra bone.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,446,35,7,And what about the lumbar?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
118,447,35,8,Lumbar is in our lower portion of the spine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,448,35,9,And you kind of discussed that radiculopathy was found in the cervical spine of Ms. Thornton.  What is radiculopathy.,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
120,451,35,12,"So radiculopathy are when there are some nerve pathology that causes some pain from the neck down to their hands, their arms, their fingers, shooting pain, aching pain, or like an electric type of pain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,455,35,16,"And Doctor, is it fully necessary for an MRI and an EMG to both show results or be abnormal for there to be radiculopathy in a patient?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
122,458,35,19,"No, not necessarily.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,459,35,20,And how is it that they can be different?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
124,460,35,21,"So first and foremost it's like, you know, those diagnostic studies are just -- it's just going to help the providers.  It's really basically the history and physical is what's most important.  And some of these tests it could be negative, but it doesn't mean that the patient doesn't have the problem.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,467,36,2,And how does radiculopathy occur?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
126,468,36,3,"So radiculopathy once there is a nerve type of problem that's coming from the cervical spine and it manifest in the -- in their arms, forearms or in their fingers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,472,36,7,"And how can it be caused from trauma, if it can?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
128,473,36,8,"So what it does it involves when there are some nerve damage or any irritations from the nerve root that it can cause inflammation, and those inflammation is the one that is really causing all of this pain that it radiates down to their hands and fingers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,478,36,13,"And in addition to these diagnostic studies and the other records that you told us you reviewed, did you, I believe you said you did, do a physical exam of Ms. Thornton?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
130,482,36,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,483,36,18,And what did that reveal?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
132,484,36,19,"So Ms. Thornton's cervical spine the range of motion is decreased in all directions, especially on cervical extension and flexion and also lateral rotation. She had some tenderness on both trapezius, the left shoulder area, and pain going down to her forearm and arm.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,489,36,24,And did your examination of her match the results of the objective testing?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
134,492,37,1,"Yes, it did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,493,37,2,"After examining Ms. Thornton, reviewing her records, studies and images referenced in your report, did you find any injuries?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
136,496,37,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,497,37,6,And what were those?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
138,498,37,7,"That Ms. Thornton has a cervical radiculopathy as well as her facet injury as a result of the motor vehicular accident on September 1, 2016.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,501,37,10,"And when you first saw her for treatment, was she still suffering from pain from the accident?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
140,503,37,12,"Yes, she was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,504,37,13,And was that about a year after the accident that you first saw her?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
142,506,37,15,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,507,37,16,Is that typical for pain management?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
144,508,37,17,"It's really not unusual.  A lot of our patients since we treat chronic pain, a lot of them they refer to us six months to a year or even two years after like when their pain persist.  That's why we mainly treat chronic pain problems.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,513,37,22,And what does chronic mean?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
146,514,37,23,"Chronic means like, you know, when -- I mean, there is three stages; there is an acute, subacute, and a chronic.  So acute is within three months -- within a month, and then subacute is within three months of the problem, and then three months after that it becomes chronic, and that's when the problems persist, and then that's when we start seeing all of this patient.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,522,38,5,"And after reviewing the records and examining Ms. Thornton, I believe it was in September of 2017, what did you decide to do for her treatment-wise?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
148,525,38,8,"So after my evaluation with her, since her pain is mainly in the cervical spine down to her arms, so we discussed doing a cervical epidural steroid injections.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,528,38,11,And was one of those eventually performed?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
150,529,38,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,530,38,13,And what is a cervical epidural steroid injection?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
152,532,38,15,"So cervical epidural steroid injection usually what I usually tells my patients is it's basically exactly the same when women gives birth, so it's an epidural injection.  So the only difference is I use is an x-ray machine to guide my needle, and then I use steroids instead of the pain medication where these women -- the pregnant women gets.  So steroids is a very good anti-inflammatory medications.  It relieves the inflammations around the nerve root sheath, and once the inflammation subsides, then the pain coming from the neck down to their arm starts getting better.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,544,39,1,"And Doctor, did you see Ms. Thornton again at a later date?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
154,546,39,3,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,547,39,4,And did she report to you whether or not her injection had helped?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
156,549,39,6,"According to Ms. Thornton, she said it's a hundred percent relief from the injections.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,551,39,8,And how long does relief from an injection typically last?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
158,553,39,10,"It really depends from patient to patient, so it depends how bad the problem is also.  It could last from months to even a year.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,556,39,13,"And Doctor, after reviewing all of the diagnostic records and your own examination and also the prior records from the Rehab Center and UPMC, do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty what injuries Ms. Thornton suffered as a result of the motor vehicle accident of September 1st of 2016?",q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
160,563,39,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,564,39,21,And what is that opinion?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer
162,565,39,22,That Ms. Thornton has a cervical radiculopathy involving bilateral C5-6 and right C6-C7 nerve roots as well as cervical facet injury.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,570,40,1,And how can that occur in a motor vehicle collision?,q,MS. CORBETT,start_answer

253,746,46,21,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,747,46,22,And in those medical records there was an MRI that was taken of her lower lumbar back in February of 2017?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer

257,753,47,2,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
258,754,47,3,But plaintiff at that time had been complaining about her lower lumbar pain; correct?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
259,756,47,5,She was.  She was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,757,47,6,"So the MRI came back negative and then an EMG was also taken, correct, of the lower lumbar?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
261,759,47,8,"The lower extremities, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
262,760,47,9,And that came back as negative as well?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
263,761,47,10,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

265,765,47,14,"Oh, yes.  I mean, from my experience in working as a pain physician for 16 years and even a physiatrist, I do encounter a lot of patients who are complaining and all of the tests were negative.  But as I do in my practice, I usually rely on my history and physical and all of these tests will just -- will only confirm my diagnosis, but I do encounter a lot of those.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
266,772,47,21,"They confirm your diagnosis.  And so, Doctor, can I ask then for your diagnosis, is your diagnosis that she is not suffering in her lower lumbar?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
267,775,47,24,"In the lower back at that time -- okay.  When I did see the patient initially, she was complaining more of her cervical spine, so I didn't really address her lumbar spine.  But she did tell me, though, that she was having pain in the lower back, but her neck pain was worse.  So we try to explain to the patient that we will like to concentrate in the area where is the worst problem.  So at the time it was her cervical spine, so -- and in fact, it was in my notes from my October of 2018 when she was saying that she was complaining of her lower back, but I don't have her records at the time, so I was trying to get her records and review the records, but her initial visit is more on the cervical spine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
268,789,48,12,"So as I -- let me understand then, Doctor.",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
269,790,48,13,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
270,791,48,14,"In September of 2017 she complained -- I understand the cervical spine issue and you examined her for that, but she also complained of the lumbar, pain in her lower lumbar.  So you did not examine her?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
271,795,48,18,I did examine her.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
272,796,48,19,Okay.  And what was your diagnosis from the examination in regard to her lower lumbar in September 2017?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
273,799,48,22,"At that time I don't have any diagnosis.  That's because, as I said, like, you know, she was complaining more on the cervical spine.  So I just defer for my impression at the time, but I was just discussing with the patient that since her cervical spine is what's causing her problem, so we will try to concentrate in that area until her next office visit.  Then we can -- if the pain in the lower back persist.  That's how I do it and then we will just reevaluate and do any procedures if -- whatever procedures we can do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
274,810,49,7,So you examined her but did not make a diagnosis on her lower lumbar?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
275,812,49,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
276,813,49,10,"Even though you reviewed her records -- and back in February when she took the MRI, she complained of the lower lumbar was the greater issue?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
277,816,49,13,"I think at that time I don't have, if I'm not mistaken, I don't have the records from the lower back.  I have mainly the cervical.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
278,819,49,16,"Okay.  So when you examined her in September of 2017, you didn't have the MRI and the EMG of her lower lumbar?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
279,822,49,19,I don't think so because it was -- I put that in off notes in her last office visit in October that I need to get her MRI for her lumbar spine as well as her EMG. So it means to say I don't have that in our files.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
280,826,49,23,Did you ever obtain those documents -- you obtained those documents prior to the report; correct?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
281,828,49,25,"Yes.  I think after I did see the patient, yes, after I have -- I have -- before I did this narrative report.  That is correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
282,832,50,3,And you reviewed the EMG and MRI of her lower lumbar?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
283,834,50,5,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
284,835,50,6,"And you saw that she was complaining predominately of her lower lumbar, not of her cervical back in February of 2017?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
285,838,50,9,No.  No.  2018.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
286,839,50,10,What's 2018?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
287,840,50,11,The October.  That's where she was complaining more of the lower back.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
288,842,50,13,"I understand.  I understand, Doctor.  But if you look through the medical records, she was complaining of her lower lumbar more so in February 2017.  That's why an EMG and MRI was taken of it.",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
289,846,50,17,"Yes, but when I saw her in September of 2017, her pain is more on the cervical spine.  I mean, they -- it really depends.  Like sometimes when patients involved in a motor vehicular accident, if it involves both the lower back and the neck, there are some days that that one area is worse than the other area.  So -- but when I saw her in September, it was more on her cervical spine, so that's why we try to concentrate treating her cervical area than the lower back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
290,856,51,1,"So when you treat, you wouldn't treat both, even though as you have just demonstrated to me today that in a vehicular accident where there is a collision that a patient could be suffering from cervical and lower lumbar, and she explained both to you.  You only treat her for the cervical?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
291,862,51,7,"Yeah.  I mean, because -- first is we inject steroids, so we don't want to load patients with steroids, you know.  So -- and I usually ask the patient like, you know, where is the worst problem, is the cervical or lower back.  We usually do that, and at the time it was her cervical spine that was causing her most of her problems, so that's why we -- that's why I did the cervical epidural injections instead of the lower back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
292,870,51,15,"Now, then you said you then saw her on October 31, 2018, the second time; correct?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
293,872,51,17,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
294,873,51,18,And there you stated there was a lower lumbar?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
295,874,51,19,"At that time, yes, she was complaining more of her lower back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,876,51,21,More than her cervical?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
297,877,51,22,"At that time, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
298,878,51,23,"Okay.  So in October of 2018 she was having more lower back, lower lumbar issues than her cervical spine in her neck?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
299,882,52,1,"Yes.  When I saw her, she was complaining more of that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
300,884,52,3,"In October of 2018, did you ask her whether her pain in her cervical spine was more or less than when you had last seen her?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
301,887,52,6,At the time -- let me see.  Her pain level was 5. She was telling me it helps her but pain starts coming back.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
302,890,52,9,Pain starts coming back.  I'm sorry.  Can you --,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
303,891,52,10,Pain starts coming back in her cervical spine down to her arms and forearms into her hands.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
304,893,52,12,"Okay.  Now, why would -- what is your diagnostics for the pain that is going from her neck down into her hands, Doctor?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
305,896,52,15,I had her as cervical radiculopathy as well as a facet injury.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,898,52,17,And that's based off of the EMG of her cervical spine?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
307,900,52,19,Based on the EMG as well as my history and physical exam.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,902,52,21,"Okay.  And that EMG -- and the report in regards to that EMG comes from Dr. Holding, dated August 30, 2017; correct?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
309,905,52,24,I'm sorry.  Which day again?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
310,906,52,25,"August 30, 2017.",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
311,908,53,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
312,909,53,2,Okay.  And that was just -- and that was right before you first physically examined Ms. Thornton?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
313,911,53,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
314,912,53,5,"In that report from Dr. Holding it stated that she also suffered from mild bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, affecting sensory only the first digit.",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
315,915,53,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
316,916,53,9,"What does that mean, Doctor?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
317,917,53,10,"So carpal tunnel is usually around the wrist area, and then you manifest symptoms down to your fingers and index middle and half of your ring finger.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
318,920,53,13,All right.  And how is carpal tunnel caused?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
319,921,53,14,"Carpal tunnel sometimes it could -- it could affect a lot of ways, as long as it does pinch the medial nerve -- the median nerve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
320,924,53,17,"Doctor, are the effects of carpal tunnel and radiculopathy, cervical radiculopathy, similar?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
321,926,53,19,Not necessarily.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
322,927,53,20,"Well, in this instance, Doctor, since the plaintiff has complained of tingling or pain that would travel down through her fingers, that type of cervical radiculopathy, would that be similar to carpal tunnel syndrome?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
323,932,53,25,"No, it's not, but here's the thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,934,54,1,How is it not?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
325,935,54,2,"If you look at the muscle -- I was just looking at the EMG testing that was done by Dr. Holding.  She did put some in some of the muscles which is supplied by this nerve.  Okay? And the median nerve it's basically around the wrist area, and the cervical radiculopathy it comes from the neck.  So there are some testing that you can really try to differentiate between a radiculopathy and a peripheral neuropathy which is the carpal tunnel.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,945,54,12,"Okay.  Doctor, you and I can both agree that Dr. Holding did recognize there is carpal tunnel in plaintiff?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
327,948,54,15,There is in the sensory only.  So what does it mean?  Sensory is just the nerve conduction studies.  Nothing happened with the needle electromyography.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,952,54,19,Okay.  And can you explain?  What do you mean by sensory only?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
329,954,54,21,Sensory is the nerve conduction studies.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,955,54,22,Yes.,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
331,956,54,23,"So when you -- the way you do it like you know, you feel some shocking in there.  And if it is positive, they try to record all of this, and if it is positive, that's just mild, because they have to combine that with the motor which is the needle electromyography and then that becomes more severe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,964,55,5,"Now, the MRI came back for the cervical spine as negative.  And as I believe you explained, Doctor, that an MRI represents or shows, it use magnets and radio waves, and shows the status of the nerve, in this case, in the neck, correct, in the spinal cord?",q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer
333,969,55,10,It's more on the anatomy that causes some pathology around the cervical spine area.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,971,55,12,What do you mean by anatomy surrounding the pathology -- or with the pathology?,q,MR. BORSUK,start_answer

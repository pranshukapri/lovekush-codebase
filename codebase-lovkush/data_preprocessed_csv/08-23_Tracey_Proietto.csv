His job is to literally take down every answer that you give and every question that I ask. In order for him to do that accurately, only one of us can talk at one time. I see that you nod your head.  He cannot put any verbal gestures onto the record.  So if there's a question that requires an answer, I ask that you just please give an answer.  If you forget to do that, I'll remind you. Your attorney is seated to your left.  If at any time you need to speak with your attorney, use the restroom, get anything to drink, we can go off the record. You can do that.  The only thing that I do ask is that you answer the question that's currently pending, because it just makes it easier for the court reporter, so we don't have to all remember where we were.",q,MS.

Just tell me, ""I do not understand the question,"" because perhaps I can rephrase it in a way that you can answer it. And if there's something that you just don't know, that's okay as well.  But what happens afterwards is a little booklet gets prepared.  All the answers and the questions are in there.  And if you answer a question that you didn't understand, then it's not helpful to anyone, you know, at any other proceeding.",q,MS. BILARDO,start_answer

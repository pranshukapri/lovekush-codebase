Due to my issue with my shoulder and blood pressures and rooming in patients, I couldn't do as much; so they gave me two days to do front desk, which is registering patients, answering phone calls, scheduling, and so on.  But after number of months, I couldn't do it anymore; and I switched to Arrhythmia Consultants, which basically I do very much administrative and only a day of medical assisting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

They -- you know, I would see anywhere between 30 to 40 patients a day that I have to room in and make sure that they are ready for our providers and our dietitians.  So, you know, 30 blood pressures, 30 weights, 30 labs, 30 everything.  It became a lot for me, considering that I was in so much pain.

So they all had full schedules.  So they all had -- you know, sometimes they would have ten patients a day each, and it was myself and the other medical assistant that had to bring all of them.  So she does half; I do half.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,299,12,4,"Okay.  Now, this new job that you have, how many patients a day are you seeing?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

128,306,12,11,"No.  This was couple of months after the accident because I would be in so much pain and I wouldn't be able to pump all day and to be bringing in patients.  So my boss at the time -- to alleviate it, she let me do two days of administrative, which is kind of -- it would help me with my hand.  Like, I would do medical assisting Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  So Tuesday and Thursday it would be kind of alleviation days between that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,314,12,19,Okay.  So she tried to make accommodations?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

132,320,12,25,"That is working out just fine.  I do mostly administrative, which is scheduling, which is obtaining records for the new patients, entering medications, making sure, you know, I collect co-pays, check-ins, check-outs, getting labs from Collaborative or Quest, so having pretty much all the paperwork ready before the patient comes.  And when the patient comes, you know, they check in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

143,345,13,24,"Yes.  I'm missing all the interaction I had with patients.  Actually, being at Pounds, I mean, I met a lot of people there.  And these are the patients that would come back constantly, I mean, to the point they knew about my children.  They asked about the pictures on the walls.  Some of them even knew when was my children's birthday because they would be there weekly, on a weekly basis.  And then that went down gradually, especially after being front desk. There is no interaction no more that I had in the room with them, which is actually having a conversation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

147,363,14,16,"Like I said, I only do it on Fridays.  So I only see patients on Fridays.  So I do see patients.  I do room in patients, but it's different.  It's different than what it used to be at my previous job.  My job here now, it's mostly behind a desk, phone calls, picking up pharmacy phone calls, patient phone calls, and stuff like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I am not to that point where I would require surgery.  The practice pretty much did as much as they could for me.  Also, you know, I couldn't get the cortisone shots because they literally target a specific portion, but mine is all over.  So he said it would be useless to get the shots because they really don't know where it is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I had them pretty much everywhere, from Oasis to Envy to another massage place right on Silas Deane, which is close by my house.  I still do the exercises in the showers, the stretching that they showed me.  I still use the machine that they gave me, the electrical current.  I do that twice a week.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

651,1302,50,19,And you do those at home?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
652,1303,50,20,"Yes, ma'am.  Majority of them are to be done in the shower while, you know, the hot water is hitting you so it helps your muscles relax.

And the hotter it is, like, it's easier to, like, relax.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
653,1310,51,1,And how often do you do that?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

658,1316,51,7,"So these two last years have been anything but easy, considering I do have three kids.  I have a household to run, and I have a full-time job.  It affects my every day, absolutely every day.  From home point, I can't do as much as I could.  I can't clean.  Where I come from, we do a lot of dough, a lot of dough making.

659,1325,51,16,Using your arm?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
660,1326,51,17,"And I am a righty, so I do everything with my right hand.  I can't even brush with my left hand. Cleaning.  I have hardwood floors inside the house.  Mopping, vacuuming, all of that is an issue. Literally providing for my children is an issue.  I can't even bring the groceries from the car because as little as a gallon of milk might seem, it's an issue carrying it in my right arm.  If I grab it from my left, I have no issues whatsoever.  But my brain doesn't always think.  I always reach out for the right from everything.  I use my sons a lot to take care of that part.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
661,1338,52,3,"Now, is there anything -- so I understand these are things that you still do, but they're very difficult?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

673,1359,52,24,Okay.  And the trouble is what exactly?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
674,1360,52,25,"So anytime I do anything like that, it's worse. My pain with my shoulder, it's continuous.  It doesn't stop. But the more I stretch myself to do things, the worse it gets.  So I try not to really do much unless I really have to.  If I have to clean the floors, then I have to clean the floors, but I don't clean it as I used to.  I don't know if I explained myself correctly.  I do what I have to do, not what I want to do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

690,1392,54,5,"This is a stiff pain that's kind of -- that's almost like something's pressing and just grabbed you and stays there.  It doesn't go anywhere.  There's better days, yes, but there's much worse days.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
691,1396,54,9,Is it like a knot?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
692,1397,54,10,"It is.  It is grabbed and stays there.  Like, I don't know if I'm explaining myself correctly.  It seems like somebody grabbed and just, like, holds type of pain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
693,1400,54,13,"Now, is this something that comes and goes?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

708,1425,55,12,"No, ma'am.  No, ma'am.  I had the headaches.  I had the back pain.  I had those issues.  Those are gone. This is my issue.  This is my constant issue, which is this part right here and this part right here. I mean, Dr. Rubin -- at the time of the treatment, he had me try something different.  He had me take the biggest towel I have in my house and you keep folding it, keep folding it, till you're done.  And then you keep folding it this way so you kind of make a block.  You tape it up, and that's what you try sleeping on.  He was wrong. That didn't help. I thought if I buy more expensive, better mattresses, that's going to help.  It has not helped.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
709,1438,55,25,Did you get a new mattress?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

I -- I'm sorry.  I just have to say it.  I sleep literally on my chest next to my -- and that's my side. Nobody can sleep on that side.  I have my nightstand, which is right here.  This is my bed.  This is my nightstand.  I put a pillow over from the bed to the nightstand, and that's how I sleep.  I cannot sleep on my back, nor I can find a way to sleep.  I bought body pillows.  I mean, I bought every pillow out there; but I haven't figured it out yet.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

731,1488,57,23,Okay.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
732,1489,57,24,"Do I cook all the stuff I used to do with the dough?  No, because it requires much more strength and requires to go through that dough making.  You have to -- in order to make the bread or any type of, like, Bosnia thing, because we do a lot with dough, a lot with fillings, you have to get it to the certain consistency.  So if you don't really work your dough, the taste is different, like if you don't really put your hands in it, if I'm saying correctly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
733,1498,58,7,Yeah.,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
734,1499,58,8,Now my mother-in-law does the bread.  I don't touch that just because it's so much strength and working it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
735,1502,58,11,"And these questions, I'm trying to get an idea how your life has changed and how the activities have changed. So is baking something you still do, but you don't do it as much?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
736,1506,58,15,"Yes, ma'am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
737,1507,58,16,"And can you tell me, like, has it changed what you've made or how has it changed?",q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
738,1509,58,18,"Yes.  It changed in what I used to make.  I mean, I -- my husband and I used to entertain a lot.  So I would cook for a couple of couples, you know, when they come for dinner, so a lot of dough, a lot of potatoes, a lot of peeling, a lot of cutting.  All of that is hard.  It's hard to even cut, like, drumsticks.  You know how they come? Like, you have the drumstick, and then you have the other part?  I used to do that with no issues.  Now I have my husband cut them, like separate it by the bone, because, like, pressing on that with the knife is just hard.  It really is. Even, like, washing dishes.  Unfortunately, I don't have a dishwasher yet.  It will happen one day.  But, like, washing dishes, it becomes so stiff and becomes so uncomfortable that sometimes I just leave the dishes for the next day.  I just don't feel my -- don't see myself doing it because, like, it becomes so much.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
739,1527,59,10,Okay.  And the grocery shopping you still do?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
740,1528,59,11,I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
741,1529,59,12,You were telling us it's difficult lifting gallons of milk and stuff like that?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
742,1531,59,14,"Yes, ma'am.  I have my army.  I have my two sons that I make bring everything in and, you know, stock everything.  This goes here.  You put this here.  You put this here.  I take care of the frozen stuff, put it in the fridge and stuff like that.  But, I mean, bringing the groceries in, that's their new job.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
743,1537,59,20,Okay.  And gardening you said?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
744,1538,59,21,"Now, that is my very, very nice love that I have. I love roses.  I love outdoors.  So the house we bought, it has a lot of -- like, it has enough portion of land.  Right? So I bought so many rose -- I had so many rose bushes that I'm the one taking care of.  We have a raised garden that I had all the vegetables in it.  Now I really just have, like, the scallions and tomatoes and peppers because those you really don't have to do much work.  You put them, plant them, they start growing, you water them, and that's it.  I can't really do so much.  That takes time and --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
745,1549,60,6,So what don't you have now?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
746,1550,60,7,"I don't have majority.  I don't have -- I did potatoes.  I don't do potatoes no more because those require you to do more with them.  I don't do corn because it's, like, so much harder, like, when you're cleaning it up, like, to take everything out because their roots grow so much down.  So the scallions are so much easier.  You just put them in, water them, and they grow.  And I do tomatoes and I do peppers.  I still do that, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
747,1558,60,15,But you used to do potatoes and corn?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

751,1562,60,19,And the roses?  Do you still have the roses?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
752,1563,60,20,"Majority of them has been dying because I -- it takes so much work.  You know, it just looks like a bush, but it takes a lot of work trimming it down, making sure that you have the correct plant food for them.  Like, when autumn comes, you need to protect them for the next year.  I just -- it's so much harder to do that because it takes time and it takes strength to be doing that.  And I kind of pretty much not gave up on it but all -- it's still there, but not as much.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
753,1573,61,4,Okay.  So you've given me a lot of examples.  Is there anything else that you think has been affected by your injuries from the accident?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
754,1576,61,7,"No.  Basically, my every day is affected, to be honest with you, from providing for my family to a job that I literally had to switch because I couldn't perform as much as I used to.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
755,1580,61,11,Have you had to pay anyone to help you?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

763,1594,61,25,And how much is it to get a massage?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
764,1596,62,1,"Well, if I get it from the Groupon, it's like $30, $40.  If you don't get it from the Groupon, then it's $100 usually for an hour.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
765,1599,62,4,For an hour?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

767,1601,62,6,Is that usually what you get?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
768,1602,62,7,"I try to get it off Groupon, to be honest; but if I don't find it on Groupon, then, you know, I pay the $100 and get it over with because I feel -- you know, them just working that area out, like, I feel it has helped me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
769,1606,62,11,Does it alleviate it?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer
770,1607,62,12,"That alleviates definitely.  It makes it feel better for me.  And then that's why I'm getting it monthly, because I feel like I feel different after being worked in that specific spot.  It alleviates it.  It doesn't take it away, but it definitely helps.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
771,1612,62,17,All right.  Are you taking any medication?,q,MS. FRARE,start_answer

Then you take two scoops of the grounds and then you pour it with, like, the hot coffee and that's how you drink it.  It's stronger coffee. But I get up in the morning.  I'm putting my water on my stove.  I'm taking my two Aleve.  That's, like, my -- no missed days.  That's every morning.  Coming from work, you take two more.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

789,1650,64,3,"It was a pain medication.  I don't recall what it was.  It started with ""M,"" but it didn't really alleviate. It didn't help me.  So I just keep taking my Aleve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

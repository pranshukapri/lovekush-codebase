That's where, you know, the fire was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

166,569,21,18,"Well, when I walked, yeah, the orientation of the trailer was backed into the building, and then that building jutted out at that point and the ramp into the building ran alongside that part of the building.  That's where the fire was, up at the top of the ramp.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

172,590,22,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

177,600,22,24,All right.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
178,602,23,1,"At least I couldn't.  You know, like I'm --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

188,628,24,2,"Had them come to the rear of the building, the driver, you know, establishes the hydrant connections with one of the drivers, and I had the rest of the crew deploy the two-and-a-half-inch line.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
189,633,24,7,What did you tell them to do with that line?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
190,635,24,9,"Basically, you know, start knocking down the bulk of the fire they could see.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
191,637,24,11,And did you watch them as they attempted to do that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
192,639,24,13,"With doing other things, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

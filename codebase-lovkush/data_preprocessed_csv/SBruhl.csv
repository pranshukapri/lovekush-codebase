And that is that I was called by someone from Mercy Health.  I honestly have no idea who that was.  And informed me that there was a -- a lawsuit in relation to Dr. Holland and Mercy Health, and that the allegations were made that cardiologists, including myself, may have discriminated against him based on his race or ethnic origin, and they asked me whether that was true, that -- that I had discriminated against him, and I said no. And they said, well, why did you refer or not refer patients to Dr. Holland?  And I told them, you know, why.  And then at the end of that discussion, they said, okay, well, let me -- I have taken notes of this whole discussion.  Let me go ahead and put together what you've said, or I've understood what you've said.  You feel free to change that however you want to, take out, put in.

67,329,12,2,Okay.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

88,372,13,19,"It's just -- it's just a sequence of events, and I -- it's -- we, as attorneys, take it for granted that we know, you know, that we're so familiar with the process, so it causes a little anxiety with the witness and counsel and everything, so just please listen to the question, then objection, and then typically you will be able to answer.",q,MR.

89,381,14,2,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

94,395,14,16,-- this person that you had been accused of being a discriminator by Dr. Holland; is that right?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
95,398,14,19,"Sure, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,399,14,20,"Okay.  Now, just to be clear, what do you think it was that -- where -- where do you think it was that Dr. Holland accused you of being a discriminator?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat
97,403,14,24,"Objection, speculation.",side_chat,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
98,406,15,1,"I actually don't understand the question.  You mean where in space was he when he, or what the situation you're asking?  I don't understand the question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,410,15,5,"All right.  At -- you believed, given this call, that Dr. Holland had accused you in some way of discriminating, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
100,413,15,8,"Well, let me back that up a little bit and say that, as I said earlier, I was told that Dr. Holland was accusing Mercy Health in -- in general and doctors that work, or work with, or around doctor -- for Mercy Health, that in general he was discriminated against.  Never was -- did anybody say, oh, he says you discriminated against him, but I -- I'm just in the general sense a cardiologist who referred patients to CT surgeons.  So the reason -- how I found out about it was because somebody told me, but I can't speculate as to why he would say that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,426,15,21,"Okay.  So as you sit here today, do you -- do you believe that Dr. Holland has ever insinuated or suggested that you personally discriminated and did not refer cases to him for a discriminatory reason?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
102,432,16,1,"So I have -- only -- the only reason why I would know that is because I did review the -- his testimony, really just briefly as it related to me.  And although I have, again, read over it once or twice tops, my overview from that takeaway was that when he's referring to me, that yes, you know, I'm just like everyone else and have, you know, discriminated against him and not referred patients to him.  And I don't know if I was clear on why I would not have done that, but he seemed clear in his testimony that he believed that I had discriminated against him. But that's the only reason I would ever suspect or think that he thought that, is from his own testimony in his affidavit, or I'm sorry, in his deposition.  Sorry.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,449,16,18,"Okay.  But you weren't shown my client's deposition until after you signed your affidavit, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
104,452,16,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,453,16,22,"Okay.  So -- so by the time that my client was deposed, you had signed an affidavit and attacked him in it, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat
106,456,16,25,"Objection, mischaracterization.",side_chat,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
107,459,17,2,No.  I don't think that's correct at all.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

109,463,17,6,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,464,17,7,"Let me take back the word attack. You -- you listed an egregious example.  In fact, you listed the most egregious example of a professional conflict with Dr. Holland in your affidavit, correct? That's in paragraph 5A, right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
111,470,17,13,"Whether it's the most egregious, I -- I don't know that that will be true or not, but it is a good example of why I, after that case, really preferred to not have him take care of my patients.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,475,17,18,"Okay.  Well, you signed this document, your affidavit, under the penalties of perjury, sir, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
113,478,17,21,Yep.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,479,17,22,Okay.  So let's look at paragraph 5A for a second.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
115,481,17,24,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,482,17,25,"And the first sentence in paragraph 5A says, the most egregious example of my professional conflict with Dr. Holland, involving a patient with a heart condition who needed surgery, right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
117,488,18,5,"The most egregious example of my -- yes, that's what it says, correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,490,18,7,"Okay.  So is that true, that it was egregious?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
119,492,18,9,"Yes, it was egregious.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,493,18,10,"Okay.  So you listed an egregious, you agree then, that you did list, according to you, an egregious example dealing with Dr. Holland, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
121,497,18,14,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,498,18,15,"And just to be clear, to acknowledge Mr. Wiencek's statement, I believe he made this morning, and I don't know if he did or didn't, but he typically makes it, when you refer to any patient today, you should not use any personal indicators, if possible, to identify the patient.  And we only use initials of a patient to jog your memory --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
123,506,18,23,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,507,18,24,"-- about the patient, okay? Just -- that ensures protection on HIPAA, even though we still have confidentiality and things on the transcript that we can do, it still protects, gives us greater protection, okay?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
125,514,19,5,I understand.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

133,530,19,21,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
134,531,19,22,"-- either, okay? Okay.  So going back in a sequence, you believed that when you were preparing the affidavit, that one of the things you were responding to was an allegation of discrimination that had been raised by Dr. Holland generally as to cardiologists, that also included you?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
135,540,20,5,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,541,20,6,"So you did have some type of belief at that time that Dr. Holland had claimed that the reason that you weren't referring to him had to do with a discriminatory reason, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
137,546,20,11,"All I could know for sure was that he was generally referring to cardiologists and doctors, is all I knew.

167,645,24,6,"Jim Brazeau and also Tom, as the Mercy Health lawyers also.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
168,647,24,8,Okay.  Okay.  So over the course -- when did you first meet Dr. Holland?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
169,649,24,10,"I can think of the first time I met him.  I was up at St. Vincent's Hospital. As far as the -- I would guess 2017 or '16, but I honestly don't know exactly, but I would guess around 2017 probably, when I was doing a heart catheterization up at St. Vincent's Hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
170,656,24,17,"Okay.  Let me go back a second, because I -- I -- sometimes I skip over this. Where have you been -- let me just ask you some background about yourself, about your training and things.  I skipped over all of that --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
171,662,24,23,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
172,663,24,24,"-- I apologize.  Tell me a little -- if you can tell me about your educational training first, and then where -- and then from there, I'll just ask you your basic work history, where you have been working.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
173,669,25,4,Okay.  I -- you want starting at college or medical school or what?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
174,671,25,6,Yeah.  Yeah.  Just quickly.  You don't have to go through all your classes. Just where you graduated from --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

177,677,25,12,"So I went to Cedarville University in premed.  I did a master's in molecular biology at Bowling Green.  I did medical school at UT Medical Center.  I did residency at UT Medical Center.  I did fellowship at UT Medical Center.  University of Toledo Medical Center, I should say.  And then directly from there, I was employed by Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
178,686,25,21,So basically when did you first start working at Mercy Health --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

183,694,26,3,When did you first start working at Mercy Health-Tiffin?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
184,696,26,5,"So again, I believe that's 2011, August of 2011.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
185,698,26,7,"That's when you -- you first were -- and from that point on, you have been basically stationed/primarily focused in the Tiffin area; is that right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
186,702,26,11,"That's correct.  I'll just say that, probably leading into the next question is, I do occasional heart catheterizations, high-risk procedures, at St. Vincent's Hospital once or twice a month, but that's -- and I, technically, to go one step further, occasionally go to St. Anne's Hospital too, but ninety, probably five to eight percent of my time is at Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,711,26,20,"Okay.  In terms of how you tend to receive patients, do you have a practice outside the hospital, or at the hospital itself?  How does that work with you?  Do you have offices?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
188,716,26,25,"It's within the hospital, my -- my office.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
189,719,27,2,Where do your referrals tend to come from?  Just come through the hospital itself or --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
190,722,27,5,"So primarily from primary care doctors in the area.  Almost none of them are employed by Mercy Health.  And then I do do consultations on patients inside the hospital, not a lot, but I don't know, two or three a day would probably be average for patients that are admitted to the hospital with cardiology problems.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
191,730,27,13,"In your Tiffin area, do you have a competing hospital like ProMedica has down there or no?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

193,735,27,18,"Are your -- do your -- are your patients typically driven to the hospital, or, and I say driven, is -- is it typically a factor in patients being seen at your Mercy location in Tiffin the type of insurance they have?  And I can clarify, if you want a little bit --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
194,742,27,25,"Please do, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
195,744,28,1,"Yeah.  There has been a lot of testimony from various people, Dr. Kabour and others have testified in the case, and have walked through how insurance really sort of dictates where they can ultimately send a patient for referral, or how they get a patient sometimes, depending upon whether ProMedica controls it.  If ProMedica controls the insurance, the referrals go to ProMedica doctors, versus if they don't.  So what I'm trying to do is get a feel where you are in Tiffin, if you have the same type of -- because they're -- here in Toledo, where we are right now, where I am right now, they have this issue going on about how patients, you know, where they go.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
196,760,28,17,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
197,761,28,18,"Depending upon the insurance.  So I just want to get a feel from where you are, that's what you're seeing or --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
198,764,28,21,"Yeah.  In general, that has fairly little to do with where I send patients, to be honest.  There are situations where they do have a certain insurance. That's not very often, but it does happen, in which case, I would be sure to send them to a ProMedica hospital, sometimes there is a VA hospital, that kind of thing. Most patients over 65, you know, they go wherever I recommend them to go, based on what I think is best for their care.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
199,776,29,7,"And typically, on a -- since 2011 to the present, on an annual basis, approximately how many referrals would you make to Mercy hospitals for surgical procedure for a patient?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
200,781,29,12,"By a surgical procedure, I'll just qualify, I assume you're meaning CT surgery.  That's -- which is pretty much the only surgery that I, generally speaking, would refer to.  I wouldn't count a heart cath or a stent to be a surgery, but --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
201,787,29,18,I'm just talking about -- correct.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
202,789,29,20,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
203,790,29,21,"That's -- that's a fair definition, so using that definition.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
204,792,29,23,"I can only kind of do a wild guess, because I really don't know, but I would say somewhere between, in those eight years, 100 to maybe 3 or 400.  I know it's a wide range.  If I had to guess at a number, which, again, I really don't track these things, maybe 2 or 300.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,800,30,5,"Well, how about -- would it be easier to say on a month -- monthly basis, like roughly --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

207,804,30,9,-- how many on a monthly basis?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
208,805,30,10,"Sure.  So that would also vary, but I would say anywhere from 1 to 2 to maybe 6 or 7, maybe 10 on a really busy month.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,808,30,13,And these are patients from the Tiffin area that are being referred for surgery potentially at a Mercy hospital?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
210,811,30,16,They would be patients from the Tiffin area.  What was the second part of the question?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,814,30,19,"They would be referred to a Mercy hospital, for the most part, unless it was a person with a ProMedica insurance, or some other reason --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

227,848,32,1,"(By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor, just -- just FYI, one of the reasons I actually, you know, it's to an advantage sometimes not to be staring at me on a camera, is it helps to listen, but we get a little conversational sometimes.  And it's just -- it's not intended.  I can tell that you weren't trying to talk over me.  It just happens sometimes. I'll reask the question. Do -- so typically, do your referrals go to a Mercy hospital, absent what you described earlier, a situation like their insurance, or another factor, you know, causing them to have to be referred outside the system?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
228,863,32,16,"So I would say that I send patients to the place that I think they would be best cared for them, to the doctors I think that would best take care of them, regardless whether they're Mercy or not.  It does help that I know firsthand doctors at Mercy Health, and so that oftentimes is the case.  But I guess to straightforward answer your question, I send patients wherever they're going to get their best care, in my opinion, where they get their best care.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,875,33,2,"Okay.  But typically, where has that been?  In terms -- have you -- have you -- in terms of your patients, you have indicated that maybe 100, over 2011 to 2000, to the present, maybe anywhere from 100 to 3 or 400 surgical patients referred.  And where have those -- where has the highest percentage of those been referred to?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

254,934,35,9,Correct.  I have referred patients to Dr. DiBardino.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

265,958,36,7,"Well, just in terms of the time periods when those gentlemen, you could remember those gentlemen all being -- sort of there at the same time, or around the same time.  And I'm saying this, because at some point, Dr. Brunsting drops off, and it's just Burdine and Hashmi, until Holland comes in 2013.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
266,966,36,15,"Let me try and answer this in the best attitude of the question, at least assuming you want, obviously you want to know the, my thought process, and perhaps that will help.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,971,36,20,"No.  Okay.  Let me -- let me go back a second.  Let me -- let me -- let me give you a time period, so that this will make it easier for you, okay? You arrive when roughly in 2011?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
268,976,36,25,August.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,978,37,1,"August.  Okay.  So we're going to talk about the time period right now first, August of 2011 through April of 2013.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
270,981,37,4,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
271,982,37,5,"And during that time period, Dr. Holland arrives in April of 2013.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
272,984,37,7,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,985,37,8,"Okay.  So prior to April of 2013, there is only three potential surgeons, Brunsting, Burdine and Hashmi.  But Brunsting drops off, I think, in -- at the end of 2 -- December of 2012 roughly, Brunsting is gone, we believe.  So during the period that you first arrived, August of 2011, until Dr. Holland arrives in April of 2013, of those three surgeons, Brunsting, Burdine and Hashmi, who did you typically refer to?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
274,995,37,18,"It was a case-by-case basis, but again, to try and get you into my thinking on that one, is -- I'll just say up front, when I didn't know any of them, I basically referred to whoever was on call, so to speak, or who was in the office, or whatever, as I didn't really know who was good or -- or bad or whatever. And as I became more knowledgeable about each individual physician, and their outcomes, I then tailored my referrals based on whether I thought that doctor could or could not handle, you know, the case in front of me. And so to summarize that all, and that, really from that point on began with when cases were fairly difficult, complicated, or I needed a certain special technique, like minimally invasive, I would send to that doctor who can handle that, even if they were not on call. When they were straight, simple, straightforward, two or three vessel bypasses, that I thought any surgeon could do, I would typically call for whoever is on call, feeling confident they could handle it. Does that help?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,1023,38,20,"All right.  So, typically then you would indicate that you would just refer -- basically the -- the surgical office would take care of it, unless it was one that you specifically referred, because you believed it was more complicated and needed to -- special attention?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
276,1031,39,2,"Yeah.  That -- I'm sorry, that's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,1033,39,4,"Okay.  And -- and so your typical procedure, not -- and I'm not talking about your atypical special case, I'm talking about your typical.  Your typical procedure was to defer to the surgical office itself, in terms of the assignment of the surgeon?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
278,1039,39,10,"I don't know that I would qualify it as typical.  As I briefly said before, I would try to refer the patient to the doctor that I thought best to handle the situation. When any of the doctors could, I would refer to the -- the office, or the CT surgery office, to divvy up as they saw fit, assuming I thought all the doctors could handle it. Whether that was most of the cases, that's probably not the truth, that most cases were like that, but again, the simpler cases, I really was confident with any of the doctors handling the -- the patients.  Otherwise, I would specifically refer to the doctor I thought most appropriate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
279,1056,40,1,"Okay.  So before Dr. Holland arrived, who did you typically refer the complicated cases to?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
280,1059,40,4,"I will just say that my recollection of Dr. Holland, not Dr. Holland, sorry, Dr. Hashmi and Dr. Brunsting, I was fairly impressed early on with their outcomes. Not that I didn't think bad against Dr. Brunsting, but I do remember feeling more confident in their care over time, and so between the two of them, I felt, maybe equally, I felt confident in both those two surgeons.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,1069,40,14,Over Dr. Burdine?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
282,1070,40,15,"That's correct.  Which doesn't mean I didn't think he was good.  I just mean my experience was that the other two were, seemed stronger, in my experience, with their cases.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,1075,40,20,So you believed that you referred an equal number of cases to Dr. Brunsting and Dr. Hashmi in terms of complicated cases?  Or is it the case that you referred almost all of the cases to Dr. Hashmi and only a few to Dr. Brunsting?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
284,1082,41,1,"If you have numbers to show me, I could, I suppose, try and say what I think is right or wrong.  The best I can say is on a case-by-case basis, I tried to do what was best for the patients in front of me. As I said before, I felt confident both in Dr. Brunsting and Dr. Holland -- Hashmi.  What percentage, what number, I really can't tell you.  I don't remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,1091,41,10,"Well, we don't -- we have not been given the numbers yet from the hospital, Doctor.  We have asked for them, and so obviously I'll -- I'll caveat -- I'll caveat that, what I'm about to tell you.  But we do have a document, that Dr. Holland was -- was provided, and it shows that, at least for the numbers we have here, that you sent 13 cases to Dr. Hashmi, 4 cases to Dr. Burdine, and -- and only 2 cases to Dr. Brunsting.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
286,1101,41,20,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,1102,41,21,"Would that sound consistent with your memory, or does that sound that those numbers appear to be off to you?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
288,1105,41,24,I --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
289,1106,41,25,And this is --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
290,1108,42,1,"-- I could live with that. Honestly, I don't know for sure, and I have no -- I was never keeping track, but I guess if indeed that is the truth, I probably would not argue against it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,1113,42,6,"Okay.  And I -- and I just want to -- you mentioned the -- one of the things that you -- and you're -- you're in -- you practice on a daily basis in Tiffin, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
292,1117,42,10,"That's correct.  Monday through Friday, and on the phone on the weekends.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,1119,42,12,"Okay.  Well, other -- other than going to --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
294,1121,42,14,"Yeah, and St. Vincent's, occasionally.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
295,1123,42,16,"-- I know -- I know -- you know, for the most part day-to-day you're there. And so you indicated earlier that over time, you learned more about outcomes and -- of the surgeons.  And I'm wondering what your source of information was on that.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
296,1129,42,22,"So I would say when the patients came back to me, their recovery would be a big part of it, their attitude about the doctor and their care that they received.  That was, I'll be honest, quite important to me, that they felt their care was good too.  It's not just about the surgery itself.  And then I think the completeness of the procedure.  I realize every case has challenges, and they don't always go the way we think, but if -- I would always call every doctor, I would say almost without question, and talk to the surgeon and say, hey, this is what I'm thinking, take a look at the pictures, what do you think.  We would try to agree ahead of time on what we thought was the best course for the patient. When the patients came back, and that was done, I counted that as I can trust this guy and this surgeon.  When they came back, and that wasn't done, that would go against my feeling of -- of quality with that -- that doctor. So, I guess, lots of things went into what makes up my attitude about a different surgeon, but -- but those are the major ones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
297,1157,43,24,"Okay.  Well, I was just wondering, so you, from your own personal experience upon patients returning to you, you were able to identify or evaluate outcomes, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
298,1163,44,4,"Sure, that's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
299,1164,44,5,"And so that would mean that in order to evaluate a surgeon's outcomes, you would have to be referring them cases to begin with, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
300,1168,44,9,"Well, there are other ways to -- so, partly, that would be one way.  Another way would be when I refer patients, and the surgeon turns down the cases, or says they can't do it, or they don't think they can do it, or -- so that would be another example of how I can learn about a surgeon's quality experiences from their own lips, when I call them on cases.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
301,1177,44,18,"That doesn't tell you the outcomes, because that's just a surgeon saying they're not going to do the case.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
302,1180,44,21,So -- okay.  So I thought we were talking about how I evaluated --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
303,1182,44,23,No.  We're talking about outcomes.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
304,1184,44,25,"-- the quality of the surgeon. So yes, back to your point, yes, they would have to do a case for me to know the outcome of the surgery.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
305,1189,45,4,"Yeah.  Okay.  So -- and then I'm trying to -- I'm just trying -- you're in Tiffin, so I'm just trying to understand the information flow a little bit.  You know, I'm not asking you to speculate or guess, and there may be things you don't know.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
306,1195,45,10,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,1196,45,11,"And that's fair -- it's a fair answer.  I'm just trying to get your best information today, and you're -- and you're doing fine so far. So for example, no one would like mail you S, you know, Society of Thoracic Surgeon Data to the Tiffin hospital for you to review for each of the surgeons, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
308,1204,45,19,That's correct that I never received any data like that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
309,1206,45,21,Okay.  And you have heard -- have you heard that such data exists?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
310,1208,45,23,"I assume, and again, I only briefly know about this, but I think STS database is perhaps what you're speaking of --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
311,1212,46,1,Yeah.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
312,1213,46,2,"-- I have heard of it.  I have actually never seen it.  It's -- I -- so I've heard of it, but I've never seen it.  I'm really not familiar with the data in it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
313,1217,46,6,Are you -- are you generally familiar that there is an STS database?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
314,1219,46,8,"That there is a database with that name, correct, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
315,1221,46,10,"Just to be clear, when you came in -- when you came in to Mercy system, you received all of your training through Mercy basically?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
316,1225,46,14,"No, none of my training through Mercy.  Well, that's actually not true.  I'm sorry.  So almost 95 percent of my training is through UT Medical Center.  In full disclosure, I actually did do six months of training at St. Vincent's Hospital during my internal medicine years, but Mercy Health did not give me my training.  UT -- University of Toledo Medical Center did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
317,1234,46,23,"Do you know what is contained in the STS database, generally?  And I don't mean specifics of the exact data, but do you have a general idea what is contained in there?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
318,1239,47,2,"So I believe that, and again, I actually don't even know who sets this up, but my understanding of that database is it's a database that surgeons use to keep track of their own infection rates, or complication rates, or death rates, or those kinds of things.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
319,1246,47,9,"Okay.  And in terms of working at Mercy, no one at Mercy-Tiffin Hospital has ever indicated to you that it's a best practice, or a good practice, for referring cardiologists have access to that information, so they can see the exact statistics of how things are turning out?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
320,1253,47,16,"Neither at UT Medical Center, or at Mercy Health, has anybody ever suggested that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
321,1256,47,19,"Okay.  And so -- fair enough. When you were training, how many surgeries did you participate in?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
322,1259,47,22,You talking about cardiothoracic surgeries?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
323,1261,47,24,Yes.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
324,1262,47,25,"I'll estimate the best I can, but I would probably say maybe 30 or 40 cases directly in the operating room, if that's what you're asking.  I mean, obviously hundreds of cases that I took care of patients that were admitted to the hospital, who then went to the surgery, and I would be consulted on, and see in the hospital.  But if you're asking in the operating room, probably 30 to 40, but hundreds over the course of their care over my training.  Maybe -- maybe even a thousand.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
325,1274,48,11,"Now, in terms of Mercy, did you ever sit in or participate in a surgery with Dr. Brunsting?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
326,1277,48,14,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
327,1278,48,15,Did you ever sit in or participate in a surgery with Dr. Burdine?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
328,1280,48,17,I have not participated in any surgeon's actual operating room.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
329,1282,48,19,Okay.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
330,1283,48,20,At Mercy Health.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
331,1284,48,21,"All right.  And so you did not participate in any surgeries with Dr. Hashmi, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
332,1287,48,24,"Not in the operating room, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
333,1288,48,25,"And you never observed, just to confirm, you never observed any of the surgeons performing surgeries at Mercy hospitals actually performing them in person, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
334,1294,49,5,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
335,1295,49,6,"Now -- all right.  So prior to April of 2013, when Dr. Holland arrived, we were talking about your understanding of outcomes.  Although, I -- let me go back a second.  We were just talking about outcomes before maybe generally.  But other than seeing patients that come back, did you have any -- strike that. Other than what you've already mentioned, did you have any other sources of information pertaining to the outcomes that you were relying upon when you were referring patients?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
336,1308,49,19,"Again, I'm not -- for total completeness sake, I suppose one more would be talking to the primary care doctors and their -- the -- my -- the doctors that referred to me, their attitudes or feelings about the outcomes and the care, but I can't really think of any other sources of things that I would take into account, as far as outcomes and quality.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
337,1318,50,3,"Okay.  So for the period prior to Dr. Holland's arrival in April of 2013, what -- what doctors, if any, would provide you with their opinions about outcomes, that would then influence who you referred patients to?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
338,1323,50,8,"I can't think of specific names, but again, to try and answer the attitude of your question, when patients would come back from surgery, and they would follow up with their primary care doctor, and the primary care doctor would say, how did your surgery go, what did you think of the surgeon, you know, how was your care?  Frequently, some of those doctors would get back to me, especially when there was things that were poor, and sometimes things that were good, and so those doctors would give me feedback. Specific doctors that said it, I, again, if you want me to list all the doctors at Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital, that will be a list, but specific names or times, I -- I can't tell you.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
339,1340,50,25,"Well, was there ever any reason that you didn't want to refer cases to Dr. Burdine that you can think of?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
340,1344,51,3,"No.  He was technically a -- forgive me.  I want to just think about the term.  His -- his technical title was a -- forgive me, I'll do the best I can here -- a thoracic surgeon that focused on thoracic surgery in general, not on cardiothoracic surgery.  In other words, bypass surgery.  He could do them, he did do them.  As far as I know, he had good outcomes, but he focused on taking out tumors in the lung, or those kind of things.  So -- I'm sorry, what was the question again?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
341,1356,51,15,Where -- where did you learn that information about that's what Dr. Burdine specialized in?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
342,1359,51,18,From Dr. Burdine.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
343,1360,51,19,Dr. Burdine told you that?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
344,1361,51,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
345,1362,51,21,Did he ever talk to you about the Muslims?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
346,1364,51,23,Never.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
347,1365,51,24,Did he ever complain to you about the fact that he wasn't getting referrals?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
348,1368,52,1,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
349,1369,52,2,Did he ever tell you that he circulated a memo about referrals?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
350,1371,52,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
351,1372,52,5,Because he was upset about them?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
352,1373,52,6,I -- I've never heard that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
353,1374,52,7,"No?  Okay. Well, now Dr. Brunsting, any reason you can think of that you didn't refer -- you wouldn't refer cases to Dr. Brunsting?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
354,1378,52,11,"The -- and I -- I don't know this for sure, but again, I'll do the best I can with what I -- I remember, is that although I think from a surgical standpoint of basic, cardiothoracic surgery, I felt equally confident in general about those two.  If it was a minimally invasive case, I knew that Dr. Hashmi could do that.  In other words, not crack the chest.  And so that would be a reason why I would specifically refer to him. I do not believe, and you feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I do not believe that Dr. Brunsting did that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
355,1391,52,24,"Okay.  Well, I will correct you, because you are wrong actually.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
356,1394,53,1,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
357,1395,53,2,"Yeah.  Dr. Brunsting came in, and although there is conflicting -- there is some varying testimony on this point as to the degree, but Dr. Brunsting knew how to do minimally invasive surgery before he came, and assisted or participated with Dr. Hashmi in performing surgeries, minimally invasive surgeries. There is also some evidence, although I will, again, represent to you it's conflicting from the witnesses, that Dr. Brunsting participated in training Dr. Hashmi into how to do that.  And Dr. Brunsting also did robotic surgery. So I -- I, you know, with those representations in mind, were you not aware that Dr. Brunsting did minimally invasive procedures, until I mentioned that to you today?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
358,1414,53,21,I do not remember him mentioning that to me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
359,1416,53,23,"Okay.  All right.  So other than the -- other than what you just mentioned, any other -- anything else you can think of why you wouldn't have referred to Dr. Brunsting?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
360,1421,54,2,"Nothing comes to mind, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
361,1422,54,3,Do you know a doctor named Ed Nahhas?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
362,1424,54,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
363,1425,54,6,Were you ever made aware that Dr. Nahhas appears on an audio recording in this case?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
364,1428,54,9,I was not aware.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
365,1429,54,10,"And that -- and this isn't a direct quote, but Dr. Nahhas says words to the effect that Dr. Brunsting told him that he was unable to get referrals, because Hashmi was very controlling, like he had a mafia behind the scenes.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat
366,1435,54,16,"Objection, form and misrepresentation.",side_chat,MR. WIENCEK,start_chat

369,1440,54,21,(By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat
370,1441,54,22,Thank you.  And I'm going to -- we'll address it later.,side_chat,MR. ARCHINACO,start_question
371,1443,54,24,"(By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor, now, have you ever heard words used -- or strike that. Did you ever hear, from any source, that Dr. Hashmi was controlling in the way the referrals were?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
372,1450,55,5,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
373,1451,55,6,"And did you have any insight into how the office was being run at Mercy-St. Vincent that the cardiologists, or the cardiothoracic surgeons all operated from? Did you ever have any insight as to how that office operated?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
374,1457,55,12,"Specifics, no.  And I'll just, to be complete, the best of my ability is, kind of as I mentioned earlier, is that when I called and said I wanted a specific surgeon to be consulted, I expected that would be done, and that was done.  When I said, hey, whoever is on, you know, I was fine to take care of this -- this case, that that happened as well. That's all I know, as far as how the office was run.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
375,1467,55,22,"Well, how -- how frequent -- in terms of whether or not a patient was -- a surgeon was selected by you, versus you deferred to the office to do so, with what frequency did those occur?  What percentages?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
376,1473,56,2,Not --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
377,1474,56,3,Best estimate.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
378,1475,56,4,"-- not trying to be evasive, I never tracked that to any kind.  It really was a case-by-case basis. I'll actually add one more.  Again, forgive me.  Perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier, but since I do heart catheterizations, and at that time we find out they need bypass surgery, when the disease is severe, usually what I would do is I would, if it was my partner who was the primary caretaker of this patient, and I was just doing the heart cath, I would call the, my partner and say, hey, this is the stuff, and, hey, let's take a look at the pictures together, and if we agree the patient needed bypass surgery, or be referred for bypass surgery, I would say, who do you want me to refer 'em to, and so I would do that. If it was a primary care doctor, who I knew cared, and some did, I would call them and say, hey, who do you want?  Do you have a preference?  And occasionally they would say things, and I would say, well, this is the reason I might do this or that, but then we agreed, and then I would make that referral. So again, based on the outcomes of those discussions, some would go to the pool, and some would go to specific doctors.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
379,1505,57,8,"Okay.  Well, do you recall it being more frequent that it would go to the pool, or that you would pick out specific doctors?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
380,1509,57,12,"To be honest, probably more frequent that I would go to specific doctors. I'll just say that I have a fairly straightforward attitude about this.  And that is, I would never refer a patient to a doctor that I wouldn't have my own father get surgery on. And so on a case-by-case basis, if I thought, hey, I wouldn't mind if this doctor did surgery on my surgery, or on my father, that would be fine.  If I felt nervous about the outcome, because of the patient's age, or comorbidities, or I needed minimally invasive, or whatever, then I would, in those situations, say, jee, if it was my dad, I'd probably call this guy, in which case -- so that did probably lead to more patients being referred to the direct doctor, than as opposed to the pool, so to speak.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
381,1529,58,6,"And during the years that you were referring patients to Dr. Fayyaz Hashmi, what did you do to educate yourself, if anything, about his death statistics?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
382,1533,58,10,"Well, on my own cases, I only remember one case of any patient ever dying. I -- I'm not saying that that couldn't have been otherwise, but from my experience with him, which was probably at least 100 or more cases, he had very low death certificates, based on, you know, my experience with the patients I sent him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
383,1541,58,18,"And you believe that -- and you believe that those cases that you sent him, those hundred or so cases, were sent over the time period, let's say 2011 until whenever Dr. Hashmi left, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
384,1546,58,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
385,1547,58,24,"And according to what you saw, for your patients at least, you didn't even see any complication rates that seemed to be high, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
386,1552,59,3,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
387,1553,59,4,"So if these deaths and complications were happening in Hashmi patients, they must have been in -- if they were, they were happening in some other doctors' referrals, because they certainly weren't happening in yours, right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
388,1559,59,10,"As I said, I did not see any significant, unexpected number of complications with Dr. Hashmi with the patients I referred to him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
389,1563,59,14,"Now, in the year 2000 -- we've mentioned Brunsting and Burdine, and we've talked about case numbers and referrals.  So I'll talk about April 2013, until the time that Dr. Holland left. And in the years that Dr. Holland, Dr. Hashmi and Dr. Phillips were there, and there is -- there is overlap.  Not in every year.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

393,1577,60,2,Phillips comes in -- hang on one second. Dr. Phillips comes in basically May of 2015.  So we're now talking Dr. Holland arrives in April of 2013.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
394,1582,60,7,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
395,1583,60,8,Dr. Phillips arrives in approximately May of 2015.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
396,1585,60,10,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
397,1586,60,11,"And then Dr. Holland was the first to depart, Dr. Hashmi retired, after Dr. Holland left, I believe.  Dr. Holland left in or about March 2018. So we're looking at the period of April 2013 through roughly March of 2018, that five-year period.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
398,1593,60,18,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
399,1594,60,19,"And we know from what you have testified that for about 2011, until the end of Dr. Hashmi's tenure, which I believe was in 2018 as well, when he left, you had approximately 100 cases referred to Dr. Hashmi, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
400,1600,60,25,"I would say at least 100 cases, would be my estimate.  I don't know a number, but roughly, that's probably fair.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
401,1604,61,3,"Okay.  And in the years 2000, May of 2015, until March of 2018, roughly, that three-year period, how many cases did you refer to Dr. Phillips?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

407,1615,61,14,"Well, how many did you refer, less than 10 to Dr. Phillips?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
408,1617,61,16,"I really don't know, but if you told me 30, I wouldn't be surprised.  If you told me 10, I could believe that as well.  So if you have the numbers, feel free to just tell me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

422,1650,62,23,"-- I'll go back to my words.  If my own father, I felt that my own father I would refer to him, and that he would have a good outcome, then I would refer to Dr. Holland and not feel bad about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

433,1683,64,4,"Yes.  And we'll take a break after this.  How did you determine quality, if you didn't look at data?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
434,1686,64,7,"So data is outcomes of my patients, so -- and I told you that -- you're saying, again -- again, I just want to make sure I answer your question correctly.  You're saying how did I determine quality, if I didn't refer patients, is that what you said?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

436,1694,64,15,"So as I mentioned before, quality has many forms.  Probably the most important one is the ones that come back to me, how they recover, how -- whether what I have asked to be done is done, whether the patients felt they got good care, so that is data.  And so that's data I'm analyzing and -- and taking over time and forming an opinion about a doctor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
437,1703,64,24,"Okay.  Well, you would like a break, and I think we're over about an hour, over an hour at this point, so let's take a break, about 10 minutes or so, take restroom and whatnot, so that we can -- thank you, Doctor.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

442,1716,65,11,"(By Mr. Archinaco) Took a short break, Doctor.  You're always welcome to take a break, provided there is no question pending.  We had been going for a while, so ... okay.  I was coming back to referrals with Dr. Holland. So am I correct that between November of 2013, and the RR case, from November of 2013, until the time that RR presented to the hospital, that you had no communications whatsoever with Dr. Holland?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
443,1727,65,22,That is incorrect.  I did have communications with Dr. Holland during that time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
444,1730,65,25,"Okay.  What type of communications did you have with Dr. Holland during that time, between November of 2013, and the time when RR presented to the hospital in May 2017, what type of communications did you have with Dr. Holland during that time period?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
445,1738,66,7,"So I'll do the best I can on this, but he may or may not have come down and met me in the Tiffin office.  I -- I know Dr. Burdine did, I know Dr. Hashmi did, and I probably assume that he did too, so I expected I probably met him at that time.  I certainly didn't have any ill feelings.  He seemed like a nice enough guy. The first time I really remember for sure meeting him, though, that I can clearly remember, was when I was doing a case up at St. Vincent's Hospital, what I felt was a pretty straightforward 55, 50-something-year-old man, who needed a couple bypasses and a valve surgery done.  And so I asked the cath lab staff who is around, and they said Dr. Holland, and so I said, well, sure, let's consult him. And we spoke about the case, we reviewed the films, and he said, great, sounds like a great patient, let's get him set up. I'll talk to him, and you know, I'll let you know when things are done.  That was the first time I -- I can remember meeting him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
446,1763,67,6,Do you remember when that -- what year that was?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
447,1765,67,8,"I really don't.  I personally think it was probably within the first few months of him, you know, joining Mercy Health, but I -- I really could not tell you that for sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
448,1770,67,13,"Okay.  And -- well, the first few months, he was in -- Dr. Holland came in April of 2013.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
449,1773,67,16,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
450,1774,67,17,Okay.  So you met him in the first couple of months?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
451,1776,67,19,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
452,1777,67,20,"Okay.  And then other than meeting him in the first couple of months in person, how many other times did you ever see Dr. Holland, that you can remember?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
453,1781,67,24,"In person, probably just a half dozen times.  Certainly not more than a dozen times, over that entire time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

456,1788,68,5,-- down to your area or --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
457,1789,68,6,"No.  I'm not sure I ever saw him again down in Tiffin area.  But when I would be up at St. Vincent's Hospital doing cases there, I would, again, occasionally refer patients to him, depending on the -- the situation. I may have seen him at some conferences-type stuff, and you know, briefly talked to him there, so that was my firsthand in-person experience with Dr. Holland.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
458,1799,68,16,"And in person, when you would have experience with him, were those, generally speaking, professional interactions? And I'll leave out RR case for --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
459,1803,68,20,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

461,1808,68,25,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
462,1810,69,1,"Other than RR case, the times when you would see him in a personal basis, what was your typical interaction?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
463,1813,69,4,"As far as his attitude and friendliness in general, he seemed fine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
464,1815,69,6,"All right.  Now, you did refer him a case in 2013; is that correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
465,1817,69,8,"I -- again, as -- if you're talking about what I told you about the first time I met him, and if indeed that was the first few months of him being there, then -- then yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
466,1822,69,13,"Did you ever send him any text messages, Dr. Holland, that you can recall?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

468,1826,69,17,"And would that be typically something you would do, when you had a patient that you referred to Dr. Holland, that you might text him for a status or update?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
469,1830,69,21,"Sometimes.  I would rarely make that my, you know, go to way of, you know, doing a consultation, if ever.  My text message communication with doctors, in general, would be, you know, if they had a question for me, or an update, or I needed to convey something to them.  Again, some doctors liked it, some didn't.  I don't really remember Dr. Holland being a text person per se, but again, I would not at all be surprised if we have some texts back and forth over the years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
470,1843,70,8,Okay.  Do you -- do you recall -- by you -- you seem to have a recollection of referring doctor patient -- Dr. Holland patients over the course of the years that he was at Mercy; is that correct?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
471,1848,70,13,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
472,1849,70,14,"So from time to time, if you believed that a patient -- strike that. What type of cases did you refer to Dr. Holland, if you can recall?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
473,1853,70,18,"The overview answer would be cases I thought he could handle and do well, as if it was my own father.  More specifically, again, more complicated cases, or minimally invasive, I would definitely not. But other than that, again, as long as I felt he could do a good job on this, what would probably be, safe to say, fairly more straightforward cases, yes, I would refer patients to him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
474,1864,71,3,"Now, did you ever -- now, you said more straightforward cases.  Did you ever refer any complicated case to Dr. Holland, that you would deem to be complicated?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
475,1868,71,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
476,1869,71,8,What year?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
477,1870,71,9,"So, again, early on, when I didn't know him, or his -- his quality, I certainly referred complicated cases to him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
478,1873,71,12,"And if the data showed that over the course of time that Dr. Holland was at Mercy that you only referred one case to him the entire time he was there, would -- would you contest that?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
479,1878,71,17,"I would be very surprised by that. Which, by the way, for the record, ref -- so calling Dr. Holland to say, hey, I think you should do this case, and when he would refuse the case, what I would consider a referral, but it wouldn't show up on your record as a referral, because he never did the case.  So there were instances where I called him, asked him his thoughts, and he said, oh, gosh, I think that's too hard.  I -- I don't know, let's not do that.  Sometimes that, I -- I agreed with him and thought that was the right thing.  Probably more often I referred to other CT surgeons, who then said, no, no, no, we can do this, and so the cases were done. So again, probably the only data you're talking about is ones he actually did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
480,1898,72,11,"Now, you said -- well, yeah. Well -- now, let's talk about the refusals. How many times do you recall referring a case to Dr. Holland and then him refusing it?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
481,1902,72,15,"I would say at least two or three times, I could say with good confidence.  It may have been four or five times, but at least two or three times.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
482,1906,72,19,And when was -- and when were these?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
483,1908,72,21,Early on.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
484,1909,72,22,Do you recall the year?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
485,1910,72,23,"Probably '13, '14, early on in my experience with Dr. Holland.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
486,1912,72,25,"So he was rejecting referrals from you, and you would talk to him on the phone?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
487,1916,73,3,"Sometimes on the phone.  Again, sometimes in person at St. Vincent's Hospital. Or, by the way, it wouldn't necessarily be directly.  Sometimes he would see the patient in the office, and then he would call me back and say, gosh, I don't know, I'm not sure it's a good idea, and -- and so, again, sometimes I would agree with him and say, okay, fine, maybe we won't do it.  Probably more often we would agree to disagree, and I would go a different direction.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
488,1927,73,14,"And that's because Dr. Holland wasn't known for doing -- he couldn't do complicated cases, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
489,1930,73,17,"I don't know if he was known, so to speak.  All I know is when he would refer -- refuse complicated cases, that made me feel that he was not confident doing complicated cases.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
490,1935,73,22,"Well, let me ask you what you heard from anyone else.  I mean, did -- did anyone else ever tell you that Dr. Holland was not qualified or incapable of doing complicated cases?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
491,1941,74,2,So I can think of one example very clearly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
492,1943,74,4,A person?  Okay.  Who was the person who said it?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
493,1945,74,6,Dr. Letcher.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

499,1954,74,15,"So, again, I'm going back to the -- this is the first case that I referred to Dr. Holland, so I believe probably within the first few months of him joining in '13. Certainly probably would have been, at latest, in '14.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
500,1960,74,21,You had a conversation with John Letcher.  And what type of doctor is John Letcher?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

503,1967,75,2,"So again, to my --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
504,1968,75,3,-- about Dr. Holland?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
505,1969,75,4,"Go ahead, I'm sorry.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
506,1970,75,5,You said you talked to him about Dr. Holland?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
507,1972,75,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
508,1973,75,8,Okay.  What -- what did he -- what did you talk about with him and Dr. Holland in 2013 or early 2014?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
509,1976,75,11,"So I had seen this patient.  He was, again, 50s roughly, had a pretty severe, leaky valve.  His heart was weak, probably around 30 percent or so.  And he had a, to my recollection, two or three bypasses that needed to be done.  I think it was just two, but anyway, I did the heart cath up at St. Vincent's Hospital.  I said who's here, and they said, you know, Dr. Holland.  I said, sure, let's consult him. I spoke with him on the case.  And again, 50s, these are dream patients, in their 50s.  Didn't have diabetes or other complicating problems, and so didn't have kidney issues. So anyway, Dr. Holland said, yeah, absolutely, I'd be happy to see him, I think we can get this taken care of, and we'll get it set up, and I'll let you know how it goes, which I was happy with. And then the day of his surgery, which was about two weeks later, I get a call from the patient, who says, Dr. Holland cancelled my surgery today, the day of the surgery.  To which I said, okay, well, let me -- I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation. Let me see what I can find out.  And so I called Dr. Holland, and he said, oh, gosh, I don't know.  You know, I was looking at his films, and his heart is weak, and you know, I know he's in his 50s, but I just -- I just don't know.  Tell you what, why don't you talk to an interventional cardiologist, see if they would be willing to put a couple of stents in those blockages, and that way, after you, you know, fix the blockages, and maybe his heart gets a little bit stronger, then I'll do surgery on the valve. And I said, well, that's pretty unusual.  I mean, if somebody needs a valve, then we would -- and they also need, you know, bypass surgery of the -- of the blockages, we would almost always do those together. And he says, well, I know, but I just -- I just think it might be best to kind of piece this up, and you know, and I said, okay.  I'll talk to an interventional cardiologist. So that's when I spoke with John Letcher.  I was actually at St. Vincent's at the time.  Again, this is like -- the next day I was going up to St. Vincent's, and I saw John Letcher in the hallway, who is a very well-respected interventional cardiologist, 20 plus years experience.  And so I said, hey, would you mind reviewing a case with me. Dr. Holland asked me to -- to get a second opinion here on whether, how we should do this.  And so I told him the story, the case, I showed him the pictures.  I absolutely did not influence him in any way.  And I said, what do you think?  And he said, to the best quote that I can think of, I think you need to find yourself another surgeon, because any surgeon who would not do the bypass in this case is probably not fit to do the valve either. So that was one of my first takeaways from Dr. Holland, and to which I -- I don't remember the details of how I relayed that back to Dr. Holland, but the short was I met with the patient.  I said, hey, I think I'd like to have you see a different surgeon. I spoke with Dr. Hashmi.  He reviewed the case.  He said, no problem, we'll take care of it.  He had the surgery done, and I still see that patient to this day, who's doing great.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
510,2056,78,13,"Okay.  So this was a patient in their -- their 50s, that you called a dream patient for surgery?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

515,2070,79,1,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

522,2087,79,18,"And in terms of the safety issue, did he explain to you what he thought the problem was that would cause potentially an increased risk to the patient of death, if the surgery was performed right then?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat

531,2106,80,11,"I'll do the best I can with this to hopefully get you the answer you, or the -- my understanding of the situation, anyway. And that is that he just felt, in general, that the weakness of the heart, the blockages in his coronary arteries, combined with the severity of the leaky valve, that he could not do it safely, and it would be wiser if it was done, he only did the surgery after the -- the bypass grafts were, I'm sorry, the blocked arteries were stented. So back -- back to directly your question, I don't remember any of the details about why he didn't want to do it, other than he didn't feel comfortable that he could do it safely for the patient.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
532,2123,81,2,"Dr. Bruhl, at the time that this patient presented to you, was the patient in heart failure?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
533,2126,81,5,"A degree of heart failure, sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
534,2127,81,6,"And are there instances that you know of where a patient's heart failure, or the condition that they're in, would be a -- a contraindicator to surgery, at least on a temporary basis?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
535,2132,81,11,"Yes, I think that would be true. There are instances.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
536,2134,81,13,"And so there are instances, are there not, where a patient's medical condition is such with their, the stage of their heart failure, that you treat them for maybe even a month or two, and then bring them back for surgery; is that right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
537,2140,81,19,"That can potentially be true, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
538,2142,81,21,"So at least as to this patient, Dr. Holland appears to have been the camp of he believed that the patient should be treated more conservatively first, and then the surgery performed later, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
539,2148,82,1,"No.  I -- I don't think that's the case at all.  If he would have said, let's treat his heart failure, and then I'll do the bypass grafts, and the valve, then I think that could be true. What he said is, I don't want to do the case at all, as is, fix the valve, the blockage problems first, and I only want to do the valve problem.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
540,2157,82,10,"Well, did -- Dr. Holland's a surgeon, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
541,2159,82,12,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
542,2160,82,13,"And do you believe -- you believe that during your conversation with him, he did or did not talk to you about surgical risk or operative risk?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
543,2164,82,17,"Whether that word was brought up, I probably doubt that.  Again, the best I can do for you is, from that conversation, he conveyed to me that he did not feel that he could do the surgery safely, as is with the patient in their current condition with the, again, with a valve and the blockages.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
544,2171,82,24,"Now, after that patient, did you -- you -- you said that you believed you did refer Dr. Holland additional patients?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
545,2175,83,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
546,2176,83,3,"So despite that interaction with him, you continued to refer him patients?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

548,2181,83,8,"Now, the skill set you were aware of was that interaction with Dr. Holland, where he said in that instance he didn't feel -- just the -- strike that. The interaction you described with the patient in 2013, other than that patient, was there any other patient, at that point in time, that you had to evaluate Dr. Holland's quality or his surgical abilities?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
549,2190,83,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
550,2191,83,18,You had -- you had previously referred him --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
551,2193,83,20,"Oh, previous -- I'm sorry.  I thought you said after that.  No, forgive me. No, I don't remember any.  There may have been other cases previously, but I don't remember previous cases before that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
552,2198,83,25,"So at that point in time, that's the only case you had to evaluate either his surgical ability, or his quality -- quality and outcome, that you can think of?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
553,2203,84,4,"That I can think of off the top of my head, that's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
554,2205,84,6,"So you based your evaluation of his quality, or his surgical abilities, based upon a case that he did not actually perform?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
555,2208,84,9,That was certainly one of the deciding factors on the assessment of his quality.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
556,2211,84,12,What did -- what do you think brought him to Mercy to begin with?  Why do you think Dr. Holland came and began working at Mercy in any capacity?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat
557,2215,84,16,"Objection, speculation.",side_chat,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
558,2217,84,18,I have absolutely no idea.  I assume that he wanted to do CT surgery.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
559,2219,84,20,"You indicated that Dr. Holland -- it was one of many factors you used in determining Dr. Holland's quality -- quality, was your interactions with him about the patient you described in 2013.  What -- what were the others, if any?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
560,2226,85,1,"So I think my overall impression of Dr. Holland, like most impressions of most doctors that I evaluate over time, is something that develops over years, over multiple experiences.  Some of those experiences are very memorable, especially when I think they're far out of normal.  Other ones, I don't remember.  So although I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever I did refer other patients to him, I did have outcomes from other patients with him.  I certainly had feedback from both patients and primary care doctors about his care. If -- and I -- again, I don't remember any other specific examples, provided one, which I don't know will add a whole lot of value, but if you would like, I can tell you the only other case specifically I can remember of a questionable outcome with Dr. Holland.  Actually, two.  I can think of two now.  Would you like me to tell you those?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
561,2247,85,22,"Yeah.  If you can remember any -- any interactions with him, where you think that you referred him patients, other than this person in 2013.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
562,2252,86,1,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
563,2253,86,2,"By all means, tell me what --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
564,2254,86,3,So --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
565,2255,86,4,-- first leads you to believe you referred a patient to him.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
566,2257,86,6,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
567,2258,86,7,"And then second, what you can recall about --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
568,2260,86,9,"Okay.  Yeah, it will be brief, because I don't remember a lot of details about it, but then we can just say that's all I remember. But the only other situation is I do remember sitting in my office, getting a call from Dr. Holland, and saying, hey, that patient you referred me, I'm in the OR right now.  You know, I don't think that right coronary is very big, and you know, I really think it might cause more problems if I, you know, do the bypass, so I'm just telling you, I really don't think I should do it, so you know, just so -- don't be surprised, you know, when he comes back and he doesn't get that right coronary done.  I think it might be more risk than benefit.  To which I would always say to a surgeon, inside the operating room, if they're there, and I'm here, do what he thinks is best.  I certainly wouldn't try and doing something he thought was wrong at the time, but that is one example I remember. And the only other one, and again, this really covers all I remember specifically about cases, is I got a call from one of the primary care doctors, Dr. Felton, if you want to know the name, and said, who is this Holland guy?  To which I said, what is -- what is the issue?  And he says, gosh, I just got one of my patients back.  I went to the surgical report.  He did this crazy surgery that hasn't been done in 20 years.  I had to research it.  Where he cut half the left ventricle open, and he cut out half the cor, you know, a fourth of the left ventricle, and he sewed it back together.  That -- that is a surgery that nobody does anymore.  And so I don't know if he's ahead of his time, or he's just way behind his time, but considering the guy's not doing that good, I'm wondering if that was a good idea or not. And he -- I think he said something to the effect of, I think we ought to keep an eye on this guy.  I'm not exactly sure his -- his skills are up to -- to date.  And I said, okay, well, we'll -- we'll keep an eye on him, and that was the only other interaction I remember specifically about a patient that Dr. Holland did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
569,2311,88,8,"Okay.  Dr. Bruhl, I just want to go back to the first patient just really quickly.  Thank you -- thank you for those, and I'll just -- I'll walk through these quickly. The first patient, you got a call when Dr. Holland was in the operating room, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
570,2319,88,16,You are talking about the right coronary case I spoke about?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
571,2321,88,18,Yes.  The first one that you mentioned just now.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
572,2323,88,20,Yes.  I -- it was my impression I felt pretty confident -- I feel pretty confident that's true that he was calling me from the operating room.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
573,2327,88,24,"Yeah.  And that -- and that's not -- that's nothing that would be necessarily unusual.  A surgeon can and does do that, call --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
574,2332,89,3,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
575,2333,89,4,-- the cardiologists -- sorry. Did you get some feedback?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
576,2335,89,6,That's my fault.  I'm sorry.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
577,2336,89,7,"No, that's okay.  That is not unusual, that a surgeon might do that, call the cardiologist, if they're seeing something unanticipated, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
578,2340,89,11,That -- that is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
579,2341,89,12,"In fact, that is something that would be, in some instances, preferred to do that, to get the opinion of the cardiologist when they're seeing something?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
580,2345,89,16,"Yes, I would agree.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
581,2346,89,17,"Okay.  And then on the second one, Dr. Felton, now, where is Dr. Felton located, by the way?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
582,2349,89,20,"He's a primary care doctor in Tiffin, Ohio.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

587,2361,90,6,"All right.  Well, we'll look it up at some point, but it's more of a, less than 100,000 probably in Tiffin itself?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
588,2364,90,9,"If that was the number, I would believe it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
589,2366,90,11,"Okay.  I don't -- I would have to look it up.  Maybe we could do that while we're here, but the -- Dr. Felton was a primary -- is a primary care in the Tiffin area, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
590,2371,90,16,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
591,2372,90,17,"And the operation that Dr. Felton was referring to, do you know if that is known as a ventricular aneurysm repair?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
592,2375,90,20,"I do not believe that was the -- the case.  I, again, I'll do the best I can, but I believe he had ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, which means the heart is enlarged or stretched out.  And I do know in the past, there was some feeling that perhaps cutting down the size of the left ventricle, to reshape it, may be of some value. I will admit that in my 18 years of being in medicine, including medical school, I do not remember a single case being done that way at UT Medical Center, or any other hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
593,2389,91,8,"Well, let's -- let's go back for a second.  Do you know what an enlarged or stretched-out heart, whether that means that a person has an aneurysm?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
594,2393,91,12,"It can mean, but it does not mean, does not mean that they do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
595,2395,91,14,"Did the echo in the operating room show that, or do you know whether or not the echo in the operating room with this patient showed dyskinesis?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

598,2403,91,22,"Yes, I do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
599,2404,91,23,What is it?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
600,2405,91,24,"It means the heart is going the wrong direction, when it's supposed to be going, contracting in, it's going out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
601,2409,92,2,And is that -- is that an indication that there is an aneurysm?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
602,2411,92,4,"It does not mean there is an aneurysm, but it can mean there is an aneurysm.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
603,2414,92,7,"Okay.  So -- so what we have talked about, the enlarged, or stretched-out heart, plus dyskinesis, those two factors could indicate that there is an aneurysm?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
604,2418,92,11,"I'm not going to go through the definition of aneurysm with you, but I will restate what I said before, that dyskinesis can be part of an aneurysm, but it does not mean that there is an aneurysm.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
605,2423,92,16,"Now, in terms of -- do you know what a -- do you know how complicated a procedure a ventricular aneurysm repair is?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

613,2445,93,12,I do not know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

620,2458,93,25,"Oh, don't want you to do that. Fair enough. Okay.  Now, other than those two that you can think of, anything else you can think of in terms of cases you interacted with Dr. Holland on before RR's case?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

623,2469,94,10,"Is I was doing a case more recently, and this actually was after 2017, after that RR case, where I was doing a heart cath case at St. Vincent's Hospital, and Dr. Phillips and Dr. Holland came down concerned, let's go with very concerned, about the outcome of a surgery, surgery case that they had done.  And I don't know specifically if it was Phillips or Holland or both.  I guess I had a feeling they both had done it, but it looked like they were having a heart attack, and they wanted consultation on the EKG, and whether it was or not a heart attack, and whether they did or not need to go for an emergency stenting.  But that is, like I said, the only -- only other memory I have of -- of them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

636,2520,96,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
637,2521,96,10,"Now, with regard to the 2013 case, you judged quality, you had an indication of quality or surgical ability, based upon the fact that Dr. Holland did not want to do that procedure, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
638,2526,96,15,That certainly was some part of my information of his quality.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
639,2528,96,17,"Okay.  And then the next case you mentioned was the one where he called you from the OR itself, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
640,2531,96,20,I did mention that as another example.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
641,2533,96,22,"Okay.  But that one, you're not -- you're -- are you -- did you -- do you believe that there is a lack of quality, because he called you from the OR?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
642,2538,97,1,"The calling from the OR, it certainly had nothing to do with quality.  The fact that he couldn't, or wouldn't, do the bypass, I would say, in general, does not always mean lack of quality, but the relative frequency in which he did not do the bypass to the right coronary artery, certainly would indicate less than ideal level of quality.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

647,2553,97,16,"And that's because when he got in, because he was actually in the OR seeing the patient's heart, and you weren't, and he decided, or want -- did not want to bypass one of the areas that you had identified that you wanted bypassed?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
648,2559,97,22,"So like I said earlier, that the overall impression of a doctor's quality is more than singlisis at times.  It's overall attitude.  And specifically if you're asking me about whether his bypass of right coronary arteries, or lack of bypass of right coronary arteries, which, of course, this is an example, made me think he was a better doctor, or a worse doctor, I would certainly say that in general, when patients came back with a much higher percentage of cases not having right coronaries bypassed, including this case, but not limited to this case, that would in general make me think that his quality was less than others, who had a much higher percentage of doing right coronary bypasses.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

Sometimes the answer is we can never do that, it's too small, we won't do it. In this case, which goes back to why he was calling me, he had said, oh, yeah, we can do that.

I told you my knowledge, memory of the -- memory of those experiences were less, but I think I can say with good confidence that I almost certainly did the heart catheterization for that patient.

Is that Dr. Felton was calling me about this case, because I, presumably, which I believe was the case, did the heart catheterization and referred him on to Dr. Holland.  He was a little bit dismayed by how the surgery was done and how the patient was recovering or not recovering.  That is all I know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Which went on to say that he was, thought that in his research of this procedure, it seemed archaic, and that he was, in general, fairly unhappy with the recovery phase of this patient.

774,2974,113,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

776,2978,113,25,"I would say at least a year, probably a couple of years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
777,2981,114,2,"And at some point, you determined or thought that he might need cardiothoracic surgery; is that right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
778,2984,114,5,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
779,2985,114,6,And how did that arise?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
780,2986,114,7,"So I -- I guess I'll just answer the question that you asked me.  When he came into the hospital, after passing out, and I saw him in the hospital, the first thing I said to him is, what the heck, why didn't you call me?  You know what is going to happen, right?  To which he said, yeah, I know.  I said, it's almost certain you're going to need surgery, so that was the first time I was pretty darn sure.  And then once we did the echocardiogram, and then the heart catheterization, that was for sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
781,2998,114,19,"All right.  So let's -- let's go back a second.  Why is it that you didn't notice this condition that he had, prior to him coming to the hospital and passing out?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
782,3002,114,23,"So I assume -- well, I'm not going to assume.  What condition are you referring to?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
783,3006,115,1,The one that appears that needed to be corrected by a surgery?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
784,3008,115,3,"So aortic stenosis.  So I absolutely knew the condition.  That is a condition that develops over 10, 20, 30 years sometimes.  And I remember very clearly having a discussion with him, roughly three to four months before this, in regard to his condition, the aortic stenosis, and the reality that at some point in the future, it was not about if, but just when he was going to need surgery.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
785,3018,115,13,"Okay.  So if you knew that, why didn't you schedule him for an elective surgery, as opposed to waiting until he passed out?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
786,3022,115,17,"So again, as I said, I told him he would need to at some point, but he had not met criteria to undergo surgery.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
787,3025,115,20,"So you believe the last time that you had seen him before he appeared at the hospital passed out, he did not meet criteria for surgery, but he might meet that criteria at some point in the future?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
788,3030,115,25,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
789,3032,116,1,So you were -- you were surprised by the level of deterioration in his stenosis over the three to four month period?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat
790,3035,116,4,Objection.,side_chat,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
791,3036,116,5,"So my estimation of his progression would be based on the symptoms he reported.  And to answer your question, based on my very poignant discussion with him, three to four months beforehand, that he could die, if he was hiding symptoms from me, and that if he develops shortness of breath, passing out, or chest pain, he needed to call me right away, because that means that he probably needs surgery, and it could be life threatening.  So when he swore up and down to me that I have none of those symptoms, I absolutely feel great, but I will call you when I have those problems, or if I have those problems, I scheduled an appointment for six months, to see him back in six months, but again, saw him back earlier than six months, because he came in the hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
792,3054,116,23,"So you had performed an echocardiogram on or -- in December of -- hang on one second.  I just want to make sure I get the year. You performed an echocardiogram in December of 2016 on this patient, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
793,3061,117,4,Do you have a document for me to view?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
794,3063,117,6,No.  I'm just asking if you remember.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
795,3065,117,8,"I probably did, but I honestly do not know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
796,3067,117,10,Was this a complicated or uncomplicated surgery that had to be performed?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
797,3070,117,13,"I would say anytime you're doing an aortic stenosis, with bypass surgery, I think that always makes it a little more complicated than a straightforward valve, or coronary disease, so I would say fairly complicated case, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
798,3076,117,19,Do you recall noting on an echocardiogram that he had critical aortic stenosis?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
799,3079,117,22,"No, I do not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
800,3080,117,23,Of 2016?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
801,3081,117,24,"Would you -- so you're using a -- I'm not trying to be difficult, but you used the word critical aortic stenosis, which has a very important definition.  What is the definition you're referring to?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
802,3087,118,4,The standard definition that doctors refer to when they talk about critical aortic stenosis.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
803,3090,118,7,"So no, I do not believe that to be true at all.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
804,3092,118,9,Was the -- do you recall the patient having symptoms of congestive heart failure when he presented to you in December of 2016?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
805,3096,118,13,"December of 2016, you said?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
806,3097,118,14,Yes.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
807,3098,118,15,"So he had, just like probably 70 percent of all the patients I see, some level of heart failure that was controlled. Certainly that would be true, I'm sure, in December of 2016.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
808,3103,118,20,And so you noted the potential that he would have to have a valve replacement; is that right?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
809,3106,118,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
810,3107,118,24,"And then instead of referring for surgery at that time, you prescribed him a diuretic; is that right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
811,3111,119,2,"So I'm sorry, the question is did I ever prescribe him a diuretic, is that your question?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
812,3114,119,5,"Yes, in or about December of 2016, do you recall --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
813,3116,119,7,I would believe that's probably true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
814,3118,119,9,-- (unintelligible.),q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
815,3119,119,10,Okay.  Go ahead.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
816,3120,119,11,Okay.  And do you know whether or not -- do you know whether or not the use of long-term diuretic increases the gradient across the valve?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
817,3124,119,15,"Certainly could increase the gradient across the valve, but is completely 100 percent appropriate for the treatment of heart failure, with or without aortic stenosis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
818,3129,119,20,"Now, when the patient first presented to the hospital, which was in or about -- give me one second -- in or about May 2017, did you see the patient upon his presentation?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
819,3134,119,25,"Yes, I believe so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
820,3136,120,1,So you drove up from Tiffin?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

835,3165,121,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

837,3169,121,8,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
838,3170,121,9,And just as -- the medical term syncopal.  I don't know how to pronounce it --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

842,3177,121,16,Okay.  That's what -- he had three of those in a week?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
843,3179,121,18,That is what he reported.  And I --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
844,3181,121,20,And so I --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
845,3182,121,21,"-- would slightly characterize that as syncope -- again, can I --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

847,3185,121,24,"Sorry.  I think I would say that he had syncope/near syncope.  In other words, he close to fell out, passed out three times. The last time, he did actually pass out.

848,3193,122,6,Okay.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

852,3203,122,16,"No.  Let's go back.  So basically, he comes in.  He's admitted to the hospital.  He's put under observation in Tiffin for a couple of days, and then transferred to St. Vincent; is that right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
853,3208,122,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

860,3222,123,9,"Now, when you transferred the patient to St. Vincent, what did you do in terms of indicating who would perform the surgery, if anybody?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
861,3226,123,13,"So I spoke with Dr. Hashmi directly on the phone, relayed the facts of the case, including the bypass and the -- the echocardiograph results and his presentation. I relayed the fact that the patient was somewhat resistant to coming to -- to St. Vincent's at all.  They were fairly adamant about going to Cleveland Clinic, but I had told him that, the patient and the family, that if my own father needed this surgery done, I would not go to Cleveland Clinic, I would go to Dr. Hashmi. And based on that, and that alone, is the only reason the patient and the family agreed to be transferred to St. Vincent's Hospital to be done by Dr. Hashmi on Monday. They were aware of that prior to the transfer and in agreement with it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
862,3245,124,6,Why did the family advise you that they were insistent upon using or talking about using Cleveland Clinic?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
863,3248,124,9,"This isn't too unusual, and of course, I don't know for sure their thinking, but in general, they were familiar with the name.  And I think the son lived in Cleveland, and so big name, I live near Cleveland, why don't we, you know, take our chance on -- on the big name and just closer to his son.  But I honestly don't really know anything.  That's just speculation to a certain degree.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
864,3257,124,18,"They didn't say, they didn't give you a reason, they just said, we would prefer Cleveland Clinic?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
865,3260,124,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
866,3261,124,22,"And then you said, your recommendation was, no, transfer to Mercy-St. Vincent because Dr. Hashmi could do it?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
867,3266,125,1,"So what I said, and I have this conversation frequently with patients, I say, okay, who do you know at Cleveland Clinic?  To which most of them say, I don't know.  To which I say, I also don't know anybody at Cleveland Clinic, including the surgeon.  So absolutely, if you prefer, I can transfer the patient to Cleveland Clinic.  They will take you, I'm pretty darn sure, and you will get whoever is in line.  Whoever the next doc is that's on the docket, it might be the best doc in the country, or the world.  It may be the guy that just graduated, and is not good at all, or maybe the guy who should have retired a year ago.  We don't know.  You're absolutely, if you want, you can take your chances on that.  But I will tell you that if my own father needed surgery today, and your dad was my father, I would trust somebody I know, who does a great job, and that would be Dr. Hashmi in this case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
868,3287,125,22,"And you agree that Dr. Hashmi, when you spoke to him, was on vacation?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

871,3295,126,4,"So the best of my recollection is that he said, no problem, I'll call the hospital, we'll get him set up with the group, or the hospital room.  We'll get him admitted to the hospital.  He didn't say whose name would be on it, but we would get him admitted to the hospital at St. Vincent's.  We'll watch him over the weekend, and we'll do the surgery on Monday, assuming there is no problems over the weekend.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
872,3305,126,14,"Well, who was there to watch him, if he was going to be away all weekend, do you know?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

874,3309,126,18,And who was that?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
875,3310,126,19,"Dr. Holland and Dr. Phillips, I believe.  And the -- and --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
876,3312,126,21,"So it was anticipated that they would be involved in watching this patient while Dr. Hashmi was away on vacation, just in case, you know, he needed to be treated before he returned?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat

That way, if anything occurred, and needed immediate treatment, there would be someone there, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
880,3329,127,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
881,3330,127,13,"Because if something happened with his condition prior to Monday that made it emergent, then someone else might need to do the procedure, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
882,3334,127,17,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
883,3335,127,18,"And but at least it was your judgment, at least when you sent the patient to Mercy-St. Vincent, that although he did need surgery, it could wait until Monday?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
884,3339,127,22,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
885,3340,127,23,"And that was on what day, Saturday?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

890,3351,128,8,I believe it was Friday afternoon.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
891,3353,128,10,And do you know how it was that either Dr. Phillips or Dr. Holland learned about the patient being transferred?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

ARCHINACO,start_answer
894,3364,128,21,"So again, in attempts to best answer that question, I will tell you that every hospital I know of, including our hospital, you can admit a patient under your name, even if you're on vacation, as long as there's been a pre-setup arrangement with your partners to cover those patients. How St. Vincent's Hospital, or their CT surgery department is set up, I can't speculate, but I would absolutely not be surprised, or in fact I'd probably be -- I would be surprised if -- if that wasn't the case, that you could admit a patient where you're on vacation and your partners would -- would cover.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
895,3380,129,11,"Well, just to be clear on this, you know of the procedure where if a person is unavailable, they can have their partners admit the patient, if they're not present, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
896,3385,129,16,"So again, if I understand your question, if there is a group of partners, and somebody is on vacation, but yet their patient needs to be admitted, the partners can admit them, yes.  I -- I think that is true.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

If they think the patient can be done outpatient, we make the arrangement outpatient, not me, other people.  If they feel the case is urgent, or emergent, we make, the staff make arrangements to have the patients transferred to the -- the hospital, the receiving hospital.  That is all done by other staff than me. The only single thing I need to know is, number one, a receiving doctor, have you spoke to a doctor who has accepted this patient to take care of them.  If that has been done, and the patient agrees they want to go there, everything is done by other people than myself.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

And then who calls who, and what -- who is contacted is -- is all beyond me.  But it happens every day, really, when we do a transfer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1001,3739,143,6,"I'm not aware of that.  As I said, I only had that one interaction with Dr. Phillips.  He didn't say anything about the case, and Dr. Holland wouldn't take my phone call.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1004,3749,143,16,"All right.  Next is, I repeatedly tried to contact Dr. Holland.  This is the next in your affidavit.  I repeatedly tried to contact Dr. Holland to stop him from the surgery.  He admit -- admittedly intentionally evaded my phone call, until after he performed the surgery. There is a couple of points here. Did I read that general correctly?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1005,3758,143,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1006,3760,144,1,"Now, the first part is you said you were repeatedly tried to contact Dr. Holland to stop him from the surgery. Correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1007,3764,144,5,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1008,3765,144,6,And you admit doing that?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1009,3766,144,7,Yes.  Well --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1014,3774,144,15,Okay.  And you -- did you personally read those?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1015,3776,144,17,"Certainly the heart cath, I definitely did.  I cannot say for sure, on the echo.  My partner may or may not have read that one.  I don't know.  But it could have been me or my partner.  Those are probably the only two people that would have read the echo, though.  But I certainly reviewed the echo, even if I was not the signing doctor, doctor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1016,3784,144,25,Why was it you state here that you were repeatedly attempting to contact Dr. Holland to stop him from doing the surgery?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1017,3789,145,4,"Well, because the family contacted me to try and stop the procedure. When I called the nursing staff to say what is going on, and they said, he's fine, there is nothing going on.  Well, tell me the vitals, and is he passed out, is he having rhythm problems?  No, he's fine.  It seemed clear to me, without further information from Dr. Holland, that we should stop this surgery, which again, had no indication that it needed to be done emergently. Now, if Dr. Holland would have taken my phone call, perhaps he would have explained something different to me, but he would not take my phone call.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1022,3817,146,6,So you reviewed the history and things of that nature that Dr. Holland and others had written down in the records?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

1028,3834,146,23,Do you know whether or not placing a patient supine in bed is an ominous sign?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1029,3838,147,1,"Well, it certainly can be ominous, but it's certainly not always ominous.  By -- by the way, doing it doesn't make it ominous.  If it needed to be done, and patient was deteriorating, then yes, that -- I would argue that could be an -- an ominous sign.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1030,3845,147,8,"Normally, you would defer to the surgeons that are in the hospital to review the condition of the patient, as opposed to you yourself inter -- intervening, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1031,3849,147,12,"If they called me and told me that what I believed, and what was agreed upon was no longer true, and were persuasive in their assessment of why it needed to be done differently, I would absolutely defer to the person there.  Without any knowledge, no, I can only go on the knowledge I have of the patient's care.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1032,3857,147,20,"Do you recall ever Dr. Phillips not repeatedly returning your calls, or you just didn't call him, after that one call?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

1038,3871,148,8,Did you call Doctor -- did you call Dr. Kabour with regard to this patient?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1039,3873,148,10,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1040,3874,148,11,Did you call him before or after you called Dr. Phillips?  To the best of your recollection.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1041,3877,148,14,"I honestly do not know the answer to that.  They were all rapid succession. Three, four, maybe five calls.  I don't remember which order it was in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1042,3881,148,18,"But according to what you're saying then, whether it was Phillips or Holland, or anyone else, no one gave you any indication whatsoever that this -- that this gentleman needed emergent heart surgery?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1043,3886,148,23,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1044,3887,148,24,You were surprised to learn that he had had one?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1045,3890,149,1,Surprised would be an understatement.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1046,3892,149,3,"Well, you called Dr. Kabour, and you requested that Dr. Kabour assist you in preventing Dr. Holland to perform the procedure, right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1047,3896,149,7,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1048,3897,149,8,"And you told him that if the gentleman did need a procedure, even then, that the patient should be transferred to the Cleveland Clinic?  You told Dr. Kabour that, didn't you?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1049,3902,149,13,I don't remember that at all.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1050,3903,149,14,"You don't recall telling Dr. Kabour you wanted to transfer the patient to the Cleveland Clinic, instead of having Holland do a procedure?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1051,3907,149,18,"I'll do the best I can with what I remember saying.  The primary reason of him calling was saying, hey, Dr. Kabour, I know you're very busy, but I am very concerned about this patient who has been transferred up there.  The patient was very adamant that only Dr. Hashmi do the surgery, otherwise, they want to go to Cleveland Clinic.  Will you please help me in intervening?  I said, I've already called the, or I don't think I already did, but, again, I was trying to pursue other means to stop this surgery.  But if he could do anything to help prevent this from going forward, I'd really appreciate it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1065,3942,151,1,"He was either interim CEO or CEO, I believe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1066,3944,151,3,So you called the CEO of the hospital about this case as well?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1067,3946,151,5,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1068,3947,151,6,Why did you call him?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

1071,3955,151,14,With what I felt was a far inferior surgeon.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1072,3957,151,16,And that was based upon the cases you referenced previously?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1073,3959,151,18,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1074,3960,151,19,And you had hadn't actually looked at any of Dr. Holland's statistics?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1075,3962,151,21,"I think what I said was I had gotten all kinds of data from Dr. Phillips over the years, based on discussions with him, and cases, and patients coming back, so yes, that is all data that I have had on Dr. Holland prior to this time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1076,3969,152,2,"And that's not -- that's not data, that's anecdotal evidence, sir.",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

1078,3972,152,5,Data is when you --,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1079,3973,152,6,"-- outcomes are data, whether the patient died or not, whether they got a right coronary artery or not, whether they had the surgery done, or even turned down the patient, all of it is absolutely data.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1080,3978,152,11,"Yeah, sure.  Sir, this data that you claim to have reviewed, it was not accumulated in any statistical format, it was just -- right?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1081,3982,152,15,"I did not do any statistics, that is correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1082,3984,152,17,And your conclusion was -- what type of procedure did this gentleman need?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1083,3986,152,19,"He needed a multivessel bypass and an aortic valve surgery, replacement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1084,3988,152,21,"So he needed nonemergent, according to what you knew on Friday, a nonemergent multivessel bypass with aortic valve replacement?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1085,3992,152,25,"I'm 90 percent sure, but say that again, especially that last part, and I will confirm that, I believe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1086,3996,153,3,A multivessel bypass with aortic valve replacement?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1087,3998,153,5,Yes.  That is my understanding.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1088,3999,153,6,"And it was nonemergent, meaning it could wait until Monday, as opposed to being done Friday or Saturday?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1089,4002,153,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1090,4003,153,10,"And what part of this procedure, based upon your, what you stated is your knowledge of Dr. Holland's skills, what part of this procedure did you believe Dr. Holland was unable to perform correctly?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1091,4008,153,15,"So again, based on that very similar case, in a 50-year-old, in which he said, gosh, this guy is too sick, and I don't think I can do it safely, was probably one of the first things that came to my mind.  If in a much sicker patient, arguably based on his age, and the fact that he was, I think more symptomatic, certainly with the passing out recently episodes, I felt very justified that this was not a case Dr. Holland I thought was -- I would have sent my own father to.  And furthermore, certainly not what I promised the patient or the family, when they agreed to be transferred to St. Vincent's in the first place.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1092,4024,154,5,"Did you advise this family that Dr. Hashmi, prior to transferring them to the hospital, was the only surgeon you knew of that could perform this procedure --",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

1097,4035,154,16,"They asked me who they think should do the surgery.  I told them I thought Dr. Holland should do the surgery.  Sorry, I told them Dr. Hashmi should do the surgery. They did not ask for any other names.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1098,4040,154,21,"Okay.  The procedure that was ultimately performed here on RR was more complicated, was it not, than the one that was performed on the patient you referred to earlier from 2013, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1099,4046,155,1,"I think that could be questionable.  I think they were of similar complexity, I suppose.  There was a valve, and a -- and a multivessel bypass, so similar complexity.  Again, I don't know if you care about this, but I do believe the EF, the heart strength, on the first case was a little bit less.  In this case, his heart strength was normal.  But the fact that he was older, and you know, might -- so had similar complexity.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1100,4056,155,11,"Now, did Dr. Holland ever tell you, or Dr. Phillips, either of them ever tell you that they refused to do this procedure, or didn't think that this one should go forward?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

1105,4067,155,22,So after --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1106,4068,155,23,That's what you wrote.,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1107,4069,155,24,"I know.  That was after he called me after the surgery, I'm telling you what he said.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1170,4250,162,23,"Well, when the patient came back to me, probably a good, at least six to eight weeks after the surgery, which is quite unusual, they -- I said what is going on.  And they said, told me how awful the last six to eight weeks were, and how he was still very short of breath, and he kept continuing to gain weight, and Dr. Holland had done multiple procedures to try and draw fluid off.  They said, this is not what we expected at all, and he's not getting any better.  That was my first indication that they were unhappy with how things went.

If they would have said, I'm going to sue, you know, Dr. Holland, and -- I may have put something like that into it, but just to ask me whether they should sue Dr. Holland, I thought would be needlessly, potentially damaging to Dr. Holland, if any other person would read that chart.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1242,4490,172,3,"So the only one that we talked about today that I think would easily be considered rude was the patient, the first patient, that I remember referring to him, where he called him on the morning of the surgery to tell him he was cancelling it. When the patient called, and they were very upset, they felt it was rude that he would cancel the patient, have his office staff cancel the patient the morning of the surgery. And so that would be an example of certainly a rude way a patient was treated.

1267,4577,175,12,"So then after three months, even though Dr. Holland did not bypass the right coronary artery, the patient wound up doing pretty well, is your recollection, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer

1269,4582,175,17,It's not?  I thought you said the patient RR did well?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1270,4584,175,19,"Was doing better.  I never did answer that question, but I think I'll tiptoe into that, and again, without -- I prefer to have seen the text, but in referring to that one context text, which I don't think for a second is the first text that I gave back to him before that.  But nonetheless, if about a month afterwards, he was doing better, it was only because I had already seen the patient, rearranged his care completely, and -- and although, I want to be as respectful of Dr. Holland as possible.  He's not a cardiologist, and he was trying to get this patient through the surgery, after the surgery, I'm sorry, and he had no idea what he was doing.  Again, I actually -- I feel bad about saying that, but I'll just say that when people after surgery do well, they do well with the cooperation of the cardiothoracic surgeon and the cardiologist. When he purposely, according to the patient, told them not to come to me, and that he could take care of it, it continued to deteriorate his condition, to as bad as it was, until I finally saw him.  After just a week of me getting involved, he absolutely was doing better.  That ultimately took at least another month and a half to two months, before he was recovered from the heart failure.  And to be honest, he ended up getting an infection of that valve, and I believe is probably dead to this day. So no, I don't think I would characterize it as he did great, but he did do better, after I was brought back into the case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1271,4622,177,5,So you believe that he got an infection in that valve at a subsequent point in time?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1272,4625,177,8,"Well, the Cleveland Clinic thinks that he got an infection in that valve shortly afterwards.  Because when he came back to the hospital with an infection, there was no talking at this time.  He wanted to go to Cleveland Clinic.  I said, I -- I failed you to a certain degree in following through on my commitment to you, so I understand your concern.  Family was right there.  There was nothing I was going to do anyway.  They were 100 percent adamant, so the patient was transferred to Cleveland Clinic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1274,4642,177,25,No.  They certainly never mentioned that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1292,4704,180,9,"So again, I'll do the best I can. Probably four or five months, roughly, three to six months certainly, I believe anyway, when he came back to the hospital, clearly infected, or septic, is the medical term, with positive blood cultures.  There was little to no doubt that that valve was the source of the infection.  He was sent to Cleveland Clinic, where they discussed replacing the valve, but he had deteriorated so much, that they really felt that that would be more dangerous than good. So the last I heard, he was getting -- actually, a little bit more I know.  He came back to Mercy-Tiffin Hospital, like, I don't know, three, four weeks after that, on IV antibiotics.  He had already been on IV antibiotics for two or three weeks, and then we again transferred him back to Cleveland Clinic, because he was failing the more conservative IV antibiotic route in response to the infected valve.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1293,4727,181,6,And is that the last recollection you have of the patient?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1294,4729,181,8,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1295,4730,181,9,And it -- antibiotics typically clear an infected valve; is that right?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1296,4732,181,11,"Typically, would be -- definitely would not use that word.  It sometimes can.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1297,4734,181,13,"That's usually what's used first, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1298,4736,181,15,"It depends how infected it is, how good a surgical candidate the person is. Certainly, if they're infected, and they're a good surgical candidate, in good shape, then sometimes they would do it right away.  When the patients are more in rough shape, sometimes they know that the risk of death will be too high, and so they'll do antibiotics instead.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1299,4745,181,24,And that is -- that was diagnosed by the Cleveland Clinic and not you?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1300,4748,182,1,"It was diagnosed by me in the emergency room, and then confirmed by the Cleveland Clinic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1301,4751,182,4,How many months was that after the procedure?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1302,4753,182,6,"Like I said, I do the best I can, but I would say certainly between two and six months, I believe, but probably more like three or four months.  I apologize I don't have a more solid answer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1303,4758,182,11,Okay.  That's all I have.  Thank you. EXAMINATION,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_question
1304,4762,182,15,"I'll follow up with one question on the affidavit.  It's Plaintiff's Exhibit 122.  In paragraph A, in the middle of the paragraph A, it says, I repeatedly tried to contact Dr. Holland to stop him from the surgery, and he admittedly, intentionally evaded my phone call until after he had performed the surgery. Did I read that correctly?",q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1305,4771,182,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1306,4772,182,25,Did he actually admit to you that he was avoiding your phone calls?,q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1307,4775,183,2,"When he finally called me, probably between 11 or 11:15 that night, and said that he did the surgery, I let him speak about what happened and how it went, and then I said, I'm -- I'll be honest, I'm quite upset that you wouldn't take my phone call.  This guy, in my opinion, did not need to have urgent or emergent surgery, or emergent surgery.  To which he kind of cut me off and said, see, this is exactly why I didn't take your phone call, because I knew you would argue with me and tell me why you didn't think it needed to be done, and -- and that was the end of the productive conversation.  There was a little bit of arguing back and forth, but that was mostly the rest of the conversation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1308,4791,183,18,"Now, do you -- did you have every opportunity to edit and update this affidavit that is in Plaintiff's Exhibit 122?",q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1309,4794,183,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1310,4795,183,22,Is there anything in this affidavit that you believe is incorrect?,q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1311,4797,183,24,Absolutely not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1312,4798,183,25,Is there anything in the affidavit that you object to?,q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1313,4801,184,2,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1314,4802,184,3,Did anyone direct you as to what to put into this affidavit?,q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1315,4804,184,5,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1316,4805,184,6,"And now that you been examined about your affidavit, is there anything you would recant from this affidavit?",q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1317,4808,184,9,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1318,4809,184,10,"Now, during your experiences referring patients to Mercy-St. Vincent, did you ever see or hear of anything that would lead you to believe that patient referrals for surgery at Mercy-St. Vincent, or even Mercy-St. Anne, were done based on a surgeon's race or national origin?",q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1319,4816,184,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1320,4817,184,18,"When you were using the surgical office to direct patient referrals, did you hear or see anything that would lead you to believe that any person was directing, or redirecting, patient referrals based on the surgeon's race or national origin?",q,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1321,4823,184,24,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1322,4824,184,25,I have no further questions. REEXAMINATION,q,MR. WIENCEK,start_question
1323,4828,185,3,"Doctor, a couple -- and I'll let you get out of here soon, I promise you, so you can see your patients. You were just asked some questions about race and national origin, so I have some follow-up questions for you on that. First, what is your understanding as to what race is?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1324,4836,185,11,"That's a good question.  My understanding would be basically, I guess, country of origin, I think.  There is Caucasian and I guess a rough -- I can name races, but basically it's a characterization of people, mostly based on their -- their color or region of -- of being from.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1325,4843,185,18,"Okay.  So you don't, to your knowledge, again, you're a physician, but you're not trying -- you're not a lawyer.  To you, there is not really a distinction between race and national origin?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_chat
1326,4848,185,23,"Objection, mischaracterization.",side_chat,MR. WIENCEK,start_answer
1327,4850,185,25,"I'm sure there is a difference. If you'd like to ask me a question about the difference, I would be happy to try and answer the best I can.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1328,4855,186,4,"Well, do you know if there is a difference or not?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1329,4857,186,6,"Between race and national origin? So I guess what I would say, the best I can do, is say that probably Asian people is a race from China, and you know, Japan, but national origin is Japan or China, so I suppose that would be my best deciphering of the difference.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1330,4864,186,13,"Okay.  And just to be clear, nobody from Mercy-St. Vincent or Mercy-St. Anne, any physicians, or anything, ever talked to you about race or national origin issues, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1331,4869,186,18,Never that I can ever recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1332,4870,186,19,"And you don't recall anyone talking to you in particular, or saying to you in particular, anything along the lines, that there is a pattern that has developed in St. Vincent or St. Anne's with regard to referrals, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1333,4876,186,25,I'm not aware of any pattern discussions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1334,4879,187,2,"Right.  And you don't -- and you were not personal friends with Dr. Holland, correct?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1335,4882,187,5,"I would not consider him a friend, I don't think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1336,4884,187,7,"Couple last questions.  In terms of Dr. Hashmi, what type of relationship, if any, did you have with him outside of just referral, professional?",q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1337,4888,187,11,"Only relationship really professional, but it was a very good, cordial relationship.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1338,4891,187,14,Did he ever invite you to any private events or parties?,q,MR. ARCHINACO,start_answer
1339,4893,187,16,Not that I remember at all.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

73,273,11,13,And did you perform a physical exam when you first encountered him?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
74,275,11,15,"Yes.  When I saw him on that day he was, I believe, 42 years old.  Reported a motor vehicle accident of January 23, 2017.  He had told me he had been through some other nonoperative treatments.  And so when I saw him we -- on physical exam that day, basically what he had was a pretty classic L5-S1 problem towards the left side.  He had weakness in his plantar flexion, in other words couldn't stand on his toes (indicating) on that left side. He had no ankle jerk reflex on the left side compared to the right.  Once again, consistent with a S1 nerve problem.  Positive straight leg raise test.  Just a basic test we do to investigate these types of problems.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,291,12,5,And how is the straight leg test performed?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
76,293,12,7,He had a positive straight leg raise test.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,295,12,9,How do you perform that test?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
78,296,12,10,"Should have him lying down, then you raise the leg up, you get to a certain level and they start recomplaining of pain which goes down their leg.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,300,12,14,"And when he presented to your office, did you have the benefit of an MRI at that time?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
80,302,12,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,303,12,17,Can you tell the jury what an MRI is.,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
82,304,12,18,"MRI is magnetic resonance imaging. It's a wonderful type of image we have that shows us great anatomical pictures of the spine.  And in this case, the ones I look at the most are lumbar and cervical MRIs which show the discs, the nerves, the bones and potential pinching of nerves.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,311,12,25,Let's start with the conclusion in this case.  Was he injured in this accident?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
84,314,13,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,315,13,3,How?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
86,316,13,4,I believe he had a herniated disc at L5-S1 towards the left side.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,318,13,6,And is this a surgical case?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
88,319,13,7,"Well, at first we try to treat most people nonoperatively, as he went through several months of trying to treat this nonoperatively, but if the pain persists and weakness, even some numbness, loss of reflex, those are all good surgical indications.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,325,13,13,Did you perform surgery on Carlos?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
90,326,13,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,327,13,15,What kind of procedure?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
92,328,13,16,L5-S1 microdiscectomy.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,329,13,17,And can you tell the jury what that is.,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
94,330,13,18,"Sure.  So, I'll just go to the model here.  I will show you the model.  This is a model of the spine.  What you have here are bones and in between are discs.  You can see the yellow nerves coming out the side and -- a disc is like a jelly doughnut, if you squeeze it hard enough a piece of jelly can come out through the back and hit on one of these nerves. In his case, his disc comes outs of the left side in the back, hits on the S1 nerve like this and sends the pain down the back of his left leg down to his foot.  When that piece of jelly comes out it impinges upon the nerve.  And when you do a surgery for this, what we basically do is the patient is asleep, we flip the patient over, we make a small incision in the back and then we'll drill a hole in the bone on this side; that's called a laminotomy.  Underneath that is going to be some ligament.  You slowly remove away the ligament until you see the nerve.  Take the nerve and pull it to the side and, underneath that, you should see the piece of herniated disc sitting there (indicating throughout).",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,354,14,16,"In this case, did you see pieces of herniated disc sitting there?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
96,356,14,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,357,14,19,And do you remove that disc?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
98,358,14,20,"Sure.  You basically -- what happens is the piece of jelly that comes out basically forms a little capsule around it and you just pop it (indicating) and out -- comes out a couple fragments, maybe one nice big fragment if you're really lucky, but usually it comes out in two or three fragments of disc.  And you remove that and the nerve is able to fall back down to where it's supposed to be, it gives it more room and people wake up and feel better.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,369,15,5,"What is the interplay between Mr. Hawthorne's symptoms of having difficulty walking, difficulty sitting and the lack of a reflex correlated with that lumbar herniation?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
100,373,15,9,"So an L5-S1 herniation usually, as I said, describes pain in the back, pain in the buttock area, pain down the leg; it can be numbness and tingling; it can be a loss of reflex like he has.  In other words, the nerve is pinched and you do not get your normal reflexes like you're supposed to have.  People with herniated discs often will have the leg symptoms, they can often have back pain.  A lot of these people have trouble sitting.  The way I describe them as, they're very fidgety people, in other words they can't sit very long, can't stand very long, really can't walk very long either.  They're kind of always of moving around because nothing is very comfortable for them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,388,15,24,I would like to look the at actual MRI in this case.  Did you use the films yourself?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
102,391,16,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,392,16,2,Okay.,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_chat

106,400,16,10,"Doctor, what are we looking at here?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
107,401,16,11,"This is called -- this is a cross-section of the lumbar spine at L5-S1.  In other words, cross-section means if we cut you off and look down at you or really look up at you, but -- and what you see here is, there's our disc, kind of like a jelly doughnut, dark on the outside, kind of jelly in the middle. These are your nerves back here, the little black things bathing in white spinal fluid. This is the left side.  That's the right.  And if we come down one frame you can see a piece of disc that's come out this side over here impinging upon the nerves on this side, versus the nerve on the right side has plenty of room.  So that's a pretty classic herniated disc towards the left side (indicating throughout).",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,418,17,2,And are those nerves the nerves you showed us on the model that go down the legs?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
109,420,17,4,Correct.  The S1 nerve begins right about there (indicating).,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,422,17,6,"And with that nerve, where should -- where would a classic presentation of pathology present?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
111,425,17,9,"Pretty much how I described it, back pain, buttock pain, back of the leg pain, kind of your hamstring area down to your calf.  And if it gets really specific, as I said, you can start losing some strength or even a reflex on that side.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,431,17,15,Thank you.,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_chat

115,439,17,23,"Doctor, you mentioned when he first presented to you in September he had already gone through some nonoperative care.  Could you tell the jury what kind of treatment he had?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
116,444,18,2,"He had told me he had been through some chiropractic treatments for several months.  Had had at least one, I think, maybe two epidural injections or steroid injections in the back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,448,18,6,What are the goal of those treatments?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
118,449,18,7,"Well, about 60 percent of herniated discs will just get better if you treat them nonoperatively.  That still leaves about 30 or 40 percent that don't get better.  Chiropractic treatments, epidural injections are all there to try to help with the pain and the symptoms in hopes that the body will just continue to get better over time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,457,18,15,And is that -- is the standard of care prior to these operations to try some nonoperative --,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer

121,461,18,19,-- interventions?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
122,462,18,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,463,18,21,Okay.  What -- what's significant about the loss of reflex in the leg?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
124,465,18,23,"It's just a sign that you see on physical exam that the nerve is pinched.  If it's pinched for a while, it doesn't even have to be that long, but people can lose the reflex, it's just something we look for on physical exam.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,471,19,3,Okay.  And when you first saw him did you schedule the surgery right after that initial operation -- or after the initial visit?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer

127,475,19,7,Okay.,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
128,476,19,8,Because his surgery was then done on November 6th.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,478,19,10,And where is -- where do you perform these surgeries?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
130,480,19,12,"This surgery was done, I believe, at St. Clair Hospital.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

135,487,19,19,"Okay.  So this isn't a laser procedure or anything like this, you physically open them up?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
136,490,19,22,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,491,19,23,Are there stitches involved?  Is there a scar involved?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
138,493,19,25,"Yeah, a scar for a guy like him is probably about an inch, maybe an inch and a quarter.  The stitches are all put under the skin.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,497,20,3,And immediately postoperatively what does this mean for Mr. Hawthorne's life?  What's his recovery like?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
140,500,20,6,"Most people that you do the surgery on, if you've chosen the patient well and they have an MRI like that, they should feel an instant change. They should know it from the moment they wake up, they should feel some difference, at least a decrease in their leg pain.  The back usually is pretty sore just from where we cut them for at least, you know, two, three weeks. As far as recovery, most people who have a labor job we likely will not let them to get back to heavy labor for about eight weeks, two months, somewhere in there.  If they have some sort of desk job or light-duty job they can probably get back sooner than that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

171,586,23,14,"But do you have a recollection of asking him if he did anything to his back after January 23, 2017, until you first saw him on September 22?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
172,590,23,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,591,23,19,"Okay. So then Mr. Hawthorne comes to you after receiving some therapy, and you've described that in general today.  Just so I understand, Mr. Hawthorne was working when he came to see you on September 22, 2017, was he not?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
174,597,23,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

179,606,24,8,"No, I understand.  But what I was asking -- and maybe you don't have that in your notes there and I understand that. But were you aware then that Mr. Hawthorne was released to do his time-of-injury job -- I think there was some accommodations made -- but he was released to his time-of-injury job as of March 2017.",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
180,614,24,16,"I know that he was working when I did see him, so that makes sense, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
181,616,24,18,"Okay.  All right. And I suppose that someone with the condition that you've described, the herniation, they can work; is that right?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
182,620,24,22,"A lot of times, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
183,621,24,23,"And I think that you've told us in a lot of cases, 60 percent, I think was your number, those people with herniations do not require surgery, they can recover without the need for surgery?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
184,627,25,3,"Yes, definitely.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
185,628,25,4,"And was Mr. Hawthorne's problem, the area that you've shown us on the video screen, was that a problem that could resolve without surgery?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
186,631,25,7,"Some do, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,632,25,8,In this case you thought surgery was the appropriate way to go?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
188,634,25,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
189,635,25,11,"And you performed the surgery as you've done on many, many other patients, I understand?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer

191,638,25,14,"Do you do the surgery that you performed on Mr. Hawthorne on a monthly, weekly basis?  I mean, how often do you do that type of surgery?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer

193,643,25,19,"I know no surgeries are routine, but is it a surgery that you're very familiar with?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
194,645,25,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
195,646,25,22,"When you were doing the surgery, when you were performing the operation as you've described for us today, did you see anything else in there that would have caused you to be concerned about Mr. Hawthorne's ability to recover, I won't say fully, but to a large degree from the procedure?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
196,654,26,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
197,655,26,5,"And I think that you've told us today and you've written it in some documentation, that Mr. Hawthorne did make a very good recovery from the surgery?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
198,659,26,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
199,660,26,10,"So when you last saw him in November of 2017, you released him to return to his time-of-injury job?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
200,663,26,13,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

204,670,26,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,671,26,21,"And why did you see him back the following year?  Did you think there would be a problem or was this just a follow-up, your routine, why did you see him again?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
206,675,26,25,He came back to see us.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
207,677,27,1,"Okay.  And when you saw Mr. Hawthorne on July 10, 2018, was he, again, in good shape and there were no problems noted?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
208,680,27,4,"That's what he reported, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,681,27,5,"As of July 10, 2018, did you see anything in Mr. Hawthorne's exam or any descriptions that he provided you which would indicate that he could not continue working in his time-of-injury capacity?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
210,686,27,10,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,687,27,11,Did you make any follow-up or schedule any follow-up appointments for Mr. Hawthorne after July 10?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
212,690,27,14,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
213,691,27,15,Was he only to come back to you if he had a problem?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer

221,706,28,4,Okay.  Is this the result that you like to see in a lot of your patients?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
222,708,28,6,"Yeah, I would love to.  Yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,709,28,7,Okay.  So this was a very positive result --,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
224,711,28,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,712,28,10,-- that Mr. Hawthorne received --,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
226,713,28,11,"Yeah, surgery was simple, recovery was easy.  Pain went away quickly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
227,715,28,13,Does it help in Mr. Hawthorne's case that he's a fairly young man --,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
228,717,28,15,Well --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,718,28,16,-- 42 years old.  Does that impact in the positive?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
230,720,28,18,No.  No.  I think the younger people do worse.  The older the patient the better.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,722,28,20,"Oh, okay.  But whatever the case, in Mr. Hawthorne's situation, the result was great, he's back to work and you're not seeing him any further; is that correct?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
232,726,28,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,727,28,25,"Doctor, if Mr. Hawthorne had complaints about, you know, ongoing problems, in your mind that would not be related to your surgery would it?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
234,732,29,4,"No, I wouldn't think so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,733,29,5,"And did you put any limitations, Doctor, on Mr. Hawthorne's ability to drive or walk?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
236,736,29,8,"For the first couple weeks we ask that they not drive.  We encourage them to walk every day.  But after we put them back to work, no, no restrictions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,740,29,12,"And would that be the same for -- I know he's got a very large dog, 130 pounds or something -- any restrictions on ability to take care of his dog?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
238,744,29,16,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
239,745,29,17,And obviously no restrictions on his ability to work?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
240,747,29,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
241,748,29,20,"Doctor, would you have released Mr. Hawthorne to work and the activities that you mentioned if you were uncomfortable with his recovery in any way?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
242,752,29,24,"I may have held him a little bit longer, sure.  I mean, I'm very happy when patients comes in after two weeks and say they want to go back to work; that's great.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
243,757,30,3,Right.,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
244,758,30,4,"I have a lot of people, even with desk jobs who still even take three, four, five, six weeks; just depends on what their desk job is. You know, some people are really stuck in a desk and that probably doesn't feel too great for eight or ten hours a day but...  No, but if they come in and, at two weeks, if this -- a gentleman like this says they can go back, sure, that's great.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
245,766,30,12,You were happy with that result?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
246,767,30,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
247,768,30,14,And you're happy to accommodate him?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
248,769,30,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,770,30,16,"Doctor, you mentioned that you thought -- last, last topic area -- you thought that all of the care that Mr. Hawthorne had received up to the point when you saw him in September was reasonable and necessary, I think you said something to that effect?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
250,776,30,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,777,30,23,How close did you look at that procedure to come up with that opinion?  Did you have all the records in front of you?  Did you scour that to determine what was necessary and not necessary?,q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
252,783,31,3,"The general progression of things after a herniated disc, most patients you will see usually go through some form of physical therapy, some form of -- and/or chiropractic treatment.  A lot will have at least one, if not two injections. So that's pretty standard. So when I did review the records that were given to me to look at these things, I mean, it all seemed pretty reasonable as far as how you would treat people nonoperatively who just come into the office.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,794,31,14,"And Doctor, was there any chance in this case that Mr. Hawthorne could have gotten to the point where he is now without the surgery that you performed?",q,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_answer
254,798,31,18,"I think it's probably unlikely.  You know, he's a classic example of someone who has, you know, quote/unquote failed nonoperative treatment.  You know, they come to see you three, four, five, six months after the pain begins. They've been through nonoperative things.  They start progressing -- unfortunately he was starting to get some weakness in his leg and those are the good people to operate on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
255,808,32,2,"Okay.  I think those are all of my questions, Doctor.  Thank you very much for your time today.",side_chat,MR. OLSZEWSKI,start_chat

258,815,32,9,Why do you ask them not to drive after the surgery?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
259,817,32,11,For the first two weeks we ask people not to drive usually because we write them for some narcotic medication afterwards and it's just easier to tell people no driving for two weeks.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
260,821,32,15,Fair enough.  That's all I have.,side_chat,MR. FLAHERTY,start_chat

So if it's a ""yes,"" I would ask for a ""yes.""  If it's a ""no,"" a ""no."" And as your attorney probably already told you, we don't want you to guess on the record, so ""I don't know"" is a perfectly acceptable answer if you do not know the answer, okay?",q,MS.

So you don't have the repeat the work life stuff -- I've already got that down -- unless there's something that you didn't tell me that you would like me to know. But my first set of question is: Activities, interests, hobbies, things in your life that you were completely unable to do for any time period after the accident.  The next set of questions I'll ask is: Activities, interests, hobbies, just regular living, daily things in your life that maybe you could still do but you might have had pain or discomfort or some issues when you were doing it as a result of the accident.

It's hard to remember right after the accident, 'cause I didn't do much of anything for quite a while. But intermittently, there are days when I don't attempt certain things, because I can't focus enough.  Like I said, there are days when I don't cook, because I end up putting something in the refrigerator that belongs on the stove, or I leave the stove on, or I put the wrong ingredient in.  I'm spaced out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

899,2123,82,8,"Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  My husband would help me with -- with all of that housework and such.  But me being the tenacious person I am and determined to try, after a couple months, I would try and sometimes fail.  And he would tell me to go sit down. But as I said, it -- it became intermittent.  It's not something I have consistently, except that the focus and the -- the -- the ability to think of words, that's really affected me, I think, more than anything.  Because I was a very -- I was known as very glib, very capable of editing and doing.  And I was very organized, and I did all kinds of wonderful things. And I cannot do most of that anymore.  And I have -- I have a hard time dealing with that, I'll be honest.  It's tough.  I've been having depression.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

It all crashed down. And they put me on -- Dr. Glessner had put me on antidepressants, and it wasn't working, this -- this year.  And so when I started to see the psychologist, they had me see a psychiatrist to monitor other, you know, medications that would work.

919,2183,84,16,"I started seeing him a couple months ago and the psychiatrist, a month and a half ago, I believe, estimate. That's another thing that my brain doesn't do well.  I -- I'm bad with dates.  My husband has to help me with these now.  Very bad with memory.  My memory is zilch. Sometimes he'll ask me -- he'll say, ""Well, I just told you about that.  What was it?""  And I'll say, ""I have no clue.  It's not there.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Or -- or later, he'll say to me, ""Well, I already told you earlier today.""  And I think:  It's just not there. It literally just -- you can't even bring it back.  It's like:  Oh, okay.

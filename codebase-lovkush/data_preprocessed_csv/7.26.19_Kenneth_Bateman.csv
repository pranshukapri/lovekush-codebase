609,1469,56,23,What was your salary?,q,MR. SABATO,start_answer

So the loss of that. And then before the accident, I was very, very active, especially with my children.  I golfed with them every weekend, we bowled, we played softball, we were in a softball league.  You know, I could -- anything around the house, I could mow the grass, home repairs, all that stuff.  I could travel, I could do virtually anything I wanted.  So that was all before the accident.  And now I'm virtually almost confined to the house in a sitting position. The pain medicine, I can't do hardly anything while I'm taking the pain medicine.  My movement with my back is limited.  I have difficulty sleeping. When I go to sleep, it takes me anywhere from two to three hours before my back gets in a position where I'm comfortable enough to sleep. Even little things like, I hate to say this, excuse me, but wiping my butt after I go to the bathroom, it is painful because of the position I have to turn to to try to do it.  I can't participate in sports.  My one son lives in Boston, I can't go up and visit him because I can't travel. Any vacation plans, I did want to go to Africa and that's always been on my bucket list and stuff like that, but I can't do that.  So it's just -- it's a disaster.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2,121,4,18,Good morning.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3,122,4,19,Can you tell me if you reviewed any documents in preparation for giving testimony here today?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
4,125,4,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,126,4,23,Please tell me what documents you reviewed.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
6,128,4,25,"I reviewed our report on the material that we received with respect to this case, and also I briefly looked at another report on the cytogenetics.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
7,133,5,4,Do you have those reports?,side_chat,MR. MILLER,start_chat
8,135,5,6,Yeah.  I'll have you mark them.  There's cytogenics and there's reports.,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_chat
9,138,5,9,"I may have them in my material, but...",side_chat,MR. MILLER,start_question
10,141,5,12,So you reviewed only those two documents?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
11,142,5,13,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
12,143,5,14,"To prepare for your testimony here today, did you conduct any type of investigation or interview or speak with anybody in the Department of Pathology or Anatomic Pathology?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
13,148,5,19,"In preparation for this testimony, I did not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
14,150,5,21,Are you aware of any investigation that was conducted by Albany Medical Center in connection with this matter?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
15,153,5,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
16,154,5,25,And please tell me what investigation you are aware of.,q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
17,157,6,2,"Objection to the form, but go ahead.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
18,159,6,4,"Once I was made aware of this, I was involved in the investigations that ensued with respect to this that included a root cause analysis.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,163,6,8,"All right.  When you say you were involved in the investigation with this, what does ""this"" mean?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
20,166,6,11,"Well, we had handled this material, this, what we call it, a specimen, in our laboratory, and handled it in a routine fashion rather than handling it with the special request that was made.  So there was an error in our laboratory in not holding the specimen for purposes of burial, as I understood it.  So that was the issue at hand that we investigated.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,175,6,20,"Tell me what the investigation consisted of, to your knowledge.",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
22,177,6,22,"Again, objection, but you can answer.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
23,179,6,24,"As I say, we had a preliminary inquiry into whether we still had the specimen. We established that we did not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
24,183,7,2,"When you use the word ""we,"" who are you referring to?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
25,185,7,4,"Well, our laboratory personnel.  That would be if -- In the usual course, it would be the supervisor and the assistant supervisor in our laboratory, at that laboratory.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
26,190,7,9,Was a report generated as a result of this investigation?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
27,192,7,11,I'm not sure of that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
28,193,7,12,Who did you report to in that investigation?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
29,195,7,14,"Well, I didn't really report to anyone.  I was part of the investigation.  I was part of the group that met to understand what had happened.  Much of it was designed to see if we could improve our practices so that this wouldn't happen again in the future.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
30,202,7,21,When was this investigation conducted?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
31,203,7,22,"In that time frame.  I'm not sure it was -- If memory serves, there was a delay in our recognizing that there had been an error.  We normally hold samples, specimens like this for three weeks after we issue a report.  So it would have to have been at least a month or so, probably, before we began to investigate it.  So sometime after that we pursued this investigation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,214,8,7,Was this a committee that was formed to investigate?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
33,216,8,9,"It was an ad hoc committee, if you will. It was what we call a root cause analysis. When a significant error is made, we try to understand what happened, why it happened, and what we can do better to avoid that happening again.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,222,8,15,Who was in charge of the investigation?,q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
35,223,8,16,Objection to form. Go ahead.,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
36,225,8,18,It usually is initiated by Risk Management.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,227,8,20,For Albany Medical Center?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
38,228,8,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,229,8,22,And can you tell me who the members were of this ad hoc committee?,q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
40,231,8,24,"I'll object as to the identification of the people, but I -- but they come from different departments, so I'll let him identify the departments that were involved and the representatives.  It is, I think, protected, but in this case I'm letting it go a little farther than I think I would otherwise.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_question
41,242,9,9,"If you could tell me what departments were involved, please.",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
42,244,9,11,"I probably wouldn't be able to tell you the individuals, anyway.  So I can tell you that we had members of nursing, Risk Management, patient access, the morgue, the laboratory/  I think hospital administration may have been there, as well, and I think there were others there. There were several members of the nursing services from different areas, from which this type of specimen might emanate.  So we might receive this type from the OR, labor and delivery, the emergency room.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,256,9,23,"Did your protocols change?  When I said ""your,"" I'm talking about Albany Medical Center or any of the departments of pathology.  Did the protocols change in the way samples are handled as a result of this investigation?",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
44,263,10,4,"Objection to form, but you can answer.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
45,265,10,6,"I believe so, but I'm not -- I'm not able to tell you in what ways they did.  I think there were aspects of it that involved nursing and the laboratory and other forms of communication that were modified.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
46,271,10,12,"As part of the investigation, were various individuals interviewed?",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
47,273,10,14,"Objection, but you can answer.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
48,275,10,16,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""interviewed.""  Certainly there were questions that were addressed in terms of what people did or did not do and why they did or did not do what they did so we could understand what might have been a source of confusion or represent an opportunity for us to improve our process.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,283,10,24,"When you say certain people were identified as to what they did or could do or did not do, did you or the committee or anybody at Albany Medical Center specifically identify the specific individual or individuals within any of the pathology departments who handled the sample and who ultimately discarded the sample?",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
50,293,11,8,"Objection, but you can answer.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
51,295,11,10,"I suspect we were able to identify the personnel involved, but I don't -- I don't know who those people were at this point in time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,299,11,14,Are there any records to identify who those personnel are?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
53,301,11,16,I'm not sure of that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
54,302,11,17,"Putting aside for a moment the names of those individuals, can you tell me if those individuals you're referring to worked within a particular department or division of the hospital?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
55,307,11,22,"Yes, I think at least one of them I know was in our laboratory.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,309,11,24,"And when you say ""our laboratory,"" what specific laboratory are you referring to?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
57,312,12,1,It's called Histology or Surgical Pathology.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
58,314,12,3,What is the difference between surgical pathology and the Department of Anatomic Pathology?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
59,317,12,6,"Well, in this hospital we call it the Division of Anatomic Pathology, which encompasses other laboratories, including Surgical Pathology.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,321,12,10,"Now, back at the time frame we're talking about here, I understand you are the Director of Anatomic Pathology, correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
61,324,12,13,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
62,325,12,14,And when did you assume the directorship?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
63,326,12,15,I believe it was '90 -- I'm not certain. In the -- '90 --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
64,328,12,17,I'm looking at your CV.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
65,329,12,18,Thank you.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
66,330,12,19,1999.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
67,331,12,20,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
68,332,12,21,"And before that, you were the Director of Surgical Pathology?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
69,334,12,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
70,335,12,24,"Is there, in fact, a Department of Histology or does histology fall within the Surgical Sathology Department?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
71,339,13,2,"It's essentially the same department, just a different name.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
72,341,13,4,And what are your duties and responsibilities as Director of Anatomic Pathology?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
73,344,13,7,"Well, again, that encompasses not only surgical pathology, but also psychology and autopsy pathology and other services related to handling tissues and fluids for anatomic diagnosis.  My role there includes overseeing the operations to make sure that we maintain a quality performance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,352,13,15,So you have administrative responsibilities?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
75,354,13,17,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,355,13,18,Do you have clinical responsibilities?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
77,356,13,19,"Outside of that title, I also operate as an attending pathologist and have a full service load, yes, sir.  Or I had had.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,359,13,22,"Back in the fall of 2015, approximately how many employees worked within the Department of Anatomic Pathology?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
79,362,13,25,"We had a number of employees that were not full time.  I think we had about 12 pathologists, probably 50 or 60 technical people, 10 or 12 office employees.  I'm ballparking it.  I don't know the exact number.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,369,14,6,"So total, give or take, of 75 people?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
81,370,14,7,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,371,14,8,Do they all work at the same location?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
83,372,14,9,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,373,14,10,At different locations within the hospital building?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
85,375,14,12,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,376,14,13,"All right.  And those 75 people, does that include the people who work for the department of surgical pathology as well?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
87,379,14,16,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,380,14,17,So do you make a distinction between people who work for surgical pathology versus anatomic pathology?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
89,383,14,20,Only in certain respects.  Certainly not in operations that relate to the quality of the laboratory.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,386,14,23,"And when we're talking about surgical pathology, just generally speaking, are we talking about samples that are provided for pathological analysis as the result of some surgical procedure?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
91,392,15,3,In general.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,393,15,4,"The Department of Anatomic Pathology, does it receive samples for analysis beyond just surgical samples?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
93,396,15,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,397,15,8,And give me an example of the samples that you'd receive.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
95,399,15,10,"Well, one of the most conspicuous ones would cytology samples; so we have fluids or smears, so forth.  We do also receive remains in the autopsy suite. Occasionally a sample is obtained outside of the venue of normal operations, either through trauma or accident or something like that, some kind of non-surgical procedure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,408,15,19,Were there various departments within the Department of Anatomic Pathology?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
97,410,15,21,"Various divisions, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,411,15,22,Please tell me what they were or are.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
99,412,15,23,Well --,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
100,413,15,24,Objection.  You want him -- I don't know if it's changed since 2015 or not.,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_question
101,418,16,3,Let's go back to 2015.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
102,419,16,4,"I think it's similar to that.  We have -- The biggest divisions are surgical pathology, cytopathology, autopsy pathology.  Under those, we have subspecialty areas that include neuropathology, hematopathology, dermatopathology, and others that are less busy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,427,16,12,Were there written protocols within the Department of Anatomic Pathology in 2015 regarding how samples were to be handled when received by the Department of Anatomic Pathology?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
104,432,16,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,433,16,18,And were those various written protocols broken down by the different types of pathology that you just referred to or was it one general overview of a protocol?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
106,437,16,22,We have a requisition form that is distinct in surgical pathology from the one that we use in cytopathology.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,440,16,25,It's distinct in which way?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
108,442,17,1,It's just a different form.  It has different needs and requirements to -- for us to operate effectively.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,445,17,4,"Now, in the case that we're talking about, is it your understanding that fetal remains taken from Larissa Davis came to the Department of Anatomic Pathology?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
110,449,17,8,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,450,17,9,Something like that was -- Would it be fair if I classified it as a routine thing?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
112,453,17,12,"It is not uncommon for us to get those, so we handle those almost every day.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,455,17,14,Are there specific protocols for the way fetal remains are to be handled?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
114,457,17,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,458,17,17,"Is it your understanding in this case -- Let me withdraw that. Is there a phrase within the department of pathology ""medical waste""?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
116,462,17,21,It is a term that is used.  I'm not certain if it's in our documents or protocols.  I don't know that answer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,465,17,24,"All right.  Putting aside your documents and protocols, have you heard the phrase ""medical waste""?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
118,469,18,2,Of course.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,470,18,3,What do you understand that to mean?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
120,471,18,4,"Well, it is a term that includes a variety of types of material that are deemed no longer necessary to retain for purposes of analysis or other reasons and can be disposed of.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,476,18,9,"And back in 2015, in your laboratory, how was medical waste disposed of?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
122,478,18,11,"Well, we do have a variety of types of material that are encompassed in that term, again, including fluids, blood, things like that that are sometimes contaminating gauze or papers, and so those go in for that type of disposal. Our own laboratory also has the specimens that, after we have done what we are supposed to do with them, are also put through that disposal process.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,488,18,21,Specifically what is the disposal process?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
124,489,18,22,"So again, for those specimens, I think is what you're asking about.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,491,18,24,Yes.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
126,492,18,25,"We issue a report, we retain specimens for three weeks after the report is issued to permit -- provide an opportunity for us to hear back from someone if there are additional questions or concerns, and then they go for disposal.  We use an incinerating process, I think, through a company.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,501,19,8,You said in your answer that you hold on to the specimen for three weeks and then you issue a report?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
128,504,19,11,"No, sir.  We issue a report -- We receive the specimen, we process it, we issue the report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,507,19,14,Regarding the specimen itself?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
130,508,19,15,"Right.  During that period, the specimen is held in storage.  We continue to hold it for three weeks after the report has been issued so that there is an opportunity for feedback.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,513,19,20,"When you use the word ""report,"" do you mean reporting on a pathological analysis?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
132,515,19,22,Correct.  That diagnosis report as you see there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,517,19,24,"Okay.  Apart from the investigation that you were involved in, did you personally have any involvement with examination or analysis of fetal remains from Larissa Davis?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
134,523,20,4,I'm not sure I understand your question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,524,20,5,Did you examine the specimen in this case?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
136,525,20,6,"It was my report that has been issued from our lab.  My name is on that report.  I'm certain I did see the slides that were generated, the slide that was generated.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,529,20,10,So would your name be on that report if you did not personally examine those slides?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
138,532,20,13,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,533,20,14,So whoever personally examined that report would have his or her name on?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
140,535,20,16,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,536,20,17,"Okay.  Now, the incineration process, does Albany Medical Center have an incinerator for disposal of what it determines to be medical waste?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
142,540,20,21,"I'm not certain anymore what the process is after it goes from our lab.  I'll be honest, I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,543,20,24,"Back in 2015, did Albany Medical Center have an incinerator on site, if you know?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
144,546,21,1,I don't know the answer to that question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,547,21,2,Who makes the determination that a specimen is no longer needed and they can dispose of it or incinerate it?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
146,550,21,5,"Well, we've had a practice that's based on an understanding through administrations in the hospital that this is the process by which we're going to dispose of these specimens.  And so I don't know if that was a decision that was made by -- I don't know who made the decision, if that's the question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
147,558,21,13,"You mean in general, Jeff, or --",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_question
148,561,21,16,"Let me be more specific, okay? When a specimen is sent to your lab, the analysis is done.  Once the analysis is done, you hold on to that specimen for about three weeks, give or take.  From that point on, who within that lab has the responsibility or makes the determination to say we no longer have to keep this or maintain it, we're going to dispose of it?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
149,572,22,1,"I understand now, I think. So our practice includes a routine that would permit us to treat the vast majority of specimens in this fashion that we just described, which is a three-week hold period.  Our storage facilities do not permit us to hold so many specimens for an indefinite period of time, so the routine is to discard or dispose of these specimens after that three-week interval. If there is a special request, we would hold it in a somewhat -- in a similar, but different area for further analysis or disposition.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
150,586,22,15,"When you use the word ""routine"" for disposal, is this a written protocol or it's just a verbal routine or understood routine?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
151,590,22,19,"I think it's written, but I don't know that I could pull it up.  It's the way we've practiced for many, many, many years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
152,594,22,23,"Is there an individual within the lab, or was there back in 2015, or department within the lab who made the determination we don't need a particular specimen, we can dispose of it, or is that determination made by different people in a case-by-case basis?",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
153,602,23,5,Objection to form. You can go ahead.,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
154,604,23,7,"Well, we have a, I guess it's FIFO; first in, first out.  That's the storage system. So we actually go through each specimen and make sure that it has been signed out and that the three-week interval has been met, and we put that in for disposal.  So there is a process that treats all specimens in that fashion that are shelved as for disposal.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,613,23,16,"Generally speaking, Doctor, with regard to each specimen that comes into the lab, going through analysis, and from there disposal or special request, is there paperwork that tracks that specimen from the moment it enters the lab to the moment it's discarded or treated or held on to?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
156,620,23,23,"So the paperwork that is that requisition form that comes with the specimen is married up with the specimen through the process until such time as a slide is made, slide or slides, and then it is married up with the slide.  So it is divorced from the specimen container at an intermediate period of the process. So once it is put into storage, the only way we can check it is through the computer, or we can make a special effort to go back and pull out the paperwork, but the report -- the paperwork does not stay with the specimen container indefinitely.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,635,24,12,"A few minutes ago in one of your answers, you made reference to special requests being received from time to time by the lab; correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
158,639,24,16,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,640,24,17,Could you tell me generally what you understand a special request to be?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
160,642,24,19,"Well, it's a request for us to do something other than routine.  We receive those -- sometimes as we receive this one written on the requisition sheet, other times there's a verbal communication, telephone or in person, email, fax.  We get communications in a variety of ways to give us this kind of special request.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,651,25,2,"So if your lab received a requisition that said in words or substance hold fetal remains, parents want them for purposes of burial, would you consider that to be a special request?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
162,656,25,7,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,657,25,8,"And generally speaking, how, back in 2015, were special requests handled or tracked?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
164,659,25,10,"Well, it depends on the request. Sometimes we get a request from a medical device company to hold something and so forth, but in this case, that request would have been met by putting the specimen in a separate area for -- for holding until we heard from the funeral home or whoever else reached out to us for that material.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,668,25,19,"So do I take your answer to mean that if a special request is received by your department for a specimen, that specimen is not supposed to be disposed of or incinerated?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
166,673,25,24,That's correct.  An error was made.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,674,25,25,"Now, before you had mentioned that you get a requisition initially, and that if -- I assume that an inventory control number or something like that is given to a sample?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
168,679,26,4,We have a unique identifier that is assigned to each case.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,681,26,6,And that unique identifier goes into the computer system?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
170,683,26,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
171,684,26,9,"As that sample that received a special request traveled in the system in your laboratory back in 2015, does that requisition with the special request travel with the specimen or do you have to look at the computer to know if there was a special request for that sample?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
172,691,26,16,No.  It's only on the requisition itself.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,692,26,17,"So if the requisition doesn't travel with the sample, the only way somebody handling that sample would know about that special request is by looking in the computer; correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
174,697,26,22,"No, it wouldn't be in the computer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
175,698,26,23,Where would it be?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
176,699,26,24,"The special request is only on the requisition, and it would be set aside in the storage area so that if someone followed up and said I'm looking for that specimen, they would go in that area and look for it.  They would await that notification or call.  We can always recover the requisition sheet, but it doesn't stay with the specimen. It goes with the rest of the case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
177,710,27,9,"What I'm envisioning from your answers is that, within your laboratory, there's more than one storage area?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
178,713,27,12,"There's one storage area, but two -- It's divided.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
179,715,27,14,"Okay.  Special request to the left, not special request to the right, okay?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
180,717,27,16,Fair enough.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
181,718,27,17,Objection.  But go ahead.,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_question
182,721,27,20,"And if you get a special request and it's supposed to go to the left, but, in fact, it is stored on the right side, nobody's ever going to know about that special request; correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
183,726,27,25,That was the system we had in place at the time this event occurred.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
184,729,28,2,So there was no backup --,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
185,730,28,3,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
186,731,28,4,-- to make sure that the special request was honored; is that right?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
187,733,28,6,I'm afraid that's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
188,734,28,7,And that process is now a different process?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
189,736,28,9,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
190,737,28,10,I'm going to go through a series of documents with you.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
191,739,28,12,All right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
192,740,28,13,All right.  And then I'll get more specific about this case.,q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
193,742,28,15,I'm just going to hand these all to you.,side_chat,MR. MILLER,start_chat
194,744,28,17,Okay.,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_chat
195,745,28,18,We'll go through them.  If you can show the doctor number 1.,side_chat,MR. MILLER,start_question
196,749,28,22,"Doctor, can you tell me what Exhibit 1 is, please?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
197,751,28,24,"This is an Albany Medical Center policy and procedure, number 10.09.  Subject is fetal death reporting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
198,755,29,2,"What's the purpose -- Withdraw that. Is this a policy, procedure or protocol of Albany Medical Center that was in effect back in November or October of 2015?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
199,760,29,7,"It appears to be so.  It looks right, but -- The date here is effective 10/8/15, so that's part of that same time frame. I'm not sure if there was a modification around that time.  It might not have been communicated to everyone.  I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
200,766,29,13,"What's the purpose of this policy and procedure, generally speaking?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
201,768,29,15,"Well, I think it's fairly stated here, to ensure an accurate and consistent method of completing the appropriate paperwork necessary to complete fetal death reporting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
202,773,29,20,So this has to do with reporting of a death to the Department of Health and Vital Statistics?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
203,776,29,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
204,777,29,24,Does this policy play any role in the -- in your laboratory?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
205,780,30,1,"Well, it does insofar as we are aware of the importance of the 20-week time frame with respect to whether a death certificate needs to be filed or not. Obviously 20 weeks is sometimes difficult to establish.  You can use estimated date of confinement or other last period. There are other ways to establish that, but we basically don't have anything to do with this reporting, if that's the question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
206,791,30,12,You mentioned 20 weeks.  What's the significance of 20 weeks?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
207,793,30,14,"Well, again, there's -- It's considered a death if it's more than 20 weeks, by the state.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
208,796,30,17,"So if it's less than 20 weeks, what's it considered?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
209,798,30,19,"I'm not sure of the exact terminology, but it doesn't require this form be completed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
210,800,30,21,So this form only needs to be completed under what circumstances?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
211,802,30,23,"I believe if it is 20 weeks of gestation. We still have a death notice, I think.  It is confusing in terms of the nomenclature and usage.  And one of the things that became evident with the root cause analysis was some of this confusion, but -- And I'm not the best person to speak to this, but I, myself, am sometimes confused.  But I think I stated fairly that there's a 20-week cutoff between what is considered a death by the State of New York.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
212,815,31,10,"Does this policy, number 1, play any role in terms of how samples are handled in your laboratory?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
213,818,31,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
214,819,31,14,And what role does it play?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
215,820,31,15,"Well, again, if it's less than 20 weeks, it is considered a surgical specimen and would be handled as we handled this one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
216,823,31,18,So surgical specimen is one that typically is considered to be disposable?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
217,825,31,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
218,826,31,21,"And other than incinerating surgical or disposable samples, is there any other way to dispose of them that you're aware of?",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
219,829,31,24,"Objection to form, but go ahead.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
220,832,32,1,"Well, certainly we could do other things with them.  We could inter them.  That's done occasionally.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,835,32,4,That would be by special request?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
222,836,32,5,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,837,32,6,"Back in the fall of 2015, was there a specific form that I will call a special request form?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
224,840,32,9,I don't believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,841,32,10,So back in 2015 -- and please tell me if I'm wrong here -- the only way that a special request can be honored is or was if the specimen were stored in the correct area of the laboratory?,q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
226,846,32,15,"Objection to form, but you can answer.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
227,848,32,17,"I suppose there might have been another way it might have been done, but that would be the most reliable method.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
228,851,32,20,"As part of your involvement in this case, either in the laboratory or since, have you looked to see if there are any or were there any entries in the computer at Albany Medical Center or its pathology laboratory that discussed this sample or discussed a special request?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
229,859,33,2,Entries into the computer?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,860,33,3,"Yes.  Any computer system, any computer entries, any digital entries with regard to this sample or with regard to the special request made for this sample?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
231,864,33,7,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
232,865,33,8,"If you could go to Exhibit 2, please. Exhibit 2 is an office note of Dr. Bruce Clark dated 10/26/15.  Do you know Dr. Clark?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
233,869,33,12,I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
234,870,33,13,Who do you know him to be?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
235,871,33,14,He's an obstetrician here in -- works primarily at Albany Med.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
236,873,33,16,"Now, on the first page, at the top where it says ""subjective,"" it talks about a follow-up for a post-spontaneous abortion. If you could read that first paragraph to yourself.",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
237,878,33,21,I do.  I have.  Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,879,33,22,Do you see where it talks about patient presents for follow-up of post-spontaneous abortion?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
239,882,33,25,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,884,34,1,And then several lines down it says (as read):  Wants fetal remains for religious reasons.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
241,887,34,4,"Yes, sir.  I see that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,888,34,5,Did you ever see this record before today?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
243,889,34,6,I don't believe I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,890,34,7,"Now, if a doctor makes a note such as this in his or her medical record, back in 2015, was there any practice or procedure in place that would result in a record like this going to the pathology department?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
245,896,34,13,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,897,34,14,"So the special requests that were made, what kind of form was it that would notify the department that it's supposed to handle a specific specimen a certain way?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
247,901,34,18,"The only form is that requisition form. As I said, we often receive special requests through other forms of communication, but in terms of a written form, that's the only one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
248,906,34,23,"Now, at the bottom of Exhibit 2, next to comments, it says (as read):  Patient had D&C tomorrow, 10/27/15.  And under that: She agrees to have chromosomal testing done. Do you see where I'm referring to?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
249,913,35,4,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,914,35,5,"When chromosomal testing is done, generally speaking, is that testing done at your laboratory or would it be sent out to a different laboratory?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
251,918,35,9,It's a different lab.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,919,35,10,"Okay.  And in order to -- Well, withdraw that. Let's assume, generally speaking, that your laboratory receives fetal remains and those remains are to be tested for chromosomal abnormalities.  What portion -- What do you do with the sample in order to be able to do that testing?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
253,927,35,18,"Well, it would have to be fresh.  As I remember, looking at the report yesterday, this was received in formalin, so that would preclude any such possibility of arcinia (phonetic) for cytogenetic testing. So if we receive something fresh, then we take some of that tissue, we don't need a lot, but they -- or they don't need a lot.  We send some fresh tissue for cytogenetic testing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,938,36,3,"All right.  When you use the word ""formalin,"" please explain that in lay person terms.",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
255,941,36,6,"Well, formaldehyde is a chemical designed for the preservation of tissues.  It affixes tissues in a way that permits us to handle them more consistently or readily.  This is a -- Formalin is a diluted form of formaldehyde.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
256,947,36,12,"Now, I believe in one of the exhibits you have the chromosome analysis.",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
257,949,36,14,Want me to show it to him?,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_chat
258,951,36,16,"Of course, yes.",side_chat,MR. MILLER,start_question
259,953,36,18,You're now looking at Exhibit 11.  Is that the chromosome analysis with regard to the specimen in this case?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
260,956,36,21,"Again, this did not come from us.  It did not come from our lab.  It was not part of the specimen we received.  So this was sent from Dr. Clark or one of his people for this testing, presumably roughly the same time frame that they sent the rest of the case to us, but we did not have any part in submitting this tissue, nor generating this report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
261,966,37,5,So this tissue was not submitted to your lab for chromosomal analysis; correct?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
262,968,37,7,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,969,37,8,"And you're saying that Dr. Clark would prepare a portion of the sample or the tissue, send it out himself to the lab for chromosomal analysis independent of your lab; correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
264,974,37,13,"Correct.  Yeah.  So he may have used, you know, some nursing staff in his suite to facilitate that.  But yeah, it was done outside our laboratory.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
265,978,37,17,"Now, when a sample of tissue is sent out for chromosomal testing like this, is the tissue placed on a slide or how is it prepared?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
266,982,37,21,"When it's sent for chromosomal analysis, I'm not prepared to be specific about the optimal way they would like to get it, but it has to be fresh, and it's usually in some kind of carrying media that provides that sustenance to preserve the tissue as best as possible.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,990,38,3,"So in order to be able to do the chromosomal analysis, the amount of tissue that a lab would need is a very small percentage of the --",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
268,994,38,7,"Yes, sir.  I don't know if they describe it here, but it's usually not -- you know, I mean, we -- I don't know the amount, but it's -- it would be a small part of most specimens.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,999,38,12,"So even after that specimen for chromosomal testing is sent out, the overwhelming majority of the tissue is still in existence to be sent to your laboratory; correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
270,1004,38,17,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
271,1005,38,18,"I believe this is Exhibit 3, Albany Medical Center Division of Anatomic Pathology; correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
272,1008,38,21,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,1009,38,22,"What is the purpose of this form, Exhibit 3?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
274,1011,38,24,"This is a request for our services.  So we are like other physicians, we are consultants.  We are asked to provide a consultation on, in most cases, tissue material.  And the form provides us the demographic information so that we can be certain that the specimen in the container is -- belongs to this patient, and then there's additional opportunity for information about what the specimen is, what the preop diagnosis, the procedure, clinical history and so forth.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,1024,39,11,All right.  This form is -- shows a collection date of 10/27/15; correct?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
276,1026,39,13,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,1027,39,14,Does that mean the tissue sample was collected on 10/27/15?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
278,1029,39,16,Presumably.  That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
279,1030,39,17,"And is that day, 10/27/15, your understanding as to when Larissa Davis had a D&C?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
280,1033,39,20,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,1034,39,21,"And it says (as read):  Location, OR 15. Is that the operating room where the tissue was collected?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer

283,1038,39,25,"And the initials next to that, what do they stand for?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
284,1041,40,2,"I think that's probably some of the nursing personnel, those people -- I don't know -- I never really use that or look at that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,1045,40,6,And then it is preprinted to say under that (as read):  Request for surgical pathology tissue analysis?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
286,1048,40,9,"Yes, sir.  This is a preprinted form.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,1049,40,10,"Okay.  Under that, it says (as read): Note, specimen number.  And write a source description for each one.  Record the number and source description of the specimen container; correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
288,1054,40,15,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
289,1055,40,16,"Now, when it refers to specimen number, what -- what is that?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
290,1057,40,18,"Well, in some cases some patients have procedures that generate more than one specimen from different sites or different types of tissue, so it's necessary for us to, you know, be able to document each and every one of those.  In this case there was a single specimen.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,1064,40,25,"Was the single specimen, which were the products of conception, given a specimen number?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
292,1068,41,3,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,1069,41,4,"And from this form, can you identify where that number is?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
294,1071,41,6,There's a label across the upper portion in that box right beneath those initials that you just asked me about.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

296,1075,41,10,S1520868.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
297,1076,41,11,That's a number that is given to this specimen by --,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer

299,1081,41,16,"When you say ""information system,"" what are you talking about?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
300,1083,41,18,We have our own information system for anatomic pathology so that our reports are captured in there with all the elements of the process that we can include.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
301,1087,41,22,Let me ask you this:  Is the information system computerized?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
302,1089,41,24,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
303,1090,41,25,So the number that's assigned to this particular sample was in a computer program at your laboratory; correct?,q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
304,1094,42,3,"Objection to form, but go ahead.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
305,1096,42,5,"In the program, it's in the database, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,1098,42,7,"Okay.  And what types of information, back in 2015, went into the database with regard to each tissue sample received by the lab under a particular identifying number?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
307,1103,42,12,"I think it's most easily recognized by that report form that is available.  It includes the demographics, patient's name, age and date -- you know, date of birth, and their medical record number.  It also includes information from this requisition form, in part.  It also includes our description of the gross interpretation, and finally a report of the diagnosis itself.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Can you tell me what CLIA is, please?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
311,1126,43,9,"That's Clinical Laboratory Inspection Association.  I'm not sure of the I, but it's an agency that inspects and regulates laboratories.

313,1137,43,20,"Well, we have a little license there to hopefully prompt them to give us information.  They don't always do so, but the information that we request is designed to provide us with as much information as we can get so that we can do a better job in interpreting the specimens.

515,1699,65,10,"Well, often it's done before we receive it.  And some of this documentation inherent in this policy and procedure is completed in a way that would direct us to the morgue itself rather than to the surgical pathology lab.

569,1865,71,20,"What do you mean when you say ""grossing of specimens""?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
570,1867,71,22,"So we inspect each specimen as it comes in with our naked eye, that's why that word ""gross"" is used as opposed to microscopic, and we describe the material we receive in terms of its volume, size, color, consistency, elements that we can recognize.  Depending on what's there, if there's something that's abnormal, we describe that, and we thereafter take sections of that material to represent what we have received, and we put those into cassettes that we individually label so that we can know what those sections are meant to represent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

580,1899,73,2,"Well, I'll preempt it.  The next name there is Sahar Nozad.  She was also a resident.  She was the one that did this gross examination description.  So she handled the specimen at that level.  The slide that was generated was given to Dr. El Jabbour, and he was the resident that was assigned to sign the case out with me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
581,1908,73,11,Okay.  So Dr. El Jabbour just handled the slide; you saw the slide?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer

606,1974,75,25,"They were linked, but each had its own dynamic.  The RCA was part of the basis, as I remember, for our response to New York State, and yet we dealt with New York State, you know, in an independent fashion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

It's just, you know, human beings make mistakes.  And obviously there are repercussions and impacts the people affected very dramatically, and, you know, we feel terrible about it.  But somebody goofed, somebody didn't put -- didn't do what they were supposed to do.

I know that one of the things we did is -- was rather labor-intensive, but it involved pulling out every case that was a product of conception and looking at the requisition sheet in this interval period of three weeks to make sure that we didn't miss any.

It works best.  If we interject ourselves, we can create confusion.  If there are emotional or other responses that need to be addressed, we don't know the patients or their families. And so that's the practice that we've always maintained, and that's what we thought would be best in this situation, to communicate, initially at least, through Dr. Clark.  I think Dr. Rosano, I believe, felt that perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Davis or -- and maybe he did as well, that might also give the opportunity for them to feedback, voice concerns, understand our concerns as well that -- So there was at least some attempt after Dr. Clark for us to reach out to them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

674,2204,84,21,"Objection to form, but go ahead.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
675,2206,84,23,"In some instances, yes, in some instances, no.  There is, I think, a global permission that is part of the documentation that is associated with entry into the facility.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
676,2212,85,3,Is research -- medical research on tissue performed with regard to fetal remains?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
677,2214,85,5,I'm not aware of that.  It's possible that there have been IRB protocols that have deemed that appropriate.  I'm not the person to ask that question.  I don't know the answer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
678,2219,85,10,"And IRB, is that an independent body?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
679,2220,85,11,"The institution has a group of scientists that function in that role here, at Albany Med.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
680,2223,85,14,"And one of the questions that the Davises have is, what happened to this tissue? And they've been told it's been incinerated.  But in all candor, one of the concerns that they have is that this tissue was used in some other way or processed in some other way or became part of medical research because there's no documentation showing them that the tissue was, in fact, incinerated. So is there any documentation that exists anywhere that could satisfy this concern and inquiry?",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
681,2237,86,2,Objection to form. If you know.,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
682,2239,86,4,"I don't know.  It's possible -- Again, we did -- We did establish a methodology whereby we would be certain that it had been three weeks, at least three weeks before we disposed of the tissues.  And so it is possible that that log exists that would confirm that it was submitted for disposal.  Beyond that, there would be no other -- The only other material we have is that material we use for testing, which included the glass slide, which we are required to retain for 20 years and is in our file, and the paraffin block which we're also required to retain, but we offered that for purposes of burial. So to the best of my knowledge, there's no one going into our lab and getting tissues out of storage for research of this type.  That's not happening.  I can make a personal assurance, but that's no documentation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
683,2262,87,1,You talk about a log relating to disposal or incineration.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
684,2264,87,3,"Yeah, I'm not certain there is such a log. There may or may not be such a log.  I know we had a method whereby we were making sure that it had been three weeks before we disposed of these tissues, and it's possible that that was associated with a log.  I'm not certain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
685,2271,87,10,"Okay.  Let me just ask you about this three-week process again from this perspective.  A tissue sample comes into the lab, and if I understand you correctly, you want to process this tissue within a couple of days.  And then you hold on to the sample for three weeks, and then it can be disposed of at that point in time. So you're talking about three-and-a-half weeks; correct?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
686,2282,87,21,Sometimes a little longer.  Depends on how long it takes us to develop our report.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
687,2284,87,23,Okay.  Do you have any information as to the earliest time an employee of the lab or hospital became aware that these remains were disposed of?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
688,2289,88,2,I have no such knowledge.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
689,2290,88,3,"The phone call from Dr. Clark to the Davises came approximately on December 16th, more than a month-and-a-half after the sample -- or the tissue came into the lab, and my clients have testified that one or both of them made numerous phone calls to the lab during the six-week period.  And when they would be called, they would be passed from one person to the next person, and that someone ultimately told Mr. Davis that the remains were processed. Do you know anything about that?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
690,2303,88,16,"No, I do not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
691,2304,88,17,"Does the word ""processed"" have any special meaning to you as a pathologist?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
692,2306,88,19,"I think it means to us that it has been evaluated and that it's in -- somewhere in the system as, you know, whether a full report has been developed or it's in progress.  It's a fairly broad term.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
693,2311,88,24,"Now, back at the time frame we're talking about, November of 2015.  Was there an outside vendor that would be used to dispose of medical waste?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
694,2316,89,3,I think -- I think we were using an outside vendor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
695,2318,89,5,Do you know if the medical center or your department would dispose of medical waste through Albany Medical Center in-house?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
696,2321,89,8,"We did have that process for a while, but I think we moved to a different process before this time frame.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
697,2324,89,11,So the incineration would take place outside of Albany Medical Center; correct?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
698,2326,89,13,"I'm not certain.  I believe that's correct, but I'm by no means the best person to ask that question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
699,2329,89,16,I gather that the laboratory handles tens of thousands of specimens a year; would that be fair?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
700,2332,89,19,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
701,2333,89,20,"So at any given time, in storage for disposal could be more than a thousand samples?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
702,2336,89,23,"Maybe not that many.  I don't know the answer to that, but probably.  That's a ballpark figure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
703,2340,90,1,"Or between 500 and 1,000, perhaps?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
704,2341,90,2,"No.  I don't -- Yeah, we have a limited storage area and it's usually near capacity.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
705,2344,90,5,"Back in the time frame we're talking about, when medical waste was going to be disposed of or incinerated, would this outside vendor come once a week, come every day, or with what regularity do they come?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
706,2350,90,11,I think it was two or three times a week.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
707,2351,90,12,"And when this outside vendor would come, and before all these samples that had been in storage were given to the outside vendor for disposal, was there any procedure by which a final check was done to determine the sample that was being given should, in fact, be given and was not attached to any special request?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
708,2359,90,20,"No, sir, not for a special request.  The only provision we were operating under was that it had been at least three weeks since the case had been signed out or the report had been issued.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

715,2374,91,9,I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
716,2375,91,10,And tell me what the hospital did to find out where they went.,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
717,2377,91,12,"Well, I can't speak specifically to that. I can just tell you in general terms that our storage facility is such that we would expect to find that specimen in there if it were still in our hands, if it had not been disposed of.  And I believe we did a hard target search for that and we could not find it.  And it was in a time frame when other specimens of that same time frame would have been disposed of, so...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
718,2387,91,22,So you're assuming that the remains were disposed of because you can't find it?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
719,2389,91,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
720,2390,91,25,"But you don't know for sure that these remains were incinerated or not, do you?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
721,2393,92,2,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
722,2394,92,3,"Objection to form, but go ahead.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_question
723,2397,92,6,And I take it that you don't know for certain what happened to those remains; is that correct?,q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
724,2400,92,9,Not for certain.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
725,2401,92,10,"Incineration of the remains is an assumption on your part, isn't it?",q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
726,2403,92,12,Objection to form. Go ahead.,side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
727,2405,92,14,"Well, I think it's -- You know, there are degrees of confidence that we operate under in many aspects of our work.  And we handle -- as you said, we handle thousands of specimens.  There's almost nowhere else that that could have gone except for disposal.  So I'm assuming, but with a fairly -- or a quite high degree of confidence that they were disposed of.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
728,2414,92,23,"Tell me this, Doctor:  Is there a reason why nobody from the Medical Center ever called the Davises after learning that the remains were missing or incinerated to apologize to them?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
729,2420,93,3,"Well, I believe I did that myself.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
730,2421,93,4,I think you said you extended your condolences.,q,MR. MILLER,start_chat
731,2423,93,6,"And -- Well, he said more than that.  But go ahead.",side_chat,MR. BELL,start_answer
732,2425,93,8,"I believe I said apologize.  I certainly meant to do that.  I meant to say that, and that was the intent of the call was to express our apologies, in part.  So, you know, I'm hopeful that was received in that way.  If it was not, then that was probably due to inadequacy on my part because that's what the intent was, at least in part. I'm not sure if others did as well, but I thought Dr. Clark did and I thought I did, and I don't know if others did as well, but I can't speak to those others, if anyone else did or did not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
733,2439,93,22,"When a request is made to the IRB for permission to undertake research, is there documentation accompanying a request?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
734,2442,93,25,"Oh, yes.  There's a form -- a formal request for that, approval.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
735,2445,94,2,"And is there -- As opposed to requesting formal permission, is the specific identification number for the tissue you're looking to do research on identified to the IRB?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer
736,2450,94,7,"No, that would be de-identified.  Any such case material would be de-identified. That's a standard.  You can seek special permission for specific materials if you have specific approval from that individual, but by and large, the vast majority of cases or instances in which you're seeking approval for research, materials are de-identified.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
737,2459,94,16,"When the research on that tissue for which permission is sought to do research from the IRB, what happens to that tissue?",q,MR. MILLER,start_answer

740,2465,94,22,"I think that's written up in the protocol and usually it's disposed of, I believe, but I'm not sure.  It would depend on the protocol, I guess.  I'm not involved with the IRB here, so I don't know what their standards or requirements are.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

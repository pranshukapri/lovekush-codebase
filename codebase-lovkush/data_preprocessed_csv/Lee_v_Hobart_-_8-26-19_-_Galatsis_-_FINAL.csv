15,304,17,17,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
16,305,17,18,"So I see that the first case here is from 2012, and that's the Saba case.  And I believe the last case here listed is the Nealan case from 2019. So between 2012 and 2019, this is a list of all the cases in which you've either been deposed or have testified at trial?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
17,311,17,24,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

31,343,19,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,344,19,5,So you understand that you're under oath and the testimony you're going to give in front of us today is like testifying before a judge and jury; is that correct?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
33,348,19,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,349,19,10,"Okay.

40,370,20,5,"Okay.  And then if you need a break, just let me know.  I will try as best we can to accommodate you.  We'll try to take a break every once in an hour or so. Okay.  I want to start with your background.  Perhaps what we can do is -- obviously, you're a talented man.  I've taken a look at your CV and you have a lot of different talents, not only in carbon monoxide but everything else.  What I'll do is -- let me get his declaration. So you've got some background material in your declaration; correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
41,382,20,17,Correct.  I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
42,383,20,18,"And that, I would assume, pertains to your experience as at least this case; correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

50,400,21,9,So could you go ahead and tell me a little about your background.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
51,402,21,11,"Absolutely.  So I have an engineering major, undergraduate.  I have a postgraduate in engineering, also, Ph.D., specifically in sensor technology, specifically in developing, inventing, testing and designing sensor technology to detect toxic gas components.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,408,21,17,"Now, your undergraduate degree, when and where did you earn that from?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
53,410,21,19,"In my undergraduate degree, I earned that at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
54,412,21,21,In what discipline?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
55,413,21,22,"In computer systems engineering.  That was the major.  During that period, however, I also had a major project that involved developing a smoke analyzer working very intimately with a combustion burner and a stack at a private company called Novatech Controls in Melbourne, Australia.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,420,22,3,And this is during your undergraduate years?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
57,422,22,5,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
58,423,22,6,And what time frame was that?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
59,424,22,7,"I began my undergraduate course in 2000 and 99 -- no, excuse me.  I'll take that back.  '95 to '99, inclusive.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,427,22,10,Okay.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
61,428,22,11,"And my experience related to this case working with sensor technology began three years into that course, and as I mentioned, that involved developing a smoke analyzer for a flue gas environment. And in addition, I had another project to develop a carbon monoxide system for an automobile that was funded by the Australian Medical Association and the Australian government to develop an interlock system for a vehicle to prevent exhaust gas suicides.  Again, both projects were undertaken at the undergraduate level.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
62,440,22,23,So what did you do upon graduating from your bachelor's program in 1999?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
63,442,22,25,"Upon graduating, I wanted to pursue my passion for sensor technology, specifically for toxic gas detection.  I applied for scholarship.  I was successful.  I had a great rapport with my supervisor at the time, and that shelved me into working as a graduate student in the premier center technology laboratory in Australia.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
64,450,23,7,When did you complete your doctoral work?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
65,451,23,8,"Roughly 2003, I believe it was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
66,452,23,9,And what did you do after you finished your doctorate?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
67,454,23,11,"After I finished my doctorate, I also completed an MBA.  After that, I spent -- also, during that period of time, I was still continually working on a part-time basis for the laboratory that I graduated from continuing these projects, and in 2005, I believe, I -- 2000 and -- let me check here so I don't get that wrong.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
68,461,23,18,Let me go ahead and enter your CV as Exhibit 3 so that you can refer to it --,side_chat,MR. TAYAB,start_chat

72,471,24,2,Can you take a look at Exhibit 3. Is that the most current version of your CV?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
73,474,24,5,"Yes.  Yes, correct. And in 2004, I arrived into the U.S. and I was appointed at UCLA as a -- at the time, the job description was as a professional engineer, which then evolved into a professorship as an adjunct associate professor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,480,24,11,And so you've been an associate professor at UCLA for how long?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
75,482,24,13,That lasted from 2004 through 2015.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,483,24,14,Okay.  And then what happened after 2015?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
77,484,24,15,"After 2015 -- 2014, 2015 time, so there was some overlap -- we were developing some technology with the semiconducting industry in the U.S., names such as Intel, IBM, and we worked on a certain specific technology related to telecommunications and we raised some venture funding, and we transferred that technology from the university to a startup company in Los Angeles.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,492,24,23,"So in the 11 years that you were an associate professor, did you work on any sensor technologies?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
79,496,25,1,"Yes.  During that period, I parented a very important sensor with BASF, one of the premier chemical materials companies in Europe, with a colleague of mine that at the time was working on campus at UCLA. I collaborated with numerous professors at UCLA on sensor technology, and some of that technology was published with various professors. And actually, we leveraged that technology into a very -- a different application, as I mentioned, in telecommunications.  So the same technology we were developing for sensing gas toxic detection, we leveraged for a different application.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,509,25,14,But were you doing anything related to gas sensing between 2004 and 2015?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
81,511,25,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,512,25,17,And were any of those efforts directed to carbon monoxide sensors?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
83,514,25,19,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,515,25,20,And then in 2015 you became a technologist of the school of engineering and school of technology at UCLA?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
85,518,25,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,519,25,24,And what's a technologist?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
87,520,25,25,"So at the time in 2014, I went to Carbonics as the CEO.  It was a full-time position while my professorship was still valid at UCLA. When that diminished and sun set, I was converted over to a technologist and I was part of an affiliation with the school of engineering, and that allowed me to continue to write proposals, obtain funding for various activities, one being I was coordinating working groups in nanotechnology for a certain conference, and that allowed me to obtain funding from the National Science Foundation and still be involved in some academic activity whilst I was at Carbonics full time as CEO.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,534,26,13,"And Carbonics, what does it do?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
89,535,26,14,"As I mentioned, the objective of Carbonics is to commercialize next-generation telecommunication technology, using the work and the technology we invented during my time at UCLA.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,539,26,18,Does that work involve extending battery life and things like that?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
91,541,26,20,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,542,26,21,"That's a favorite topic of mine. What kind of batteries, just out of curiosity?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
93,545,26,24,"Well, what we did at Carbonics is we're not specifically involving the battery problem; we are producing transistors and circuitry that is much more efficient that can extend the life of batteries.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,551,27,4,"Okay.  And then at some point in 2016, you became a researcher with UCLA?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
95,553,27,6,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,554,27,7,Tell me what that's about.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
97,555,27,8,"Not much different to a technologist. It's again a non-paid position, it's an affiliation, and that continued allowing me to submit proposals as a non-paid affiliate of UCLA.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,559,27,12,"Okay.  At some point, you were -- you got involved in a company called Forensic, Forensics LLC?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
99,562,27,15,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,563,27,16,From 2000 to the present?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
101,564,27,17,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,565,27,18,And what does Forensics LLC do?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
103,566,27,19,"Over the period of working on carbon monoxide cases that began in 2012 with the Saba case, I was exposed and reenergized my interest in sensing technology, or I should say further emphasizing the importance of that in my brain capacity. And in 2018, again working with various cases in carbon monoxide, I saw an opportunity where low-level carbon monoxide detection is required, and with that entity, I began commercializing various carbon monoxide detector products.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,578,28,5,What sort of products?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
105,579,28,6,"A key product is a low-level carbon monoxide detector specifically for pilots, for aircraft application, and it's -- there's a need, a need where you're in a small volume of space or an automobile or an aircraft and there is a leak coming from somewhere, some situation is going on, and occupants, such as moms and dads and other people concerned about their health, typically purchase these products and they monitor the environment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
106,588,28,15,And this is specific to carbon monoxide or other types of gases as well?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
107,590,28,17,"At the moment, my focus -- when we began in 2018, the focus was specifically on carbon monoxide, but then I saw a demand for other toxic gases, such as ammonia, nitrogen dioxide and others.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,594,28,21,And you said this was a low-level detector. What do you mean by that?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
109,597,28,24,"So the definition of low level basically means one will be alarmed of carbon monoxide at a low level.  Low level is less than 70 parts per minute.  There's a demand -- a lot of people, again, as I mentioned, folks driving vehicles, flying planes and others, believe that being alarmed at 70 parts per million following the UL 2034 protocol from 60 to 240 parts per million is not adequate enough.  And there is --",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
110,607,29,8,I think you may have misspoke.  Minutes instead of parts per million?,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
111,609,29,10,Minutes.  60 to 240 minutes. Did I say parts per million?  I apologize. So there is a -- there are a group of people that believe that is not adequate so there is a demand.  There is a market demand for low-level carbon monoxide detectors.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,616,29,17,"Okay.  Now, you mentioned the Saba case, and that's listed in your list of cases as well. Can you tell me a little bit about that case?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
113,620,29,21,"That was a situation where it was a home in Arizona, and the -- both gas burning appliances, the boiler and the furnace, were located in a small, confined cabinet.  And what was occurring was a backdraft situation where when the furnace was on and the water heater was on, it would suck in the exhaust coming out from the boiler, the hot water system, and in that situation, it was polluting and it was polluting the inhabitants of the home.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,630,30,5,Approximately what levels of carbon monoxide?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
115,632,30,7,I don't recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,633,30,8,Was it what you would consider acute?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
117,634,30,9,I don't recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,635,30,10,Were there any immediate injuries requiring hospitalization of the persons exposed?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
119,637,30,12,I don't recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,638,30,13,Okay.  Did you do any sort of modeling analysis on that case?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
121,640,30,15,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,641,30,16,Can you tell me a little bit about that modeling analysis?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
123,643,30,18,"That modeling -- that modeling analysis was undertaken what we call based on a mass balance model.  I employed software that's readily available from the EPA to undertake that analysis, and that analysis determined what a typical carbon monoxide profile would look like in a residence over a period of time.  I believe that period of time was over a 24-hour period, if I recall correctly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,652,31,1,And based on that model you were able to draw some conclusions?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
125,654,31,3,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,655,31,4,And those conclusions were what?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
127,656,31,5,"If I recall correctly, the conclusion was that the occupants were mostly being poisoned with carbon monoxide in the evening hours when in bed, and the ventilation system was very close, in close proximity to the inhabitants lying in bed, which, in that situation, evoked a proximity situation where the carbon monoxide was not diluting and was being blown straight into the inhabitants' space.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
128,664,31,13,Okay.  And did you perform any air flow calculations?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
129,666,31,15,"I believe I did not.  I believe I obtained those inflow calculations from the appliances, and then we input values into my model, and we made some assumptions with regards to the air flow and exchange ventilation of the home.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
130,671,31,20,And did you also with the model determine what the ambient concentration of the enclosed area was within that home?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
131,674,31,23,"Correct.  We developed a profile of carbon monoxide with time of what that looked like, given their daily routine within the home and some assumptions around their behaviors.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
132,679,32,2,And what were the assumptions?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
133,680,32,3,"The assumptions were lengthy, but they considered --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
134,682,32,5,Let me just --,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
135,683,32,6,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,684,32,7,Were the assumptions related to the behavior of the occupants?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
137,686,32,9,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,687,32,10,Okay.  I'm not interested in that.  Okay. Did you use carbon monoxide concentration measurements for the carbon monoxide being discharged from the offending devices?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
139,691,32,14,"Can you rephrase the question, please?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,692,32,15,Did you measure the level of carbon monoxide being released from the two devices that you mentioned?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
141,695,32,18,I personally did not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
142,696,32,19,Okay.  Were measurements of carbon monoxide releases made?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
143,698,32,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
144,699,32,22,What sort of measurements were those?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
145,700,32,23,"They were emission flue gas measurements, COAF measurements, to be specific.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
146,702,32,25,Okay.  And did you perform a similar sort of analysis in this case?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
147,705,33,2,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
148,706,33,3,Okay.  So you did not do a mass balance in this case?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
149,708,33,5,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
150,709,33,6,You did not do any sort of modeling in this case?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
151,711,33,8,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
152,712,33,9,And you did not use the EPA software to assess what the exposure would be to the individuals in this case?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
153,715,33,12,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
154,716,33,13,And what's the EPA model?  Can I have the name for that?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
155,718,33,15,The name I believe is IAQX.  It's again a mass balance model.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
156,720,33,17,And why did you choose not to do such an analysis in this case?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_chat
157,722,33,19,Objection; form.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
158,723,33,20,"In this case -- well, let me start again.  In the Saba case, I undertook a model effort because the defect and the situation was changed.  They repaired the problem, and I was not able to go in and take measurements of the ambient environment.  That is the preferred modus operandi. The second is if that situation has changed, which it did, then I would take whatever parameters are available and I would put together a model with some assumptions based on interviews, et cetera, and various data points. In this case, measurements were made onsite, on location, and in my mind, that is the gold standard in terms of having the subject appliance, in this case, the subject of an at-hand for measurements to be taken, hence, not requiring a modeling effort.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,741,34,12,So it's your view that measurements on the subject oven in this case were taken; correct?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
160,743,34,14,Can you rephrase the question?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,744,34,15,It is your view that the measurements of carbon monoxide level from the subject oven in this case were taken; correct?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
162,747,34,18,"I believe the measurements taken on September the 21st and 22nd reflect, in some limited capacity, based on the testing on the days, the carbon monoxide increase within the bake chamber.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,751,34,22,Okay.  And that you considered was adequate data to render whatever opinions you have been engaged to render?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_chat
164,754,34,25,"Objection; argumentative, misstates the entirety of the testimony.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat

791,2037,84,8,"Simply because the origins of the definition and the use of COAF was developed early in the 20th century for that exact purpose where the impetus was on the human health aspects of occupants of an enclosed space reaching and exposed to 100 parts per million within a one-hour period. And what they did when they were developing this methodology of COAF measurements was to look at the human health aspects based on this 100 parts per million over a one-hour period that they deemed to be inappropriate, and they backward engineered the circumstances and the flu emissions to come up with a COAF that would produce in a certain volume of space, given certain assumptions, an amount of flue gas, COAF, that would then occur in the ambient up to 100 parts per million for one hour. So the point here is, the historic evolution of COAF or the origin of COAF has actual roots and impetus and motivation from a human health standpoint which, on Page 2, Paragraph 8, says the total polar opposite.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1001,2561,104,12,"I believe it was taken out of operation in the 2010 time frame.  So, yeah, that actually changes the equation.  So it would have been operating for about 13 or so years.  That's correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1011,2585,105,10,Not that I believe.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1012,2586,105,11,You did not look at the bake chamber or any of the other components?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

1019,2597,105,22,"It operates like pretty much most furnaces operate where there is a burner, a blower, a heat exchanger, a convection fan that blows air through the heat exchanger to move and circulate and heat up the air.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1020,2603,106,2,You mean around the heat --,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1021,2604,106,3,"Around the heat exchanger, that's correct. So that function of combustion, fossil fuel combustion to exchanging that energy or that heat to an ambient environment or, in this case, an oven environment, is fairly well understood by myself.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1022,2609,106,8,"Okay.  And so this particular oven, it has a bake chamber to the right-hand side; is that right?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

1034,2628,107,1,And what's the function of the blow motor?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1035,2629,107,2,To move air into the area of combustion.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1036,2630,107,3,So to provide combustion air?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

1045,2650,107,23,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1046,2651,107,24,"Okay.  And then from the burner, there is a combustion chamber; is that correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1047,2654,108,1,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1048,2655,108,2,That's where the flame comes out?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1049,2656,108,3,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1050,2657,108,4,And what's past the combustion chamber?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1051,2658,108,5,"There is a combustion chamber.  Then I believe there is a box, and then that goes into a serpentine structure that I believe there are a number of tubes that try and increase the surface area, so when there is flow external to the heat exchanger, it can heat up the environmental air circulating.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1052,2665,108,12,Okay.  And the heat exchanger is connected to a flue?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1053,2667,108,14,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1054,2668,108,15,Okay.  And what's the primary function of the flue?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1055,2670,108,17,"The primary function of the flue is to redirect toxic gas, combustion byproducts, combustion of flue gas to an outdoor environment where it is safe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1056,2674,108,21,Okay.  And then you talked about air being circulated around the heat exchanger. How is that done?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1057,2677,108,24,I believe that's done by a convection fan or blower of some type so that the internal air of the bake chamber can heat up.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1058,2681,109,2,And do you know the rate of capacity of that convection fan?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

1070,2703,109,24,Can you rephrase that question?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1071,2704,109,25,Have you looked at the manner in which the air flows inside the bake chamber with the compromised heat exchanger?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1072,2708,110,3,"Other than looking at an animation that I've seen provided to me and also looking at the massive gorges of the heat exchange, I haven't undertaken an analytical numerical analysis.  No, I have not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1448,3683,147,16,"Getting back to Vent 1, you make a notation here which says Vent 1, 20 inches by 20 inches, and then you've got something in parentheticals. What is that?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1449,3688,147,21,"So Vent 1, 20 by 20 is the physical diameter of the vent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1450,3690,147,23,You mean physical dimension of the vent?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1451,3691,147,24,"Dimension of the vent, that's correct. And I have in parentheses, air from .3, forward arrows .7 meters per second.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1452,3695,148,2,What does that mean?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1453,3696,148,3,So that means that I measured air flow of that vent in that range.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1454,3698,148,5,And what does that match?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1455,3699,148,6,Meters per second.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1456,3700,148,7,Meters per second. So are we to understand that the air flow from Vent 1 when you measured it ranged between .3 and .7 meters per second?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1457,3704,148,11,"My measurement range, that range, because there are sitting grills on the vent and that was the range that I measured.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1458,3707,148,14,Is this air going out of the vent or into the vent?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1459,3709,148,16,Out of the vent.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1460,3710,148,17,So this is air blowing out of the vent?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1461,3711,148,18,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1462,3712,148,19,And how did you take this measurement?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1463,3713,148,20,Using my handheld air flow meter.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1464,3714,148,21,Let me -- I'm trying to look for something here.  Give me one second.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1465,3716,148,23,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,is brackets
1466,3717,148,24,"(Whereupon, there was a brief pause in the proceedings.)",brackets,,start_question
1467,3721,149,2,"Now, did you measure the air flow at just one spot, or did you measure them at multiple spots of the vent?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1468,3724,149,5,"So each vent was measured at multiple spots, locations of the same vent; hence, I have the range that I obtained.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1469,3727,149,8,Okay.  And then for Vent 2 you did the same thing?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1470,3729,149,10,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1471,3730,149,11,And you got a range of air flows from 0 to .3 meters per second?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1472,3732,149,13,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1473,3733,149,14,Okay.  And was this when the HVAC system was cycling on and off?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1474,3735,149,16,The HVAC system was on and I have no reason to believe it was off.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1475,3737,149,18,"Okay.  You're getting a value of 0 for Vent 2, and then I presume at some point you got a value of .3.",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1476,3740,149,21,"It was momentarily.  As I was moving past the grill, it would register, because it was -- the grill is, as you can see from the photographs, blocking the little spindles on the fan from fanning, so you have to adjust it to obtain some operation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1477,3747,150,2,"Okay.  So you could have the same vent, but you could get different values by the manner in which you're holding the apparatus to the vent; is that correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1478,3751,150,6,"Effectively, yes; hence, that range of values is noted here (indicating).",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1479,3753,150,8,Okay.  So at Vent 3 you say air is equal to 0. So you got no air flow through Vent 3?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1480,3756,150,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1481,3757,150,12,"Now, are these vents interconnected, do you know?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1482,3759,150,14,I don't know.  I didn't inspect the internals.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1483,3761,150,16,So you didn't go up past the roof to look at the way in which the venting was connected?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1484,3763,150,18,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1485,3764,150,19,"And then at Vent 4, you call it the Return. What does that mean?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1486,3767,150,22,"That is a return vent.  It's a larger vent that pulls air in, and the data for that, as we can see on Page 4 of Exhibit 18, specifically the last three digits of the bottom left, or let's say bottom right, Picture 136, has an air flow, a return air flow of 2 meters per second.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1487,3774,151,3,Which means it's air flowing from the bakery into the vent?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1488,3776,151,5,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1489,3777,151,6,"The other three we looked at, air flow was flowing from the vents into the bakery?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1490,3779,151,8,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1491,3780,151,9,Okay.  And at Vent 3 you got no air flow; correct?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1492,3782,151,11,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1493,3783,151,12,"And at Vent 4 you got a return, but you haven't noted what the air flow is?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1494,3785,151,14,"I haven't; however, the photographs have that data on there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1495,3787,151,16,Which is 20 --,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1496,3788,151,17,"I see 2.0 meters per second, and the other photograph ending with 130 and 144, I cannot make out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1497,3791,151,20,"In other words, Vent 4 is pulling a lot more air out than Vents 1, 2 and 3 are pushing in; is that correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1498,3794,151,23,"If I was to take 136 as the intake at 2 meters per second, summate the four vents, there is a gap of some amount of flow.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1499,3798,152,1,"So it's almost double -- it is double, isn't it?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1500,3800,152,3,"It is double; however, I'm not sure if there are other vents that were drawing up air using the same system of return.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1501,3803,152,6,"And to the bottom right of the figure, you've got a fifth box, and that says Return. What is that?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1502,3806,152,9,"So that is the return vent, 21 1/2 by 21 1/2 return vent at the bottom.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1503,3808,152,11,And then what is Vent 4 --,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1504,3809,152,12,The discrepancy.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1505,3810,152,13,-- return?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1506,3811,152,14,There must be another vent that was missed.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1507,3813,152,16,"So clarify that for me.  So you're saying there are four vents that are blowing in air, and there is one vent sucking in air; is that right?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1508,3816,152,19,"I believe so, but Vent 4 that's blowing out air, the Vent 4 that is presumably blowing out air, I haven't noted its flow rate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1509,3819,152,22,"Yeah, but you pointed to the picture and said it's 2.0.",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1510,3821,152,24,That was for the return.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1511,3822,152,25,But you said -- Vent 4 you then noted in the parentheticals that it is a return.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1512,3825,153,2,That should not be Vent 4 there.  That must be a typo.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1513,3827,153,4,So what do you think is the correct -- what should have been the correct notation there?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1514,3829,153,6,Vent 4 should equal whatever the diameter of the vent is -- I didn't know that -- and the flow rate.  I must have missed it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1515,3832,153,9,Okay.  So you're saying Vent 4 is not a return but the return really is the one to the bottom right; is that right?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1516,3835,153,12,"Seems to be the case, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1517,3836,153,13,Okay.  And you don't have the flow data for Vent 4?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1518,3838,153,15,That seems to be the case.  That correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1519,3839,153,16,"Now, did you use this data in any way?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1520,3840,153,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1521,3841,153,18,Why?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1522,3842,153,19,"If I'm going to an inspection, I typically do that so I don't have to come again and retake, but given that I missed that, I would have had to return if I had to do any analysis regarding air flow.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1523,3847,153,24,"Now, did you do a calculation of the air change rate for this bakery?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1524,3850,154,1,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1525,3851,154,2,And so you're saying the only reason you have this data is that on inspections as a matter of course you generate data such as this; is that correct?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1526,3855,154,6,"Knowing what I knew about the situation where there was a subject oven in a bakery space, I had my air flow meter with me, I had my tape measure with me.  The subject oven wasn't there, so I chose to obtain as much information as possible from the environment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1527,3861,154,12,But you're not using this data for your opinions?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1528,3863,154,14,I have not used this data for my opinions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1529,3864,154,15,"Now, have you looked at dimensions that others who have done previous inspections of the bakery have reported on the dimension of the bakery?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1530,3867,154,18,Of the bakery itself?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1531,3868,154,19,Yes.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1532,3869,154,20,"I know on the day there were other photos taken with measurements.  I've used that to determine the distance of certain key locations such as a co detector, where it was stored in the drawer, cabinet, such as opposite the oven on the wall distance.  But other than that, I haven't analyzed other information.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1533,3877,155,2,"Now, who are the others recording dimension information?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1534,3879,155,4,I believe there was another gentleman on this same day that I mentioned that took the roll call.  I think he may have taken some measurements and I used these pictures that he took.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1535,3883,155,8,"Ah.  Now, where are those pictures?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1536,3884,155,9,"They are somewhere in my file, I believe.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1537,3885,155,10,I don't think we've seen those pictures.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

1546,3898,155,23,Yes.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_question
1547,3900,155,25,And you reviewed those pictures for what purpose?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1548,3903,156,2,"As I said, to understand the distance of -- distance from the subject oven, again, from to the wall where Julie Lee mentioned that she plugged it in in February of 2009 and the distance to where she mentioned she placed it in a cabinet or a drawer and to understand those locations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1549,3909,156,8,"Okay.  Now, if you will flip Exhibit 17 to the reverse side, there's another sketch that has been drawn. Who made that sketch?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1550,3913,156,12,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1554,3918,156,17,"The bakery -- okay.  This is a sketch of the bakery, but it's not the full bakery.  It's part of the bakery.  There's a funny wall piece that disembarks different color tile, and I just mapped out that piece of the bakery which, if you can see on the first page of Exhibit 17, has like a -- somewhat of a kink.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1556,3926,156,25,The top middle side.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1557,3928,157,1,Okay.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1558,3929,157,2,"So, effectively, this is the magnification of that space.  And I have taken those points, random points in that space to analyze the air flow with my meter.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1559,3933,157,6,"Okay.  Now, this magnified spot that you're talking about, is it to the front of the bakery or the back of the bakery?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1560,3936,157,9,It's toward the front of the bakery.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1561,3937,157,10,So this is the customer-facing side?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1562,3938,157,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1563,3939,157,12,Okay.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

1565,3943,157,16,"Okay.  So you've got three points here, Point A, Point B and Point C. What do they depict?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1566,3946,157,19,"They depict effectively what I'm doing with these photographs over here on Exhibit 18, Page Number 5, and it shows the locations.  I'm not sure if the photos corroborate these points, but it shows the time of taking an air flow measurement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1567,3951,157,24,"So, essentially, this location is from the bakery looking out into the store; is that correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1568,3954,158,1,"You're referring to Exhibit 17, Page 2?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1570,3956,158,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1571,3957,158,4,And what did you determine from your air flow measurements of those three points?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1572,3959,158,6,"The air flow was zero meters per second, and that's basically it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1573,3961,158,8,"So for all three points, the air flow was 0 meters per second?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1574,3963,158,10,"That's what the meter was reading, correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1575,3965,158,12,And what does that mean to you?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1576,3966,158,13,It means at that specific point there was 0 meters per second flowing through my meter.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1577,3968,158,15,And would that mean that there is zero air flowing into the bakery or out of the bakery?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1578,3970,158,17,I would not describe it that way.  I would describe it as at that point that there was no air flow at that specific absolute location of the bakery.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1579,3974,158,21,"Okay.  So at that point in time, there was no air flow when you measured it at Point A, B and C?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1580,3977,158,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1581,3978,158,25,But you're not saying one way or the other whether air flows into the bakery or air flows out of the bakery or if it's static?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1582,3982,159,3,"I didn't undertake that analysis because one would have to do a lot more work to conclude if it's moving in, moving out.  But as a -- as a -- how can I put it. I noticed -- I actually felt that there was no air flow.  It felt somewhat stagnant.  I can definitely testify to that.  And I think the points that I mention here shows that. So it wasn't a surprise to me to feel that it was stagnant and to have the actual data that it was stagnant.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1597,4019,160,14,Can you rephrase the question?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1598,4020,160,15,Would you need to calibrate the air flow meter before making measurements?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1599,4022,160,17,"I'm not sure if it's in the instruction manual to do so, but possibly.  Actually, one should calibrate most instruments before they attempt an experiment for an analysis like this to have maximum accuracy as possible.  But in this case, I did not calibrate this, nor do I believe it was -- there were instructions to do so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1667,4201,167,14,"As I'm looking at the data here, that's correct.  All I can conclude from this area of his Page 1 is that the 218 COAF is from the Testo because I know for a fact that the monoxor detector he used does not calculate COAF.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

1933,4948,196,7,The folks that you just mentioned.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1934,4949,196,8,That neither Durazo nor Gumbert had an analyzer?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1935,4951,196,10,Correct.  That's my understanding.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1936,4952,196,11,Your understanding of the testimony is that the only people who had carbon monoxide measuring devices were Bertoch and Brignola?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1937,4955,196,14,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1938,4956,196,15,And Brignola brought the Testo and the Bacharach device and Bertoch brought the Q-Trak device?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1939,4959,196,18,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1940,4960,196,19,And the 25M PPM and 239 PPM COAF is the Brignola data that you're relying on in your declaration?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1941,4963,196,22,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1942,4964,196,23,"Okay.  And that data was generated on September 21st, is your opinion?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1943,4966,196,25,"That, I believe, is fairly certain, based on his testimony.  And also we have another data set that he produced from the second day of testing that also we received higher COAF measurements, so...",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1944,4971,197,4,"Let's go to that.  That's Exhibit 13. Now, I confess I've never seen this before so we'll have to do it live here, and I need your help knowing what you understand this data set to mean to you. So there are ten data points in this spreadsheet; correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1945,4978,197,11,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1946,4979,197,12,And these were data points generated by Brignola?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

1961,5017,198,24,"Okay.  Now, let me try to understand what these column headings are. Do you have an understanding as to what these column headings are?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1962,5022,199,3,"I believe most of them, yes.  I believe most of them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1963,5024,199,5,"Well, can you tell me what the second column heading is?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1964,5026,199,7,"Sure.  That's cut off, so that's probably the only one that I'm not familiar with.  Set, Run, Tim.  It's missing an ""e,"" possibly, but again, I can't speculate because there's no other word after that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1965,5031,199,12,Could it mean second run time?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1966,5032,199,13,"It could, but I don't know what the definition of that is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1967,5034,199,15,"Okay.  Well, what about the next column?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1968,5035,199,16,"That is Tstack, which represents temperature of the stack; that is, of the actual measured gas coming from the thermocouple at the end of the probe of the Testo.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1969,5039,199,20,So this is the temperature probe of the Testo measuring the temperature of the gas that it's measuring?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1970,5042,199,23,"Or its environment, correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1971,5043,199,24,Okay.  And then percentage Co2.  That's obvious.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1972,5046,200,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1973,5047,200,2,And then the next one is percentage EFF. Do you know what that means?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1974,5049,200,4,"Yes.  The objective of most combustion analyzers is to determine the efficiency of a furnace, so the user places various parameters within that, and the calculation of percent efficiency is given to the user.  So that is what it's logging, based on the input parameters, which is temperature, carbon monoxide, COAF and oxygen.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1975,5056,200,11,"Now, the next column, percentage ExAir. What's that?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1976,5058,200,13,That is the excess air column.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1977,5059,200,14,Okay.  And the next one is percentage of oxygen?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1978,5061,200,16,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1979,5062,200,17,The next one is carbon monoxide ambient?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1980,5063,200,18,That's carbon monoxide as measured.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1981,5064,200,19,As measured.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1982,5065,200,20,That's correct.  That's coming -- that's the raw carbon monoxide value coming from a CO sensor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1983,5068,200,23,"And then the next one is the air-fee carbon monoxide, which is a calculated number; correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1984,5072,201,1,"Yes.  That is calculated based on the CO and the o2 sensor, which provides the air-free, undiluted measurement of the carbon monoxide, which is the absolute carbon monoxide that is in the sample of the gas.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1985,5077,201,6,"Okay.  Now, how do you know if the COAF is computed using CO and o2 and not CO and Co2?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1986,5079,201,8,So the way I understand the Testo runs and operates is that it undertakes a calculation to determine the Co2.  It's inferring a Co2 based on some assumptions the meter has set up to undertake.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1987,5083,201,12,"Okay.  So the Co2 percentage is also a calculated number, is what you're saying?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1988,5085,201,14,"I believe so.  I believe so.  That occurs in a number of combustion analyzers, and I believe that is what is occurring with the Testo.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1989,5088,201,17,"Okay.  Now, are any of the columns after that relevant to our discussion?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_chat
1990,5090,201,19,"Argumentative, vague and ambiguous.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
1991,5092,201,21,"Well, I can tell you what they are.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
1992,5095,201,24,Okay.  Go ahead.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1993,5096,201,25,"It's T ambient, which is the ambient temperature as measured -- again, I haven't read the manual fully, but I'm assuming it is of the environment where the analyzer is placed, the handheld part of the analyzer.  And the instrument is of the internals of the analyzer itself to ensure that it's not overheating as we are placing -- sucking hot air from a certain location.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1994,5105,202,8,Okay.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1995,5106,202,9,"Again, that's the way I interpret this, and there may be a mistake here or there, but in the whole, I believe that that is correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1996,5109,202,12,"Okay.  Now, let's talk about each of these ten data points. Do you have an understanding as to where these ten data points were taken from?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1997,5113,202,16,"I believe -- okay.  So I believe I would look at this in two -- two steps. One is the 10:33 time stamp, which is the first row to the third row, which is 10:42.  That's about nine minutes.  And I'm understanding that to be the first test of the day starting up the oven from a cold state, and as we discussed a moment ago that both of these are probing under the door. That's the way I'm interpreting these data in these tests.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
1998,5124,203,1,And what makes you believe that it's the oven in the cold state?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
1999,5126,203,3,"Well, first of all, the temperature draw in at the bottom of the door is fairly low, so one could infer at that point in time it's close to ambient, and I believe there is some notes -- let me just have a quick look here -- and that it's the first log of the data sequence.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2000,5132,203,9,"Now, are you relying on any of these three data points for your opinions?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2001,5134,203,11,"As it currently stands, it actually further enhances my opinions, especially the third row where we see a COAF measured up to 249, which is actually higher than we had from the previous day.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2002,5138,203,15,And you are relying on that number?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2003,5139,203,16,"I'm relying on the whole data set, everything we have here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2004,5141,203,18,"Now, do you consider the first three data points to be valid data points?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2005,5143,203,20,I have no reason not to.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2006,5144,203,21,You testified that the first three data points represents a cold state of the oven. Is it appropriate to be taking measurements when the oven is in its cold state?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2007,5148,203,25,"Well, the oven is emitting carbon monoxide.  The oven is depleting oxygen.  The oven is increasing in temperature. So the burner is functioning.  It's reading flue gases in the bake chamber, which confirms the heat exchanger at this point is being breached. And we have three time stamps and data points of -- and we see an increase in COAF.  So that's how I interpret these three data points.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2008,5159,204,10,"Now, the third data point, this seems to be a large excess of air and a very large amount of carbon -- I mean a large amount of oxygen, but very low carbon dioxide. Do you have any explanation for that?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2009,5164,204,15,"Explanation for what exactly, the COAF value or --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2010,5166,204,17,Yes.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2011,5167,204,18,"The COAF is calculated.  We have excess here that's diluting the carbon monoxide, so to compensate for that, you have to compensate for the large excess air.  Per the equation, the COAF has increased. And that's interesting because the temperature is increasing, and as we could see, there is no -- given the time stamps that we're seeing, it's two minutes and then seven minutes, so we're having data being recorded at not even intervals, so we're seeing the oven operating -- again, the features are increasing in temperature and increasing in carbon monoxide air-free.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2012,5181,205,6,"Now, did Brignola take these measurements at randomly-selected points in time?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2013,5183,205,8,It seems to be the case.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2014,5184,205,9,So it's not log-in data; he's just taking random data points?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2015,5186,205,11,It seems to be the case.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2016,5187,205,12,So he seems to be taking manual data points in this data set?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2017,5189,205,14,I believe so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2018,5190,205,15,And do we have any idea at what point in the basic cycle he's taking these data points?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_chat
2019,5192,205,17,Asked and answered.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
2020,5193,205,18,"I believe, looking at the first three points, it must be during the burner on, given that the temperature is increasing.  So that's my inference from looking at the data.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

2031,5221,206,20,I didn't see that information.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2035,5228,207,1,"Can you repeat the question, please?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2036,5229,207,2,Was it on the Testo device that this data was recorded?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2037,5231,207,4,I believe it was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2038,5232,207,5,Okay.  And then what about Data Points 4 to 10. Where was the probe when those data points were taken?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2039,5236,207,9,"I know sometime, by reading the testimony that on the second day, the probe was placed through the door, so I would have to -- let me just double check Burtoch's notes. I would have to assume that sometime afterwards, which is 90 minutes or so, which would give them enough time to drill a hole and place their equipment and set it up again, that -- that the probe was placed through the door.  I know it occurred.  I saw pictures of it.  So I believe that could be the case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2047,5266,208,13,I believe that's what occurred.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2048,5267,208,14,Okay.  And what observations have you made with respect to Data Points 4 through 10?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

2204,5674,224,5,"This statement means that the sensor, the concentration that it reads, would have an accuracy of plus minus 3 percent of its reading.  So, for example, if we are reading 100 PPM, it could be either 103 PPM or 97 PPM at its calibrated temperature. So if one is to calibrate this detector at room temperature, 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and you were taking a measurement at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, you would only be considering the plus minus 3 percent accuracy. However, if one is increasing or elevating the temperature of operation, you must add .28 percent of your reading in addition to the 3 percent, .28 percent per Fahrenheit that is elevated above the calibrated temperature. So if one again is taking a measurement at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and it has been calibrated at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, one would have to undertake a calculation.  The difference in temperature is 30. One would times that by .28, add plus 3 and then you will have your percent accuracy that you would work with.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

2210,5710,225,15,"Sure.  So the difference in temperature is important.  In your example, the one that I've put forward, the difference is 30 degrees Fahrenheit, 100 minus 70.  30 degrees times .28, that is nearly 10-ish.  10 percent plus 3, that equals 13 percent. Again, ballpark figures. So when we have our measurement at 100 degrees Fahrenheit -- again, let's assume it's a hundred parts per minute -- one would have to assume that the possible ranges is not 100 PPM, although it may be, but it can vary up to 100 PPM times 13 percent, which is 113 or 100 minus 13, which is 87.  So that would be the range one would be looking at in that situation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2304,5942,234,13,"First and foremost that the temperature is increasing.  So we see that trend.  That's basically all I can conclude from the temperature reading.

2305,5949,234,20,And what's the oven set to?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

2310,5957,235,2,Okay.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2311,5959,235,4,So you're looking at Brignola's notes for Bertoch's data?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2312,5961,235,6,"I'm trying to see the start test period of the 22nd, if there is any sign. So in Mr. Brignola's notes, he has Test-1. And again, I am assuming that the start sequence is the same start sequence as Mr. Bertoch's, and he has the T column constant at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, that may have been the temperature set for the start sequence of the 22nd of September, but again, reading their testimonies, I don't recall at this point in time that was the case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2313,5971,235,16,"But looking at Brignola's data for Test 1, it seems to be that the oven temperature is set to 400 degrees Fahrenheit; is that right?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2314,5974,235,19,It seems to be the case.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2315,5975,235,20,So would it be reasonable to believe that the temperature setting for the Data Points 0 to 19 are with the oven set at 400 degrees Fahrenheit; is that correct?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2316,5979,235,24,"In addition to Mr. Bertoch's marks, 375 to 400, that is possible.  I'm not sure.  I'm not certain of that, but that is possible.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2317,5983,236,2,Okay.  But you're not 100 percent certain whether it's 375 or 400 that Mr. Bertoch took his data at?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2318,5986,236,5,That's the way I'm reading it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2319,5987,236,6,We'll have to infer from Mr. Brignola's notes and say that it could be 400 but we're not sure.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2320,5990,236,9,I would agree with that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2321,5991,236,10,"Okay.  Now, we've talked previously about the temperature of the oven as measured by Mr. Brignola's as 292, but we're not seeing internal temperatures anywhere near that range for Data Points 0 to 19. Do you have a view as to why that is?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2322,5997,236,16,"The 292, can you refresh my mind where that is?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2323,5999,236,18,This is in Mr. Brignola's notes.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2324,6000,236,19,"Yes, I see it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2325,6001,236,20,Okay.  So the temperature as measured here for the same set of data points is less than half of what they measured as the inside temperature of the oven with Brignola's Testo device. So my question to you was:  Do you have a view as to why the temperatures are so much lower with the Q-Trak device?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_chat
2326,6009,237,2,"Objection; vague and ambiguous, assumes facts, incomplete hypothetical.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
2327,6011,237,4,I don't -- I'm not certain why that's the case.  I can only assume that it has to do with the design of the probe and where the thermocouple is located within the TSI probe and within the combustion analyzer probe.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2328,6017,237,10,"In the combustion analyzer probe, do you know where the three sensors are located, the temperature, the carbon monoxide and the oxygen sensors are located?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2329,6021,237,14,"I've never used the Testo 330-2, the subject Testo that we're referring to.  I have used a Bacharach combustion analyzer and, typically, the sensors CO and o2 are within the instrument, and the thermocouple or temperature sensor is on the end of the probe of the combustion analyzer, and it's exposed.  It's an exposed element, so that the combustion analyzer can detect temperature as close as possible to the sample gas, unlike the TSI, which has more plastic protection just visibly looking at it for everyday use. So again, I would have to assume that it would be a dynamic situation where there's probably more packaging around the thermocouple of the TSI sensor than the Testo.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2330,6037,238,4,"So you're saying that due to the packaging of the Q-Trak sensor, the temperature probe is unable to measure the temperature of the environment it is in?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_chat
2331,6041,238,8,"Objection; misstates the testimony.  It assumes facts.  It's an incomplete hypothetical.  It assumes that the 292 is from a thermocouple, not from the measured temperature on the oven.",side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
2332,6046,238,13,That's not what I said. It's just a matter of time.  It may take a little longer for the TSI to measure that temperature than a combustion analyzer temperature for a thermocouple would.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
2333,6052,238,19,"So, say, for example, the 10th data point on your sheet, it's recording a temperature of 85. Is it fair to say that that data point is being measured ten minutes into the test cycle?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2334,6056,238,23,"I'm not sure exactly when they started this data log and when they turned on the oven, so I can't give you a definitive answer to that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2345,6082,239,23,"Okay.  Regardless, by the time the 10th data point was taken, is it fair to say that the oven was running for ten minutes?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2346,6086,240,1,I don't have the time stamp of when the oven begun for me to answer that question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2347,6088,240,3,Okay.,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2348,6089,240,4,"So in that question you're assuming both were turned on simultaneously, the logging and the oven, and I don't see any data that I can infer that that is the case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2364,6135,241,24,"The data set that we have before us communicate to me that there is an increase in temperature at a certain period of time. It also tells me there's an increase in carbon monoxide and an increase in carbon dioxide. So exactly when that process, the combustion process begins is unknown exactly at the minute where that begins.  It could be at 2; it could be at negative 2; it could be at 0.  We do not have that time stamp to superimpose when the oven was turned on with this data set.  I have not seen it.  I have not seen it.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

2368,6153,242,16,Absolutely.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2369,6154,242,17,Why do you say absolutely?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2370,6155,242,18,"Because we have three markers of combustion.  One is an increase in temperature, an increase in carbon monoxide and an increase in carbon dioxide.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2373,6162,242,25,Do you think that's the accurate reflection of the temperature of the air that's being sampled at that point?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2374,6166,243,3,"That is the reflection of the air touching the thermocouple of the IAQ, and I believe it's in close distance to the carbon monoxide sensor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2375,6169,243,6,Okay.  But that temperature is reflective of what?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2376,6171,243,8,Of what the carbon monoxide sensor of the TSI Q-Trak is feeling or sensing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2384,6188,243,25,"Again, given the design of the probe and the intention of the designers to reflect the temperature, it would definitely be in close proximity to the CO detector, because that is indeed its function, to represent the temperature of the sample gas which -- what does the sampling, what does the sampling is the CO and Co2 sensors. So it would -- again, as an engineer, as a designer, it would make good sense to me that they're in good proximity, and I believe that would be the case.  I've seen no other data to tell me otherwise.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2385,6201,244,12,"Okay.  And why doesn't this temperature, that's the 85 degrees for the 10th data point, correlate with the temperature as measured by the Testo device?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_chat

2546,6660,262,3,And so your question to the technical support representative at TSI was what does invalid mean in CO sensor reading. Why did you ask that question?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2547,6664,262,7,"Because we have an invalid row on 30 and 31 of Exhibit 20, and I was trying to deduce what the definition of invalid was because I could not locate it within the instruction manual.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2548,6668,262,11,And what was his response?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2549,6669,262,12,"As shown here on Exhibit 24, he mentions that there is a problem with the voltage.  Even just one sample reading poorly, he will classify the whole reading as invalid. So it does not mean the sensor is malfunctioning.  So I believe I understood it as an engineer that there would have been a spike in the signal coming to the microprocessor or the analog or digital converter. There was some information that couldn't be processed, and instead of trying to capture that, it just strikes it and places an invalid input. That's the way I understood it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2550,6682,262,25,"Okay.  And then on October 6th, you talked with the technical support representative again and asked: ""Can I use the CO data at 140 degrees Fahrenheit."" And his view was: ""Best not to, should not since the air quality detector is at 140F.  In addition, we do not know the accurate temperature to undertake an offset calculation.  Can use data only within temperature specifications."" So what did you understand from that?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2551,6698,263,15,"I understood that at 140, the temperature as we see on the data log on Exhibit 20 in the temperature column, the temperature saturates at 140, and since it doesn't go beyond 140, we don't have the temperature data to perform the offset accuracy calculation for the CO sensor.  And that's the way I understood it from his column as",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2552,6705,263,22,So anything above 140 -- or anything at 140 is data you cannot use?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2553,6707,263,24,"Anything above 140, because we know it is at 140, but above it, we don't know.  So, yes, you are correct.  By definition, at 140, best not to use.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2576,6773,266,12,"No, it's not.  That's something separate.  It doesn't put it in a saturated range; it puts it in -- potentially, the system, the sensor, the instrument itself can have an error up to 5999 plus 3 percent.  It doesn't mean it's sinking and saturating and we're going into that realm of actual operation.  It doesn't mean that at all.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

2583,6802,267,15,"And it says 1 through 54 here, but in the data log, it's 0 to 53; is that correct?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2584,6804,267,17,53.  54 is the end.  I don't think there is a doc page.  That's the end of the range.  So it is data from 0 to 53 as shown in Page 1.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2665,7014,275,19,"As I mentioned, we have a volume of space.  We have carbon monoxide in that volume of space, such as this room, but in this case, specifically, it's a flue gas situation and we know that there are combustion products in that space of volume. In that space of volume, we have excess air due to the combustion process that could be 100 percent.  It could be a thousand percent.  We determine that via an oxygen or Co2 measurement and convert that into the excess air amount, which is dilution factor of the carbon monoxide.  This occurs in a flue gas environment. So the excess air coming from the flue gas, the combustion process, is diluting the carbon monoxide as the sensor sees it.  As the carbon monoxide sensor detects it, it is reducing typically as the excess air is increased.  That is the best way to describe it.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

The COAF is used mostly in a combustion flue gas environment, emissions and others where one wants to extract the real concentration of the carbon monoxide. So if one is undertaking, for example, an emission measurement, one should be using COAF to determine the amount, the absolute amount of carbon monoxide emitted into a certain location coming from a flue gas environment. Similarly, if one is to inhale a pure flue gas volume of space into their lungs, one is inhaling -- one is to calculate and understand the absolute carbon monoxide concentration, not the as-measured CO signal coming from and as-measured CO sensor. One must take into account the absolute amount, and that's exactly what the COAF is meant to do.  It's been designed so that it removes the dilution factor which is coming from the excess air and providing the user or the person adopting this methodology a true, a true sense of the absolute carbon monoxide in that volume of space.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2692,7140,280,15,"So in Paragraph 20 you say: ""This provides an 'apples to apples' basis to compare carbon monoxide measurements in a flue gas environment (such as within the subject oven chamber with a breached heat exchanger) with an indoor 'ambient' air equivalent."" So explain that to me, because I don't understand it.",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2693,7152,281,1,"Absolutely.  So typically, when -- let's take the OSHA standard of 50 parts per million that is quoted by OSHA as an ambient situation where is at one atmosphere at 25 degrees Celsius, okay? When one inhales flue gases, it's a different situation.  The flue gas is not in one atmosphere, and it's not at a certain temperature as stated or quoted by OSHA.  The parameters are different from that angle. So to take the as-measured, the as-measured sensor display in that inhalation situation would be incorrect, because the absolute amount one is inhaling, knowing it's a flue gas environment, is the COAF, is the absolute amount of carbon monoxide. Therefore, when we are talking about exposure analysis and inhalation and knowingly we are in an ambient environment, fantastic.  One would be using the ambient exposure limit or standard, which is 50 parts per million. When one knowingly is inhaling flue gases, one has to make accommodation for that environment and you fix -- of excess air dilution as measured by the raw CO as-measured sensor coming out, and that has to be compensated for. So to make an apples-to-apples comparison to a standard that takes into consideration one atmosphere at a certain temperature, we also have to understand when one inhales a flue gas environment to take into consideration the dilution effects coming from excess air and use a measure that takes into consideration the absolute amount of carbon monoxide.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

2963,8134,318,21,"As far as I understand, it's readily available.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2964,8136,318,23,Okay.  Have you seen this method being used for estimated carbon monoxide total weighted average exposures?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2965,8140,319,1,"Again, from what I have seen in the past, it's usually denoted in a journal equation form, which is similar to what I've presented here today.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2966,8143,319,4,"And the equation is just one -- one calculation, isn't it?  Because total weighted -- just bear with me. In my math classes when you look at the weighted average, if, you know, T-1 is one plus, T-1 and 2, sigma, and it sums up all of those to get an average, but you've used just one number?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
2967,8150,319,11,"You're describing that very nicely.  It's a summation of if one is experiencing different levels of exposure at different times, one would have to take that into consideration.  That is when one would need to have the other components in the equation. But in this case, we know that the folks here are within 13 feet of the oven and there's a CO detector alarm within 13 feet of the oven, so we are putting that as one constant exposure level.  It could have been higher.  We don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
2968,8161,319,22,"Okay.  So if you -- strike that. And so Brandon Adams has the same TWA numbers, even though the door is open, given at different times, but the hours are the same.

Again, that's why I termed this as a conservative approach.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

And Lee says she opens the oven up to 75 times, Rodriguez says she opens it up to 24 times during her shift, and Lacy says she opens it up to 70 times in her shift.

3007,8293,324,24,"In totality, no more than 20 minutes. Again, I don't recall that with high definition, but it wasn't a lengthy interview; it was more of a discussion.  So I understand where the detector was, understand how it was moving, and understand, actually, what she meant in her testimony with regards to placing it in a cabinet and where that was located.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3010,8309,325,14,"Again, in line with her testimony, it's not a hundred percent sure if the CO detector was introduced into the bakery in January or February.  It's about that time in 2009 they -- and it was a CO detector obtained from the store itself off the shelf. It was given to Julie, I believe, by her colleague, Tina Klein, and when -- the first mention of alarming, I believe, was when the door of the oven was open, it started alarming. She also made reference to placing the detector on a baker's table, which she identified to me when we were there.  It was adjacent, just next to the oven, and also placing it up on that work shelf. She also mentioned that they placed it adjacent, opposite the oven, and powered it with mains power on the wall, I believe, with a cord and it also alarmed at that location.  And just to clarify, it also alarmed, as I mentioned previously, on the baker's table on the shelf so it was alarming at multiple locations -- not only multiple locations, but also using batteries and when in the state of powered by the mains power. And at some point in time, I believe she mentions -- or she mentioned that it was becoming annoying, so they tried to place it in a cabinet or a drawer, which she showed me.  And I believe someone measured it -- I measured it.  It was 23 feet away from the location.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

3014,8344,326,23,"Yes.  And again, at some other point in time after that, it was so annoying that they pulled out the batteries, and that occurred -- I think taken from her testimony, that was in mid-February 2009.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3019,8361,327,14,"Based on her -- my interview with her and her testimony, I believe that's what happened, correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3020,8364,327,17,Okay.  And then was there another detector that was placed?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
3021,8366,327,19,"There's mention of another detector, and I believe reading Julie Lee's testimony, I believe she says, ""It was after my break"" of some period of time, sometime later.  I think she was gone for six or nine months' period, and I believe someone else brought in a CO detector.  I believe Byrd mentioned that he -- I think he said he brought it in. But again, some people -- again reading the testimonies, some people recall there was a second detector; some people don't remember a second detector whatsoever. So again, with memory loss and all the rest of it, it's very fuzzy what actually happened, but my understanding reading Julie Lee's testimony specifically with regards to the sequence of events, that was very clear to me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3136,8655,338,22,"Prior to the break, Doctor, we were talking about the alarms limited by a CO detector. So I've taken a look at an exemplar first of a detector, and there's an alarm guide in the back of it which says four beeps is a CO alarm, and you testified that that beep could be 80 decibels or more.

3143,8677,339,18,I would say so.  I would say so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3144,8678,339,19,And it's just that its duration is shorter than a beep?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
3145,8680,339,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

3150,8690,340,5,"And this alarm guide says three chirps per minute, malfunction, replace the alarm. And so that means that it chirps three times in succession and stops and then chirps again a minute later and stops; right?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer

3152,8697,340,12,"Okay.  So that's to specify a malfunction. And here it says: ""Five chirps per minute to the end of life alarm.  Replace it, throw it away."" Is that consistent with your understanding as to how these alarms typically function?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
3153,8704,340,19,"The chirping, yes, for battery replacement.  Three, four beeps for CO alarming. Regarding A malfunction -- again, we've got an exemplar.  If that's the case, that's the case.

3294,9150,357,23,I don't recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3295,9151,357,24,Okay.  So what's the value of these plots?,q,MR. TAYAB,start_answer
3296,9152,357,25,"Well, as I was mentioning, the first value is that the emissions coming from a burner cycle turning on has typical characteristics of most combustion burners, which is a low of the peak and then coming to some steady state situation.  That's the first. The second is its sensitivity to both the air and gas intakes where we can see, as we tweak those variables just slightly, the carbon monoxide varies considerably. For example, Test Number 1 here is six gases 3.5 inch water column.  What is emitted is about the peak at about a 40-second mark is about 660 or -70 COAF. And then adjusting those variables can considerably increase the COAF emissions, as shown in multiple examples here, reaching up to 8000, for example, in Test Number 6, and Test Number 7 in the 2000s. So the value, coming back to your question, again solidifies what I have known myself when it comes to combustion and burners in general is that slight tweaks to the variables, such as gas or the air fuel ratio, which is effectively what is going on, considerably changes the emissions, the flue gas emissions being produced.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3297,9180,359,1,"And if you take away features that would account for those emissions, such as a flue damper, such as a purge cycle, that's what manufacturers put those safety devices in place for, isn't it?",q,MR. TAYAB,start_chat
3298,9184,359,5,Objection; misstates the evidence and the testimony and compound.,side_chat,MR. JARCHI,start_chat
3299,9186,359,7,"Again, what Dr. Romig has presented here to me signifies that we have a typical upstart in emissions, flue gas toxic gases being produced, and that the burner in this case is very sensitive to air and gas.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

I see them walking around when one should be placing it on a table in a stationary location.  It was describing that situation. Sure, if one is walking around with a CO detector such as the UEI we talked about a moment ago and trying to obtain accurate data readings of a certain location, that would not be reflective of that location simply because the meter is in motion.

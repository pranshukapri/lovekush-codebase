Can you tell me what type of physician you are?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer

We also deal with people who have traumatic injuries to those areas, individuals who have arthritic conditions, and certainly we treat conservatively and have the training to do surgery in those areas if the need arises.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,163,6,14,And can you tell the jury please about the process of becoming an orthopedic surgeon?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
12,165,6,16,"The process after graduating medical school and doing a one-year internship entails a four-year program wherein you are just doing orthopedics and taking care of patients who come through the emergency facility.  You get the opportunity to be in clinic setting, sometimes in private physicians' offices.  So you are getting a well-rounded education in that regard and then actually going to the operating room and participating in surgeries and doing the surgeries under the direction of the individuals who have privileges in the hospital setting and also outpatient settings as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,177,7,2,Can you tell the jury how long you've been a physician?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer

18,184,7,9,I hold certificates in orthopedics and pain management.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
19,186,7,11,What does board certification mean?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
20,187,7,12,"Well, in the surgical subspecialty it means that you've met the requirements of independently incorporated boards.  There is three of them in Pennsylvania.  I'm certified by one of them.  They are recognized as equal. So when you meet the requirements, taking tests and then the last year actually being watched doing surgery by board certified individuals, who also review your charts in the hospital and office setting for the two years before, you receive a certificate.  So that's for me 1989 my first certificate. After that there is recertification, and that just entails taking written tests, and I have done that successfully three times up to 2011, and I hold the certificate that designates Emeritus status.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

31,218,8,17,"As a resident I had publications, along with my physicians who were trainers, but in practice, no, I have not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,221,8,20,And have you held any academic positions in your time as a physician?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
33,223,8,22,I had two academic positions.  My last one was 1994 as associate professor at Hershey Medical Center.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,225,8,24,And do you train the future generation of doctors these days?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
35,228,9,1,"I'm still privileged to have young individuals come to the office in various stages of vocational training or those who want to be physicians.  So, yes, I just recently had somebody with me this last couple of weeks.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
36,233,9,6,And tell the jury about your current practice.,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
37,234,9,7,"I would call my current practice a dual practice. Orthopedics and pain management are married very well together, in that you can't have one without the other. People who have injuries particularly have pain. I get to see individuals also who have metabolic diseases, such as muscular dystrophies, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and those individuals, unfortunately, have pain associated with their disease state.  So you can treat those individuals by doing a number of techniques to try and deaden their pain and also using medications we can help as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
38,245,9,18,And as part of your practice do you treat individuals who have been injured in car accidents and other accidents?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer

43,256,10,3,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
44,257,10,4,Do you interpret those studies yourself as well?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
45,258,10,5,"I have the training to do so.  I'm not a radiologist, I'm not a neuro-diagnostician, but I have to be able to look at those studies and make determinations for patients particularly.  So, yes, I can look at them and certainly understand the morphologic concepts, what the anatomy looks -- so I am doing that all the time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
46,264,10,11,"And are you familiar with the cost associated with orthopedic care not only in the state, but also on the side of the state?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
47,267,10,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

52,278,10,25,I went to Syracuse University.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,280,11,1,All right.  In looking at your -- I have two resumes from your -- or CVs.  The first resume has that you obtained a bachelor of arthritis psychology from Syracuse University.  What exactly is a bachelor of arthritis psychology?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
54,285,11,6,"Well, I would call that a typographical error. That's why we have updated ones.  I knew that was a problem there.  There is no such thing, obviously.  It's a bachelor of arts, and my area of study was in psychology.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,290,11,11,"I see.  Okay.  So this resume that I was supplied is not correct, the one that refers to bachelor of arthritis?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
56,293,11,14,"Yes.  It's quite old and had that pointed out to me about two years ago, so it's an old one.  The one I gave you is up to date.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,296,11,17,So that's been removed from your current resume; correct?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
58,298,11,19,"Oh, yes.  It's been corrected.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,299,11,20,"All right.  And I'm just looking at -- your resume is a little somewhat out of chronological order, but you went to Friends Select School.  I assume that's high school; is that correct?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
60,303,11,24,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,304,11,25,"And then the next entry is 1977 graduate year Syracuse University.  What does that mean graduate year? Is that the year you graduated from Syracuse, 1977?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
62,308,12,3,Right.  I finished in three years.  I left in 1976.  The certificate year is 1977.  They don't let you graduate early at Syracuse.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,311,12,6,"And the next entry is Saint Joseph's University, 1976.  So did you go to Saint Joseph's while you were at Syracuse?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
64,314,12,9,"When I left Syracuse in the winter time, I went to Saint Joe's, started my psychobiology graduate work, so it was the same year that I left Syracuse.  It was in the winter time that I started.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,318,12,13,And then you went to -- you did post graduate work at Drexel in 1978?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
66,320,12,15,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,321,12,16,"Then in 1972 to 1981 you were at Des Moines University, College of Osteopathic Medicine; is that correct?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
68,324,12,19,1978 to '81.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,325,12,20,'78 to '81?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
70,326,12,21,Yes.  Is there a typographical on that one?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,327,12,22,"All right.  And that's in Des Moines, Iowa.  Is that where you got your medical degree?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
72,329,12,24,"That is correct, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,330,12,25,I also saw on your resume that you spent time at the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey; is that correct?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
74,334,13,3,"Right.  It originally was Memorial Hospital.  I started there working with an orthopod when I was 16 years old actually, but it changed its name when UMDNJ bought it, so it became a university when I left.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,338,13,7,"Just so I'm clear, is that a dental school where you trained in dentistry as well?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
76,340,13,9,No.  It's actually a medical and dentist school both.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,342,13,11,I see.  And then you went to the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery; correct?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
78,344,13,13,I didn't go there.  I did my residency there.  I finished my residency in the last three years.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,346,13,15,"I see.  And the two resumes that I have, one is on a letterhead from Cypress Orthopedic Pain Management and Rehabilitation Centers; and the other one is on Tall Oaks Therapeutics and Rehabilitation Center.",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
80,350,13,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

82,354,13,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,355,13,24,Why do you have letterhead -- resumes on two different letterheads?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
84,358,14,1,"Well, look at the bottom right-hand corner, at the bottom of the page there is a little tree there and it's a division of Regional Orthopedics, basically the fictitious names to designate which one we are talking about.  Instead of saying Philadelphia, because there is already Philadelphia Orthopedics, we name them by trees.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,364,14,7,Okay.  But I'm just curious why two different names on two different resumes.,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
86,366,14,9,"It depends on what was given to me, as far as what was printed out.  So for today we are here, obviously, in Pittsburgh, so we use the Pittsburgh address where my office is.  So that would be the only reason. They're both the same, actually.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,371,14,14,"So the Pittsburgh address is 500 Grant Street in Pittsburgh, Suite 2900; correct?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
88,373,14,16,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,374,14,17,And that is the old address of Simon & Simon back in October of 2018 when you saw Ms. Pfaff; is that correct?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
90,377,14,20,"Not that I'm aware of.  I don't know what Simon & Simon office situation was, but as far as I know, they're not in my suite.  That's a whole suite.  I have -- I'm No. 22 in that suite.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,381,14,24,And is that where you saw Ms. Pfaff?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
92,382,14,25,Yes.  That is my office.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

94,385,15,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,386,15,3,And what exactly does that office consist of?  Do you have staff there?  Do you have equipment there?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
96,388,15,5,"Well, there is three receptionists who will manage the individuals who come to see me, and then in the office itself I have an exam table, a stool for the exam table, a desk, a computer.  I have a copier there.  I have all of the tools I need to do examinations.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,393,15,10,"And, um, do you man that office full time?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
98,394,15,11,"Well, I'm not there full time.  I come a couple of times a month, depending on who has booked patients.  I also do medical marijuana.  So if there are individuals who are scheduled for that, I'll see them there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,398,15,15,What do you mean you see individuals for medical marijuana?  I didn't understand that.,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
100,400,15,17,"I'm certified to give certification for cannabis, medical cannabis.  So I see those individuals as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,402,15,19,I see.  All right.  You were talking about your board certifications.  You -- am I correct that you are certified by the American Association of Physician Specialists?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
102,406,15,23,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

112,423,16,14,"I don't have AOAO certification, that is correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,424,16,15,"Okay.  And just so we are clear, what's the AOA?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
114,425,16,16,AOA is American Osteopathic Association.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,426,16,17,"The American Association of Physician Specialists that you are certified by, that is not an orthopedic board, is it?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
116,429,16,20,"Yes, it is.  Well, it's the parent board to the American Board of Orthopedics, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I followed to the T the PTO orders that Judge Bechtol gave. There were two of them, and in each instance even those cases that you are citing I gave causation statements with differentials, and I did my job on that alone.  So there were no trials.  I never went to any courtroom in Utah, Texas, or Florida, or anywhere else those ten cases were. My job was in Philadelphia with a multidistrict litigation.

271,811,31,12,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
272,812,31,13,The first thing is first.  Is this a surgical case?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
273,814,31,15,"This is, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
274,815,31,16,"After examining Lillian and reviewing her records and studies, combining your expertise with your evaluation, can you tell me what diagnoses you came to?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
275,818,31,19,"Well, Ms. Pfaff had injury to her spinal column, and I will just say that those injuries are in the form of soft tissue, in that the disks and structures that involve the nerves are not an issue here.  So even when I first met her for the neck, she told me that she did have neck pain as a result of the motor vehicle accident in which she was involved, but she said that that pain resolved after she had treatment.  So mainly the complaints were in regard to the right and left shoulder.  So for those areas she had contusions and she had an exacerbation of her preexisting degenerative joint disease that was quiescent prior to May 26, 2016 which is the date of the motor vehicle accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
276,832,32,7,"And what did that exacerbation to the shoulders cause for Lillian, or what did that require?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
277,834,32,9,"Basically it caused pain, and what it required was to replace the joints for both the right and left shoulder.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
278,837,32,12,"And just so the jury is clear, would you agree with me that this is an aggravation case.  These are new injuries for Lillian?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
279,840,32,15,"There is no question she had it before, but I would say that based on what I reviewed and what we talked about, saying quiescent means that the issues of arthritis were not causing her functional problems or her ability to carry out with her activities for the most part.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
280,845,32,20,"And without necessarily going to exactly what Ms. Pfaff's problems was right now, can you just briefly explain to the jury what the shoulder anatomy is like?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
281,848,32,23,"Well, shoulder anatomy is very interesting, because it's not like the hip, in that you have the head of the bone sitting in a socket.  There is a socket in the shoulder, but it sits pretty much vertically, and it is very, very shallow.  So the head will ride in that socket, and the stabilization for the head is four tendons that are the rotator cuff, and the four tendons spell the words S.I.T.S, S-I-T-S.  So those are the main structures that stabilize the shoulder.  There is also a capsule in the joint that surrounds the head and the socket which is called the glenoid fossa.  The head is the humeral head, and above the head is a bone that you can actually touch in your own shoulder.  It's squared off at the edge.  That comes off the scapula which is called the acromion, and then there is the clavicle which is the collarbone which meets the acromion and forms a joint.  So all of these anatomical structures that I just mentioned make up what we call the shoulder girdle. Inside the joint on the socket is a lip that's called the labrum, and that cushions the head as it rides or moves in the socket when you go through range of motion.  There is a plexus of nerves that sit in that area as well right in front of the head.  It's called the brachial plexus, so that supplies motor and sensory function as well as the nerves that comes out of the neck and form those nerves that eventually fan off into the extremities.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
282,876,33,25,How does that joint wear down over time?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
283,878,34,1,"Well, the joint is under a lot of stress, and the bone itself will start to deteriorate.  It will start to wear, as far as the actual cartilage on the bone surfaces. There is about 2 millimeters of cartilage on the surface, and that will just start to wear away over time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
284,883,34,6,"And with regard to Ms. Pfaff, one of her diagnoses from her operating surgeon is that glenohumeral arthritis.  Have I pronounced that correctly?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
285,886,34,9,"Exactly, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
286,887,34,10,Can you tell me what that is?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
287,888,34,11,"Well, the glenoid, as I said, is the actual socket, and the humeral designation is the head, so that forms a joint called the glenohumeral joint.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
288,891,34,14,"And if someone has arthritis in that area, are they generally still able to function?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
289,893,34,16,"Pretty much so, yes, because it's shallow and you're relying on muscles.  You don't have weight-bearing like you do in the hip and knee and even in the ankles which you rarely see arthritis as well, but hip and knee you see a lot of arthritis because there is a constant grinding of those surfaces, even though there is materials in between.  For the knee it's the meniscus.  For the hip it's a structure also called the labrum, so similar to what we see in the shoulder.  So the shoulder takes more time to develop this arthritic condition than those other joints in the body.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
290,905,35,2,"And with regard to trauma with someone who has glenohumeral arthritis, how can trauma affect that?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
291,907,35,4,"Well, trauma will cause the structures that are also interposed between the bones -- there is synovial lining, for instance.  There is the capsule.  Everything starts to become inflamed, and we call that inflammatory disease.  That is what arthritis is.  It becomes an issue because the nerve fibers and the structures that are supplied by nerves will start to send signals to the brain that there is pain there.  So ordinarily it's not a problem.  She may have periods of time where she needs some treatment for the arthritis, but generally it's not the same as when you have trauma like this.  So when you have a contusion, a traumatic head into the socket kind of thing from force, that becomes -- the arthritis becomes inflamed and that's what causes pain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
292,921,35,18,And we know in Ms. Pfaff's situation she ended up having surgery.  In your medical opinion was the replacement of both of these surgeries caused by this accident?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
293,925,35,22,"There is no question, yes, the need for the surgeries was precipitated by the accident-related injuries, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
294,928,35,25,Is this the straw that broke the camel's back type of situation?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
295,931,36,2,"Absolutely, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,932,36,3,Okay.  Can you explain to the jury what she had done?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
297,934,36,5,"Well, basically, what she had done is a surgery that entails obviously going to the operating room, placing the person under anesthesia.  Sometimes we do a spleen block which is the muscles here.  There is a nerve under there that the anesthesiologists can actually knock out, so to speak, and allow for us to work in that area. So basically an incision is made most of the time up-front.  The skin in what we call the subcutaneous tissue is placed aside by retracting it.  There is a large vein there that you have to protect, so you place that under the retractors, and then pretty much you are at the capsule.  You cut the capsule and you can release the first tendon of the rotator cuff which is the supraspinatus, and that allows you to start making the cuts in the bone.  So you are actually cutting the head off of the bone that we call the humeral head. The implant that will go into the canal of the bone has a stem on it and it has a head that will simulate the head of the humerus.  So the process of taking the medullary canal out, that is the internal table of the bone, is done by reaming.  We have reamers that start in small diameter, and you work your way up until you get a good internal bone mantel to in most places place cement. The cement will hold the stem in, and then you position the head to that socket.  You then repair the structures back to the flange that's on this implant device, and then you start the process of sewing inner layers out to the skin which we'll clip with skin clips usually and then put the dressings on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
298,964,37,9,And to get into the medical name of what she had done I understand is a bilateral arthroplasty.  What does that describe?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
299,967,37,12,"Right.  It's just describing a total joint -- a partial joint replacement.  You can also replace the socket.  Sometimes we choose not to.  It's up to the surgeon.  There is a plastic piece that will be an extra part of the procedure where you punch a slot.  It has a flange on it as well.  You cement that in as well, and the head rather than have metal against the actual cartilage that's already damaged, you're replacing that cartilage. So you are creating a new head and socket, basically.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
300,976,37,21,"I'm going to move to strike the doctor's testimony, because it's talking in generalities as opposed to what actually happened to Mrs. Pfaff.",side_chat,MR. LANG,start_question
301,980,37,25,Is this the procedure that Mrs. Pfaff had done?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
302,982,38,1,"It is the procedure, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
303,983,38,2,"And Doctor, one of the other notes on the procedure was biceps tenodesis bilaterally.  What does that describe?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
304,986,38,5,"Well, there is two heads of the biceps.  In her case the long head was outside of the groove that it usually sits in.  So when you make a muscle and you pull your arm up and tighten, her tendon was not sitting where it's supposed to.  So the tenodesis is just a stabilization procedure for the biceps so that again the tendon will ride in the groove where it's supposed to be anatomically, and the person will have better function in the biceps.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
305,995,38,14,What does that tendon have to do with the shoulder?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
306,997,38,16,"That tendon actually goes into the shoulder and the top part of the labrum at the 12 o'clock position.  It actually inserts into the labrum.  So it's in the joint itself.  The other small head inserts in the small bone that's underneath the clavicle.  That is called the coracoid.  So these two tendons are -- at least the one, let's say, the long one, is absolutely related to function of the joint itself.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
307,1005,38,24,And the final part of the triple procedure was capsule release.  What does that mean?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
308,1008,39,1,"Right.  So I talked about the joint being surrounded by a capsule.  That stabilizes the head.  In injury the capsule becomes laxed, so you're basically going to sew it.  In my case I used to use a hot thermal wand to do that, and I would place the wand, kind of like putting an iron against a piece of clothing, but in this case you are going to shrink the tissue.  So you can sew it to shrink it by putting it on itself, folding it over and sewing it in that position, or you can thermally do it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
309,1018,39,11,"And are these arthroscopic like through a portal, or are these open procedures?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
310,1020,39,13,These are open procedures.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
311,1021,39,14,"And are her joints now in both shoulders, are those joints totally artificial?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
312,1023,39,16,"Yes, they are.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
313,1024,39,17,Is that hardware expected to remain in her shoulders?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
314,1026,39,19,"It's permanent, unless there is a complication. Then it has to be removed.  It will stay in there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
315,1028,39,21,And in Lillian's case why was such a drastic procedure needed instead of a simple scope?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
316,1030,39,23,"Well, the amount of arthritis, for one, the fact that in a person of this age, I believe she was 85 when this injury occurred, you are going to have to look ahead a little bit and be a little smart in looking at the structure of the tissues.  So it's just a technical piece of information about how the surgery is approached, but it will give the person a better mechanical advantage doing it this way.  That's really what it's about, getting function back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
317,1040,40,7,And you told us already you conducted a physical exam of Lillian Pfaff in October of 2018 when you saw her. What did you find on your exam when it came to her shoulders?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
318,1044,40,11,"Well, just looking at the shoulders, the wounds were well-healed from the surgery that she had, and in looking at the motion, she had on the left 45 percent normal and on the right 55 percent normal.  So we have numbers that actually the AMA puts out that we use as the standard norms, and then we work off of those numbers no matter what age the person is, and then we determine the percent for the different planes of motion.  There are six of them here going forward, backward, internal, external, circumduction and extension.  So that's what we're basing those numbers on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
319,1055,40,22,"And when someone has a reduced range of motion like that, what kind of daily activities or what kind of motions with their upper extremities and arms are impaired?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
320,1060,41,1,"Well, just things like going in the refrigerator and trying to get a gallon of milk out or a half gallon or a quart, whatever it is, just that reaching motion, going in a closet and getting something off of a hanger.  I mean, just things that we do in our normal lives that are now going to be altered because she doesn't have that full range, and she actually recruits her scapula which is the wing bone in the back to get the shoulder to do some kind of motion, but it's not functional motion that we are talking about.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
321,1070,41,11,"And when we are talking about a loss of range of motion, is this something where a patient, specifically Lillian, is it something where she'll stop because it hurts or mechanically it just doesn't do that anymore?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
322,1074,41,15,"It just doesn't do it anymore.  It's rare that you have pain because you replace those areas that were arthritic, so a certain degree of pain because there is adhesion, there is scar, and just the way this total joint works in this particular joint.  All of those factors are going to be an issue for a person that's trying to do activities.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
323,1081,41,22,"And I do want to turn to the conclusion -- well, before we get there.  In your medical opinion did you find the reduction in her range of motion and the condition she's in now when you saw her in 2018, did you find that that condition was permanent?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
324,1087,42,2,"It definitely is, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
325,1088,42,3,"Okay.  Turning to the conclusion in your report, could you please tell the jury what conclusion you came to?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
326,1091,42,6,"Well, as far as the conclusions, I talked about the spinal column, the shoulder itself, and the need for the surgeries.  And then she had chronic pain obviously after and a decrease in her activities, so that factors in and diagnoses.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
327,1096,42,11,And what did you find to be the cause of those injuries and those diagnoses?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
328,1098,42,13,"Well, the motor vehicle accident of May 26, 2016 is the reason that she underwent the surgeries and the reason that she has her post-op findings as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
329,1101,42,16,"And using your experience, clinical training, your review of the records, and your examination of Lillian Pfaff, were you able to arrive at a prognosis for her?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
330,1105,42,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
331,1106,42,21,What is that prognosis?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
332,1107,42,22,I gave her a fair prognosis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
333,1108,42,23,What does that mean?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
334,1109,42,24,"Prognosis is a predictor of future issues that a person is going to have, based on statistics and statistical analysis about this particular injury and what this injury entails.  So we're kind of going to be able to talk about what the person may need in the future, as far as my role have to be talking about a reasonable degree of medical certainty.  So just looking at these cases and in particular Ms. Pfaff what happens in the future.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
335,1118,43,7,"And based on that prognosis, were you able to come to an opinion as to whether or not she would require future care and treatment?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
336,1121,43,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
337,1122,43,11,And what did you conclude and recommend in that area?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
338,1124,43,13,"Well, Ms. Pfaff is a person who really falls under the pain management realm.  I don't think there is anymore surgery she's going to need, unless there is a complication or something happens to the implants or they loosen, become infected, that kind of thing, and I don't foresee that.  But really in order to have her continue to function, because she is an active person, mostly medications that I mentioned.  They're certainly helpful.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
339,1132,43,21,"And could you just read through that for the jury, please?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
340,1134,43,23,"I said palliative care, meaning not doing anymore surgery, utilizing medications, including but not limited to analgesics, anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants. There are some fancier ones called membrane stabilizers and even cream applications for the soft tissue areas, but those would be the ones I would pick to use perhaps in combination or just singularly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
341,1142,44,5,What are membrane stabilizers?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
342,1143,44,6,"Membrane stabilizers are unique medications that actually affect the joints.  So even though she's had a joint replaced, there is still soft tissue around this implant or implants, and what happens with those soft tissues is again they become inflamed.  So you can actually use these medications to reduce inflammation by not putting a needle in there with medication.  I wouldn't inject the joint, because that would cause higher risk for infection particularly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
343,1152,44,15,And you've told us that you found the surgery was related to this accident.  Do you give that opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
344,1155,44,18,"I do, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
345,1156,44,19,Do you have an opinion as to the reasonableness and necessity of the care she's had to date?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
346,1158,44,21,"I would certainly characterize the care as being medically necessary, reasonable, and causally related, as I said.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
347,1161,44,24,"And Doctor, you've reviewed the bills in this case; is that correct?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
348,1164,45,1,"I did, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
349,1165,45,2,Did you find the charges charged for this care to be usual and customary?,q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer
350,1167,45,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
351,1168,45,5,"Thank you, Doctor.  Have you given us all of your opinions to a reasonable degree of medical certainty?",q,MR. FLAHERTY,start_answer

358,1183,45,20,I see.  So you don't have a file on the person that you examined for this litigation?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
359,1185,45,22,"Right.  I'm not a treating physician, so I'm not obligated to keep any records.  I'm not a physician that's formed a patient relationship, so I'm not obligated to keep any records, and we don't have capacity to do that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
360,1191,46,2,Okay.  I'm going to touch on something you just mentioned here at the end of your direct testimony. Medications that she'll need in the future.  She also needed these same types of medications before; correct?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer

384,1230,47,15,All right.  And this was all by the time you had seen her; correct?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer

392,1245,48,4,"Okay.  So you did know that.  All right.  Would you -- well, let me ask you.  You reviewed -- you said in your report that you reviewed some medical records; correct?  You actually have a section records reviewed?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer

405,1265,48,24,I have more than that in my document.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

441,1335,51,16,"Well, when I presented the documents that speak to the issue of activities, particularly she was instructed just to give an idea of what is limited from the shoulder standpoint.  And when I saw her, it was the spinal column as well, but as far as any medical disease state, she should have not included those, and I don't think that she did, as far as I can tell from the review.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
442,1342,51,23,"Maybe I didn't understand your answer.  Let me -- my question wasn't clear.  You're saying today that her shoulder injuries caused by this motor vehicle accident have somehow affected her activities of daily living, her day-to-day activities; correct?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
443,1348,52,3,"I am indicating that and in particular when it comes to shoulder girdle function, yes.  I'm not including any medical disease states that may cause her to not be able to do certain things, let's say, walk for distances.

451,1374,53,3,Yeah.  And she -- and with synovitis.  What is synovitis?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
452,1376,53,5,"As I said, there is a lining of the joint called the synovium.  It produces fluid to kind of lubricate the joints.  So when it's inflamed, anything that is an itis that's attached to it will be inflammation related.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

458,1388,53,17,"You are correct, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
459,1389,53,18,And his operation was to try to alleviate the problems caused by that arthritis; correct?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
460,1391,53,20,"In part, because, as I said, in my testimony earlier, arthritis in and of itself doesn't necessarily cause problems.  I agree that she had a history before that of some complaints about the shoulder.  In the two years before that where she did present to her treating physician nobody ever talked about surgery, and I didn't see any recommendations for it.  So she didn't need surgery until this accident occurred.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

465,1410,54,13,"And so your opinion is that since these preexisting conditions were quiescent prior to the motor vehicle accident, her complaints after the motor vehicle accident were because of the motor vehicle accident; is that correct?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer
466,1415,54,18,I think that summarizes it quite well.  Thank you.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
467,1417,54,20,What do you mean by quiescent exactly?,q,MR. LANG,start_answer
468,1418,54,21,"Well, it's not making the person have to go to a doctor and do what she did with Dr. Phillips.  In other words, she goes to a doctor who is going to give her some medication.  She limits her activities and then she's back to doing what she was doing.  She was actually working. So after the accident she's not working.

559,1630,62,25,"Well, I do because the history is in there that she already knew she was getting a shoulder replacement. So there is no elaboration on the history, but obviously this came after.  So anything that transpired before with her treating surgeon was already decided.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

563,1644,63,13,"I went by her history, and I still think that the history is accurate.  If she had periods again where she had increased pain because of, let's say, a fall, that certainly isn't again the same as what was already exacerbated by the motor vehicle accident.  In other words, this is just something on top of what already was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

She didn't have any surgical opinions provided.  She went to a chiropractor, and I don't think there is anything else afterwards, unless you are going to show it to me that again would be similar to as the same as what transpired after the motor vehicle accident.

577,1716,66,7,"Not at all.  She was confused, for one.  She was in a traumatic event, and when you read these kind of documents, it is so common not to have every single injury that may have occurred listed.  Those guys are trained to get people away and into an emergency setting so they could be evaluated.  It's about life and death.

It may not manifest until later on as well.  And here is a person who had arthritis and doesn't complain about it.  So again it may have been quiet at that point in time.  It may not have manifested.  I don't know.  I can only just say in regard to the documentation, it isn't there, but that doesn't mean it didn't get injured.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
585,1752,67,17,"Well, wait a second.  Now you said she didn't complain about it.  Two months before the accident or in March of 2016, three months before the accident, she's complaining significantly to her chiropractor; right?",q,MR. LANG,start_answer

587,1760,67,25,"All right.  Well, let's kind of try to bring this back around to a logical conclusion.  If she would have complained of shoulder pain in the emergency room or to the paramedics, they would have examined those areas of her bodies and given her appropriate treatment; correct?",q,MR.

588,1766,68,5,"They may have.  I can't speak for what was in the mind or how a paramedic is going to act on the scene. Again multiple trauma, elderly person.

I accept that, but that doesn't mean that the shoulders were not injured, as I said.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

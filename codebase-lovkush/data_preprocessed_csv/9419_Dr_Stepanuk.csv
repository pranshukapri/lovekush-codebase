64,326,13,1,"As I explained to Mr. Baer prior to the deposition, we do have a pending motion to preclude the testimony of Dr. Stepanuk.  Obviously, we're participating in the deposition. We're not waiving any of those arguments. In fact, I believe we're scheduled to argue those with the court this afternoon.  Additionally, we have a motion limine pending to preclude the emergency room records from St. Luke's. So with your consent, Mr. Baer, what I would suggest is that we just have a standing objection to those questions rather than interrupting if you get into that area since we have a pending motion on that.",side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
65,343,13,18,Understood.,side_chat,MR. BAER,start_chat
66,344,13,19,All right.  Okay. We can go back on. VIDEOGRAPHER,side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_question

74,371,14,20,That's correct.  I would refer them to someone.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,373,14,22,"And if somebody needed surgery, you wouldn't do that, correct?  You would refer them to somebody else?",q,MR. SMITH,start_answer
76,376,14,25,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,378,15,1,"You referenced your curriculum vitae and you said it's up-to-date.  I'm at curriculum vitae.  You mentioned your publications that you would have had, say, over the past 40 years; is that correct?",q,MR. SMITH,start_answer
78,383,15,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,384,15,7,"Would I be correct, Doctor, that the only -- you only list one publication where you reference any type of shoulder issues on your CV?",q,MR. SMITH,start_answer
80,388,15,11,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,389,15,12,"You were asked a question earlier about your percentage of practice treating patients versus your medical legal work, and I believe what you testified to is that you testify at least 50 times a year?",q,MR. SMITH,start_answer
82,394,15,17,I think the answer you want is about 70 percent of my practice involves patients in litigation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,397,15,20,So would it be fair to say that 70 percent of your practice involves medical legal work?,q,MR. SMITH,start_answer
84,400,15,23,"Medical legal work, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,401,15,24,"And so only about 30 percent of your practice involves actually treating patients, fair?",q,MR. SMITH,start_answer
86,405,16,2,Yeah.  Actually treating regular patients that do not have legal issues.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,407,16,4,Would that be an accurate statement?,q,MR. SMITH,start_answer

90,413,16,10,One time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,414,16,11,And when was that?,q,MR. SMITH,start_answer
92,415,16,12,"On July 1, 2019.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,416,16,13,"And as far as that examination, you wrote one report, correct?",q,MR. SMITH,start_answer
94,418,16,15,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,419,16,16,And it consists of three pages?,q,MR. SMITH,start_answer

98,424,16,21,"Doctor, with respect to shoulder surgery, is it possible for you to quantify the number of times you've performed an arthroscopic surgery on your patients' shoulder over the course of your career?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
99,430,17,1,"Not really.  Knee arthroscopies and shoulder arthroscopies are common procedures, probably the majority of the procedures that I perform, but I can't give you a number.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,435,17,6,"Would it be more than 1,000?",q,MR. BAER,start_chat
101,436,17,7,Objection. VIDEOGRAPHER,side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
102,439,17,10,"Objection that the doctor just testified that he cannot give you a number.  In the beginning he said he couldn't quantify it.  So it's an objection to the form of the question, is leading, and is also asked and answered.",side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
103,445,17,16,"It's not a leading question, but I can also do a follow-up question to the doctor and he can answer it accordingly.",side_chat,MR. BAER,start_chat

109,461,18,6,"Okay, Doctor.  All right, Doctor, we're going to point your attention to Maritza Rodriguez.  Sir, we're here on behalf of Maritza Rodriguez related to her treatment following an accident that occurred on January 31, 2018; is that correct?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
110,467,18,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

112,473,18,18,"Yes, it is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,474,18,19,"Now, you were not a treating physician for Ms. Rodriguez; is that correct?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer

116,479,18,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,480,18,25,"And, Doctor, could you please take a look at the documents that we marked and take a look at Stepanuk-2.",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
118,484,19,3,That's the report that I generated after evaluating Ms. Rodriguez.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,486,19,5,"Doctor, I'm going to ask that if you need to, refer to your report as needed during the course of your testimony here today; is that understood?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
120,490,19,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,491,19,10,"Now, Doctor, in a moment I'm going to ask you to walk us through your evaluation of Ms. Rodriguez step-by-step.  But before I do that, I'd like to know the answer to one very important question.  That is, after examining Ms. Rodriguez, reviewing her records, studies that are referenced in your report, did you find anything wrong with her?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
122,499,19,18,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,500,19,19,Please tell us what it was.,q,MR. BAER,start_answer

125,505,19,24,Can you please explain in greater detail what those injuries are.,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
126,508,20,1,"Cervical strain and sprain is stretching of the ligaments and muscles in the neck.  It's like a sprained ankle in your neck. The right upper extremity radiculopathy is tingling, numbness that radiates down the right arm.  A rotator cuff tear -- we can go to a model.  This is the shoulder.  It happens to be a left shoulder.  This is the collarbone.  This is the humerus, the arm bone.  The rotator cuff is in here.  The green is a bursa.  When you have shoulder problems, you get bursitis. (Indicating). The rotator cuff in this case was torn in this area, completely torn all the way through, but it didn't retract, meaning it didn't separate.  Talk about the AC joint, the acromion is this part.  The clavicular, the clavicle is this part (indicating).  So it's an acromion clavicular AC joint arthritis.  So there is arthritis in this joint pushing down where the rotator cuff tear adding the injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,529,20,22,"Okay.  Doctor, please tell us what the other injuries are.",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
128,531,20,24,We did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

130,536,21,3,The right rotator cuff tear.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,537,21,4,Do you have an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the extent or the seriousness of those injuries which you described for us?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
132,541,21,8,It's my opinion that the injuries were serious.  They were permanent injuries and her prognosis was poor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,544,21,11,"Are these conditions painful conditions, Doctor?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
134,546,21,13,"Yes, they are.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

136,550,21,17,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,551,21,18,What did you review?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
138,552,21,19,"I reviewed prior studies that showed that she had prior disc problems in her neck and back with prior radiculopathy in her right arm.  I also reviewed an MRI.  I tried to open the MRI itself, but could not.  So I reviewed the report of an MRI of the right shoulder dated 6/4/18.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,560,22,1,"Now, Doctor, with respect to reviewing the MRI studies and the MRI reports, is that something you do in your customary practice?",q,MR. BAER,start_chat
140,564,22,5,Objection. VIDEOGRAPHER,side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
141,567,22,8,"I believe based upon the doctor's report, he did not review the actual MRI studies, only the reports.",side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
142,570,22,11,"In deed.  In fact, he just said that he --",side_chat,MR. BAER,start_chat
143,572,22,13,But in your question you said in reviewing the MRI studies and the reports.  That's the basis of my objection.  He did not review the MRI --,side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
144,576,22,17,I'll rephrase the question. VIDEOGRAPHER,side_chat,MR. BAER,start_question
145,581,22,22,"Doctor, are the review of MRI studies and MRI reports something that you do in your normal practice?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
146,584,22,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,586,23,1,"Why do you do that, Doctor?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
148,587,23,2,"Because you do the MRI because a patient has a problem.  They complain of shoulder pain, pain doesn't get better, so you do an MRI to see what's going on.  And in this case, it showed pathology.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,592,23,7,"Now, Doctor, you said you were unable to open up the disc that contained the MRI study, the actual MRI study; is that accurate?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
150,596,23,11,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,597,23,12,What did you have to review in its place?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
152,599,23,14,The report dictated by a reading radiologist.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,601,23,16,And what were the findings from that reading radiologist?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
154,603,23,18,"That it was hypertrophy of the AC joint.  That's the joint we talked about where the arthritis was.  It was a full thickness cuff tear, full thickness rotator cuff tear without retraction.  So the cuff was torn, but it wasn't separated, wasn't retracted.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,610,23,25,Was there any other findings with respect to that shoulder?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
156,613,24,2,"Of note is that there was no muscle atrophy.  When a rotator cuff tear is old, it begins to atrophy.  It does separate. It does retract and the head of the humerus rides up.  None of that was present on this exam.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,619,24,8,"Now, Doctor, what other documents did you have an opportunity to review?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
158,622,24,11,"I reviewed an MRI of the neck, MRI of the low back, and an EMG of both arms that were done prior to the motor vehicle accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,626,24,15,"And what's the significance or what were the findings there, sir?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
160,628,24,17,They showed disc pathology with radiculopathy.  That's my opinion.  These were aggravated by her 1/31/18 accident.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,631,24,20,"And, Doctor, could you please tell us what other records you reviewed.",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
162,633,24,22,"I reviewed records from a Dr. Garabo, Dr. Hassan, and Lehigh Valley Pain Center.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,636,24,25,And what was the significance in those records?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
164,639,25,2,"She saw Dr. Garabo and he also treated her for prior injuries.  He treated her for her present injuries including the shoulder injury.  She then saw a Dr. Hassan, H-A-S-S-A-N, on 7/24/18.  He saw her for right shoulder pain and he noted that there was no pain in the shoulder prior to the motor vehicle accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
165,647,25,10,Objection. VIDEOGRAPHER,side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
166,650,25,13,The objection is to the doctor's testimony that the doctor noted that there was no prior shoulder pain.  I believe what he is referring to is a statement by the plaintiff.  Just object to the testimony as misleading and mischaracterizing the record.,side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
167,657,25,20,I will just note that hearsay in the context of a medical record for the purposes of diagnosis is an exception to the hearsay objection.,side_chat,MR. BAER,start_chat
168,661,25,24,"Sure.  No disagreement there.  It's just that it was her complaint, her indication, to the doctor that she had no prior shoulder problems, not the doctor's opinion that she had no prior shoulder problems is the basis for my objection.",side_chat,MR. SMITH,start_chat
169,669,26,6,Okay. VIDEOGRAPHER,side_chat,MR. BAER,start_chat
170,672,26,9,"Dr. Hassan examined her and found a rotator cuff tear.  He said that she failed attempts in nonoperative treatment including therapy, injections, medications, and activity modifications, and therefore he recommended surgery.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

172,682,26,19,7/24/18.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

185,708,27,19,And what did she tell you?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
186,709,27,20,"Well, she complained of neck pain, right shoulder pain with occasional numbness in the right arm, injured in a motor vehicle accident on 1/31/18.  She was a driver of a car.  She was injured when she was struck on the passenger's side by another car that went through a traffic light.  The impact caused her vehicle to spin.  She was wearing her seatbelt.  The airbags deployed.  She injured her right shoulder as she was swung about by the impact.  She went to St. Luke's Hospital in Allentown and was treated and released. She complained to me of a stabbing, sharp pain in her right shoulder. She said her shoulder pain was severe.  She had pain with overhead use of her shoulder with occasional numbness down the right arm.  She had mildly, severe pain in her cervical spine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,729,28,14,"Now, Doctor, Ms. Rodriguez saw you one year and five months almost to the day from when this crash occurred; is that accurate?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer

193,742,29,1,"All right.  Doctor, did you perform any tests on Ms. Rodriguez as part of your examination?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer
194,745,29,4,"Yes.  I examined her neck and she had pain in the neck muscle upon palpating or pressing on the muscles.  She had a full neck range of motion.  The main problem was pain in the right shoulder.  She had pain about the entire right shoulder.  There was no instability.  There was no weakness.  She did have a significant decrease of motion to the right elbow. She could only abduct and flex to 45 degrees.  Abduction means bringing it up from your side, and that was 45 degrees. Usually, it's up overhead 180 degrees.  Flexion is bringing the arm forward.  That was only 45 degrees, normal is 180.  External rotation or bringing the arm rotated outwards was 80 degrees.  That's pretty much normal.  Internal rotation is rotating the arm downward.  That was only 30 degrees, normal is about 70 to 80 degrees.  She had positive impingement signs. These are signs that the rotator cuff is irritated when you put the arm through certain motions.  She had no crepitus.  The reflexes were equal.  She had a decrease in sensation to the right arm.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

210,807,31,14,"It's my opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that she sustained an aggravation of her neck pain and an aggravation of her radicular symptoms on 1/31/18.  Her right shoulder pain and right rotator cuff tear, aggravation of the right AC joint arthritis was a direct result of her 1/31/18 accident.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,815,31,22,"Doctor, with respect to this, did you also have a reasonable degree of medical certainty or an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the reasonableness and necessity of the treatment that she underwent following this car crash?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer

219,839,32,20,And what future treatment does Ms. Rodriguez require?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
220,841,32,22,"I recommended arthroscopic surgery on her right shoulder, recommended an updated MRI of her neck and EMG of the upper extremity.  Also recommended pain control injections for her neck.  That's pretty much it except that if her cervical symptoms and disc pathology persists and becomes intolerable she will require surgery on her neck.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,850,33,5,And what type of surgery is that?,q,MR. BAER,start_answer
222,852,33,7,That would be a cervical arthrodesis or a fusion of her neck with taking the disc out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,855,33,10,"Doctor, with respect to the surgery to the shoulder, are you the only doctor that has recommended that surgery?",q,MR. BAER,start_answer

Pain control injections is $6,000 per series of injections, and I've recommended two series of injections costing $12,000.  The cost for the cervical arthrodesis is $125,000.

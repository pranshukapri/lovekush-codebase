3,138,5,18,"Mr. Robinson, good morning. My name is Rich Scholer, I'm an attorney with Farmers and I represent Mr. Edward Holt in a lawsuit that you filed in reference to a motor vehicle accident that I have occurred on August 27th, 2017, and we're here for your deposition today.  Have you ever had your deposition taken before for any reason?",q,MR. SCHOLER,start_answer
4,149,6,3,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,150,6,4,"Okay.  Then I'm going to go over some guidelines to make it go as smoothly as possible.  I'm going to ask you some questions, you're hopefully going to provide some answers, at the end your Counsel may have questions for you. Seated to my left and your right is the court reporter.  Her job is to take everything that's said down accurately, so we want to try and make her job as easy as possible.  Because at the end, she's going to make a little booklet that will contain all of the questions and all of the answers, and we want that booklet to be as accurate as possible. So certain guidelines we like to follow.  I'm going to ask you a question, you may know exactly what I'm going to ask, but I'm going to ask you if you could let me finish the whole question before you start your answer. I'll give you the same courtesy, let you finish an entire answer before I start another question.  So she can look at me, take the question, look at you, take your answer. It's hard in our normal, everyday conversation.  We typically speak over each other.  If it happens, she will stop us and say, ""I can only take one person at a time.""  Not trying to be mean or nasty, just trying to get an accurate transcription. If I ask a question and you don't hear it, please say so, and I'll repeat it.  If I ask you a question and you don't understands it, please say so and I'll rephrase it.  Otherwise, if you answer it, I'll assume you heard it, you understood it, and you're giving me a truthful answer.  Because the first thing the court reporter did is give you an oath to be truthful.  Even though we're not in a courtroom setting, you still have that legal obligation to give truthful answers. If I ask a question and you have absolutely no idea, I don't want you to guess.  Although, if you can give an estimate or approximation; time, distance, anything like that, that's perfectly fine.  But if you are going to answer my question with, ""I have absolutely no idea, it's going to be a total guess,"" I'd rather you say, ""I don't know,"" or ""I don't recall,"" that's perfectly fine.  I'm only interested in finding out what you recall about the facts. All the answers have to be verbal.  If you respond with an uh-uh, uh-huh, shrug your shoulders, nod your head, everyone in the room is probably going to know what you mean, but for the purposes of the record, those things don't transcribe, they look the same.  So if you get prompted to say, ""Is that a yes,"" or ""Is that a no,"" that's for the benefit of the transcript. Hopefully we won't be here that long, but if you need a break for any reason, just let us know.  We can take a break, talk to Counsel, go to the restroom, get a drink, whatever you want. But I would ask if you could finish answering whatever question has been already been asked so the court reporter doesn't have to read it back when we come back from that break.  But otherwise, if you need a break just let us know. If you recall an answer to a question a couple questions down the way and you want to go back and say, ""Hey, I want to supplement that answer,"" no problem, just let us know.  ""Remember when you asked me that question back then?  I remembered something else."" That's perfectly fine.  Whatever you remember, whenever you remember, we can go back and supplement any answers that you have. Do you understand all of the instructions as I've given you?",q,MR. SCHOLER,start_answer

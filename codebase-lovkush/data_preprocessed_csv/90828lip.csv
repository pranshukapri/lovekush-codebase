4,81,4,6,I have.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,82,4,7,"Very good. Well, since you have, I will just go over a couple very brief ground rules that you probably already know. The first, as Madam Court Reporter has just reminded me, we must speak slowly and clearly so that she can accurately record everything that we say. Secondly, all responses must be verbal, yes, no, or whatever the answer may be. Thirdly, it's very important that we don't talk over each other so that she can accurately record everything that we say. Finally, if you don't understand any of my questions, please let me know, and I will be happy to rephrase them.  It's very important that we are on the same page at all times so that we have an accurate and clear record going forward. Okay?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer

10,116,5,16,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,117,5,17,This document schedule requested you to bring pretty much just a copy of your file regarding Ms. Johnson. I see you have some papers with you today. What did you bring with you today?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
12,126,6,1,This is basically the office file.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

14,128,6,3,"Well, there's -- there is one report from July 16, 2019.  There's actually a separate report that's not in here as well. There's the form that Ms. Johnson fills out when she comes into the office, a patient history form. There's a couple pages of my notes. There's a letter from Paula Valese. There's some -- there's some x-ray reports from GW. Some of the forms that Ms. Johnson signs when she comes in. Some of the forms that she didn't sign when she came in. And -- oh.  And then there's a letter from Mr. Covacevich, who unfortunately is not with us today.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

17,151,7,1,Thank you.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer

19,156,7,6,"Great. Now, the binder of records that you have, where did you receive those?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
20,159,7,9,"Well, it came with this letter from Mr. Covacevich.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

22,165,7,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,166,7,16,"I think that you said to me that there was another report. When you said that, what did you mean?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
24,169,7,19,"I meant just what I said.  There's a -- after I completed this report, I wrote another, sort of supplemental, additional report, which I don't think you have.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,176,8,1,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
26,177,8,2,Okay?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,178,8,3,And why did you not bring it with you today?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
28,180,8,5,"Because it just didn't get -- for some reason, it's not in the file, but I know about it, and then -- so I -- I can print it out -- I can read it to you.  In fact, I can read it off my phone to you.  It's just a couple -- maybe one paragraph or so.  But it just wasn't -- for some reason, it didn't get put in the file.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,187,8,12,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
30,188,8,13,So the file got processed and billed without it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,190,8,15,Understood.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
32,191,8,16,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,192,8,17,"That second report, when did you complete it?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
34,194,8,19,I think it has the same date on it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,195,8,20,It's also from July 16?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
36,196,8,21,"It's from July 16, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,197,8,22,And why was it -- why did you do a second report on the same day?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
38,202,9,2,"Because after I completed it, then I realized that the impairment issue was not addressed.  And I don't think it was actually -- I don't know that it was requested in the letter or addressed in the letter, so I -- I guess at some point it crossed my mind that that would be an issue that would come up, so I just -- while it was fresh in my mind, I dictated something about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
39,211,9,11,Okay.  If that report could be produced I guess to counsel and then to me --,side_chat,MS. KYLIS,start_chat
40,214,9,14,Yes.,side_chat,MR. KEARNS,start_chat
41,215,9,15,"Well, I'll be happy to. I can't physically do it here.  I can read it to you if you want.  I mean, I would just read it in if you want just so you have an idea what it says.  But if you want me to just send it to you when I get back to the office, I'm happy to do that as well.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
42,222,9,22,"I think that would be fine. I mean, maybe just as a formality we can leave the deposition open for it?",side_chat,MS. KYLIS,start_chat

49,240,10,15,"All right.  Well, while we're on the subject, can you tell me generally the substance of the -- what we're going to call the second report and --",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
50,244,10,19,Sure. Do you mind if I reference it?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,246,10,21,Sure.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
52,247,10,22,If I look at it? Okay. Do you want me to just read it to you or just tell you what it says?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,254,11,4,"If it would be easier, Doctor, to read it, that would be fine.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
54,256,11,6,"It says ""Orthopedic Surgeon's Report."" It's dated July 16, 2019.  And it references Regina Johnson. And it says (as read):  Following review of submitted medical records and the examination performed on 7-16-19, it could be said with a reasonable degree of medical probability and certainty that there is permanent impairment demonstrated.  This impairment is considered to be a result of the injuries sustained when she was shopping 2-2-16.  The impairment is represented in her current symptomatology, the physical examination and the imaging results.  This includes the myelomalacia reported by Dr. Hung. And it says ""Kenneth R. Lippman, M.D.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

56,276,12,1,You're welcome.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,277,12,2,"Doctor, while we're on this -- I'm going to just keep referring to it as the second report -- the last line of this report, you were discussing that your opinions were based on the symptomatology and included -- and you used a medical term.  I was hoping you could give me a definition of that medical term that you used in layman's terms, the diagnosis from Dr. Young.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
58,286,12,11,Hung.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,287,12,12,Hung.  Sorry.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
60,288,12,13,"H-U-N-G. Well, the term is ""myelomalacia,"" M-Y-E-L-O-M-A-L-A-C-I-A.  And basically that's a softening of the cord, the spinal cord.  It's when the cord turns to mush.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,293,12,18,And what causes that condition?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
62,294,12,19,"Well, it could be caused -- it's caused by some injury to the cord.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,296,12,21,"Okay.  Now, we'll get into the mechanism of injury here in a minute, but I just want to focus on this while we're on it. Can you explain to me the basis for your opinion that this softening of the spinal cord is causally related to the incident that occurred at Walmart on February 20, 2016.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
64,306,13,6,"Well, there's no indication in the records that she had any type of problem, difficulty or concerns that would suggest the diagnosis of myelomalacia prior to the events of February --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,311,13,11,20th?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
66,312,13,12,"It was 20th.  I just realized that this one says ""02"" instead of ""20,"" so the one I read to you has the wrong date on it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,315,13,15,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
68,316,13,16,Okay?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,317,13,17,We can forgive that.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
70,318,13,18,"Yes.  Thank you. So prior to the events of February 20, 2016, she was quite -- she was physically active and had no symptoms that would be associated -- that would lead to entertaining such a diagnosis. And then when you go through the initial medical reports, the ones that are generated basically in the days, weeks and months following the injury, you see symptoms that are highly suggestive of this type of diagnosis. The -- there's a description of the initial injury, the unsteadiness that she had, the ataxia, the radiating symptomatology.  That and other symptoms are very suggestive of this type of diagnosis that was eventually made by MRI.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,339,14,14,Right. And that diagnosis didn't come until the MRI in 2018; correct?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
72,342,14,17,"That's correct.  There was not an MRI of the neck in 2016 or 2017, and to the best of my knowledge, there was not one prior to 2016 either.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,346,14,21,"Correct.  Okay. Now, based on the description you just gave me, it sounds like your -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like your opinion is based on the fact that she did not have any symptoms of this condition prior to the incident but did after. Did you review any medical records of Ms. Johnson that predate the February 20, 2016 incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
74,359,15,9,I did not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,360,15,10,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
76,361,15,11,I don't know of any.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,362,15,12,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
78,363,15,13,Okay?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,364,15,14,"Therefore, was your -- is your assessment that she did not have those symptoms prior to the February 20, 2016 incident based solely on her history that she provided to you verbally when she came in for her visit?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
80,369,15,19,It's based on the history and the lack of records.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,371,15,21,"Did you review any records that -- of her medical history that predate the February 20, 2016 incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
82,377,16,2,No.  I don't know of any.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,378,16,3,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
84,379,16,4,"I mean, if there are some, I -- I'd be happy to look at them.  But as we sit here, I don't know of any.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,382,16,7,"Okay.  So when you say ""lack of records,"" that doesn't necessarily mean that those records don't exist, it's simply that you were not provided them to review?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
86,386,16,11,"I don't know of any that do exist or don't exist.  I just don't have any information, other than I asked her in some way if there was something like this that predated the events of 2016, and she didn't indicate that there were, and I don't know that any records have been provided or found or known of or exist.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,393,16,18,"Understood. Okay.  Thank you. Staying just for one more moment -- and I'll get into the other background questions that I want to ask you, but staying on your opinions as to this permanent impairment referenced in your second report that you've read to us from your phone, other than the information you've previously provided regarding the symptomatology, is there any other basis for that opinion that you can tell me about as we sit here today?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
88,408,17,8,I'm sorry.  Could you run the question by me again.  I'm not sure I understood the question.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,411,17,11,Yes.  That was a terrible question.  I saw Madam Court Reporter shake her head at me. I'm asking about the opinion in your -- what I'm calling the second report about permanent impairment.  You told me that that opinion is based on the symptomatology as presented to you by Ms. Johnson. Is there any other basis for that opinion that you can explain to me today?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
90,420,17,20,"Sure.  It's -- it includes the symptomatology, but it also includes the physical examination, all the examinations that were performed between February 2016 and now, in other words, what other providers found in those several years' time, and the imaging studies, as well as the nature of the injury, the history itself, and the lack of a prior history. So it's basically -- I mean, it's everything that's on the table as we sit here.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,434,18,9,"Okay. Now, in terms of permanent impairment, have you done any kind of quantitative assessment of her permanent impairment as you opine it to be?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
92,439,18,14,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,440,18,15,Okay.  So no kind of disability assessment or anything like that?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
94,442,18,17,No.  I haven't done -- if you're asking me if I put a number on it -- is that what the question is?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,445,18,20,"Yes, Doctor.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
96,446,18,21,Okay.  The answer is no.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,447,18,22,"When you said that she has a permanent impairment, what does that mean?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
98,452,19,2,It means that the situation is unlikely to change to a significant degree and will continue to be problematic for Ms. Johnson.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,456,19,6,Thank you. All right.  If I could take us back to the beginning and just ask you a few background questions.  And I do appreciate you reading us your missing report from your phone.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
100,461,19,11,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,462,19,12,"Okay.  Just very briefly, Doctor, can you give me your educational background, starting with college.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
102,465,19,15,"I went to college at Clark University, which is in Worcester, Massachusetts. After that, I went to medical school, Mount Sinai School of Medicine.  That's in the city of New York. After that, I completed a one-year surgical internship at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City and then, after that, an orthopedic residency program at State University of New York Stony Brook.  I completed that in 1985.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

112,496,20,21,I have been on probably three occasions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

123,519,21,19,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer

It seems like every day it's more and more, but it's not -- I don't think it's the majority.  It's -- most of the time it's patient care, but that in and of itself generates administrative issues, so I'm not really sure where you draw the line between the two.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

174,645,26,20,"First of all, I don't -- patient population isn't the same, like I used to always see people that needed spine surgery and I just don't see that very often anymore. I used to work very closely with a neurosurgeon.  I don't work with him anymore. He left town, basically. So just -- it's just a different kind of practice than it was a couple years ago.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

182,677,28,2,"Well, I guess you'd have to define what that is.  I mean, I guess -- I guess this is medical-legal work.  I don't see it as medical-legal work, but you see it in a different way. So I do evaluations some.  On different days it's different amounts.  Many days I don't see any at all and some days I'll see a couple of them, and so it depends.

The next one is the low -- it says low back. The next one says left arm, SH, which is shoulder, and then elbow, and then it says left buttock.  It says leg and knee, not the foot, and the head, problems all over. And then TX, which is treatment now, and then it says PT -- that's the physical therapist -- wants to take it slow. Then it says orthopedic surgeon at GW doesn't want to do surgery. And then it says see I-N-J, so I think that would be injury, and then it says -- well, actually, it's not ""see.""  It's ""sec,"" S-E-C, so that's an abbreviation for secondary injury, I-N-J, slash harm. So there was some discussion that she was referencing that the surgery might lead to further injury or harm.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

267,942,38,17,No.  She was -- she was talking about her understanding of why the orthopedic surgeon at GW did not want to do the surgery and explained to me that it was her understanding that it would lead to secondary injury or harm.

So she didn't find that changing the bed was helpful. I never had spasms/sciatic until this accident.  I want to be great again.  I am in pain every day. And then PT, and then she said, I cannot pronounce his name.  And then I have a note it's Washington, D.C. off of 19th Street. All last year.  This year, not for last three to four months. Took FMLA last year.  Doctor put me on ADA at my job.  Gave me ergonomics.  One, because of stress of job.  Two, because didn't approve of FMLA.  Three, doctor said do desk over.  Doctors say sit, stand and walk around. Then it says last time high heel shoes in 2016. Then it skips a line and it's Spinal Balance says massage may irritate.  I don't know why.  He can tell multiple pain, two-pound left side dumbbell, five to eight pounds on right. Then it goes onto the next page. He told me I can do intervals of running. Then it says ortho surg said my knee looked like not -- and there's a word I can't make out -- torn something.  He said tears, said I was too young for back surgery.  They see the inflection where it is not good. Then with regards to neck, has this type of pain before.  Then it says both knees involved.  I fell in bath -- no.  Actually, it says, I fell on something that begins with a B. And then it says when ST came on top of me. And then on the side of the page I wrote in a box knee pop. Prognosis.  Sent me into a progressive state.  My shoulder are always tense.  N/B get stiff.  Pain.  Not just weather.  After -- oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Not just weather, and then it says difficulty turn to left last week. I try my own Pilates and stretches. I've gained weight, 55 to 60 pounds estimated, as not as active.

318,1165,47,15,"Okay. But we did establish that of the records you reviewed before your visit with Ms. Johnson on July 16, 2019, none of those records predated the February 20, 2016 incident at Walmart; correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
319,1171,47,21,"I think we established that, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
320,1172,47,22,"Okay. Now, what is your understanding, Doctor, of the mechanism of Ms. Johnson's injury?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
321,1179,48,4,"The mechanism is that she was by a shelf, bent over in some way, and the stroller fell from the shelf, striking her about the back of the head, the neck and back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
322,1183,48,8,"Thank you, Doctor. Now, in your report, you do note -- I think you just used the same words -- at the time of the incident, she was bent over looking down. Now, in Ms. Johnson's deposition, she testified that she was actually squatting. Does that make a difference to you in your understanding of the mechanism of injury?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
323,1192,48,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,1193,48,18,And why not?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
325,1194,48,19,I'm not really sure what the difference is between bent over and squatting. She could have been squatting -- I think it's just a different -- it's a matter of semantics really.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,1202,49,2,"Is there a physical difference in your mind between squatting and being bent over? And for example, in my mind when I think of bending over, I think of bending at the waist, versus squatting, you're really bending at the knee I suppose.",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
327,1208,49,8,She could be bent at the knees and bent over at the waist as well or some combination of the two.  But I don't think that the mechanism is changed by whatever position she may be in. I don't really see that there's a -- that one particular position would be more problematic or less problematic than another.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,1215,49,15,"All right.  One of the issues -- one of the medical issues that Ms. Johnson has been complaining about is pain in her knees.  And she testified that during the incident she -- when she was struck by the stroller, she fell landing on her knees. Is there a difference, Doctor, in your assessment of any injury to the knee based upon whether Ms. Johnson was squatting versus bending over at the time of the incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
329,1228,50,3,No.  I think either way she could have hurt her knees.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,1230,50,5,Okay. Do you have an understanding as to the height of the shelf that the stroller was on when it fell onto her as she has alleged?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
331,1234,50,9,"Well, sort of.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,1235,50,10,What do you mean by that?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
333,1236,50,11,"There's been some reference somewhere in the records that the shelf was about six feet high, but I don't take that to be an absolute measurement.  I don't really know how high the shelf was.  It was a certain height.  There was a certain amount of change in the height of this stroller, but exactly how far it fell I couldn't say.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,1244,50,19,"Okay.  If I could ask you to assume that the shelf on which the stroller was sitting at the time of Ms. Johnson's incident was three and a half feet tall, does that change the mechanism of injury, in your view, or does it change your assessment as to the injuries that she sustained based on that mechanism of injury?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
335,1255,51,5,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,1256,51,6,Why not?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
337,1257,51,7,I don't see how it does.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,1258,51,8,"The assessment that you have made in your report regarding Ms. Johnson's injuries, was that assessment based on an understanding that the shelf was approximately six feet tall?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
339,1262,51,12,"No.  I'm just saying that there was a reference in there, but I don't take that to be an absolute certainty.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,1265,51,15,"Okay. Now, Doctor, it's your understanding that Ms. Johnson went to the emergency room a few hours after the incident; correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
341,1269,51,19,Yes.  I think there's -- I wrote about that in my report.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,1271,51,21,That's right.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
343,1272,51,22,And there are medical records that support that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
344,1277,52,2,"Yes. Now, what is your understanding of her complaints at the time that she went to the emergency room a few hours after the incident on February 20, 2016?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
345,1282,52,7,"Well, my understanding is that those are the primary complaints that are outlined in the report, not to say that she didn't say something else that they didn't transcribe or they didn't think was as significant as their primary concern, but it's what's in that report.  They talk about her head, neck and back.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
346,1290,52,15,"Now, is it fair to characterize those complaints as purely subjective?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
347,1292,52,17,"Well, I think complaints are subjective, yeah, but also I think it's -- if someone has a complaint, that's a sub- -- that is by the nature of a complaint subjective.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
348,1296,52,21,Fair enough.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
349,1297,52,22,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
350,1301,53,1,"Now, you -- you reviewed the x-rays that were taken at the emergency room on the date of the incident; correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
351,1304,53,4,"Yeah.  I've seen x-rays of her neck, her chest, her left shoulder and the lumbosacral spine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
352,1307,53,7,And all of those x-rays were from the emergency room on the date of the incident; correct?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
353,1310,53,10,"Well, they're dated -- they were taken just after midnight, so they're actually dated the next day.  They all say the 21st instead of the 20th.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
354,1314,53,14,Fair enough.  And I appreciate the clarification.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
355,1316,53,16,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
356,1317,53,17,"Now, all of those x-rays that we just talked about, they were all normal; correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
357,1319,53,19,"They're essentially within the limits of normal in the sense that there's nothing broken, there's nothing fractured on those x-rays.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
358,1326,54,1,"So based on those x-rays, is it fair to say that there was no objective finding of injury?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
359,1329,54,4,I don't think that the x-rays show objective findings of injury.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
360,1331,54,6,"Okay. Now, you have reviewed the medical records pertaining to Ms. Johnson's medical treatment after the injury; correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
361,1335,54,10,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
362,1336,54,11,And she treated with a number of different orthopedic doctors and her primary care physician; correct?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
363,1339,54,14,"Sure.  She saw -- I mean, I can read to you the name of each doctor that she saw.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
364,1341,54,16,That's not necessary.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
365,1342,54,17,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
366,1343,54,18,"Now, when she went -- her first visit with the GW Medical Faculty Associates after presenting to the emergency room on February 20 was on February 25, 2016. Have you reviewed that record?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
367,1351,55,1,"If it's in here, I did review it, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
368,1352,55,2,"Okay.  Well, I'll represent to you that the doctor's note from her February 25, 2016 visit notes that she was given a referral for physical therapy.  And in fact, most of her other doctor's visits following the incident make notations or referrals for physical therapy. However, based on the records, Ms. -- and her deposition testimony, Ms. Johnson did not actually attend any physical therapy until -- I believe it's -- until July 2018, about two and a half years after the incident. Do you recall that in your review of the records?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
369,1366,55,16,I think that's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
370,1367,55,17,"Okay.  Now, given her -- the nature of her complaints as to her injuries, do you have an opinion as to whether her failure to engage in any kind of physical therapy for two and a half years after the incident despite being recommended to do so by her physicians that she was seeing at the time has any impact on her condition following the incident and her recovery, if any?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
371,1379,56,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
372,1380,56,5,Why not?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
373,1381,56,6,I don't have an opinion about it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
374,1382,56,7,"Do you have any -- well, let me ask you. When a patient with the kind of subjective orthopedic complaints that Ms. Johnson presented with is recommended to undergo physical therapy and then doesn't, does that failure to engage in physical therapy impede their progress and recovery, generally speaking?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
375,1391,56,16,"Generally speaking, I don't know if it does or it doesn't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
376,1393,56,18,"Okay. Okay.  Another treatment or study that Ms. Johnson failed to procure in a timely manner is an MRI.  She did not have any MRIs taken until February of 2018, so two years after the incident. Do you recall that in your review of the records?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
377,1404,57,4,"I recall that the MRI was done in 2018, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
378,1406,57,6,"Okay.  Now, her doctors had been recommending that she get an MRI at least a year prior to that. Are you familiar with that?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
379,1410,57,10,"I can't tell you off the top of my head when the first time it was recommended, but I know that it was recommended before it was actually obtained.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
380,1414,57,14,Okay.  But she didn't get one until February of 2018; right?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
381,1416,57,16,"Well, I think that's right.  Yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
382,1417,57,17,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
383,1418,57,18,I don't know of any other one.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
384,1419,57,19,"And when she had that MRI in 2018, it showed multilevel degenerative disk disease; is that right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
385,1422,57,22,"It shows exactly what it says in the report.  It's the report from Dr. Hung, so everything that's written down there is what it shows.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
386,1429,58,4,"Okay.  Now, the multilevel degenerative disk disease, that is not something that is typically caused by a traumatic incident; correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
387,1433,58,8,"Well, it could be caused by a traumatic injury -- by a traumatic event or it could be affected by a traumatic event, but it's also something that most likely was present to some degree prior to the traumatic event.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
388,1438,58,13,Okay.  Does the fact that she didn't have this MRI taken for approximately two years after the incident affect its reliability in any way as to what she may or may not have had as an underlying condition as of the February incident?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
389,1444,58,19,No.  I think it's a perfectly reliable MRI.  I don't know of any technical issues or anything of that nature that would cause me to question its reliability.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
390,1451,59,1,"Okay.  Perhaps I didn't phrase that quite right. I'm not trying to question the technical aspects of the MRI, but what I want to ask you about, Doctor, is the gap that Ms. Johnson had in her treatment, the failure to do PT when it was recommended, the failure to get an MRI for two years. Does that affect your opinions in this case as to the causal relationship between the incident that occurred in Walmart in February of 2016 and the ongoing complaints that you've talked about today?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
391,1464,59,14,"Well, I'm still not sure I understand the question. It doesn't affect it.  It's information that I took into account in coming up with these opinions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
392,1469,59,19,All right.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
393,1470,59,20,"I think if you -- if you look back, as I alluded to earlier, the -- that specific issue of the softening of the cord is represented in her initial findings, which were noted by numerous different providers at GW, and it's in keeping with what was subsequently found on the MRI. Whether the MRI was done the first day or the first month or the first year, I don't know that that would have changed this scenario in any positive or negative way.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
394,1484,60,9,Is it possible that it could -- the MRI could have been different in February of 2016?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
395,1487,60,12,"Oh, I'm sure it was different in 2016.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
396,1488,60,13,What do you mean by that?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
397,1489,60,14,"Well, I don't think that this softening of the cord happened instantaneously. I think it's a slow, gradual, progressive process, so I'm sure it would have looked different. Whatever degenerative findings she had would change over time to some degree, so that would look somewhat different, too.  But I don't know how that would change the natural history of this event.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
398,1502,61,2,"Okay. One of the things that you mention in your report, Doctor, is that Ms. Johnson told you her physical therapist does not want her to have massages. Do you have an understanding as to why that is?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
399,1509,61,9,"As we sit here, I really don't.  And as -- I will -- at the time I was with Ms. Johnson, I really didn't understand it either, so I can't explain to you why that is. I would have to defer to whoever said that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
400,1514,61,14,Okay. You also note in your report -- and you mentioned it was in your handwritten notes as well -- that Ms. -- one of Ms. Johnson's goals is to be great again. Do you have an understanding as to what that means?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
401,1521,61,21,"Well, my recollection was she was telling me that she was -- before this happened she was great and she just doesn't feel that way anymore.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
402,1528,62,3,"All right. Did -- in that vein, did Ms. Johnson discuss with you any other sources of stress that she was undergoing, for example, at her workplace, during the time period from February of 2016 until you saw her in July?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
403,1534,62,9,"I don't re- -- I don't recall any specific discussion about stress at the workplace.  There are some references in the file, so I have some familiarity with it, but I don't know that we specifically discussed it. We may have, but I just don't recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
404,1540,62,15,Okay.  You do mention in your report that she has stress in her job.  Okay?  And she testified in her deposition that one of the stresses in her job was due to some harassment that she had been experiencing. Is it fair to say that that is a collateral source of the stress that you note she's experiencing at her job that I believe you relate to her pain issues attributable to the Walmart incident?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
405,1553,63,3,I think it could be another source of stress.  Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
406,1555,63,5,"Okay. Okay, Doctor.  I want to ask you just a couple things about your report where you discuss the diagnostic imaging you reviewed. This is page 4 and near the bottom. You looked at the x-rays of the cervical spine. Do you see that in the second to last paragraph?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
407,1564,63,14,I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
408,1565,63,15,"Okay. Now, you write here that there were degenerative and productive changes. Now, I'm familiar with degenerative changes, but what does ""productive changes"" mean?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
409,1571,63,21,"Well -- so I think the simple way to understand that is that it's basically a bone spur.  When you see the bone production, that's a spur.  It's building up in that area. So that's what I'm referring to when I'm talking about productive changes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
410,1580,64,5,Okay.  So you did note productive changes in the cervical spine.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
411,1582,64,7,In the lower segments with reasonable preservation in the upper segments.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
412,1584,64,9,"What does that mean, ""reasonable preservation in the upper segments""?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
413,1586,64,11,"So C1, C2, C3, C4, they look pretty normal.  5, 6, 7, they look arthritic.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
414,1588,64,13,"Okay.  Now, you just said that they look arthritic. Do you attribute those productive changes -- or do you have an opinion as to whether those productive changes are attributable to the injury that Ms. Johnson is claiming from the Walmart incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
415,1595,64,20,"I don't think they are exclusively attributable to the injuries. So interestingly enough, when you -- when you read the initial x-ray report, the one that was obtained in the emergency room, they don't actually report productive or degenerative changes.  But when you look at the -- when you look at the images, you can see that there were some productive or degenerative changes, so this -- this was certainly an average or reasonable neck back in 2016, February 2016, when injured. So how much of the change is due to the natural aging process and how much of that change is due to the trauma itself, there's no way to differentiate those two.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
416,1614,65,14,Okay.  You wouldn't be able to give any kind of percentage?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
417,1616,65,16,No.  I don't know that there's any way to give any kind of percentage.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
418,1618,65,18,Okay.  But it's fair to say that the findings that you observed on the x-ray reports are due both to just the natural aging process as well as the injury she's claiming?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
419,1622,65,22,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
420,1626,66,1,"Okay. Now, it looks like you -- in the last paragraph of your report on page 4, you looked at x-rays of the left knee as well, and those are x-rays that you obtained as of that July 2019 visit; correct?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
421,1632,66,7,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
422,1633,66,8,Okay.  And that x-ray was normal; right?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
423,1635,66,10,"From an x-ray standpoint, I would say that's normal.  Sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
424,1637,66,12,No objective findings of any injury in the left knee based on that x-ray that you took?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
425,1640,66,15,"No, not based on that x-ray.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
426,1641,66,16,"Okay. Now, it appears that you only ordered x-rays of the left knee, not the right knee.  Is that right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
427,1645,66,20,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
428,1646,66,21,Was there a reason why?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
429,1647,66,22,I'm sure there was.,a,THE WITNESS,is brackets
430,1651,67,1,"(Document review.) But as we sit here, I'm not sure what that -- what the reason was.  Just perhaps because I thought those findings were more marked in the left knee than the right.",brackets,,start_question
431,1656,67,6,Which findings are you referring to?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
432,1657,67,7,The physical exam findings.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
433,1658,67,8,Okay.,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
434,1659,67,9,But that's just -- I don't have a note which addresses your question specifically.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
435,1661,67,11,"Okay.  If I could take you to page 5, that first paragraph, it looks to me like you ordered an x-ray of the left shoulder and reviewed that.  Am I right?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
436,1665,67,15,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
437,1666,67,16,And it appears that you noted some mild early productive changes at the AC joint. What does that mean?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
438,1669,67,19,"Well, it means the same type of productive changes that you see in the neck. There's narrowing of the joint space with increased bone formation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
439,1676,68,1,And what -- do you have an opinion as to the cause of those productive changes?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
440,1678,68,3,It's the combination of everything that's happened to that shoulder since the beginning of her time.  It includes the injury to the shoulder and also whatever else has happened to that shoulder over the years.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
441,1683,68,8,"When you mentioned the injury to the shoulder, I assume you're referring to the incident at Walmart. What's your understanding as to how the shoulder -- and let me clarify the -- Ms. Johnson's left shoulder was injured during the Walmart incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
442,1690,68,15,"Well, it was injured as -- when the stroller fell on her, in whatever position she was, at whatever height it fell from.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
443,1693,68,18,"So what -- perhaps I'm trying to dumb this down a little too much, but what happened to the shoulder that caused injury, based on your understanding?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
444,1697,68,22,"Well, I don't know that we fully defined what happened to the shoulder, other than it remains problematic and symptomatic. It's become very stiff as a result of the injury. It was originally caused -- I'm sorry. It was originally called a sprain.  I don't think that really fully defines the injury, but that's all the information we have to work with.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
445,1710,69,10,"Okay. Have you seen Ms. Johnson since July 16, 2019?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
446,1713,69,13,"No, I haven't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
447,1714,69,14,"Had you seen her prior to July 16, 2019?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
448,1716,69,16,"No, I had not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
449,1717,69,17,"Okay. Now, Doctor, I'll take you to that last paragraph of your report if I may. The first line is that it appears to be your opinion that treatment to date appears appropriate, reasonable, and causal connection is demonstrated to the injuries sustained 20 -- I'm sorry -- February 20, 2016 and their sequelae. Which treatment are you referring to in your report in that paragraph?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
450,1731,70,6,"Well, basically I'm referring to all the treatment that's in this binder, the treatment provided by GW and Spinal Balance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
451,1734,70,9,And Spinal Balance -- we didn't get into that -- that is the PT provider that she ultimately saw beginning in 2018; right?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
452,1737,70,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
453,1738,70,13,Okay.  And is it your understanding that she was prematurely discharged from Spinal Balance due to noncompliance with the physical therapy program?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
454,1742,70,17,No.  I don't recall the reason for discharge.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
455,1744,70,19,"Okay.  If I -- well, allow me to represent to you that her records reflect that she was discharged for noncompliance with the physical therapy program. Does that affect your opinion at all as to your opinions that that treatment was reasonable and necessary in this case?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
456,1754,71,4,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
457,1755,71,5,Why not?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
458,1756,71,6,I thought it was reasonable and she underwent treatment for a period of time. That's fine.  I don't know how the discharge would affect what happened before the discharge.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
459,1761,71,11,"Okay. When you say in your report that the causal connection is demonstrated to the injuries sustained on February 20, 2016 and their sequelae, what sequelae are you referring to there?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
460,1767,71,17,"Well, everything that she has experienced as a result of these injuries, the stiffness, the pain, the softening of the cord, the limitations of function, the need for activity modifications, the limitations of her activities, all that are the sequelae of this injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
461,1777,72,2,"Now, does the fact that Ms. Johnson was noncompliant with her physical therapy treatments and with the recommendations of many of her doctors during her treatment -- does that affect whether the sequelae are causally related to the incident?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
462,1783,72,8,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
463,1784,72,9,Why not?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
464,1785,72,10,Because the sequelae are a result of the incident independent of any treatment that's provided subsequent to that event.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
465,1788,72,13,"Okay. Now, is it possible, Doctor, that Ms. Johnson could have gotten better if she had been compliant with her doctors' referrals for physical therapy and the physical therapy that she did finally begin to undergo?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_chat
466,1794,72,19,"Well, I'll object to the question, but go ahead and answer it if you can.",side_chat,MR. KEARNS,start_chat
467,1797,72,22,"Anything is possible, but I deal with probabilities.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
468,1803,73,3,Do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability that Ms. Johnson would have gotten better if she had been compliant with the recommendations of her treating physicians?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
469,1808,73,8,I don't -- I don't know of any treatment that could have been provided that would have significantly altered this outcome.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
470,1811,73,11,"Okay.  Now, by ""this outcome"" -- I think I'll segue into your next line in your report, which is that long-term prognosis is considered guarded. Is that what you mean by ""outcome,"" that Ms. Johnson has this permanent impairment that we've previously talked about today?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
471,1818,73,18,"Yes.  I think that it's reasonable to state that what she experiences as of July 16, 2019 is pretty much the way it's going to be for her.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
472,1822,73,22,Okay.  You next state that ongoing needs for treatment are anticipated. What treatment is anticipated?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
473,1828,74,3,"Well, I can't say with any certainty what treatment it would be, but I would not be surprised if there is treatment in the future. But exactly what it comes out to be or predicting what it's going to be, I'm not in a position to do that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
474,1834,74,9,"Okay.  So if I could ask it in a better way, do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability that Ms. Johnson will require future treatment related to these injuries?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
475,1839,74,14,"No.  It's a possibility, but I can't say with any degree of certainty that she will require treatment or what that treatment would be.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
476,1843,74,18,"Okay. If you are called to testify at trial in this case, do you intend to offer any opinions as to whether Ms. Johnson had to miss any time from work?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
477,1851,75,1,"If the question comes up, I would address it.  I mean, it has been addressed in the records, and I think it was addressed appropriately in the records. So she did miss time from work, and subsequently there were workplace modifications, and all that seems reasonable and appropriate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
478,1859,75,9,"Okay. Okay, Doctor.  If I could end with this last, very broad question. We've discussed many opinions that you have today about Ms. Johnson's care. Do you have any other opinions that you would offer at trial as to Ms. Johnson's medical treatment?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
479,1867,75,17,"Not that come to mind as we sit here, but certainly if you ask more questions, something else may come to mind.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

489,1890,76,15,"Very quickly, either in your handwritten notes or maybe in the second report that will be produced, you mentioned the possibility of Ms. Johnson having surgery.  She had talked to one of her doctors about a surgery?",q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
490,1896,76,21,Yep.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
491,1897,76,22,What kind of surgery was she talking about?,q,MS. KYLIS,start_answer
